charles todd watchers of time chapter september osterley dr stephenson turned away from the bed where the dying man lay breathing so lightly the blanket over his thin chest barely stirred his bony restless fingers plucking at the edge of the wool were the only signs of life and awareness twice the young woman sitting on the bed beside him had tried to still them covering them with her own but her fathers hand picked up the silent tattoo again like a drummer remembering his place as soon as she released it he had already frayed an inch of the binding she gave up and sat back sighing his face was grooved by illness and a stubble of beard emphasized the lines like a rough landscape of suffering below the sunweathered skin of forehead and nose shaggy gray eyebrows hung heavily over the sunken lids age weighed him down but there was a certain strength there as well as if life had made him fight for all he had and he had not forgotten the battles catching the eyes of the mans sons who were standing on the far side of the bed faces in shadows cast by the scarf draped over the lamps shade the doctor nodded toward the window across the room out of earshot of the patient the young woman looked up as they moved away but stayed where she was she didnt want to hear what was being whispered another gust of wind swept the front of the house and rain was driven heavily against the panes rattling them the storm had stalled as they sometimes did here along the coast reluctant to move inland and lose itself in the hilly terrain there for three hours or more it had hovered over the village flailing everyone and everything out in the open the older of the two brothers bent his head to catch the words as stephenson said softly hes moving comfortably and peacefully toward the end theres nothing more i can do but he might wish to have mr sims here and i should think your sister would be comforted as well mr sims was the vicar the younger brother answered yes ill go for him then he went quietly across the room to the door the scarf that shaded the lamp by the bed riffled as he passed and the light flashed once across his face there were wet trails of tears on his cheeks his sister reached out and briefly took his rough hand the other brother sighed hes had a long life pa has but not that long sixtyfour wed thought hed be with us another five ten years his own father lived to just past eighty and uncle tads young for seventysix he shook his head your uncle thadeus has the constitution of an ox stephenson agreed he may well outlive your grandfathers years but your fathers heart has given out and his body must follow he studied the grieving mans face noting the deep lines of worry and sleeplessness hetty baldwin his housekeepers daughter was getting a good man in martin baker the doctor told himself much like herbert in charactergodfearing with strong ties to his family and a fierce sense of duty it was a sound match everything happens in gods own time you know even this and its a kindness that he wont linger he spoke the words as comfort then nodded toward the bed see if you can persuade elly to rest a little shes hardly stirred from his side since yesterday morning well call her if theres anyurgency she will only wear herself into collapse driving herself like this ive tried to no avail martin turned toward the window lifting the curtain and pulling aside the shade a little to look out rain ran down the glass in rivulets pushed against the house by the wind a filthy night he thought a fitting night for death to come he dropped the shade back in place and said to dr stephenson theres naught to be done to make it easier on her ill leave something a sleeping draught give it to elly in a glass of water when your father is gone and martinsee that dick doesnt insist on being one of the pallbearers that shoulder of his is not fully healed and the socket will never be as strong as it was hes not out of the woods yet he could still lose the arm if hes not careful the army surgeons cant work miracles without a little help ill remember good man a clap on martins shoulder for comfort and then stephenson walked back to the bed he reached down and touched ellys hands folded tightly in her lap they were cold shaking your father is comfortable he would want you to be the same let martin fetch you a shawl at least she nodded unable to reply the gray head on the pillow moved first to the right then toward the left herbert bakers eyes opened and focused on his daughters face he said in a gravelly voice i want a priest the doctor leaned down and replied reassuringly yes dick has just gone to fetch mr sims i want a priest the old man repeated querulously hes coming papa elly said fighting her tears can you hear me hell be here quite soon priest her father demanded not vicar herbert the doctor said soothingly let me lift you while elly gives you a little water the dark pleading eyes shifted to the doctors face i want a priest the dying man said very clearly this time refusing to be distracted the bedroom door opened and dick was ushering in the vicar i met him on his way here he told them coming to see if we had need of him mr sims was taller than dick thinner and not much older ive been sitting with mrs quarles and thought it best to call on you before going home the vicar explained herbert baker had taken all day to die most of the town knew the end was near a matter of hours at best sims had stopped in twice before sims reached out to touch ellys arm saying easily ellen do you think you could find a cup of tea for us we could use the warmth on such a wet night she flushed shyly tea ohyes ive just to put the kettle on smoothing the blanket over her father she got up leaving the room with reluctance sims took the place on the bed that shed vacated and squarely met the intent eyes of the old man youve had a good life herbert baker you were married to a fine womana caring wife and a devoted mother both your sons survived the war and have work elly is a lovely girl god has been kind to you thankee vicar and ill have you say a prayer for me after the priest goes the vicar looked up at martin then said dr stephenson hes been asking for a priest just now before you came in i dont know why dick said father james is the only priest in osterley hes a catholic thats righthes the one herbert baker said with more will than strength something in the depths of his eyes flared with hope martin said if thats what he wants humor him then dick go and see if father james will come here his brother hesitated glancing uneasily at the vicar as if hed just been asked to commit heresy but mr sims nodded encouragement and dick went out the door martin said youll stay to sims from the bed came the single word stay the lined face was exhausted as if speaking was a greater effort than he could manage sims replied ill go to the kitchen then from the look of her ellen is more in need of that tea than i am rising from the bed he added gently ill be within call herbert never fear his smile was reassuring herbert nodded his eyes closed the wind had dropped again and on the roof overhead the rain seemed to fall softly now with a summer patter dr stephenson said quietly to sims hes sound enough in his mind but dying men often have whims like this best to humor him yes i knew a wounded man in the war who wanted to be buried with his little dog only he didnt have a dog but when they came to bury him his arms were folded across his chest as if hed held one as he died strange comfort but who are we to question the vicar went out the door shutting it quietly behind him there were voices on the stairs sims speaking to ellen and then they went down again together the room was silent martin watched his father for a time and then said anxiously to stephenson itll be an easy passing as easy as any his heart will stop and his breathing will follow he will be asleep long before that i didnt expect him to wake at all i thought hed reached the last stage herbert roused by their voices said is the priest here then not yet papa martin answered lowering himself to sit on the bed dicks gone to fetch him he gripped his fathers hands unable to say anything a plain man with few graces but the warmth of his fingers seemed to give a measure of peace to his dying father martin cleared his throat hoarsely warmed in his turn the silence lengthened after nearly a quarter of an hour dick came in bringing a short and balding man of middle age in his wake father james greeted stephenson with a nod and came to shake martins outstretched hand his fingers were cold from the night air i understand your father has been asking for a priest he said his face showing only concern i dont know why father nor does it matter ill speak to him then shall i it was a question asked gracefully setting martin at his ease the priest turned quietly to bend over the bed after a moment he said mr baker herbert its father james what can i do to help you baker opened his eyes seemed to have difficulty focusing them then blinked as he looked up at the white clerical collar clearly visible against the black cloth father james is it yes as a thin trembling hand came out from under the blanket father james reached for it and the claw seemed to lock onto his send them away herbert baker said just you and me father james glanced across at the anxious faces of bakers two sons and then at dr stephenson the three men nodded briefly walked to the door and went out their shoes loud on the wide boards of the passage then moving together down the stairs father james waiting until they were well out of earshot looked around to collect some impression of this man lying in the bed waiting for death to come he knew who the bakers were but had seldom exchanged more than a word or two with any of them it was a big room set under the eaves with simple but sturdy furnishings and a worn carpet on the floor someone had painted watercolors of the sea and framed them for hanging an amateurs hand the sunrises and ships vigorous but showing an untrained eye the family had taken pride in them to frame them the single window faced the street the shade pulled against the night and the curtains drawn across it so many houses in the town had this same air of workingclass austerity father james found himself thinking osterleys years of prosperity lay in the pastwell before herbert bakers time no one starved but people here worked hard for their bread as the priest turned back to the bed he saw the womans photograph on the table beside it the soft whisper of the rain faded then revived as a squall the wind sending a gust of drafts into the house and making the lamp dance to its fitful tune bakers wife she had died before the war as he recalled and this must have been taken some ten years before that the daughterellenlooked much like her the same dark hair and sweet face staring at the camera with trusting and expectant eyes he sat down carefully on the beds edge where ellen and the vicar had sat before him and said in the voice that was his greatest gift as a priest deep and steadfast im here we are alone in the sight of god in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit tell me how i may serve you nearly half an hour later father james walked down the stairs of the baker house and found the family the doctor and the vicar waiting for him in the small very victorian parlor tea had been brought and poured but the cups were still more than half full sitting forgotten wind rattled the shutters a theatrical announcement of his appearance like a drumroll every face had turned toward the priest all eyes pinning him in the doorway concern mixed with weariness and not a little curiosity in their expressions father james cleared his throat and said into the expectant silence your father is resting quietly now he has asked me to reassure you that he wishes to be buried in accordance with his own beliefs with mr sims officiating i have served him by giving him a little comfort if he should require me again youve only to let me know and now if youll forgive me i must go it is late he was offered refreshment he was offered the gratitude of the grieving family prevailed upon by mr sims he sat and drank a cup of lukewarm tea out of kindness dr stephenson watching him was struck by the tension around his eyes putting it down to the awkwardness of being in an unfamiliar household among strangers not of his faith the two of them doctor and priest had shared many long watches together over the years and stephenson had always found him a strong and dependable ally in the business of offering peace to the dying and solace to the survivors even so the face of death was never commonplace one learned to accept that was all father james behaved with sympathetic courtesy toward herbert bakers children that deep voice bringing a measure of comfort to ellen as it had to her father dick and martin both slackfaced with exhaustion appeared to find a renewal of strength in his assurance that herbert baker had made his peace with his god and had not changed his faith simple men they couldnt fathom their fathers odd behavior and were half embarrassed by it father james understanding that said only your father was not frivolous at the end we are all in need of gods grace like a child before his father im some years older than the vicar perhaps to a man of herbert bakers age it mattered he smiled across the tea table at sims the vicar looked up tansy the liverandwhite spaniel sitting by his chair patiently waited for simss fingers to resume scratching behind the curly ears he said almost diffidently in the war it was the same they were so young most of them but old in experience that i couldnt match i sent more than a few of them along to the methodist chaplain who was closer to their fathers age than i was that seemed to be the best thing to do for them then he turned the conversation adding to father james you must be thanking god that this weather held until after your autumn fete at st annes it was a blessing ellen said martin went with hetty to the bazaar he brought me a brush for tansy and a new lead a smile lit her pale face and then faltered papa was well enough to go last year so he was the vicar answered returning her smile he has been a rock of strength each spring at holy trinity too i always took pleasure in working with him as soon as it was decently possible father james rose and took his leave martin baker escorted him to the door and thanked him again the priest stepped out into the night the rain had dropped off once more and there was only the wind to keep him company on his long walk home dr stephenson climbing the stairs once more found that the priest was right herbert baker seemed to be resting quietly slowly losing his grip on life in the small hours of the night the man died peacefully his family gathered about him his daughter ellen sobbed quietly and his two sons watched in anguish as he drew several short uncertain breaths then stopped breathing altogether only a thin sigh passing his lips the vicar by his side prayed for herbert bakers soul as the sigh faded the funeral was well attended and herbert baker coachman by trade was sent to his eternal rest with the goodwill of a village that had known him to be an honest and plainspoken man with no vices and no outstanding talents except perhaps for loyalty a week after the funeral dr stephenson returned to his surgery late one afternoon to find father james just walking out the door well met stephenson exclaimed with pleasure come in let me pour myself a drink and i shall be at your service first babies are not to be hurried this one kept his mother and me awake all of the night and well into the afternoon and ive missed my breakfast my lunch and my usual hours he led the way back through the doorway down the passage and into his private office the room smelled of wax and disinfectant a blend that father james found to be a sneezemaker he dragged out his handkerchief sneezed heartily three times and grinned crookedly at stephenson you should hear me when theyve waxed the pews and the confessional at st annes the blessing is im not bothered by incense the office was small painted a pleasing shade of blue and offered three chairs for visitors as well as the more comfortable old leather one behind the doctors broad wooden desk dr stephenson settled into that and father james took his accustomed place in the ancient wingback as stephenson lifted the bottle of sherry and offered it to him the priest said no thank you ive another call to make and shes temperancemad ill lose my reputation if i reek of good sherry stephenson grinned how does she manage communion wine then its consecrated and the evil of the grape has been taken out the doctor chuckled then poured his own glass yes well the mind is a wonderful thing wonderful its about the mind ive come father james said slowly oh yes stephenson sipped his sherry with relish letting it warm him id like to ask you if herbert baker was in full control of his faculties when he called me to him on his deathbed baker yes well that was an odd business i daresay but he was dying of congestive heart failure and his mind was as far as i could tell clear to the end of consciousness any reason why you feel it might not have been his voice lifted on a query stephenson was a man who liked his own life and that of his patients as tidy as possible no the priest replied on the other hand im seldom asked to secondguess mr simss parishioners or he mine for that matter it was curious and i found myself wondering about it afterward baker most certainly appeared in full control though understandably weak still you never know which reminds me stephenson said turning the subject to something on his own mind theres one of your flock i do want to talk about mrs witherspoon shes been refusing to take her pills again and imerhanged if i can understand it the priest smiled theres a challenge for you at a guess id say that when she feels a little stronger shes convinced she doesnt need them then she feels unwell again and quickly takes two to make up for it a goodhearted woman but not overly blessed with common sense if i were you id have a talk with her husband she pays more heed to what he says than to anyone else the sun shines out of mr witherspoon in her view the ironmonger was the most lugubrious man in osterley stephenson laughed the eye of the beholder well theres a thought that woman will make herself seriously ill if she doesnt heed someone he looked at his wine golden in the little glass i had a patient once who swore that sherry was spanish sunlight caught in a bottle never been to spain myself im hardpressed to escape for a few hours in yarmouth but theres most certainly medicinal magic in it he finished the wine then said how are those triplets of yours father james beamed the triplets were his younger sisters children and lived some distance away thriving sarah is coping with the help of two nuns i found for her and every member of the family we can dragoon into service ive done my own turn walking the floor at night i expect those boys will be holy terrors by the time theyre eight their father was something of a devil himself at twelve stephenson said arent we all but responsibility comes soon enough the priests face changed subtly it does ill be on my way then get some rest you look as if you could use it watching him out the door stephenson had the curious feeling that father james should take his own advice nearly two weeks had passed since the funeral stephenson rested and busy had long since put herbert baker out of his mind when he took his wife to visit friends it was a dinner party like a dozen others the doctor attended with some enthusiasm whenever he could there were eight couples and hed known all of them for years comfortable with each other sharing a common history they had found in one another a companionship that had few boundaries stephenson could count most of them as his patients and his wife had sat on committees of one sort or another with every one of the womenchurch bazaars flower arrangements food baskets for the poor spring fetes charity cases visiting the sick welcoming newcomers to osterley and generally forming an ad hoc social group that was as small as it was select he couldnt have said afterward how the subject arose someone asked a question another guest expanded on it and a wife raised a laugh by adding her own views stephenson found himself picking up the thread and the next thing he knew he was telling the story of a dying patient who had wanted to hedge his bets in the next life by seeing both the vicar and the priest one of the guests leaned forward was that old baker my wife remarked to me that shed seen father james walking out of bakers front door one night in a pouring rain saying goodbye to young martin on the step i told her she must have been mistakenbaker was sexton for seventeen years at holy trinity richard cullen said had the right idea though didnt he who was it that said paris was worth a mass that dissolved into a debate over whether it was henri iv and progressed to a recital of the opening lines of the vicar of bray herbert baker had been forgotten once more it was late in the evening on the second of october when father james returned to the victorian gothic house that served as st annes rectory he let himself in through the unlocked kitchen door grateful for the lamp still burning on the small table by the window and sniffed appreciatively at the lingering aroma of bacon he crossed the room to peer into the oven his dinner was sitting on the rack in a covered dish lifting the lid he saw that the contents were a little dry but certainly still delicious there were onions as well and what appeared to be a scotch egg the housekeeper mrs wainer hadas always remembered that the body needed nurturing as well as the soul he could feel the saliva flow in his mouth onions were his greatest love father james set the lid in place and closed the oven door tired from a long vigil by a very ill parishioner he stretched his shoulders as he straightened his back the chair by the bed had been too low and his muscles had knotted but the man had lived thank god his family needed him he went down the passage that led past the parlor and the small music room that he had converted into a parish office in the darkness he moved with the ease of long familiarity as he reached the hall by the front door he could hear the clock in the parlor cock itself to strike the hour the whirr of the gears a soft sound that stopped him one hand on the newel post at the foot of the stairs the clear golden chimes always reminded him of the house where he had grown upthe clock had come from thereand the laughter of his mother and father sharing the reading of a book as the children sprawled at their feet it had been a nightly ritual just before bedtime and it was something he himself celibate and alone missed mark had died in the war killed on the somme and judith had died of the influenza taking her unborn child with her but sarah had brought her triplets alive into the world and he looked forward to the day when their rowdy spirits and lively voices would brighten the silence of the old rectory sarah had already promised them for a week each year though they were not yet three months old he smiled to himself at the thought mrs wainer bless her would probably quit in dismay as the chimes echoed into silence he went on up the stairs to his study on the first floor the lamp on the desk wasnt lit but one in his bedroom was burning a low flame that guided his movements he went through the bedroom door to put his case and coat away and then wash his hands before dinner coming back into the dark study he failed to see the shadow that stood immobile in the deeper shadows beside his private altar the gold chain on the priests chest gleamed in the moonlight pouring through the windows noticing that the draperies hadnt been drawn father james crossed the room to pull them to reaching high over his head to move the heavy velvet across the wooden rod the first pair were only half shut when the shadow stepped out directly behind the priest in the figures hand was the heavy crucifix that had always stood on the altar between a slender pair of candlesticks it was lifted high and the base of the cross brought down with stunning force straight into the bald head that seemed in this light to be tonsured and unnaturally white a target that was so clear it seemed to draw a sigh from the priest he began to crumple like old clothes falling to the floor the crucifix was lifted again the base flashing in the pale light as it descended a second time as the priest hit the carpet with an ugly thump the bloody scalp was struck a third time then with efficient grace the shadow stepped back dropped the crucifix from a gloved hand and set about silently swiftly wrecking the room the police summoned the next morning by a distraught mrs wainer took note of the food left untouched in the oven the black blood pooled beneath the priests head there by the window and the state of the room the paperstrewn floor and the scattered contents of the desk drawers they examined the tin box that lay upside down and pried open with scissors emptied of parish funds and came to the conclusion that father james returning home unexpectedly had been attacked by someone hed disturbed in the midst of a burglary not a target a victim hed heard a noise in the house they concluded discovered there was an intruder upstairs and gone to the window intending to see if there was anyone at home next door the neighbor had three nearly grown sonsit would have taken only a few seconds to unlatch the window and call to them to come and search the house with the priest the alarmed thief very likely concealed in the bedroom just behind the study must have seen father james at the window and hastily reached for the first weapon that came to handthe crucifixstriking the priest down from behind to stop him from calling for help in his terror hed hit the priest again and then fled the money from the box in his pocket muddy shoe prints near the lilac bush showed a worn heel a tear in the sole near the toe a poor man then and desperate as luck would have it the house next door usually noisy with three generations of family had stood empty the previous night taking even the elderly grandmother with them theyd traveled to west sherham to meet the girl one of their sons wished to marry but the thief couldnt have known that if the family had been at home theyd have arrived in force very likely in time to glimpse the fleeing man it would have been satisfying to have a description of the killer the townspeople of osterley whether members of st annes holy trinity or no church at all were shocked and horrified they gathered in little clusters silent for the most part or carrying on conversations that ended in head shakes and stunned disbelief a few women wept into their handkerchiefs redeyed with grief and misgivings children were shushed told to go to their rooms questions unanswered it was a wicked thing to kill a clergyman no one could recall even having heard of such a crime happening before in norfolkcertainly not in living memory osterley would be the talk of east anglia mr sims trying to minister to his flock as well as the murdered priests until the bishop could send someone else down from norwich heard the same litany again and again he was such a good caring man hed have helped whoever it was given them the money done his best for them there was no need to kill him a growing aura of suspicion spread through the town as people tried to secondguess the police then it slowly began to occur to inhabitants one after another that the killer couldnt be a local man not someone they knew it simply wasnt possible still eyes turned suspiciously glanced over shoulders followed this man or that down the street with furtive conjecturean unease spreading like a silent illness through the town mr sims found himself thinking that there was a reason for killing father james if hed seen the face of the man invading his home and threatening him with the crucifix from his own altar recognition was knowledgeand there were some who might be afraid that even the compassion of a priest had its limits fear was seldom ruled by reason it reacted to danger first and logic afterward the first blow must surely have been fearthe succeeding blows could have been fear or could have been cunning the need to silence how was anyone to know until the priests killer had been found sims tried not to look into the faces of the people of osterley and speculate but he couldnt stop himself from doing it human nature was human nature he was no different from the rest of his neighbors the war had taught sims that frightened men did whatever they had to do to stay alive and in the trenches killing had become a natural reaction to peril he wondered if the priests attacker was an unemployed former soldier one so desperate that hed felt no compunction about taking life one man in osterley came close to meeting those criteria sims refused to entertain the likelihood that he would ever kill again the vicar scolded himself for such unchristian speculation surely not even a warhardened veteran would kill a priest all the same how far would the few pounds stolen from the rectory go how long before empty pockets drove the killerwhoever he wasto strike again that nightfor the first time since hed come to osterley nine years beforemr sims locked his doors the vicarage stood behind a high wall in an expanse of wooded lawn old trees that had always been his pride and given him a sense of continuity with those who had served holy trinity before him now the house seemed isolated and secretive hidden away and intolerably vulnerable he told himself it was merely a precaution to lock his doors in bitter fact he was coming to terms with the unexpected discovery that the cloth which had always seemed his armor and his shield was neither and that a man of god was no safer than any other householder chapter october london rutledge cut himself shaving and swore his sister frances sitting in the chintzcovered chair by the window winced but said nothing when he did it again she couldnt stop herself darling must you carve up your face on your own or could i do it for you surely im a better butcher than you are the words were light intentionally he shook his head if im to return to work i must learn to manage he was on medical leave from the yard and it was dragging on day into endless day chafing his spirit she regarded the heavy bandages that swathed his chest still binding one arm close to his body im surprised the yard will allow you back until that comes off surely there are regulations you can barely button your own shirt and ive done up your shoes for you all these weeks a halfdressed policeman is hardly a proper representative of the majesty of the law frances shut up yes i know it isnt a pleasant reminder is it im sorry but i do think you may be acting prematurely he put down his razor splashed water on his face and groped for a towel the razor went sailing across the room this time he swore silently hamish reflecting his anger said aye it isna a brave thing you do merely foolhardy rutledge said i am going mad cooped up in these rooms the words served to answer both of them frances said deliberately misunderstanding him yes you must be i did ask you to stay longer at the house its still warm enough to sit in the gardens in the afternoon or walk across the street into the square you can come back again if you like she had brought him there from hospital and found a nurse to care for him until he could fend for himself then taken over the chore of getting him dressed and undressed each day while he impatiently healed wounded tigers she had thought more than once would have been less of a handful but in the beginning when shed been summoned north she had been terrified that hed die before she got there shed only just got used to him being home and safe with wars end after four bitter years of killing her brother had come back to her alive and so she had let her guard down at last policemen werent supposed to be shot in the line of duty the shock had left her breathless still shed done her best not to fuss over him rutledge who understood the unspoken concern that lay behind his sisters efforts to keep him under her eye had found it impossible to explain to her that he preferred his own flat where he could swear at the pain or pace the floor at night or simply sit with his eyes closed until the worst had passed instead hed merely said that he needed to learn to do for himself again now he gingerly stooped and picked up the razor then turned to grin at her frances you are the most capable woman ive ever met when it comes to dealing with a crisis you have no peer all the same its easier sometimes not to have witnesses she smiled yes father was just the same i cant remember a time when he was ill that he didnt want to find himself a burrow somewhere and crawl off until he was better it drove mama to despair the smile faded but returning to work ianis it wise rutledge studied her she knew a little what hed been through in the war not all of it she knew that he had been shellshocked but not that he had brought back from the western front the living voice of a dead man corporal hamish macleod nor did she know what it was like to order a man shot or to send weary and battleworn men into certain death to walk on the maggotridden bodies of corpses or watch a friend die hideously screaming nothing deadened such memories they stayed bottled up raw brutal barbarous the stuff of nightmares that the mind scrambles to bury deeper and deeper just to survive until there was no way to exorcise the demons that had seized possession of part of him there were stories he could tell when friends or colleagues asked how was it over there and these were tailored to each listener for some humorous accounts of the incessant rain and sucking mud the lack of water for bathing how necessary it was to shave so that the gas masks fit properly to others he spoke of acts of bravery hed witnessed or the kindness of the nursing sisters to a few he was comfortable discussing the shared danger that had turned men who had almost nothing else in common into brothers but seldom the whole truth for anyone only a small measure of it it was he thought better that way this is no a wound of war hamish reminded him now you made yourself a target on purpose yet in some ways the confinement of this healing had once again left him vulnerable to all the horrors hed fought these past five months to overcome now they were creeping out again in spite of him reaching out to pull him back into the morass of despair and hopelessness hed struggled so fiercely to leave behind in the distraction of work the subsequent exhaustion that brought him dreamless sleep the concentration that kept hamish at bay he had scraped together a measure of peace until scotland it was a refrain that hamish had dinned in his head day and night for the past three weeks until scotland rutledge told his sister lightly forcing the shadows out of his conscious mind theres sanity in work ive a desk full of papers to get throughhardly a test of endurance and i am on sick leave not permanent disability this will heal in good time unlike the spirit its little more than a week early frances was that rare woman who knew when to stop persuading and start encouraging all right then lets try a compromise you can manage your own breakfast and find yourself a midday meal but come to me for your dinner at least i can be sure youre eating properly you dont you know you are far too thin still but it wasnt eating improperly that kept rutledge thin and drawn it was so many hauntings hamish the war the impossibility of forgetting when england was full of wounded men struggling to go about lives that years in the trenches had altered irretrievably people looked away from such men now embarrassed by them unable to think what to say to them the war was finished over and done with except for the crosses in flanderss fields and the living reminders no one quite knew what to do with he saw himself a dozen times an hour on the streetsamong the amputees the blind the ugly coughing of the gassedeven though hed come home from france whole in body his wounds were invisible yet he shared the misery of such men even now he could see clearly the poor devil hed watched from his window that very morning clumsily managing his crutches and attempting to steer a reasonably straight course among the passersby or the hideously burned face passing under the street lamp three nights ago long after dark the man had tried to hide the worst of his scars with a scarf but with one ear missing his hat had settled awkwardly a pilot shot down in flames and unlucky enough to have lived through it as he had lived through scotland somehow hamish said ye ken i wasna ready for ye to die to silence his thoughts rutledge agreed to dinner with frances the prospect of working a full day again was daunting he knew quite well he hadnt regained his full strength all the same it would do no harm to try and possibly offer him some little respite from hamishs morbid concentration on scotland rutledge didnt want to think about scotland scotland had haunted him while he was recovering from surgery it had filled his drugged dreams it had brought him upright drenched with sweat and pain in the darkest part of the night when defenses were at their lowest ebb words faces the sound of pipes that last day of rain when nothing stayed dry it was all there in his mind when he was most vulnerableon the edges of sleep waking in the predawn hoursfighting the overwhelming pain for fear the doctor might give him more drugs if anyone guessed how much he suffered hed never wanted to go back to scotland too many scots had been killed in the trencheshe had given the orders that sent hundreds of them charging into no mans land through gunfire that was pitiless inhuman he had watched them scream he had seen them drop he had stepped in the thick red blood where they had crawled in agony toward their own lines hed heard their last fumbling words as they died it was a burden of guilt that still burned like live coals in his conscience but the yard had seen fit to send him north whether he wanted to go or not barely a month ago hed done what he had sworn he would never do and he didnt want to think about it now there were letters from his godfather david trevor who lived near edinburgh lying in his desk across the room unopened he didnt want to read them until he was well until he was back at the yard and his mind was filled with other problems he didnt want to hear how it had ended he wished to god night after night that it had never begunand knew that he lied even as he said the words he had had to stay but hamish reminded him of those letters day and night and hed ignored the voice until his head ached when he was healed fully healed hed read them not until then hamish be damned oh god scotland be damned frances was watching his face and he dragged his thoughts back to the present before she could read them much as he disliked admitting it she was right onearmed he was worse in the kitchen than he was with a razor and his cooking would keep her happy too less likely to chide him for looking like a scarecrow now lets see about that tie then i must go ive a party tonight and nothing to wear she smiled as she rose and crossed to the wardrobe this one i think with the gray suit chief superintendent bowles was not happy to see him but then bowles never was pleased to find inspector rutledge at his desk the chief superintendent had hoped rutledge might die of septicemia foolish of him to get himself shot in the first place it went to prove that rutledge was neither dependable nor competent to deal with police work all the same one could hope that the next time he was fired upon the bullet would fly true there was already talk in certain quarters about the possibility of a promotion bowles had squelched it saying too soon too soon hes not been back at the yard half a year yet give the man time to find his feet bowles greeted his returning inspector with what could best be described as subdued enthusiasm and set him to clearing up files going over paperwork for the courts looking at the disposition of cases wouldnt do to have rutledge out on the streets fainting in the midst of an inquiry hed told his superiors that as well wait until the mans healed time enough then for him to take on a new case rutledge in fact didnt care the mindnumbing concentration needed to finish each report or check every document kept hamish at arms length and silent it was respite in the form of inescapable boredom and he embraced it with prodigious gratitude the other urgent requirement was to rebuild his stamina depleted by enforced idleness and so he began a regimen of walking each day to breakfast in a darkpaneled pub chosen because it lay several streets above trafalgar square to lunch at any one of several pubs on streets that ran toward the tower and then an ever larger loop that would bring him back to the embankment frances under the impression that he was prudently taking the underground said nothing about his gray face each evening but the thought of walking down into the crowded noisy tunnels turned him cold with nerves it was too much like being buried alive in the trenches the first day rutledge arrived back at the yard shaking from the exertion and still made himself take the stairs two at a time even on the weekend he refused to stay indoors and rest by his third day at the office a tuesday he could walk without the black shadows of exhaustion clouding his mind to the point that he was a danger to himself and traffic in the streets on the afternoon of the fifth he was able to breathe reasonably well and stop to look about him his legs he thought wryly belonged to him again their tendency to wobble in his weakness had angered him more than the arm strapped to his chest there was work being done on a plaster war memorial in the middle of whitehall the construction had snarled traffic for some time and before returning to the yard rutledge decided to have a look at it simplicity had been the goal but the memorial seemed inadequate he thought to hold the memory of so much spilled blood and so many ruined lives depressed he moved on toward st margarets church to stand on the corner of bridge street for a time looking up at big ben and watching pigeons wheeling against the sky reluctant to return to his desk in his stuffy illlit office he listened to the traffic on the thames and considered crossing the busy bridge hamish relishing the wind from the river and a sudden gust of rain that swept down on them was lost in his own reflections the sound of voices like small birds twittering in a bush brought rutledges eyes back to st margarets and his thoughts back to the present a group of young women stylish in black stood waiting at the door for another just descending from a motorcar in the street she waved and hurried toward them the wind catching the skirts of her coat as if sweeping her out of his reach he recognized her walk before he heard her voice calling to her friends it was jean she caught up with the others and laughter surrounded them her face holding the pale light for an instant before they turned and went inside the church her cheeks were flushed with excitement and warmth her wedding was to be held at st margarets in a fortnights time jason webley had told him that coming to visit him in hospital at the end of september and after a time awkwardly turning the subject to the woman rutledge had once been engaged to marry i say old man have you heard jeans set a date end of next month webley paused then added she asked elizabeth to be in the wedding party elizabeth asked me what her answer ought to be and i told her i thought you wouldnt mind no but he had minded not because he begrudged jean her happiness but because shed taken away so much of his he could still remember the day nearly eight months before when shed told him haltingly in another hospital ward that she wished to end their engagement and hed seen the fear in her eyes the dread of being tied to a broken man he hadnt yet begun to recover a silent empty man in the grip of nightmares she couldnt understand and shed believed that he never would be more than that an object of pity for the rest of his life hamish reminded him it was a nearrun thing it had been but rutledge was as unprepared for her desertion as he would have been for a slap in the face hed needed comfort a gentle reminder of that normal life hed lost somewhere in the trenches jean couldnt have chosen a worse time to break her engagement to the man shed once sworn she loved above all others a week or two morea month would it have made a difference if shed offered him the compassion of waiting a little longer held him in her arms and told him it didnt matter she loved him still even if it was a kind lie he would never know jean had scuttled out of the hospital room in undisguised relief grateful that hed been willing to set her free by august she had become engaged to a diplomat and was looking forward to a new life in canada where the man was taking up his next posting blithe unshadowed she had brushed away the war years as if they were a bad dream shallow frances had called hera woman who would never have made him happy staring at the church door rutledge found himself thinking that he was after all a lucky man he hadnt married jean in that golden haze of when war was gloriously linked to romance and adventure not to suffering she had tried to persuade him to agree to a hasty wedding then uniforms crossed swords and a hero off to fight the hun and he had reminded her that she was far too young and lovely to find herself a widow he wondered what kind of life they might have shared these past seven months after hed finally been released from the clinic still a prisoner of his own terrors and how deeply they would have come to hate each other finally or if she might have found herself wishing that the bullet hed taken in scotland in september had put an end to their pretenses hamish said shed ha been bonny in black certainly she would have carried herself with great courage impressing all his friends trailing behind her the whisper of great passion and love lost where neither had ever existed still he was swept by a sense of loss as he watched her pass through the door of the church oblivious she hadnt felt his eyes or his thoughts she hadnt sensed his presence and turned to look for him there was a loneliness in that by the end of that week rutledge told himself that hed made rather remarkable strides from the crippled man struggling to shave onehanded while his sister watched the throbbing in his shoulder and chest muscles had begun to subside into a dull ache that he could put out of his mind he could do without the sling now for hours at a time al hough the arm was still tightly bound another week he told himself and ill be fit again the dinners with his sister were beginning to wear thin much as he loved her enjoyed the variety of her cooking and appreciated the fact that she did not fuss frances worried about him and he found it difficult to smile and ignore that on the other hand before the war it had been rutledge who had worried about her and he knew too well the signs of unspoken concern of skirting around issues that ought not to be discussedwhat had happened in scotland jeans approaching wedding mutual friends who were in worse straits than he was he had reached the point of wanting to blurt out if only for the sake of clearing the air between them looki know david is worried that i havent written himi just cant face it yet dont ask me why and as for jean i wish her well im not heartbroken im lonely thats all but i dont want to meet a dozen of your suitable friends for gods sake thats not the answer hamish reminded him yere no fit company for yourself much less a lassie get drunk and get it oer with as advice it wasnt bad but that friday there were more pressing matters to consider chief superintendent bowles after a consultation with the police surgeon considered his options then went to see rutledge its a matter of setting the bishops mind at rest hes worried about the death of one of his people catholic priest murdered in some backwater of norfolk called osterley a priest rutledge repeated surprised in the eyes of the law killing a clergyman was no more heinous a crime than killing a shop girl or a fishmonger the penalty was the samehanging by the neck until dead but in the eyes of society a man of the cloth was protected by his calling set apart inviolate hamish reminded him that priests had once been burned at the stake but that was another day and time with no bearing on bowles was shaking his head we lost our way in the war you know it was one of his favorite themes no good ever comes of change women doing mens workit isnt natural the lower classes getting above themselves i shouldnt wonder if well see worse before were done society breaking down bolshevism on the loose now a priests dead he peered at the sheet of paper in his hand struck down with his own altar crucifix in st annes rectory to be precise the local police havent caught the villain yet the priest walked in on a thief apparently its probable he could have recognized the man and was murdered for that reason the police are looking at that as the primary motive for now stillwe may have a madman in our midst whos to say differently little wonder this bishop wants reassurance that were doing all we can what was the thief after rutledge interjected there were more likely choices for breaking and entering than a church office or rectory a poor box and a priests pockets were notoriously bare madman indeed a paltry sum collected at the church harvest festival im told which means everyone at the festival in the village and in the countryside for miles around knew there must be money in the rectory that broadens the inquiry considerably rutledge agreed did the priest have a housekeeper how did an intruder get past her shed already gone home for the day and the priest himself should have been in the church to hear confession but had put up a notice there saying he was away at a deathbed and might not be back in time clear sailing the thief must have thought but father james came home and went up to his study and the intruder panicked a shame but there it is it could happen to any householder it couldand often did word has come down from the chief constable in norfolk that its politic to send an officer bowles said youre to show the yards concern and have a look at the evidence speak with this bishop or one of his people assure him that the local police know what theyre about and once hes satisfied that everything possible is being done come back to london from what i hear of the local man blevins hes competent and has a good reputation for using his head shouldnt take you more than a few days and october in the broads is usually fine rutledge remembered that it was often wet but said nothing hamish said its no a holiday mind watch your back you canna trust the man he doesna want you in london its more likely a diversion rutledge answered silently to take pressure off blevins while everyone is watching me hell be free to get the job done hamish grunted have ye forgotten scotland already bowles was saying leave now and youll be there tonight anything i ought to know regarding those before you go he gestured to the files spread across rutledges desk parker can deal with them no im finished with this lot in fact i was about to hand them over to sergeant williams hell know which are to be filed and which distributed to the officer in charge of the investigation ill send williams up to collect them theres a train at half past ten you can make it if you hurry bowles smiled in encouragement rutledge was reminded of crocodiles the same cold yellow eyes very well he stood up took the pages bowles handed him tucked them under his good arm and went to open the door ill report by telephone shall i no need its a courtesy visit you wont be getting involved the doctor taking the bandages off rutledges chest for the last time looked at the wound poked and probed at itmaking the patient winceand then nodded in satisfaction you were damned lucky dr fleming said that no deep infection set in still it wont hurt to have a small plaster over it a matter of prevention how do you feel rutledge looking down at the raised raw scar in the matted hair on his chest replied i can breathe without discomfort he flexed his arm it felt like a soggy rag i doubt i could take on a child of six in a brawl fleming chuckled nor should you but that arm will be like new once you begin using it never fear just dont overdo it for the first few daysdont carry anything heavy or push at anything that doesnt want to budge again a matter of prevention i have found in twenty years of treating patients that nature is a good doctor too given half a chance the problem is we seldom give her credit and therefore come to regret it it was rutledge knew one of flemings favorite homilies im off to norwich which shouldnt be strenuous cheating the ratepayer are you id take the train if i were you less demanding on the chest muscles than driving but rutledge left london in his own motorcar his claustrophobia still rampant it was not possible for him to sit in a compartment jammed hip and knee into other travelers the compulsion to stand and scream for air would be as violent as it was unreasonable by the time he reached norwich his chest muscles were in open rebellion mother nature urging them on hamish worse than dr fleming at pointing out rutledges shortcomings reminded him that he had made the drive against advice as a compromise rutledge found a small hotel on the outskirts of town and stayed the night there not prepared to face the traffic of norwich at the end of the day hamish who had alternately raged at him and baited him for miles of the way was as tired as he was the familiar voice was silent over dinner rutledge slept hard from fatigue hamish never followed him into sleepthe voice in his head lived in the waking mind a bitter and hourly reminder of the bloody offensive in on the somme where so many men had died not by the hundreds or thousands but by the tens of thousands their lives thrown away in wave after desperate wave of futile attacks where he himself had been buried in mud and saved from suffocation by the body pressing down on him hed been told over and over again that corporal hamish macleod had saved his life but the blood caked like a second skin all over his face and hands had come from the english firing squad and the coup de grace rutledge had had to deliver personally in the instant before a direct hit had blown the salient to bits hamish hadnt died from german fire and rutledge had been too shaken too lost in the depths of shell shock to set the record straight that corporal macleod had been shot for refusing a direct order on the battlefield the night before that final dawn assault the tangled skeins of truth and official reports had left rutledge with silence with memory with a waking haunting that had nothing to do with ghosts only with the broken mind of a man who had been sent straight back into battle before hed had any rest or come to terms with his own deep sense of guilt for having to choose between one mans life and the morale of the equally exhausted and dispirited soldiers who hadnt refused the order to climb out of the trenches and fight again and three years later he still had not exorcised that guilt it had become too deeply rooted in blood and bone and sinew like a second self rutledge had tried over and over again to die during the last two years of the war putting himself in the way of danger courting the unholy bombardments that splintered the earth daring the hidden machinegun nests that raked no mans land with lethal fire like a lover embracing a bloody mistress he had sought out any periland had come through unscathed to find himself again and again hailed as a hero because he seemed to have no fear of dying it had been the bitterest irony chapter the following morning rutledge found his way through the busy streets of norwich to the address hed been given by chief superintendent bowles it was a small house near the new catholic church far older than the building in whose shadow it stood and with a small garden behind it a gloomy house upright and victorian with sharp eaves that seemed to pierce the low clouds rutledge walked up to the door in a misting rain that enveloped the earth like a shroud on a small wooden board faded gold letters spelled out diocesan office lifting the door knocker a great brass ring that fell with a doomsday clamor he turned to look at the street behind him a half dozen men were waistdeep in a broken sewer digging shovels full of stinking mud out of the pit urchins gaped down into the hole fascinated while passersby held handkerchiefs to their noses against the rank odor a pair of women huddled together on the corner exchanging news the hems of their black skirts even blacker with the runoff of the umbrellas they clutched over their hats a man walking a dog moved swiftly hurrying it along as it stopped to sniff in the gutters no one took notice of the caller at the rectory rain was a great separator hamish whose fierce covenanter ancestors had taught him well was skittish about entering this den of popery and idolatry rutledge amused assured him that his soul was in no danger how can you be sae sure when the church of england is hardly better than this lot the door was opened by a housekeeper whose hair graying at the temples was auburn and whose face flecked with freckles had a touch of irish in it the woman looked him up and down as he gave her his name and asked are you ill then he smiled official business all the same you look as if you could do with a cup of tea and the poor man hasnt had his either writing reports all the morning come in then she took his hat and coat clicked her tongue at the dark patches of rain across the coats shoulders and spread it carefully over a chair to dry then she led the way down a passage to a room at the far end to hamishs considerable relief there were no niches filled with bleeding saints in the passage nor a pervasive odor of incense except for a single small crucifix above the narrow entry there was no sign that the occupants of this den had designs on anyones soul opening a door into a gracious room at the back of the house the housekeeper stood aside to let rutledge enter beyond the windows the rain fell softly on a garden already drab and colorless and dripped from a small pear tree a tall secretary desk the doors in the upper half standing open and the front piled with papers stood against the far wall and there was a table and comfortable chairs set to catch the light spilling in the windows a man in simple priests garb sat there staring out at the wet flower beds a book open in his lap he looked up as the housekeeper gave rutledges name with a flourish hardly a den of iniquity rutledge silently pointed out to hamish this was more the study of a scholarly man a place for retreat and thought hamish reserved his opinion setting his book aside and standing the man crossed the room and held out his hand from london are you thats a fair journey bryony some tea for the two of us she cast a quick smiling look at rutledge and said the kettle is already on the boil the door closed silently behind her im monsignor holston the tall thin man continued he had an aesthetic face and the eyes of a policeman intent knowing the long nose bearing a pincenez was aristocratic and gave the face character if not beauty but the grip of his calloused hand was firm strong he offered rutledge one of the chairs by the table and returned to his own to mark his place in the book close it and set it aside im instructed to speak to you on bishop cunninghams behalf he was called away on pressing diocesan business scotland yard well im pleased to see you i must say this matter of father jamess death has been worrying what can you tell me rutledge smiled its more a matter of what you can tell me ive come to listen ah yes well lets not wait for our tea then monsignor holston ran his fingers along the edge of the leather corners of the blotter its very straightforward what the police propose must have happened the local people took one look at the sceneat the desk broken open most particularlyand declared that father james had surprised a man intent on stealing funds collected at the bazaar a fortnight previously certainly the money was missing he realized how formal his words sounded as if he were quoting directly from the police record and made an effort to continue in a more natural tone father james was usually in the church at that hour you see hearing confessions and should have been in the confessional not his study it must have been quite a shock to the intruder to hear him coming up the stairs according to inspector blevins the man panicked seized the crucifix from father jamess altar and struck him down before fleeing thats all the police can tell me with any certainty the priest stopped and the blue eyes studied rutledges face there was a wariness in them straightforward yes rutledge agreed but youor your bishopapparently werent satisfied why is there more to the story than the police have learned or is it something to do with the circumstances in which he was found sadly no we have no information about the crime itself monsignor holston smiled wryly except that if it was robbery it was unnecessary father james was a very caring priest hed have helped the man he wouldnt have turned him away or turned him in for that matter whats frightening is he broke off and then added i spoke to the bishop myself after id been summoned to osterley by the police i tried to explain what it was about the crime that troubled me he adjusted his glasses as if to see his way more clearly through his own feelings i stood looking down at the body and its true the shock unsettled me it was such a wastea terrible unspeakable waste but my reaction went beyond that i felt something that was primeval fear if you will hamish stirred rutledge said if he was a friend thats a fairly common reaction monsignor of a life squandered and a certain anxiety because death has struck so near he paused father james had died unshriven perhaps unconsciously that weighed heavily it would be natural for you to be concerned yes id take that into account of course i would but it was more than that god knows ive attended my share of deathbeds like a physician im able to separate my emotions into tidy cubbyholes in order to function but not this time he looked down at his hands i grant you that to a poor man the sum collected at the bazaar must have seemed enormous the blows inspector blevins told me were struck in rapid succession a frenzy if you will a terrified man caught out unexpectedly might well have reacted in that fashion hating what he was doing but driven to shield himself and yet somehow i cant accept that if he had come openly there may have been reasons why the intruder couldnt come openly or perhaps hed convinced himself that theft was the easier way that he couldnt keep his promise to repayor see that he worked out the money in time or kind yes i grant you that but consider two things the intruder must have known the pattern of father jamess usual movements otherwise why choose that time of day and he must have known that the study was upstairs and that that was where the money was being kept he didnt ransack the rest of the house he went directly to the study and surely the first place hed have searched the most logical choicewas a desk drawer the money was in there why tear the room apart if hed got what he came for in my opinion if the thief had been more careful opening that drawer and had slipped away before father james came back from hearing confession surely no one would have been able to say with any certainty just when the money went missing logic seldom enters into it a man robbing a house is usually in a hurry and not eager to be caught if hed just killed in a fit of panic he might have wanted to make it seem hed expected a better haul to point a finger away from the fact that he was desperate enough for the little hed found in the desk hamish said ye ken yon priests been busy worrying owr it gnawing at it like a dog with a bone monsignor holston was shaking his head i am trained to think about religious issues when i apply the same logic to this murder i findquestions not solutions no murder is simple rutledge told him but if i understand what you are telling me father james must have been killed by one of his own parishioners its not a pretty possibility though a likely one and surely the police have considered it a shadow of relief passed over the priests face he said im afraid that several other things point in that direction as well which i felt the bishop had to be told father james wore an antique gold medal of saint james on a chain a gift from his family when he was ordained the candlesticks from his private altar might have fetched a goodly sum as would the altar crucifix that was used as the weapon they were old at a guess theyd belonged to the priests of st annes since the early s why should a thief pass up such tempting opportunities if hes in desperate need and has already committed murder whats another minute taken to stuff a crucifix in a pocket or candlesticks under ones coat an eyebrow lifted quizzically as if inviting rutledge to prove him wrong perhaps because the thief was afraid they were objects far easier to trace than a small handful of bills or coins yes id thought of that too my answer was the metal could be melted down if you knew where to go the thief might not receive more than a portion of its real value but it must surely come to a tidy sum i find myself returning again and again to the fact that if hed wanted only the money he could have run out shoving father james out of his way and taken the chance that in such a brief unexpected encounter in a dark room he might not be recognized better that than the sin of murder on his soul hes fearful hamish interjected that he might ken the killer the door opened and bryony came in with the tea tray shadowed by a tigerstriped gray cat bryony set the tray onto the table close to the priests elbow cast an eye over it then left the cat following at her heels with a smug air rutledge tried not to remember a white cat lying on a pillow in an empty room looking for its owner to come again the rectory doesnt own bruce the cat monsignor holston said in amusement catching rutledges eye on the animal he owns the rectory if i understand his genealogy correctly his greatgreatgrandmother was a resident here thats before the bishops time and mine he poured a cup of tea for rutledge and then for himself passed the pitcher of thick cream and the bowl of sugar a plate of thin sandwiches and another of thin slices of cake followed rutledge was beginning to see a pattern in the dispassionate account monsignor holston had given his reasoning had been easy to followsomeone who had no connection with the church might have considered the candlesticks and the crucifix an unexpected windfall this thief hadnt but hed known or guessed where to look for the money as holston had all but said the evidence pointed directly to a member of the church but was that his only deduction there were shadows behind the priests eyes worry more than mourning rutledge decided to bide his time as monsignor holston settled to his tea rutledge asked have the police interviewed members of st annes congregation surely they were most likely to know that the bazaar money was still in father jamess hands as well as where it was being kept oh yes that was done and done again there are as in every parish catholic or protestant a few er black sheep these were questioned a third time but such men arent likely to commit murderpetty theft perhaps even burglary if pressed by circumstances there were at least three needy parishioners who might well have talked their way out of trouble if father james caught them in his study ill wife in one case and too many children to feed in another and a third is known for his taste for the horses in their straits any sum might have been tempting in inspector blevinss opinion none was likely to be a killer he said not one of them had the stomach for it perhaps inspector blevins should be searching for a man who might have had one of the booths at the fair or had come to the fair for the express purpose of finding money somehow and chosen to come back and try his luck at the rectory when he had been unsuccessful anywhere else the cake was heavy with eggs and sultanas rutledge thought frances would tell me its strengthening yes the local authorities have been quite thorough there also theyre still searching for individuals who had set up a booth and any strangers who had drawn attention to themselves apparently it isnt easy to trace their movementsthis is a popular time of year for harvest fetes and bazaars they could be in a dozen towns rutledge finished his cake and set aside his plate the thin man opposite him had consumed three helpings to his one filled with a nervous energy that demanded stoking monsignor holston seemed not to notice the richness of the cake lets return to my earlier suggestionand yours what if we turn the tale around and ask ourselves if the priest was killedand the pittance taken to cover up the crime rutledge asked the police also dismissed that theory they reported to the bishop that there is no reason to believe that father james had enemies the blue eyes had become watchful policemen often interviewed witnesses and friends of a murder victim who felt a driving need to find explanations to look for answers but rutledge had the strong impression that monsignor holston was trying to shape the thinking of this man from london guiding it carefully toward an unclear goal rutledge said i think it might be time for you to give me the whole of the story monsignor holston smiled do you usually have so little faith in the things youre told inspector which is another way of saying perhaps that i believe you yourself have not yet come to face the truth the priest sighed it isnt a matter of truth he replied turning for a moment to look out the window at the rain its a matter of faith sometimes theres a feeling one cant shake off have you ever experienced such a thing when rutledge nodded he went on try as hard as i will i cant ignore that primeval responsethat sense of dangerof fear for myself as well as for father james i asked the bishop to send for scotland yard because my instincts tell me it was the right thing to do what if there is more here than meets the eye what if this murder is beyond the experience and training of the local people to investigate fully what if the killer is able to outwit them and we see no one brought to justice he paused then said in a strained voice its likely that ill be sent as the interim pastor at st annes until a replacement can be found i dont want to be the next victim chapter rutledge stared at the priest his mind working swiftly as he weighed what had been saidand what had not youve been afraid from the beginning havent you that father james was not killed for money for the sake of argument what if youre right what if the theft was no more than a cloud of confusion to mislead the police if youre worried about being the next victim the only conclusion i can draw is that youve been told something monsignor holston interrupted his voice earnest i was in that room before theyd taken father james away and there was violence in the presence of his body violence that went unexplained and it spilled over on me do you understand what i am trying to say what if this murderer isnt satisfied that its finished or has your profession inured you to death inspector perhaps its out of fashionafter the slaughter of thousands in the war to put the death of any maneven a priestdown to an unspeakable act they are both unspeakable acts murder and war rutledge answered grimly i havent become inured to either of them youre describing the force of the crime i think not the motivation monsignor holston shook his head no it was something in that room the policemen were about the lamps lit the spirit of the man long since departed the body cold evenbut the lingering sense of violence was frightful he paused as a priest i have no key to unlock the mind of this murderer but i fear it and in doing so i fail the man who has just taken a life and in failing him i have failed god he set his teacup aside rutledge said if youve sent for scotland yard to restore your faith in your god we arent trained for that no it isnt what i need from you i need your intelligence and your knowledge of how or why such a crime is committed i want to be sure that the man the police take into custody this weeknext weeknext yearis the culprit it will be easy i think to find people who might have been needy enough to steal and put the blame on them i want to be absolutely sure it isnt misplaced the priest had failed to answer the question directly hes as slippery as a fish hamish warned youre a trained and intelligent man yourself monsignor surely youve taken the question a step further if it wasnt something father james knewor had told you then it must be something in that rectory that the killer was searching for and if he failed to find it you must feel fairly certain that hell come back to try again if youre there he wont let your presence stand in his way just as he didnt spare father james what in heavens name could father james have kept there that would be worth one priests life and perhaps two what could have put him at such risk if i knew the answer to that monsignor holston said in resignation we wouldnt be having this conversation id have told inspector blevins at once then im left with the original police supposition that this was a breakingandentering gone wrong and the people in osterley can handle that if im to present a case to my superiors that calls for the yards intervention ive got to persuade them that there is very good reason to think the yards time is well spent here yes the fact that the victim is a priest naturally weighs with them or i wouldnt have been sent to norwich in the first place but the rule of thumb is that the local constabulary often knows more about the people they need to interview than an outsider could and are therefore more likely to spot the killer i have given you all the information that its in my power to give you monsignor holston replied his austere face clouded with doubt i cant tell you more than thati wish i knew more and i wont lie to you either i will say this father james was a very good man sober and hardworking a man of faith and deep convictions i have a duty to him if his murderer can be found i want him found hamish said a priest could be killed for what he knows it was true rutledge finishing his tea shook his head as he was offered more and set his empty cup on the tray theres another avenue we havent really explored a clergyman learns to cope with a variety of responsibilities some of them rather onerous theres always the chance that what happened to father james is in some way related to his duties and in taking them over you may put yourself at risk as well someone may believe you will come to know more than you safely should its always possible of course the truth is a clergyman can often make quite good guesses about whats going on in his parish and hes often privy to confidencesnever mind what hes told in the confessional but in that confessional he may learn the whole story a husband is unfaithful to his wife a clerk has cheated his employer someone has spread a lie that hurt others a child was not fathered by the man who believes its his thats the reason the words uttered in the confessional are a sacred trust it must be a place where a person tells the truth and unburdens his soul before god we believe in this sacrament and we protect it with our silence father james wouldnt have broken that vow and if a man or a woman tells the priest something and later regrets that confidence he or she may regret having spoken but god knew long before he or she stepped into the confessional and the priest is sworn to silence thats not always the practical answer rutledge told him monsignor holston removed his glasses rubbing the bridge of his nose no it isnt the practical answer is that man or that woman may simply move to another parish leaving behind the priest who knows the truth and finding another one who will accept this newest member of his flock at face value one doesnt murder the priest for the secrets of the confessional it would have changed the face of the church hundreds of years ago if that had become the common practice he restored his glasses to their proper place settling them into the deep indentations on either side of his nose then tried to smile and failed were you told that father james was a chaplain in the first two years of the war until he was sent home with severe dysentery in who can be sure that the truth doesnt lie there in the war monsignor holston turned his head again to look out at the garden as if he half expected to find the answer he wanted in the grassy paths and the shrubbery or half expected to find someone standing there hamish said he fidgets like a man with an uneasy conscience rutledge answered silently uneasy or uncertain aloud he said in that event i see no reason why you should feel that youre in any particular danger monsignor holston turned from the window to rutledge i have told you its primitivethe hair rising on the back of my neck in a dark corner of my church or coming down the passage here in the house when its late and im alone sitting in a lighted room when the windows are dark and the drapes havent been drawn and looking up suddenly to see if someone is out there staring in at me it isnt real its all imagination and im not by nature easily frightened now i am did you serve with the same units that father james did i never went to france i worked among the wounded here in england as they were being sorted out when the ships came in most of them were in too much pain to do more than accept a cigarette and a little compassion some reassurance that god was still watching over them monsignor holston shook his head youre probably right im not thinking very logically about any of this but somewhere in this muddle there must be an explanation for father jamess murder and my own strange sense that somethings wrong he took a deep breath im sorry youre a very clever man inspector rutledge youll sort it out i am reassured that scotland yard has sent us its best and that was all that monsignor holston was prepared to say leaving the rectory rutledge paused to speak to bryony as she showed him to the door around them the house was silent shutting out the sound of the rain and the echo of shovels scraping against stone out in the street i understand that father james was well thought of now there was a black day when father was killed ive not got over the shock of it well thought of of course he was and well loved well respected too she took rutledges hat and coat from the chair beside the door and held them to her as if they offered comfort you can ask anyone people always speak well of the dead he told her gently even a priest is human and sometimes frail as to that i wouldnt know im not one to go around looking for failings i can tell you father james was a patient man and generous if someone had come to him with a tale of hard luck hed have given them the money they neednt have killed him for it itll turn out to be a stranger mark my words a cruel and ungodly man with no regard for his own soul her eyes remained on his as if expecting him to make a pronouncement that would set her mind at rest a noncatholic is that what youre saying neither protestant nor catholic in my viewno churchgoing man would murder a clergyman would he im saying that whoever it was killed father james wasnt hungry or in debt he was calculating and selfserving with a devil in him or her women can be terrible cruel sometimes are there so many of those walking about that it takes all this time for the police to track down the right one its been days now since fathers death and what have the police got to show for it i call it a crying shame surely theyve tried oh as to trying now id agree with you there theyve tried but theyre not what id call clever men she moved to open the door for him letting in the damp and the reek of the filthy mud being piled high at the roadside housebreaking and petty theft firesetting or assaulttheyll find the culprit because chances are hes done it before but thats not clever is it its only a matter of knowing where to look and in this case perhaps only a matter of finding out who has extra money jangling in his pocket the money he stole from father james rutledge responded reasonably six of one is it now she tilted her head to look up at him father james was a family man did they tell you this past august his sister presented her husband with three little ones and father james was always helping out with the babes whats she to do now with winter coming on and no one to come and stay a few days when ones sick of the croup and shes up all the night you might speak to mrs wainer she was father jamess housekeeper and a more decent woman youll never meet ask her about walking into the study and finding him there stiff and cold blood all over the place and for all she knew the killer lurking in the bedroom ready to strike her down as well if youve set monsignors mind at rest just now it would be a kindness to reassure her too and only a few hours out of your way mind where will i find her he stepped through the doorway as she handed him his coat and hat he could feel the blowing mist on his face fine as silk against his skin shes at the rectory still though i dont know for the life of me how the poor woman can walk through the door its her duty to be there she says every day just as if father james was still alive osterley is the name of the town surely they told you that in london its closer to the sea in the north and easy enough to get to from here her eyes were shrewd easier of course to go back to london satisfied youve done your duty by us theres many would do that somehow i dont think youre one of them and with that she bade him a good day and closed the door rutledge turned the crank and got into his motorcar out of the rain and then he surprised himself by sitting there considering what bryony had said the motor idling under his gloved hands as they rested on the wheel he hadnt anticipated being drawn into the life or the death of this man it wasnt the task that had been set him go to norfolk to reassure the bishop that the police are doing their job properly and instead hed been expected he thought wryly to perform a small miracle or two find a true explanation for the murder of the priestand then track down the killer he didnt envy the local man blevins struggling to conduct an investigation in a climate of disbelief that refused to accept simple murder for what it really was a commonplace calamity not the stuff of legends but even as he tried to make light of bryonys forceful plea and monsignor holstons fears rutledge couldnt escape the fact that their intensity had touched him hamish said aye but it will pass with the mood which was probably true the thing was bryony had made it very hard for him to walk away instead he put the motorcar in gear and turned the bonnet north instead of south toward london driving on to osterley as a schoolboy learning to draw the map of great britain rutledge had been taught that the island resembled a man in a top hat riding a running pig the top hat was the northern part of scotlandthe highlands the mans head and body were the lowlands and the midlands of england the pigs head was wales its front feet the cornish peninsula its hind feet the downs of kent and its rump was east anglia the great bulge of essex suffolk and norfolk jutting out into the north sea toward the low countries it was a picture he and his schoolmates had found diverting endlessly practicing their drawing of the pig and its rider unaware that the effort sealed forever in their minds the geography of their country now as he covered the miles between norwich and osterley rutledge watched the raindrops collect on his windscreen and resisted hamishs efforts to draw him into a debate over the interview with monsignor holston he didnt want to delve into the priests motivations or bryonys the earlier mood as hamish had predicted was wearing off and in its place was a rising doubt about his own judgment he hadnt been cleared for a return to full dutyand his instructions had been to travel to norwich nothing had been said about continuing north old bowels would have his liver if he upset the local man on a whim and brought the wrath of the chief constable down on both their heads on the other hand rutledge could say with some certainty that he had made precious little progress in reassuring the bishops representative the monsignor wouldnt have settled for less than a fullblown investigation by the yard given any choice in the matter if a visit to osterley was what it took to satisfy him of the yards faith in inspector blevins there would be no official objections to that but hamish wouldnt be put off its no the body thats standing in your way ye havena put scotland out of your mind ye werena ready to return to work because you werena ready to face living the bandages are off rutledge answered flatly by the time im back in london the police surgeon will be satisfied that the medical leave can be rescinded aye but watching yon fine doctor cut away bits of bandage is no the same as coming to grips with yoursel ill deal with scotland when im back in london oh aye then tell me why were driving north again it was a pretty route leaving norwich to follow country lanes through gently rolling hills many of them hid small flint or brick villages in pocketsize valleys and the stillgreen meadows on the rounded hillsides were sheltered by a line of trees where fluffy clusters of norfolk sheep dotted the landscape their fleece thickening for the winter so unlike france with its broken walls and stark chimneys lining the roads from the front he could almost pretend that it was and nothing had changed but of course it had there was never any going back to hamish this was soft countrypeaceful and prosperous where a living came more easily than in the harsh often barren landscapes of the highlands that very harshness in hamishs opinion had made the scots formidable fighting men norfolk had produced fine soldiers too rutledge reminded him but as far as hamish was concerned training and blood were two very different factors in the making of an army one could be taughtthe other was in the very bone even in the trenches hamish had been fond of citing examplessome of them ranging back to the twelfth centuryof scottish prowess in battle it was rutledge thought a way of life that had seldom brought prosperity or contentment to the highlands but in pride and fierce spirit it had bred a full measure of courage the miles rolled away behind them and then the road rutledge was driving wound through a cut in a hill and unexpectedly came to an end facing a broad expanse of marshes as flat as they were striking and bronzed now with the coming winters palette of redbrown and yellow and old gold he paused at the junction to stare out across them thinking to himself that for such a small country england had its share of beauty here the road went either right toward cley or left toward hunstanton running along the landward edges of the marsh as far as the eye could see rutledge turned left feeling the wind coming in from the northwest bearing with it the cries of gulls out along the ridge of dunes by the sea rounding a curve a few miles farther on rutledge found himself in the outskirts of a small sprawling village lying under a sky that looked like a great gray bowl holding in the light from the unseen water beyond the marshes to his right this wasnt the famous constable sky those broad horizons that the artist had made his signature vast banks of clouds filled with delicate color that somehow emphasized the simplicity of the ordinary lives he chose to paint farm lads fishing or tired horses drawing a haywain across a treeshaded stream each caught in his workaday worldrustic beauty unaware of the grandeur overhead here the sky was selfeffacing canopy accepting its more prosaic role of joining sea and land even when the sea was nowhere to be seen but it was out there beyond the marshes that had taken root on the salty wet silt it had left behind this part of norfolk had fought long battles with the forces of wind and water which had often changed the shape of the coastline a village might lie on the shore this century and find itself miles away from the sea in the next the first scattering of houses led him next into the village of osterley to his left a great flint church stood high on a grassy knoll well above the main road and looking down across it to the houses that marked the waterfront a church rutledge thought that must have been built by the wool trade and heavy coastal shipping there were a goodly number of these cathedrals in miniature in norfolk which had seen a flourishing economy in its day if he remembered his history correctly osterley had been one of the great ports in the middle ages and some of those riches had gone into the clerestory and the strong soaring towers creating a sense of light and power at the same time rutledge turned up the lane leading to the church driving up the hill for a better look a sign posted by the churchyard gate told him that this was holy trinity someonea womanwalked out the church door a notebook in her hand and shielding her eyes looked up at the clerestory the way the wind played with her skirts and the long coat she wore rutledge got the impression that she was slim fairly young and attractive it was there in the set of her shoulders and the tilt of her head though her hand and arm hid her features there must be a fine view from yon tower hamish said its verra high a landmark from the sea as well i should think the town of boston in lincolnshire had used its church tower as a beacon for centuries the woman walked back into the church frances rutledge thought would have approved of the hat she was wearing dark red with silver and blue feathers on one side that gave it a stylish air he was tempted to get out and pay a visit to the church to see her better just then a man came up the hill from the village not by the road but through the churchyard and went inside a workman from the look of him wearing a smock and heavy shoes shed been waiting for him perhaps he turned his attention back to the terrain ahead of the motorcars bonnet the lane disappeared into a small copse he thought there must be five or six houses scattered beyond it but decided not to trust his axles to that twisting rutted stretch of muddy road he could just see a few chimneys rising above gabled roofs and at the far end what might have been a barn judging from its bulky silhouette across the lane from the church stood the vicarage half hidden behind a flint wall its drive disappearing into old trees that gave some hint of its age he turned the motorcar and went back down the lane to the main road just on the corner of a street to the rightwater street the sign informed himstood the police station rutledge pulled up in front of it and got out to pay his courtesy call on inspector blevins but there was a notice posted on the door dated this morning gone to swaffham in the event of an emergency contact east sherham police station a number was given he opened the door and looked inside the front room was silent uninviting as a place to wait aye and for how long hamish asked querulously rutledge closed the door again starting the motorcar he decided his time would be better spent exploring the village and calling on mrs wainer that could be viewed as an extension of his original briefputting bishop cunninghams mind at restrather than an infringement of the local mans investigation water street clearly went down to the quay it ran along there for some distance before turning back to the main road as if disappointed by what it had found at the harbor but he passed that turning and stayed on the main road interested in the size and general layout of osterley it appeared to be prosperous enough no ugly areas of rundown housing or noticeable poverty but without signs either of money to waste on ostentation there were some half a dozen streets running inland to his left short streets for the most part although he thought that sherham street went on to the next village for it appeared to vanish over the hill into farming land two streets turned to his right old point road and marsh lane down old point road he saw the second church in the village and decided that it must be st annes and then as suddenly as hed come upon osterley he was out of it a muddy farmyard on the right a house half glimpsed on a rise to his left and the main road west dropped sharply down a hill and ran along the marshes that spread to his right as far as the horizon even hamish was struck by the splendor of the view and rutledge turned into a small stony culdesac to look out at the scene grasses and marshes covered the land like a rough browngold blanket and a few stunted trees bowed before the wind on the point of giving up against its force the grasses moved as if with a will of their own as the wind ran capriciously through them here ducks and geese and sea birds owned the silence a thin line of white at the very fringes of the marshes marked the sea it was wildly beau iful and rutledge thought here is something man hasnt destroyed hamish said aye but give him time a small falcon rose from the thick grass to fly some twenty yards then hover with beating wings above its unsuspecting prey rutledge watched it swoop and then take off again with a dark smudge hanging from one claw a mouse the stillness was broken only by the wind sweeping in from the sea and he thought he had caught the sound of waves rolling in a deep roar that was felt as much as it was heard like a heartbeat the sense of peace was heavy and the sense of isolation a formation of geese out over the surf flew like a black arrow toward osterley following them with his eyes rutledge remembered the lines of poetry from which the words had come they ran through his mind almost without conscious thought across the moon the geese flew pointing my way a black arrow on the wing but i was afoot and slow and stumbled in the dark by moonset i was left alone and sad still far from the sea o a manning had been writing about a mans desperate struggle against despair here in the marshes watching the wedge of geese it seemed to be possible to reach the sea after all he felt his spirits lift unless hamish told him harshly its only an illusion chapter ignoring hamish rutledge spent another five or ten minutes there his eyes scanning the marshes but now it seemed devoid of life the spell it had cast broken he got out to crank the motor under his feet was a bed of stones white round pebbles that when split showed their opaque flinty core many of the towns along the north sea had been built of such stone hard and durable at the center as the motor came to life and he turned to walk back to the drivers side he found himself thinking about bryony again the housekeeper had told him that the police had got nowhere why had no one in osterley come forward with information about the priests death it was a crime that any community should instantly condemn the kind of sudden death that drove people to lock their doors at night and look askance at their neighbors and remember small events that might be pieced carefully together until the puzzle was solved i saw a man i overheard such and such while waiting to pay my account at the greengrocers father james told me one day after mass a village thrived on prying privacy was an illusion protected by silence rutledge turned the car once more and went back the way hed come the answer to his question seemed to be that they had no information to give the residents of osterley or they had closed ranks around the murderer of the priest but thats no likely hamish pointed out or does it explain why the bishop called in scotland yard reaching old point road again rutledge turned in the second church was smaller than holy trinity its steeple a slim finger pointing into the gray sky built of flint and weathered by the sea winds it offered a plain face to the world but seemed to be timeless after a fashion a survivor a black board with gold letters informed him that this was indeed st annes roman catholic church the churchyard lay behind it a low stone wall enclosing the gravestones that over time were slowly encroaching on the building another hundred years rutledge thought and the stones would reach the apse next to the church was the brick rectory small and victorian but with such a flair for extravagance it might have alighted here one night in a storm and decided to stay an exotic bird faring well in this northern climate far from its native land hardly a setting for bloody murder he stopped the motorcar in the yard of the rectory and was on the point of getting out to knock on the door when a woman pushing a pram along the road called to him mrs wainer has gone to do her marketing in the town but i should think shell be back in an hour at most rutledge thanked her he turned for a third time and decided to make his way back to the waterfront he might even find his lunch there it had been some time since hed breakfasted in norwich osterley was built of local flint with brick facings at windows and doors the lumpy pebbles seeming to cling to the walls like hungry leeches and yet there was a quality to the construction that spoke of sturdiness and endurance and a certain seaworthiness as if prepared for the onslaught of storms he found the street that turned off to the harbor and it swept him around an unprepossessing bend where houses clung to the edge of the road on either side then down to the narrow quay to run along it for some distance before water street turned back toward the main road it was a busy part of the town people coming and going carriages and carts standing in front of shop doors horses with their heads down dozing where they waited but rutledges attention was drawn to the harbor as he drove slowly through the congestion where there had once been the blue wash of water banks of silt met his eye instead these grassy hummocks rolled like earthen waves out to the north seas edge and the muddy earth below the stone quay gleamed wetly under the gray sky a small ghost of its medieval magnificence a handsome port suitable for coastal trading where fishing boats had brought in heavy nets filled with plaice and cod and mackerel had become a narrow ribbon of water that wandered halfheartedly into view touched the quay at high tide and then wandered away again two or three small boats had been drawn up behind a line of sheds at the far end of the quay and left to rot another pair sat in the black mud waiting to be pushed into the main stream of the ribbon he lifted his gaze to the great arm of sand dunes covered with shore plants and grasses which was flung out beyond the marshes on his right ridged with colorrust and waning green and dull gold it had once sheltered osterley from storms making it a safe haven but it must also have allowed the sand to find a haven as well until the water had been lost amid the pits and shallows rising faster than it did a haunt of waterfowl now but through the breaks in the ridges one could still glimpse the sea tantalizing and perhaps close enough to hear when the wind fell off there must be a fine strand still out where the headland rose to his left the kind of place that would have attracted fishermen and bathers had there been easier access small houses shops and a single hotel had taken over the waterfront now cheek by jowl they presented a blank face to the sea few windows and most of the doorways shielded by narrow rectangular entries that kept out the wind and provided some protection in storms these were a signature of many seaside towns accustomed to rough weather neither rich nor poor and mostly unchanged over the past century or more osterley offered a middleclass solidity that was the backbone of england attitudes still firmly fixed in victorian morality and the responsibility of empire clinging to the edge of the land the town was no longer a part of the sea his was the only motorcar on the street today although he saw three more standing at angles in the walled yard beside the only hotel a fat gray goose wild not domestic picked at the black mud beyond the quay and its mate stood watch neck straight and eyes bright early winter arrivals beyond the town to the right of the harbor the marshes spread east for miles rutledge found a small space in which to shift into neutral and look out across them they held a fascination for him always had but he had forgotten their odd beauty just below him in the water a boat was coming in the man at the oars handling them well keeping the bow midstream as if he knew his way his fair hair dark with sweat as he pulled toward the quay he wore a good tweed coat and an english setter sat between the thwarts tongue lolling as it watched the quay come closer rutledge turned off the motor and got out standing there until the boat had reached the stairs and then walked forward to catch the rope the man threw up toward him thanks my pleasure the rower stood up and stepped out onto the lower stair a man of middle height with a strong face and eyes the color of a winter sea he was fit and trim clicking his tongue he waited as the dog leaped up the stairs ahead of him excitement in its movement waiting for a sign to run heel you ragbag he said and looking up at rutledge added hes got more energy than i have but then he hasnt been working the oars for the past hour or more ill have the devil of a time walking home hell be there and back twice over before i cover half the distance it was said with a mixture of impatience and affection the voice was cultured without the local accent can you go out as far as the sea rutledge asked nodding toward the distant headland oh yes its quite nice out there silent as the grave except for the waves breaking as they come in and the birds putting up their usual fuss i rather like it he spoke to the dog and the pair set out up water street the dog matching the mans strides for the first twenty paces and then bouncing ahead like a thrown ball urging his master on then an older woman coming out of a shop to her horsedrawn carriage called out edwin care for a lift the man waved to her and whistled the dog to heel rutledge watched him swing himself into the carriage and heard his laughter as the woman agreed to allow the wet wriggling animal to leap up with them returning to his motorcar rutledge noticed the pelican inn standing at the far end of the quay where the road turned up a barmaid had just finished sweeping the entry and was now shaking out the bit of carpet where customers wiped their feet she was buxom fair and middleaged with a goodnatured face children rolling hoops ran up the street shouting to each other drawing a frown from two welldressed men conversing under the wroughtiron sign for the bakers shop a black cat sat in a sheltered corner licking its fur and ignoring the small terrier that was trotting at the heels of an elderly man with a cane the man spoke to the barmaid and she laughed a pub rutledge thought was one of the best places to test the temperament of a village he left the car at the end of the quay and walked across to the pelican the barmaid had gone inside and was wiping down the last two tables her face pink with exertion as she gave them a good scrub she looked up and smiled at him saying what can i do for you love is it too early for a lunch the hams not near done nor the stew neither but i can give you a ploughmans that will be fine he answered bread and good english cheese and a pint here sit by the windows where you can enjoy the view she shrugged plump shoulders and added if you like the marshes i find them dreary myself too much wildlife for my taste of the crawly kind if you take my meaning more of them than there are of us and thats no lie he sat down by the window that looked out across the marsh and counted a flight of some dozen ducks coming in to what must be a pool hidden somewhere among the tall grasses the barmaid had disappeared into the kitchen and he heard the rattle of cutlery and dishes as his eyes adjusted to the dimness created by smokeblackened beams and tables he realized that he wasnt alone another man sat in a corner nook by the bar his head bent over a newspaper rutledge wasnt certain whether he was reading it or using it as a barrier against conversation decoratively the pelican contained the flotsam and jetsam of a seafaring port an iron anchor in one corner several ships models suspended from the beams a handful of blueandwhite chinese plates resting on shelves nailed to the walls with haphazard artistry carved seabirds of every shape and size perched on the wide windowsills as if trying to find a way through the glass a stuffed greylag goose enormous and showing signs of moth occupied one end of the bar with a sign around his neck advertising a norfolk ale there were even odd bits and pieces from around the world hung wherever they might fit a great hammeredcopper dish from morocco or turkey set above the hearth was large enough to serve an entire family without crowding a small elephant sat in one corner carved from teak and caparisoned in fraying velvet with tiny silver bells in the fringe what appeared to be a water buffalos horned skull was mounted above the door and on another wall curved knives in ornate sheaths shared honors with a hideous mask from somewhere in africa leering through shellrimmed eyes and mouth it gave the public house a decidedly eccentric air as if more than one seaman had settled his account with whatever souvenirs he had in his kit hamish commented i canna say the goose is an encouragement to a mans drinking the barmaid came toward the table with rutledges lunchchunks of freshly baked bread and sharp cheddar cheese a pickle and a pot of mustard as she set them before him she tilted her head to the room at large and said were generally busier than this but its market day at east sherham and most people wont be back before two oclock she went to draw his pint and added friendly gossip that she was here on business are you he answered that he was and she continued to chatter for a few minutes longer telling him that she had been born in hunstanton and had come to osterley with her husband who had since died fighting a house fire and that she and her two daughters had found a good home here she seemed to ignore the man in the corner as if he was another fixture along with the elephant and the mask rutledge said i was shocked to hear that a priest was murdered in osterley a week ago it doesnt strike me as the sort of town where such a thing could happen she shook her head i never thought it either none of us has got over it i can tell you i keep my girls close and lock the doors at night if hed kill a priest he wont stop at children will he i shudder to think what sort of devil could do such a thing i havent slept deep since it happened rutledge was on the point of asking her another question when a group of men strode in hailing her with accounts of their success bidding on a pair of rams at the sale in east sherham and eager to relive it blow by blow she went off to serve them and listened with good grace to their rambling story of the days best bargain underlying their enthusiasm was a more somber thread of strain and they seemed to be intent on ignoring it their laughter was a little loud a little forced the barmaidbetsy theyd called hersoon had them settled with pints to celebrate their success rutledge decided from the strong noses that marked each weatherbeaten face that they were father and sons he finished his meal amid the general hilarity and a rash of newcomers bringing their own news of the market it was as far as he could tell the only topic of conversation of interest just now who was there what theyd bought or failed to buy how the prices ran and any gossip gleaned for an hour or so the shadow of the priests death was being resolutely lifted the man at the corner table had not moved as far as rutledge could tell nor had he turned a page in the newspaper no one encouraged him to join in the goodhumored banter or asked him to drink with them settling his account rutledge left the pub and went out to start his motorcar it doesna appear to be a town with dark secrets hamish said and they didna stare at youa stranger with suspicion interesting wasnt it but then market day generates its own excitement when the euphoria of a bargain wears off and night begins to fall people will begin to look over their shoulders again hed been to towns where the silence hung heavy as mist faces shut and unfriendly where there was no distraction from fear and uncertainty here there seemed to be a determined refusal to acknowledge that osterley had been touched by evil he wondered why where water street turned at harbors edge to run back up to the main road there were two horsedrawn carriages outside the greengrocers shop and a lad from the butchers next door was carrying a bulky package out to deposit in a pony cart accompanying a woman dressed in black with a small touch of cream at her wrists and collar an elderly woman stepped out of the greengrocers with a large basket filled with her purchases and turned to walk up toward the main road rutledge thought she might be mrs wainer but there was no one to ask you can feel the water hamish said it must be verra bitter here in winter raw with an east wind sometimes rutledge agreed when the storms roll in back on the main road rutledge braked as he came to the police station but the sign hadnt been removed from the door he drove on to st annes and got out of the car staring up at the rectory cupolas and mock turrets and gingerbread gave it a frivolous air that the simpler lines of the victorian frame seemed half ashamed of there were carvings at the peak of the gables and he told himself that if the builder had found a place to add gargoyles hed have done it and yet the whole seemed far more pleasing than any one part next to the rectory was a fairsized flint house with a small glass conservatory now flecked with moisture from an array of tall plants inside most certainly the home of the neighbor who had been away on the night of the priests murder the windows on that side of the rectory looked across a narrow stretch of grassy lawn almost into the windows of the larger house but the rectory windows also looked down the lawn to the road had father james seen someone there someone he believed would hear his shout a laborer walking home from the fields a constable on patrol hamish said was it luck that the family was no at home or did the killer choose his time because of that yes its possible rutledge answered if hed been watching the house for several days the next three houses were more modest in design curving toward a house closest to the point that must have been part of the port buildings in its heyday a small hotel or a customs house a placard nailed to a board and neatly lettered in white identified it as a rooming house in its present incarnation across the street from where he stood there were five flint houses built for comfort more than style rutledge walked up the short path to the rectory door the knocker he discovered was a bit of whimsy as well a coffin he let it drop and the echoing ring of sound startled him deep as a bell tolling hamish responding to his unspoken thought said it must ha been the last owners an undertakers rutledge was about to answer him when the door opened and a small whitehaired woman dressed in black warily asked his business he explained who he was offering his credentials for her inspection she glanced at them with relief and then stood aside to allow him to enter a dark hall with two doors on either side of a wide staircase of worn mahogany a passage ran down beside the stairs to a third door at the back end of the hall mrs wainer opened the one to her right and invited him into a small parlor with a gesture offering the sofa as the most comfortable seat it was a room of surprisingly lovely proportions with long windows facing the church a selection of old but wellcaredfor furniture and an oak mantelpiece that rose nearly to the high ceiling this was ornately carved with ferns and acorns and leaves and rutledge wondered if it had come from an even older house the scent of lemon wax pervaded even the upholstery and rose to greet him as he sat down the sheen on every wooden surface spoke of the brisk application of a polishing rag and there was no dust on the green leaves of the large plant in one corner hamish eyed it with dislike yons the ugliest aspidistra ive ever clapped eyes on rutledge was in agreement it seemed to thrive without beauty out of place here but certainly well fed and watered mrs wainer was saying as she stood before him like a schoolmistress did i understand you rightly scotland yard you said that means london yes thats correct behind her on the mantel was a small china clock with a french dial and beveled glass it ticked with a soft grace her eyes closed for a brief moment and she said i have prayed for answers and there have been none until now rutledge said not absolutely certain he understood her i havent come to tell you that the murderer has been found no youve come to look for him thats what matters im here because bishop cunningham was concerned enough to contact the yard as he should have been it was a despicable crime despicable i looked at father james lying there and i knew straightaway that such a thing hadnt been done by an ordinary man inspector blevins cant seem to grasp that or wont im beginning to think he wants to believe it was a thief come for the bazaar money but it wasnt now youre here something will be done about what happened there was an intensity in her face that made rutledge feel uneasy why are you so certain that the killer wasnt a thief because he wasnt i dont care what they say you dont knock a man down for such a pitiful sum then leave behind a medal around his neck worth more than fifty pounds if youd kill a priest youd feel no compunction stealing his medal in my opinion this was vengeance someone wanted him dead it was an interesting choice of words rutledge said what had father james done to bring such wrath down on him thats what you must find out she told him earnestly ive been father jamess housekeeper since first he came here to osterley and thats been well over ten years now he was a good man and a wonderful priest a caring priest and good people make enemies she turned her head to look over her shoulder toward the door and the stairs as if expecting someone to come down them and call to her i dont think ill ever be free of that horror him lying there in his own blood his hand so cold when i touched it that i cried out for the pity of it her eyes came back to rutledge a monster did that killing retribution for father james standing up against cruelty and evil and sin mark my words thats what youll find if you search hard enough hamish said she believes what she said and she willna be satisfied with any other solution rutledge answered him silently she must have loved him in her own way and anything less than a monster will make father jamess death seemsenselessto her aloud he said to mrs wainer did you know the money was here the money from the autumn fair of course i did father james gave it to me that evening when the fair was over and said lock this away in my desk will you ruth ill give you the key and fetch it again as soon as ive cleaned up hed been dressed as a clown to entertain the children you see and the paint was still on his face did you usually lock money away for him i did whatever he asked he trusted me she said simply was the desk broken into to find the money yes it was damaging the drawer something fierce but theres only a small lock on the drawer a flimsy thing at best it was secure enough from prying eyes if anyone came into the room hardly more than thatand we never had a hapenny stolen until now there was no need for safes and bolts on doors i have told you he trusted people father james did it wouldnt have occurred to him that this house might be invaded the way it was sadly enough thats often the case rutledge answered her its one reason why housebreakersand the likehe added hastilyare often successful but i have no authority here mrs wainer except to assure the bishop that everything possible is being done to find father jamess murderer and how pray could you hope to assure the bishop of that when you havent lifted a finger toward setting inspector blevins on the right track her eyebrows rose and she regarded him with a scornful expression the yard rutledge began but she was not interested in the politics of the yard or its role outside london like bryony in norwich she was concerned only with finding a reason for an otherwise incomprehensible crime he had disappointed her and her face let him know it making amends as best he could rutledge said you tell me that goodness makes enemies can you give me the names of anyone who might have had a reason to harm father james dont be daft if i could have made such a list id have handed it over to inspector blevins and i never heard father james speak ill of anyone he had a way with him listening to what was said to him considering what was to be done for the best and good man that he was he always looked for the best in people but he didnt always find it there are some that are twofaced smiling and agreeable under your eye but meanspirited and venomous behind your back he knew that just as any good policeman should her views on the failings of human nature met with approval from hamish he said aye a man owed my grandfather money and said he couldna pay it back his business was sae puir but it wasna true he was hiding the profits rutledge said you were in this house every day going about your duties how did father james behave those last weeks as he always had or could you see that he was worried preoccupied for the first time he caught a glimpse of fear in her eyes it was unexpected as if she had locked it away and didnt want to bring it into the light mrs wainer was silent for a moment then answered id find his bed not slept in some mornings and hed often be standing at the kitchen window by the back garden looking out the tea already made as if he hadnt been able to rest that last morning he turned a surprised face to me when i came in at my usual hour as if hed lost track of the time was there a problem in the parish that kept him awake if there was it never reached my ears but hed been to the doctors several times to my certain knowledge and i was beginning to wonder if he was illa cancer or some such and it was on his mind a local man dr stephenson yes its all i could think of that father must have been given bad news i waited for him to confide in me but he never did and then he was killed god rest his soul and i couldnt help but think as they put him into the ground hell not have to worry any more about the cancer did he show signs of being ill coughingcomplaining of paintaking medications you hadnt seen before no id have come right out and asked him then it was justi dont knowjust a feeling that he was sorely troubled i asked him the first time i found him standing in the kitchen if there was anything on his mind and he said no ruth im well but there was something wrong he wasnt himself something on his conscience then she gave him a stern and heavy look priests like father james dont have evil on their conscience id as soon believe that my own son was wicked and him a respectable bank clerk in london chapter just past the first turning for water street rutledge saw the small board indicating dr stephensons surgery on impulse he pulled over and stopped left the car out in front and rang the bell it would do no harm to confirm or deny ruth wainers fears a woman admitted him her apron crisp and her hair tightly pulled back into a small knot it gave her face a severity that was belied by the kind eyes rutledge gave his name and asked to speak to the doctor his surgery is closed for the afternoon it isnt a medical matter it concerns a police investigation he showed her his identification she considered him uncertain what to do finally as rutledge smiled at her she said doubt heavy in her voice hes in his office writing up a patients record to send to london if i let you go in you wont keep him long will you the post wont wait he was taken to dr stephensons private door down the passage and admitted into the small office where the doctor sat at his desk papers spread around him he looked up saw rutledge behind his nurse and said i dont have hours today have you told him that connie it isnt a medical matter rutledge said its police business ive been sent down by scotland yard the yard is it stephenson said giving his visitor his full attention oh very well i can spare you five minutes no more he put the cap on his pen and sat back in his chair locking his fingers together and stretching his arms in front of him he was a brisk man rutledge thought but not cold and he appeared to be competent for his eyes examined his visitor openly and behind the short neat beard his mouth twitched with interest the nurse withdrew closing the door and stephenson said you dont look well you know he gestured toward a wing chair it isnt surprising i was shot some weeks ago in the line of duty rutledge nodded that explains it then you still carry that shoulder a little higher as if its stiff what brings you to osterley this business about father james ive been asked to reassure father jamess bishop that everything that can be done has been done in the matter of the priests death then you should be speaking to inspector blevins not to me on the contrary the questions i have to ask are medical rutledges glance moved from the prints hanging on the blue walls to the bookcase stuffed with medical treatises and texts stephenson pointedly shuffled his papers if you are asking me in some roundabout fashion to tell you which of my patients was likely to have committed murder i cant help you id have gone straight to blevins if id had even the faintest suspicion that one of them could have been responsible rutledge smiled the patient im inquiring about is father james himself you were his physician and ive been told that he had something on his mind shortly before his death his housekeeper believes that he might have been seriously ill and was keeping it from her if it wasnt his health that troubled him then we have another avenue to explore if it was we can close that door i dont see how his state of mind will help you find the thief who killed him but i can assure you that father james was as healthy as a horse save for a few bouts of sore throat now and again bad tonsils but never serious enough to require more than a box of lozenges for the soreness they worked well enough most of the time and yet he came here to see you several times in the weeks before he died theres nothing surprising about that religion and medicine walk hand in hand as often as not i confer with the priest or the vicar as frequently as i summon the undertaker people grieving or in pain or frightened need comforting and thats the role of the church when medicine has done all it can rutledge let a silence fall it expressed nothing but stevenson seemed to read into it a refusal to accept his offhand remarks after a moment the doctor added but youre right the last time or two it wasnt an illness that brought him herehis or a parishioners he wanted to ask me about a patient of mine man named baker father james had been to see him just before he died afterward he began to wonder about bakers state of mind at the end far as i know it was clear and coherent i saw no reason to believe otherwise and i was in attendance one of father jamess flock actually no i suppose thats what lay behind his questions although father james didnt go into the matter baker was staunch church of england but he wanted to be shriven by a catholic priest as well as his own vicar and his family humored him father james to his credit attended even though it was one of the nastiest nights id seen in a year or more a few hours later herbert baker died of natural causesi can vouch for thatand his will was quite straightforward as a matter of fact id been asked to witness it some years back none of bakers children has complained about it as far as i know there was no reason to feel any concern and i told father james that and yet you tell me he spoke to you again about baker the doctor picked up his pen indicating that he wanted to get back to his own work i just explained what happened there was some confusion the night this patient was dying baker insisted he wanted a priest the one from st annes but it was the vicar who sat beside the old man when he breathed his last close on to three in the morning father james had already gone back to the rectory having spent no more than half an hour with the patient i grant you that it wasnt the usual sort of thing but then ive sat by enough deathbeds myself to know that theres no accounting sometimes martin baker sent for a priest to give his father ease rightly so what do you think was resting so heavily on herbert bakers conscience rutledge asked the question conversationally as if out of simple curiosity i expect it was no more than some youthful indiscretion baker had been sexton at holy trinity for many years and he may not have relished spoiling the vicars good opinion of him just at the end ive known more than one case where a mans wild oats came back to haunt him on his deathbed i shouldnt think that father jamesan experienced priest from all ive heardwould be overly concerned about a young mans wild oats father james often surprised me with the breadth of his concern for people there was compassion to spare for any lost sheep i found it admirable in him the doctor uncapped his pen ive given you far more than your five minutes this is pressing the report im writing i have a patient in hospital in london facing surgery it cant wait just two other questions if you will did anyone to your knowledge hold a grudge against father james he wasnt that kind of man his predecessor was autocratic and while everyone respected him there was little love for him father james on the other hand was a reasonable clearthinking individual who took his duties to heart but was never oppressive about it i wasnt one of his parishioners but i am told he preached a fine homily in a voice that made the rafters sing i understand father james was a chaplain at the front and was sent home early with severe dysentery yes it was chronic and the army surgeon was of the opinion he would be dead in a month if he wasnt sent home decent water decent food and bed rest saw him right enough father james wasnt happy to be sent home he wanted to serve there was a father holston in norwich who set him right again by telling him that god not father james decided where he could serve best which oddly enough came true in the influenza epidemic he was my right hand id have lost twice the number of patients without his dedication seemed to have the constitution of an iron man i can tell you rutledge thanked stephenson and stood up to leave as he walked to the door he turned and asked when did baker die before or after the autumn fete at st annes a day or two after the bazaar as i recall the vicar said something about the timing of the stormthat it was a blessing it hadnt struck earlier now thats all i have to say to you good afternoon hamish grumbled as rutledge walked out of the surgery if it wasna his health that worried yon priest before his death and this man baker didna weigh unduly on his mind what kept him awake at night was it yon fair at the kirk yes i was wondering about that myself sometimes people come a long distance to attend these affairs if they have any sort of reputation for good food and good entertainment people travel far to funerals as well i think the bazaar is a more likely choice father james didnt officiate at bakers servicesthe vicar would have done that looking around him at the town of osterley where a watery and inconsistent sunlight was reflected from the flint walls rutledge found himself thinking that he would be on his way back to london tomorrow back to the letters lying unopened in the desk drawer in his sitting room away from the smell of the marshes and the call of gulls overhead he answered absently the local police will know more about such evidence than i do but would they whatever lay at the core of this murder whether it was theft or a killing with a purpose someone appeared to have covered his tracks very well was he cleveror merely lucky hamish said for a man who willna be involved with this death you ask a good many questions there was a taunt behind the simple words rutledge said no ive merely tried to be sure that the good bishops fears are unfounded but was that really true in rutledges experience investigations often floundered when the police failed to ask the right question or failed to look behind the most obvious evidence at what could have been overshadowed by it damning connections grew out of persistence connections that at first glance were not even visible most mistakes were made by the human elementthe refusal to be objective an old sergeant at the yard had told him once at the start of his own career when the police look for guilt theres always enough to serve their purpose nobody is free of guilt but if you search for the truth now thats a different tale what was intriguing about this case was the reaction of those who were close to father james they ignored the theft and believed that nothing short of a greek tragedy could explain this murder the assumption that the death of great men grew out of cataclysmic events it was implicit in their denial of the facts even though a small sum was stolen it had nothing to do with the actual crime but what if it had a life was not always given its real value hamish said aye but what if this killer only hunts priests and theres another one in jeopardy now neither theft nor greek tragedy but madness rutledge raised his eyes to look up at the church standing high above the road and wondered how such a killer would choose his next victim or if he had already killed before since the osterley police station was no more than a few doors from the doctors surgery rutledge left his motorcar where it was and walked there the sign was still up and he started to turn away intent on the drive back to norwich but there was the sound of a voice somewhere inside and he hesitated then reached for the knob thinking he might find someone with whom he could leave a courtesy message for inspector blevins he stepped into a scene of chaos a huge man had been pushed against his will into a chair that faced the sergeants rough wooden desk and two constables were attempting to hold him down on the seat while he bellowed at an inspector listening to his curses with an expression of distaste a sergeant stood at the inspectors shoulder the constables turned to see who had come through the door glanced back at their inspector and in that instant of distraction loosened their grip on the massive shoulders the inspector glared at rutledge demanding what do you want and then savagely ordered franklin watch what youre doing damn it inspector rutledge scotland yard the man in the chair surged to his feet like a whale breaching hamish yelled a warning and rutledge hastily leaped aside the enormous man broke away from the constables and lunged toward the door one shoulder ramming into rutledge and sending piercing swords of fire through his body he gasped for breath the pain nearly doubling him over but thrust out a foot instinctively managing to trip up the man and then to dodge his thundering fall everyone was shouting at once the clamor was deafening the constables were on the man like monkeys and blevins breathing hard swore again dont stand there sergeant give them a hand as his sergeant an older man jumped into the fray without much effect blevins added at the top of his lungs hit him if you have to the wildly struggling man went limp as something struck him on the head with a solid thud of flesh against flesh a fist rutledge leaning back against the wall was trying hard to breathe normally again dizzy with the effort the sergeant calling angrily to the constables to hold on leaned over his desk to fumble for handcuffs between them the four men managed to haul their dazed captive to his feet and out of the room toward the rear of the station as the prisoner regained his senses rutledge could hear his rising bellows and the thumps of his heavy boots as he kicked out at his captors or the walls whatever was in reach blevins walked back into the room rubbing his thigh with his fist damned ox rutledge did you say from the yard what do they want is it about the priests murder as rutledge nodded blevins bent to pick up papers that had fallen from the desk to the floor he added well youre just in time he jerked his head toward the rear of the station where the protests and curses marked the location of a holding cell thats our man at least theres every likelihood it is he was the strong man at the bazaar quite an act pulling a line of carriages against a team of horses picking up a bench with two young ladies seated at either end defying ordinary men to lift his iron weights very popular with the young people engaging personality they tell me names walsh it had been simple theft after all what connects him with the priest rutledge felt like hell his mind refusing to function while his lungs burned circumstantial evidence so far mrs wainer was quite put out when she found walsh wandering about in the rectory on the day of the bazaar lookinghe saidfor water to wash up she sent him away with a flea in his ear fortunately later on she remembered what had happened and told sergeant jennings and when the police in swaffham caught up with him at a fair there he had a new cart for his gear weve just brought him in as a matter of fact nothing suspicious in a new cart surely the fire was subsiding it was paid for two days after the priest was killed with bits and pieces of bills and coin blevins gestured to the chair vacated so abruptly by the strong man then sat himself down behind the sergeants desk there was a cut on the heel of his hand and he stared at it then at the bloody stain spreading on his cuff damn the bastard teeth like steel traps rutledge took the chair his chest was settling into a dull ache now gingerly testing he took a deep breath and felt nothing beyond the usual resistance but the memory of the pain was still fierce the sort of money a bazaar takes in yes but surely the kind of thing his act brings in as well blevins glared at him look were just at the beginning of this business ive got men asking questions at the smithy where the new cart was built to see when it was ordered ive got men asking questions about walshs movements the day of the festival here as well as the night father james was killed a man that size cant slink around without being noticed half the county force has been given to me for the duration to track the killer down a local lord has even put up a reward for information leading to an arrest father james was well liked were doing the best we can rutledge rejoined peaceably yes i can see that you seem to have the investigation well in hand bishop cunningham was alarmed enough to ask the yard to see if there was anything we could do monsignor holston will be glad of the news that someones in custody i suppose he will blevins rubbed his eyes tiredly he was a friend of father jamess do you want the truth this is the first reasonable lead weve found and if he didnt kill the priestwalsh i meanwhy did he put up such a fight here and in swaffham because hamish pointed out the man might well have other secrets to keep unrelated to murder rutledge said then you dont want me underfoot ill return to london and leave you to it he had already been planning to do just that but now there was an unexpected sense that he had somehow failed the people who had turned to him for answers this arrest wouldnt bring them peace hamish said they were wrongbryony and mrs wainer and monsignor holston it wasna a greek tragedy that brought walsh here only a new cart blevins was staring thoughtfully at rutledge debating something on his mind then to rutledges surprise he said id take it as a favor inspector if you stayed on a day or two at least until weve had an opportunity to look into matthew walsh the strong man he used the words with irony then meticulously straightened the stained green blotter before adding ive felt a good deal of anger over this business i was one of father jamess parishioners you see im not certain im detached enough to do my job properly to judge walshs innocence as well as his guilt have you spoken to the chief constable he tells me that it isnt a question of my feelings blevins interrupted its a simple matter of the facts well i ask you how am i to judge the facts in this murder case when id cheerfully watch the bastard who did it hanged you must have known father james fairly well what was he like middleaged but he went out to france all through the somme he was there ministering to any man who needed him of any faith even hindus for all i know you could come and sit down in his tent and talk i mean talk he considered rutledge in the war were you rutledge nodded i wondered when i saw you flinch just now thought it might be an old wound caught wrong well then you know what im trying to say half of us were scared of dying and the other half knew we were already deadthere was no hope of getting through it but i never once heard father james say it was duty what we owed to england or any of that other he broke off and grinned sheepishly as he remembered where he was he never treated us like fools instead hed help us pray for courage i was never much of a praying man until the somme no more than was required of me at any rate father james taught us to pray for strength to see us through whatever came our way it was all that saved me sometimes walking into no mans land in a hail of fire my guts would turn to water id shake so the rifle jerked in my hands and id pray loud enough to hear myself i wasnt the only one either no rutledge had heard men pray in such straits an odd mixture of pleading and defiance sometimes trying to bargain for their lives hed done it himself until the prayer had turned to begging for release blevins shook his head well thats the kind of man father james was and some bloody coward strikes him down for a few pounds all that goodall that kindness and compassionwiped out for a bloody handful of coins he waited for a response watching rutledge there was nothing in his face to show how he felt but his eyes pleaded hamish observed yons a worried man i dont see why i shouldnt stay until youre satisfied rutledge answered slowly bowles had after all given him a few days in which to carry out his original orders and the bishop would never complain of thoroughness theres a hotel here in osterley not up to london standards perhaps but itll suit you well enough the woman who runs it is pleasant and the food is good ill call round later to see if you need anything best to let walsh calm down before we try to talk to him rutledge heard dismissal in blevinss voice the inspector also needed to calm down rutledge thought hamish agreeing said hes no a bad policeman if he sees his own weakness standing rutledge said i left my luggage in norwich ill go back there tonight and drive up tomorrow id also like to have a look at father jamess study if you dont mind before we talk to walsh mrs wainer will see to it i dont think shes opened that door twice since it happened no doubt pretends the study and the bedroom dont exist anymore she took it very hard father jamess death blamed herself for not staying on until hed come back for his dinner but thats always the way isnt it hindsight yes its common enough rutledge thanked him and left he drove back to the outskirts of norwich to the hotel there and left a message with sergeant gibson at the yard that he was staying over within half an hour frances telephoned him to see how he was managing and to pass on the good news that a mutual friend had just given birth to a daughter mother and child doing well father recovering she had always managed to pry information out of gibson the crusty old sergeant was apparently water in her hands there was still an hour before dinner and rutledge sat down in the most comfortable chair in his room and shut his eyes against the lamplight his chest ached with a vengeance and he could feel the waves of exhaustion that swept him too strong to allow him peace too much driving too much strain on the stillhealing flesh but it had been worth it away from london he found he was free of that obsessive need to appear to be unchanged by what had happened to him in scotland here no one knew his past or cared about his future rest seemed to elude him his body tense with pain and yet at some point he slept the quiet in the room giving way to the sound of battle the distant roar of artillery the chatter of machine guns cutting down the men struggling across no mans land the rain that beat against the windows in a sudden squall became mud underfoot slippery black he went down unsure whether hed been shot or lost his footing he lay there unable to find the will to rise again hoping he was dying corporal macleods voice was shouting at him asking if hed been hit he scrambled to his feet wondering why his chest felt heavy wondering when there had been time to bandage it it was hard to breathe as he ran calling to his men his eye on the barricaded hole where the hun gunners lay hidden he could hear the thump of bullets all around him the screams of the wounded the prayers and cries of angry terrified men his men he couldnt reach the gunners he couldnt get within rangethe spotters had given him the wrong coordinates it was a slaughter and he couldnt get to the gunners and then a wellhidden snipers rifle fired and somehow he heard it over the din of battle and it fired again and at the third shot for a mercy the machine gun nest fell silent chapter rutledge ate dinner in the quiet little restaurant attached to the hotel most of the other diners were local people and he belatedly remembered thinking about it that it was saturday evening the hats of the ladies lacked style but were worn with pride and the suits of the younger men were prewar illfitting as if the weight lost in whatever theater theyd served hadnt been regained couples chatted selfconsciously keeping their voices low and falling silent from time to time as though they had no idea what to say to each other fourfive years of war left gaps in their lives that would be slow to mend he wondered what jean had to say to her canadian diplomat how long even she had known him not that it mattered as the door from the lounge bar opened rutledge looked up in that brief instant he thought he recognized the man standing by the hearth drinking down what appeared to be a scotch and water but when the door opened again the man was gone it was the same man hed seen bringing in the boat at the osterley quay he was nearly sure of it edwin his name was the hotels food was simple but well cooked carrot soup roast mutton and potatoes with a side dish of cabbage and onions and an apple tart to finish with only hamish for company rutledges mind unbidden returned to the murder of father james why is it he found himself thinking that there has to be meaning in an unforeseen death all of nature kills without compunction why should everyman die with a fanfare of trumpets like another hamlet in london he rutledge had seen his share of wanton murder where life had been snuffed out callously and yet father jamess friends had searched for purpose in his death as if this somehow provided a legacy hamish with relish reminded him that there was no longer a case if yon strong man is the murderer its no your duty to finish the investigation rutledge heard him and even agreed but he was not satisfied if he was guilty walshs motive had been theft to pay for his new cart and father james most certainly would have recognized him even in a dark room the sheer size of the man would have given him away that alone might have turned father james toward the window to call for help on the other side of the coin if walsh had been startled to find someone walking into the study he couldnt have guessed that the priest was not likely to press charges cornered he would have tried to protect himself as best he could and once the crucifix was in his hand it was a very small frantic step to using it a frightened man looking for a way out what would mrs wainer have to say to that or monsignor holston even inspector blevins with his man apparently safely tucked away in a cell had asked rutledge to stay on in osterley why by the time rutledge had reached his dessert he had come to realize that each of father jamess defenders had spread over the indignity and degradation of murder a cloak of tragedy but even their vision of that cloak was different what was it about this priests death that made everyone wary of the simple truth or made the simple truth a very odd choice what had they failed to tell their visitor from scotland yard hamish interrupted him to ask why a protestant in apparently good standing with his own pastor would suddenly demand to see a different oneand one outside his own faith it was not something that set well with his covenanters view of things come to that he persisted why would father james feel concerned about that dying protestants mental stability rutledge was moving on to the lounge for his tea in a quiet corner where the bay window looked out over the dark gardens he discovered that he was staring at his own reflection in the uneven twohundredyearold glass it distorted his features giving him a sinister look but mercifully the chair had been set at an angle the reflection of rutledges right shoulder masked by the shadows of the velvet drapes and there was no way to tell if there was anyone standing behind him a shiver ran through him and he turned away from the window even the teacup in his hands couldnt warm the coldness that had touched himwhat if the chair had been placed only another few inches one way or the other and he had stared without warning into a bloody and accusing face hamish prodded again the voice just out of rutledges line of sight still shaken it took him several minutes to answer confession was a sacrament in the catholic church the stricture on silence was not as strong in the church of england if there had been something on the old mans conscience something serious enough for confession to ease his dying he might well have chosen not to tell his own vicar as dr stephenson himself had pointed out sims knew the familythe wife if there was one the children instead baker might have turned to a priest who not only was bound by secrecy but had no close ties with the survivors i canna see it makes sae great a difference unless the truth would prevent baker from lying in consecrated ground that was something rutledge hadnt considered he wouldna fash himsel oer small sins hamish continued and i canna think whatever it was weighed sae heavily on his conscience if he carried it about wi him to auld age rutledge agreed nothing so common as infidelity or an unpaid debt would send father james to the doctor to ask questions about bakers sanity and a man confessing to a sin even to a crime long forgotten by everyone else would present no question of conscience for the priest a dying man was past trying in a court of law justice after a fashion had been done father james had spoken of the dead mans will what if one of the inheriting children had no right to the family name aye that hamish answered his thought would be a serious matter or had another name that had been kept hidden for a lifetime was that the secret the dying man wanted to impart to father james to leave behind a record of a childs true heritage was it that responsibility that had kept the priest pacing the rectory floor at night surely he might have felt he owed some duty there if it was a confession father james wouldnt have spoken of it to monsignor holston he was bound by his vows not to tell anyone even another priest or even to seek comfort in his own quandary but monsignor holston might have been aware of some distraction of a heavy burden that was never brought into the open it was an interesting dilemma what to do about a confessed sin and where there was a will there was a solicitor who had drawn it up if there were dark secrets in the baker family perhaps he would also have a few of the answers if there were none to be found were back again to the war hamish said without enthusiasm you ken better than most what secrets soldiers bring home with them or what secrets a man might confess before battle no expecting to survive it and how to find such a needle in a haystack of returned veterans yet that same needle might have found father james nearly a year after the war had ended because hed come to a bazaar the next morning rutledge left the norwich hotel and drove back to osterley hamish battering at the back of his mind rutledge hadnt slept deeply the night before unable to find a comfortable position his chest had throbbed relentlessly torn muscle overtired from fighting the wheel frances would have had his head if shed known and refusing to be eased consequently hed been subjected to a long and unpleasant interlude every time hed roused enough to turn over hamish for one reason or another had taken a dislike to the damp dreary weather and was in full form if he wasnt comparing the rounded green land of this part of norfolk to the great barren mountains and long glens of scotland he was reviewing the circumstances surrounding the death of father james or mulling over the conversation with monsignor holston or inspector blevins awake rutledge was unable to let down his guard asleep pain found him again in an endless restive circle hamish rutledge discovered he was thinking at some point was a malevolent spirit with no need for sleep this morning fighting a headache from the unpredictable shifts in subjects some of them seeming to lie in wait for him and aimed with a deadly accuracy others following the unsettled state of his own thoughts rutledge was glad to see a modicum of sunlight sifting through the overcast it seemed to foretell a lifting of the clouds in his mind hamish seemed to find it more to his liking as well as the land changed a little announcing their approach to the sea hamish unexpectedly said it isna a verra pleasant thought returning to london i canna ken why people live in cities jammed cheek by jowl like so many sheep off to market rutledge agreed his cluttered office was claustrophobic when rain ran down the sootblackened windows shutting him in with the lamplight and the musty smell of cigar smoke and wet wool when it rained old bowelss moods were as unpredictable as the shifts in hamishs trains of thought nor was he eager to return to francess watchful care his sister was a master at concealing her worry behind a light facade of humor but he knew her too well to be taken in by it he said aloud in the silence of the motorcara habit he found nearly impossible to breakill be here at least one more day it will do no harm a lorry bound from kings lynn to norwich sent an arc of muddy water across rutledges bonnet as it passed in the southbound lane he blinked as the spray washed the windscreen and left behind a dark and odiferous residue that slowly vanished in the drizzle that had resumed swallowing up the sun as he drove into the town rutledge saw people hurrying toward holy trinity bound for the service he recognized a few of the faces from his brief visit on saturday the farmer and his sons who had successfully purchased the prize ram the young woman hed seen earlier in the churchyard the barmaid at the pelican and two of the children who had been playing in water street the familiar habit of sunday worship comfortably being followed occasionally greeting a friend often looking up at the great tower that marked their destination as if already focused on the service there was something very english about it he had the odd feeling that he had come home the constable on duty in the police station informed him that inspector blevins was at mass and had left word that he would expect his london counterpart after lunch if theres a mass theres a priest hamish told rutledge as he walked back to the motorcar yes id like to see who has been sent to conduct it he turned the car and drove to st annes the watery sunlight brightened stopping in the drive beside the rectory rutledge sat back in his seat trying to ease the tense muscles in his chest massaging his upper arm near the shoulder commanding it to relax hed nearly succeeded by the time the first of the parishioners came out of the service and walked away down the street watching them he wondered which had been under suspicion before walsh had been taken into custody surely blevins had considered a good many of them before the investigation had widened in a few moments monsignor holston stepped out of st annes and stood by the door speaking to each family as they left the service rutledge watching could see that monsignor holston knew a number of them and found a brief word even for those he didnt for a scholarly man the priest had a remarkably affable manner with people inspector blevins in the middle of a group stopped to make several remarks and the priests face lighted a little but there was doubt in his expression as he turned his head to follow blevins and his family as they walked on a trio of elderly women dressed in black and very eager to take monsignor holstons hand in their turn brought up the rear of the procession of people he reassured each woman bending to hear what the eldest stooped and leaning on a cane had to say but in the end he shook his head hamish said he doesna know who will replace father james i have a feeling the bishop may wait until the police have finished their job as the women moved off down the path monsignor holston turned to go back into the sanctuary and then saw rutledge for the first time hailing him rutledge got out of the car and strode toward the church well met the priest said come and talk to me while i change out of my robes rutledge joined him at the door i see you were sent here to conduct the service does this mean the bishop has made no decision about father jamess successor or are you taking up residence now the bishops biding his time i think he prefers to wait until theres some news about the killer not wanting to be seen to be filling father jamess shoes with unwarranted haste but he cant leave it much longer there are needs here that i cant meet coming only for a day and most of all its a need for continuity a sense of order having been restored they went into the sanctuary together and down an aisle this is a very lovely church you know monsignor holston gestured to the stark simplicity surrounding them father james used to say that it was stripped of all pretension down to the bare bones of faith architecturally thats quite true and i think he carried that message through into his pastoring here but this is a dying parish theres no work for the young people here along the coast the bishop should find a young priest with energy and ideals to fill father jamess shoes one who might reach them before they wander off to work in norwich or kings lynn or peterborough you could see for yourself how many of those present this morning were over forty yes i had noticed is this considered advice or an offering to the gods to keep you safely in norwich opening the vestry door monsignor holston smiled yes theres that i dont mind coming here for the services i just dont have a fancy for staying i should think with walshs capture that much of the strain would begin to dissipate to soften the remark rutledge added although that will take time im sure monsignor holston shook his head theres still something in that househe gestured toward the unseen rectorythat would keep me awake at night the coffin door knocker for one it was said lightly the smile returned that was a bit of whimsy on some victorian priests part a reminder that dust to dust is everyones fate he took off his robes and laid them carefully in the small black case on the table after a moment he said i was surprised to see you still here inspector i had thought youd go back to london duty done i had every intention of going rutledge answered but inspector blevins has asked me to stay on a day or two until they are sure that this man walsh is the one they want they only brought him in yesterday and theres still a great deal to find out about his movements monsignor holston nodded blevins spoke to the bishop last night early days was what he said but i think hes very hopeful bishop cunningham asked to be kept informed blevins would also like to see this ended rutledge paused watching monsignor holston as he added the consecrated wafers to his case and closed the lid as they walked out the vestry door into a spreading patch of sunlight he said im just going to the hotel to see about a room will you join me for lunch monsignor holston sighed id like that very much but i have to be back in norwich for a service tonight if youre here next sunday ill accept if im still here rutledge agreed where did you leave your motorcar behind the rectory look if you are staying on here will you keep me apprised of the situation im sure inspector blevins will have his hands full andid appreciate it yes i will and monsignor holston was gone hurrying around the apse into the churchyard lifting a hand in farewell as he disappeared in the direction of the rectory hamish said he left with indecent haste yes i dont know what hes afraid of but monsignor holston is a man looking over his shoulder he wanted me to come inside with him because he didnt want to be in that church alone at a guess id say hes not sure the evidence against walsh will stand aye hamish said thoughtfully therere ghosts there but of his making or are they real i wish i knew rutledge answered walking back to his own motorcar the osterley hotel had once been grander when the town was closer to the sea now it offered comfort to what travelers there were and to families and merchants staying for market day rutledge thought it might also be the only lodging within several miles where townspeople could put up guests the hotel stood on water street where the road ran along the quay and was built of the ubiquitous flint three stories with windows looking out over the marshes or onto a courtyard at the side of the building where carriages and motorcars could be left the woman who came to the desk as he entered was nearing fifty he thought her graying hair tidily pulled back into a soft knot at the nape of her neck clear gray eyes met his when he asked for a room for the night for several days he said she nodded pleased theres a nice view of the sea from number seventeen if you have keen eyesight she added with a smile what brings you to osterley we dont get many holidaymakers this time of year a matter of business he said pleasantly when did the sea recede not in my lifetime the early years of the last century though they say that the storms since are eroding the beaches again and we might see the water return within the next ten or twenty years that would be nice there was more hope than certainty in her voice we serve breakfast at seven later if you prefer it and if youll be in to luncheon wed like to know its generally served at half past twelve dinner is from seven to nine then the cook wants to go home you can also find a meal at the pelican when were closed thats the pub at the end of the quay she was leading him up stairs that had been painted a soft green to match the carpet running down the center of the firstfloor passage a line of photographs in goldtrimmed oak frames had been hung along the walls and he saw that they were early photographs showing osterley when it still managed to attract a few bathers dark and faded but fascinating as history victorian women in black silk gowns and bonnets strolling by the sea with black silk parasols shading their faces from the sun small boats coming in to the quay in deeper water than existed now and a fisherman proudly displaying his catch his cap at a jaunty angle there was a very early photograph of a coaster unloading freight boxes and bales and barrels just beyond the pelican and next to that children forming a ring of curious faces around a pair of seals on the strand their sleek wet heads cocked in wary uncertainty in this one the marshes were a thickening line of reeds and grasses more prominent to the east leaving the western side of the narrowing harbor as a last sacrifice to the encroaching silt noticing rutledges interest she said my grandfather took those avid photographer with a keen eye for such things he was lucky with the sealsthey dont come this far south very often she stopped before number seventeen and opened the door it was a bright room flooded with light from a double pair of windows large well furnished with a bedstead of mahogany wood a dresser with a mirror and a clothespress that matched a painted washstand stood in the corner two comfortable chairs framed a table under the first pair of windows and a desk was set under the second the finest room in the house hamish murmured im mrs barnett she told rutledge if im not in the office im in the kitchen or out to do the marketing leave a note if you cant find me i will thank you do you care for luncheon today as its sunday the pelican is closed youll have to drive inland some distance if thats no trouble we have one other guest at the moment and shes staying in not a very agreeable morning for exploring the countryside but i think it will clear by afternoon she cast one last glance around the room nodded and closed the door rutledge went to the windows and looked out from the first floor he could indeed see the water a thin line of waves curling in gleaming dully and a flight of birds rising from the shingle strand the hummocky marshy ground filling the harbor from the headland to his left as far as the great hook of land that served as a natural breakwater on his right appeared to be threaded with footwide rivulets of no great depth as well as the little stream that was all that remained of the harbor having seen the photographs in the passage he realized that the buildings that had once served the seashops selling ships stores fish markets taverns yardshad long since been turned to other uses he had noticed one sporting a sign proclaiming a branch of the wildfowl trust another had become a smithycumgarage hamish said i ken the sea taking a mans livelihood storms scour the coast of scotland men drown ships are lost its a hard life but here they turned their hands to other things i expect norfolk is sheep country or people simply moved on those with a skill to offer somewhere else for a time he stood there simply enjoying the view his windows open to the cry of the seagulls and the light breeze that was rapidly clearing the rain out but the air here was fresh and clean a tang of salt in it the houses and shops seemed richly colored in the warming sunlight their flint and brick walls holding the very character of norfolk many of the streets of this village now looked inland as if growing accustomed to accommodating the missing sea but water street still ran toward it and then turned when it reached the quay the pale line of water out beyond the ridges of grass seemed to lack the energy to find a way back a wan lover with no real passion for a reunion hamish said no one remembers when the storms brought the sea inland i wouldna hae wanted to live here then which was rutledge thought a perceptive remark he noticed an elderly man in a small boat rowing up the stream heading in to osterley he rowed smoothly back bent arms moving from long practice in the even easy strokes of someone brought up on the water muscles bulged where the sleeves of his darned sweater had been rolled back to the elbows and the heavy corduroys he wore were well worn watching him pull for the quay rutledge realized suddenly that he envied the man drawn to the water as he himself was though the harbor had vanishedeven most of the little boats themselvesthe gulls ever hopeful could be heard heading toward the lonely rower or wheeling just out of sight above the hotelas if searching the marshy silt for the next wave lacking a boat he wondered if it was safe to walk down to the distant beach or if there was a track he could follow he straightened and brought his mind back to the present his suitcase was in the boot he would have to fetch it the tips of the fingers on one hand absently massaged his chest too much driving had aggravated the blow hed received yesterday damn the man walsh but it hadnt been his fault rutledge had been in the wrong place looking at his watch rutledge realized that it was nearly twentyfive after twelve his baggage could wait he washed his hands in the basin and dried them on a towel embroidered with an ohosterley hotelringed with blue forgetmenots the room was scrupulously clean and in good order mrs barnett was conscientious about her guests comfort down the passage he heard another door open and then close the carpet muffled footsteps the other guest he wasnt in the mood for conversation he waited for a count of twenty opened then shut his own door and followed down the passage and the stairs the french doors to the right of the lobby stood open now and there was a long dining room with some twenty tables covered in white cloths with green serviettes but only two by the long windows had been set for the meal farther down the room a woman with a book open in front of her was already spooning her soup all he could see was the top of her dark head rutledge took his own place with his back to her and looked out the windows here there was no verandah with white painted chairs waiting for people to sit in them and watch the water those belonged to the south coast of england where the sun shone with more warmth and regularity flowers nearly withered in the october winds stood in boxes by the door a few were still colorful in the brief shelter of the wall the dining room with its ornate glass chandeliers was very pleasant once it must have been filled with guests with a large staff to see to them now it appeared to be only mrs barnett who served the meals she came through the swinging doors from the kitchen carrying a tray with his soup on it and a basket of fresh bread with a smile she served him and was gone not lingering to talk it was excellent soup a mutton stock with vegetables and barley he ate with relish feeling hungry hamish at the back of his mind was occupied with the street outside there were quite a few people about their shadows barely visible in the pale sunlight but there was a patch of blue sky to the north growing steadily larger rutledge saw blevins walk past lifting his hat to a young woman who held a shy little girl by the hand a heavyshouldered man who looked more like a blacksmith than a farmer or fisherman his hands gnarled and ingrained permanently with black was talking to a thin man with the pale face of a schoolmaster three laborers awkward in their sunday best and deep in conversation made way for a dray pulled by a farm gray it passed them in a rumble of wheels and disappeared around the bend a welldressed man about sixtyfive years of age passed through the outer door and opened the inner door to the lobby his footsteps could be heard approaching the dining room and he came through the french doors with an air of command that matched the craggy power of his face susan he called after a moment mrs barnett appeared in the kitchen doorway and something in her eyes instantly altered as she saw who had come to dine she walked forward slowly her expression a careful blank rutledge keeping his attention fixed on the last of his soup couldnt avoid hearing the ensuing exchange im in town for the afternoon and felt sure you could accommodate me for luncheon today my lord it isnt possibletheres no table made up yes yes i know i should have called ahead but i didnt expect to be delayed beyond an hour now ill be lucky to get away in three he looked around ill join that gentleman by the window shall i and save you the fuss of preparing a place for me his eyes swept the room again empty but for the two hotel guests and then came back to rutledge crossing to the table he said may i join you sir it would spare mrs barnett a good deal of inconvenience if you allowed me to share your table behind his broad back mrs barnett grimaced rutledge said the question i think is whether mrs barnett can manage in the kitchen if she can then i shall be happy to have you join me susan she nodded with what grace she could muster rutledge wondered if it was her own luncheon that would appear on the extra plate thats settled then the man declared as she went to fetch plates and cutlery he pulled out the chair opposite rutledge and said sedgwick is my name i live in east sherham not far from osterley but a long way to drive home for my lunch a guest here are you he settled heavily in his chair rutledge they shook hands over the silver salt and pepper shakers for a few days on a private matter yes thats what brings most of our visitors these days business not pleasure i understand the town was once quite famous for fish and the fine bathing he looked up as mrs barnett set his place and then brought his bowl of soup from the tray thank you my dear and dont stand on ceremony mr rutledge has finished his soup hes ready for the next course as she set the bowl in front of sedgwick her eyes met rutledges he had the distinct impression that she would have enjoyed nothing more than pouring the lot over sedgwicks head ill wait rutledge told her and she left them sedgwick ate with gusto im famished he said between spoonsful it has been a long morning and i breakfasted shortly after six is that your motorcar i saw in the hotel yard the fourseater yes it must be my younger son bought one like it a year before the war found it an admirable motor made the run from london in excellent time and never gave him any trouble he smiled wryly im at the mercy of gout myself dont fancy driving when my foot is aching like a fiend in hell the conversation moved on from motors to unemployment and then to some discussion of the peace treaty that had been signed is it worth the paper it was written on i ask you the french were vindictive as hell and the hun is too proud to live long under their heel sedgwick shook his head answering his own question politicians are the very devil foolish idealists like wilson in america or shortsighted and closedminded like that lot in paris mrs barnett served them roasted ham and a side dish of carrots and potatoes seasoned with onions still steaming from the ovens as she rearranged the salt and pepper to accommodate the various dishes she asked sedgwick if he cared for hot mustard sauce he smiled and helped himself from the silver bowl she held for him then sighed i dont think anyone can match mrs barnetts mustard sauce she wont tell me how she makes it and so i try to remember which days shes likely to serve it youll find it excellent as she moved away after serving the sauce to rutledge sedgwick added know the broads well do you ive come here a time or two a friend kept a boat west of here but that was before the war hes not up to sailing these days ronald had been gassed at ypres the damp ravaged his lungs now never been much for the sea myself but one of my sons was fond of boats and took us out a time or two he smiled sheepishly not the stomach for it if you want the truth sedgwick was an engaging man the sort of englishman who could spend half an hour with a stranger without fear of encroachment on either side which told rutledge watching the sharp eyes beneath the gray shaggy brows that he was not what he seemed by the end of the meal rutledge had his man pegged his accent was oxonian his voice well modulated his conversation that of a gentleman but he still had occasional trouble with his aitches london roots and not the west end in spite of the heavy gold watch fob the elegant signet ring on the left hand and apparel that had been made by the best tailors in oxford street as they finished their flan and susan barnett brought the teapot for a second cup the woman who had been sitting behind rutledge some tables away rose and walked out of the dining room sedgwick bowed politely turning his head so that his eyes followed her through the doorway an interesting young woman he said to rutledge religious sort im told she was at a dinner party given by the doctor here and spoke very well on the subject of medieval brasses it was almost condescending as if to underline rutledges thoughts sedgwick added spinster of course settling the question of where she stood in his scheme of the world indeed rutledge said watching her walk across the lobby the brief flash of a shapely ankle and the glossy dark hair above the straight back seemed at odds with sedgwicks opinion of her sedgwick excused himself after his second cup of tea and spoke to mrs barnett in the kitchen before leaving the hotel rutledge himself rose from the table dropping his serviette by his empty cup and went into the lobby there was a small sitting room beyond the stairs the door standing wide inside he could just see his fellow guest reading her book while the room was for any guests use the occupant seemed to make it clear that she did not wish for company her chair set at an angle that discouraged any greeting he turned and left the hotel to walk down the street toward the water a chill wind blew off the north sea and whipped the saw grass he could just see far out on the dunes the single boat hed watched coming in was now beached on the damp strand below the seawall with wet boot prints coming up the stone steps and leading up into the town he could follow them as cakes of gray mud flecked off at each step hamish said the priests killer wore old and worn shoes yes i hadnt forgotten the strong man walsh was wearing boots with hobnails and his feet are large aye its a thought to bear in mind chapter instead of fetching his luggage from the boot as hed planned rutledge drove to st annes rectory the mixture of watery sun clouds and drizzle that had pursued him all morning had given way to fairer skies if the sun stayed out he thought as he pulled into the short drive the day would soon be pleasantly warm a light wind riffled his hair as he went up the walk to the door and lifted the coffin knocker after a time mrs wainer came to answer the clamor and recognizing the inspector on the doorstep greeted him with noticeable relief i thought it might be someone wanting monsignor holston i hope i havent taken you from your dinner he said no ive finished do come in she said and was on the point of leading him back to the victorian parlor when he stopped her id like to see father jamess study rutledge said gently if it wouldnt be too much trouble for you she turned her head toward the stairs if you dont mind id rather not go up there just now i still find it hard she looked at rutledge again its sunday and he was always on time for his dinner and hungry having fasted theres no one to cook for now though id bought a nice bit of ham hoping monsignor holston would stay i feel at sixes and sevens there was a sadness in the words that touched rutledge well the bishop will send a new priest when hes ready it should be reassuring to know that inspector blevins has found the man responsible the housekeeper answered oh yes but her response was polite with no sense of relief only acceptance of course i told the constables the strong man had been in the house but i never dreamedhe seemedi dont know apologetic about his size afraid of bumping into anything go on if you like theres no harm can be done and maybe some good up the stairs then and the second door on your right toward the house next door hamish observed rutledge thanked her and started up becoming aware of how little noise he made on the solid treadsa muffled step a sound youd miss if you werent listening for it when hed reached the landing he turned mrs wainer was still standing by the parlor doorway unwilling to remember what lay at the top of the stairs there was an expression of deep grief on her face then she walked away down the passage as if turning her back on what he was about to do the second door to the right led into a large study with a bank of long windows covered with heavy velvet draperies that shut out the light rutledge was reminded suddenly of what monsignor holston had said that the room had spoken to him of evil whether what he sensed now was evil or not he couldnt say but the dimly lit room seemednot empty waiting hamish said it isna the corpse its been taken away but the spirit perhaps rutledge hesitated and then shutting the study door behind him crossed the carpet to pull the draperies open watching the wooden rings move smoothly down the mahogany rod with the familiar clickclicks brightness poured into the room and that odd sense of something present there was banished with the light he found that his feet were set in a scrubbed and faded portion of the carpet where someone must have tried to remove the blood that had puddled from father jamess head wound an onerous duty for the grieving woman downstairs rutledge stepped away from it then looked at it in relation to the windows if the victim had been struck down just there and from behind he must have been facing the window his back to his attacker rutledge went to test the latch and then look outalmost directly into the windows opposite where he could see an old woman in a chair knitting everyone described father james as middleaged but fit but walsh was a very large man even if help had come what could even one of the strapping sons next door have done it had taken four men at the police station to subdue walsh and by the time anyone had reached the study the priest would have been dead yet if he was as capable as all the people who knew him had claimed he was he would have abandoned any hope of aid and tried to deal with the intruder in some fashion if he wasna afraid of the man hamish said he wouldna have called for help if he was afraid hed ha kept an eye on him yes thats what id have done rutledge answered him even if he knew the intruder hed have been wary ortoo certain of his powers of persuasion here if you need the money that badly take it and go with my blessing its easier to smash the back of a headwhen theres no face staring into yours hamish pointed out with the bayonet we didna look into the face and that was also true dead center twist withdraw a belt buckle above the blade not a pair of human eyes so why had the priest turned away toward the windows rather than toward the intruder only an exceptionally trusting man would have done that look ill turn my back and let you walk out of here return the money if and when you can there are others who need it as much as you do still to say that father james must have had a very good idea who was threatening him yet how far could a frightened man trust in return had it been a calculated risk then to calm whoever stood there rather than agitate him or had his assailant said turn your back and let me go then lost his nerve rutledge listened to his intuition and heard no reply the room then he slowly turned to study it not only had the drawer been broken open the room had been ransacked if the priest had caught the intruder with the tin box pried open and the money in his hand and offered him safe passage out the door when had the room been torn apart it must have happened before father james came up the stairs but why when the locked desk drawer was the most logical place to begin a search and would have yielded the small tin box straightaway if the room had been turned upside down after the priest was dead why not take a few minutes more to search through the rest of the house the small clock in the parlorthe gold medal around the priests neck whatever other easily pocketed windfalls came to handthese had been left behind why had ten or fifteen pounds satisfied a killer if walsh needed that much to finish paying for his cart and would take nothing elsewhy kill the priest hamish said when you came in your first act was to open yon draperies rutledge looked again at the windows yes and if father james had done the same the killer would then have been presented with his back before they had even spoken to each other he examined the rest of the room one closed doorway led to the priests bedroom as he found by opening it simple furnishingsa hard single bed a wooden crucifix above the headboard and a muchused priedieu against the wall of the study an armoire between the windows and a low matching chest at the foot of the bed a chair stood beside a small bookshelf and rutledge crossed to read the titles religious texts for the most part and a collection of biographies pitt the younger disraeli william cecilthe great secretary to elizabeth the first and a selection of poetry tennyson browning matthew arnold o a manning he turned away and opened the only other door it led to a bath rutledge closed that and went back to the study here were the broken desk and a chair to one side of the passage doorway a horsehair settee with two straightbacked chairs at angles beside it faced the hearth in the corner beside the bedroom door stood the private altar the candlesticks were there polished to shine like molten sunlight but the police had taken away the crucifix used as a weapon a darker spot on the wood marked its dimensions it would have been heavy and one blow would have sufficed two at most hamish said a man could stand unseen between that altar and the wall if the room wasna lit rutledge was already looking at the space he wedged himself in it a broad man could just fit himself in there and a thin one but could walsh yon priest in norwich hamish had not liked monsignor holston perhap he canna return to the scene of his crime if hed stood in the bedroom whoever he was rutledge speculated until the priest had turned his back to attend to the drapes it would have taken the murderer a half dozen steps to close the distance between them even accounting for walshs longer strides and wary alert father james would have sensed he was coming the first blow wouldnt have hit the back of his headit would have struck him in the temple why was monsignor holston afraid in the church as well hamish persisted but rutledge was looking again at the shadows between the drapes and the altars tall back i dont know that someone would hide in a confessional after the serviceenter through the vestry door and wait for the service to end he tried to concentrate again even if the draperies had been drawn and the lamps were not lit father james couldnt have missed the signs of a search paper on the floor would have gleamed whitely even in low light and what householder would have crossed that scatter of papers and books and furnishings to go to the window his first act would probably have been to call out whos there and to stand on the threshold waiting in that case the intruder had been in the bedroom and would have had to call to the priest to lure him nearer beside the altar the slightest movement would have drawn the priests wary eyes immediately and yet the crucifix the weaponhad come from the altar not the bedroom unless the intruder had already armed himself it was a puzzle and more than a few of the pieces failed to fit rutledge went to the desk and examined the broken drawer it was savagely butchered a shard of wood still hung at an angle though someone had tried to make it appear tidy by pushing it nearly back into place he looked at the small lock mrs wainer was right hardly worthy of the effort put in to breaking it so severely unless hamish told him it was done in haste for fear of being caught he shouldnt have been caught mrs wainer had gone and the priest was usually at the church at that hour whoever it was should have had a clear run twist the evidence another way the force of the blows that killed father james a man of more than average strength driven by fear would have struck with what appeared to be savagery in an ordinary person and that pointed a finger directly at walsh the strong man the thing was only two people knew exactly what had happened here one of them was the victim unable to tell his side of the story the truth if it was to be found had to be dug out of the silence of the killer and the traces of his presence that could be read in his motive it was easy to understand why blevins was so pleased to have such a likely suspect under lock and key walsh had been in the rectory before walsh had extraordinary strength and walsh was in need of money to pay for his cart but how many inspectors had seen their early proofs slip through their fingers like sand leaving them with nothing to take before a magistrate rutledge looked around the room one last time thinking about monsignor holston rather than father james why had holston wanted the yard to take over the investigation or at the very least to supervise its progress to find out something he himself couldnt tell the police or to protect something he was afraid the local people might discover a policeman from london had no insight into the residents of osterley and could easily miss a small and seemingly insignificant bit of evidence that inspector blevins would recognize instantly but if monsignor holston died next because he had knownor guessedtoo much how quickly the investigating officers would jump to the conclusion that the connection between the two victims must be their calling and not shared knowledge a priest killermad beyond the pale kill a third priest and there would be no shadow of a doubt even if the third had been selected at random misdirectionthe sign of a clever mind hamish said but i canna think thats verra likely if theres already someone about to be charged i agree but it might explain why monsignor holston is so afraid surveying the windows again rutledge went on if it was nearly dark with no lamps burning father james might have drawn the drapes before lighting one and if the damage was done after the murder there would have been nothing to alarm the priest as he walked in here the desk drawer would have been out of his line of sight which would mean that the killer was surprised not the priest theres another way it could ha happened if the killer was waiting for the priest which puts an entirely different complexion on it doesnt it rutledge replied thoughtfully monsignor holston was right about one thing there was something odd about this murder scene it told conflicting stories about the sequence of events were the drapes openor closed was the lamp on the desk burning where had the killer been standing and when had the room been torn apart had the priest seen his killer or had he been struck down before he was aware that he was in danger had the murderer come here for the money in the deskor for something else altogether a sieve through which a defense lawyer could walk at will rutledge found mrs wainer in the kitchen staring out the window that looked out onto a stand of lilacs the back garden and beyond that to the churchyard she turned as he came in he asked her to show him where the footprint had been found and she pointed to the largest lilac bush on one side of the lawn its branches arched and then dipped nearly to a grown mans waist and there was a bare spot where the grass didnt grow just by it the shadows of the bush would have made an excellent place to watch the house rutledge asked the housekeeper if she left the lamp in the study lit when she went home each evening no not that night if thats what youre asking me and i think about it time and again i wasnt sure you see when he might be coming back and i didnt want to leave it burning untended if he was going to be very late she hesitated and then said anxiously do you suppose it made any difference no im sure it didnt a policeman makes an effort to be thorough when picturing the scene in his mind and the draperies were they left open or were they shut they were shut she replied firmly thats what i do when i leave of an evening except in the summer when theres light well past nine what did father james generally do when he came in did he walk in this way or through the door at the front of the house rutledge took a moment to look around him it was a friendly room painted a very pale green like early spring leaves and the curtains at the windows were a rose pink feminine in a way but not exclusively so had mrs wainer had a voice in choosing the colors most certainly she had a hand in its care the great iron stove was polished like rare furniture the table well scrubbed beneath the hanging lamp the stone sink empty of unwashed dishes a small rag rug lay by the door for wiping feet it too was spotless she was saying to him father always came in by the back he left his bicycle in the shed then stood his boots there by the door on the little rug and hung his coat on a peg if it was wet ive known him to walk through the house in his stockinged feet rather than dirty my floors he was that thoughtful and then hed go up to his room to wash up if he needed to or to leave his coat if it was dry if the meal wasnt ready hed work at his desk or if there were visitors hed come back down to the parlor to speak with them other people would know this was his habit to come in through the kitchen door she smiled i shouldnt wonder if half the village did the same tradesmen come to the kitchen door and a neighbor bringing over an extra loaf from her baking or a jar of pickles or jam shed just put up a man would never think of walking into the front hall with muck on his shoes or children running in from the rain i daresay theres not a kitchen door in osterley thats ever locked though theres the key on the nail just beside it there was no need without warning her face crumpled the smile dissolving into a grimace of pain he was like my own son ive such grief i dont know how to cope with it turning away she fought to keep her voice steady if thats everything ill go home now i shouldnt have stayed this long rutledge thanked her gently and walked back through the house to let himself out the front door halfway down the passage he heard a sob and hesitated but her grief was private there was nothing he could do or say to assuage it and his place in osterley was clearly marked outhe came and went a stranger by the door at the front of the house chapter when rutledge arrived at the police station twenty minutes later after leaving his motorcar at the hotel he found inspector blevins sitting in his cramped office finishing a stack of sandwiches and a steaming thermos of tea missed my lunch he said gesturing to the sandwich wrappings someone was reported shooting out in the marshes and thats not allowed i spent well over an hour tramping through the bloody reeds looking for the fool my wife took pity on me and brought me these care for one thanks no i ate at the hotel is it safe to walk out to the sea if youre local i suppose its safe enough i wouldnt recommend it too easy to lose yourself and then id be out searching for you it was a friendly warning putting the cap back on the thermos of tea blevins looked up at rutledge and away again theres been a complication he said he ran his fingers through his hair father james had two sisterssarah and judith judith died in the influenza epidemic sarah is married and has young children there was a telephone message here at the station this morning from sarahs husband man by the name of hurst philip hurst ive met him a time or two steady and reliable the message was hed call back after mass and he did just before the damned shooting started in the marshes blevins stopped fiddling with the thermos and set it aside interesting conversation hurst told me that one of judiths favorite stories as a child was jack the giantslayer father james undoubtedly filling the role of jack in his sisters eyes sarah claims he must have read it to her dozens of times but thats neither here nor there he seemed to be avoiding coming to the point as if he found it distasteful rutledge waited when he was in france father james wrote often to both sisters and sarah remembers one letter in particular where he told judith that hed finally met the giant there was even a line drawing in the margin with father james dwarfed by this stick figure and there was some other nonsense about the story and that was it youre telling me that walsh is this giant god no father james was joking reminding his sister of their childhood this giant could have been anyone hed seena punjabi for all we know a good many of the highlanders were damned tall for that matter but now ive got to find someone in the war office to look up records to see if walsh could have met father james in france they wont like that but if its true i need to know about it before im made a fool of in the courtroom it doesnt change anything even if he did youll have to question everyone at the bazaar again to see if the two men recognized each other that day i dont see how it was possible for walsh to recognize father jameshe was dressed as a clown to entertain the children and his face was painted but of course father james could well have remembered him hamish reminded rutledge mrs wainer spoke of clowns paint he was still wearing it when he handed her the bills and coins theyd taken in so she had rutledge regarded blevins trying to read his face asking walsh is the simplest way to find out he observed you cant ask him anything without being cursed and abused better to find out from the war office than give that clever bastard some way of crawling out of this charge does sarah hurst still have the letter it was written to judith who showed it to her and theres no way of knowing if judith kept it much less whats become of it since she died but hurst thought we ought to know and rightly so could walsh have been searching for it either time he was at the rectory it was not uncommon to keep letters after a loved one died lord no how would he have known such a letter even existed no its a false scent and im not going to be sidetracked by it besides if father james had learned something incriminating about walsh he wouldnt have told his sister would he lets leave it i told you only because i thought youd agree with me that its not important hamish reminded rutledge of an exchange during last nights dinner at the norwich hotel on the subject of the murder having to do with the war and how to find such a needle in a haystack of returned veterans yet that same needle might have found father james nearly a year after the war had ended because hed come to a bazaar i see your point it was enough to satisfy blevins changing the subject rutledge told him ive been to the rectory to look at the study doesnt tell you much does it mrs wainer scrubbed that carpet nearly through to the nap trying to get out the blood wouldnt hear of having a constable do it for her it was her place she insisted not his he wolfed down the last sandwich then began to fold the serviettes in which they had been wrapped a b in gothic script had been embroidered into one corner entwined with a sprig of lilac a great deal of force was used to open the desk more than needful yes thats true but i doubt our blossom of fragility back there in the cells knows his own strength the same force was used to kill father james the theory is that he came looking for money to pay for his new cart but this was some weeks after the bazaar by that time the money collected at the fair might well have been already dispersedto the needy to pay for a new altar cloth whatever use it was intended to serve why did walsh believe that the money was still in father jamess hands ive looked into that myself more often than not those funds are used as a priest sees fit the accounts that must be paid by the parish come from another sum thats on deposit in the bank the autumn fete never brings in a large amount although this year the first since the war ended we had a better turnout the men had come home and the young women who had gone away to do war work were back as well he paused thats been the hardest part for me you know accepting that a good many men from osterley wont be coming home whilst youre fighting you dont think about it all that much but the butchers son and mrs barnetts nephew and so many other faces youd expect to see about the town didnt make it or theyre crippled and off somewhere learning how to make baskets or some such that they can sell the best man we ever had in the marshes is blind two of the choirboys are orphans their mother dead of the influenza and their father killed off jutland theres talk of making a small war memorial here to honor the dead of osterley i dont see it myself but those who lost loved ones might find it comforting after a fashion rutledge was reminded of the monument that london was building to the nations war dead an enduring memorial to the great war the newspapers called it a place where wreaths could be laid each november and prayers said for the dead who hadnt come home he shivered many of them had never been found they still lay in flanderss fields buried so deep in the wrecked earth that not even a farmers plow would turn them up leather boots might last longer than flesh or bone and helmets as well but in time even leather crumbled and metal rusted after a few years peas and corn and vineyards would cover their resting place not a wooden cross or a plinth of marble would they even hear the prayers of a grateful nation and how long would gratitude last blevins was saying to him father james survived the war survived the influenza epidemic a brave man but never a foolhardy one anybody will tell you that hed have dealt with the man in his study given half a chance but if it was matthew walsh he had no chance at all i dont know what your experience has been but in mine a good many men the size of walsh are of a milder nature this monsters got a temper father james may have made a fatal mistake in judging his adversary theres some truth to that rutledge agreed but speaking of walshs sizeive been thinking about the print of the shoe you found at the rectory near the lilacs brushing aside rutledges words blevins said impatiently yes ive already come to the same conclusion walshs foot dwarfs that print i had a drawing made of it to match with the shoes of any suspects you know what this means dont you this time rutledge let him have the pleasure of answering his own question it tells me friend walsh must have had an accomplice hamish breaking a long silence warned you ken the sum stolen wouldna be enough for two did walsh have an assistant at the bazaar there had been no mention of anyone else in the strong mans act to rutledges knowledge but that would make sense if walsh needed someone he could trust no no he worked alone as far as we can discover blevins answered i doubt he ever made enough to hire an assistant some months ago he had a woman with him but im told she wasnt good for business the young ladies seemed to find her intimidating well thats not surprising but breaking and entering is a different proposition theres often another man along to act as lookout thats why he was standing near the lilac bush he was out of sight from the churchyard and the neighboring house blevins seemed convinced for the time being rutledge left the subject and moved on what about other towns where walsh has made an appearance were there any crimes that could be traced to him is this a pattern id thought of that too were looking into it after a moment of silence blevins said we havent got more than curses out of walsh so far would you like to try your hand at questioning him it wouldnt do any harm weve put him in irons to keep him manageable blevins reached for a ring of keys and took rutledge down the passage to the makeshift cells set in behind the offices he wont be tried here the inspector went on as he unlocked the door were moving him to norwich by the middle of next week were used to drunk and disorderly petty theft and the occasional wifebeater who wont learn his lesson and any murderers weve had to deal with over the years are generally more terrified of what theyve done than they are a threat to the peace but this man is dangerous when blevins unlocked the door of the cell walsh was sitting on the iron cot his face bruised his eyes defiant ankles and wrists were fettered a heavy chain hanging between them blevins said briskly youve met inspector rutledge before nearly knocked him down i wouldnt think about trying it again hes here from london walsh surprise in his face said are they taking me to london then that could depend on how cooperative you are the inspector wants to question you about the priests death taking advantage of the mans uncertainty rutledge asked almost conversationally ever use an assistant in your act walsh eyebrows raised walsh answered i used a woman for some weeks thought it would make the ladies more willing to let themselves be lifted on the bench if iris went first but she didnt work out why do you want to know i should have thought a man would have been more useful considering the bench and the weights you must haul about regularly in your cart walsh grinned i can lift them and you too and ill show you if you unlock these he raised his hands the chain clanked unmusically but its weight seemed not to cause him any distress rutledge returned the smile then why did you take someone with you when you killed the priest was that more dangerous than pulling a carriage against a team of horses im surprised that youd choose a woman to stand outside and watch she couldnt stop the priest from coming home could she or warn you but what youve done is pitched her into this with you accomplice to murder i should have thought there was barely enough money for one the grin had faded walsh said angrily i didnt kill any man with or without help except in the war when i was paid to do it are all policemen deaf or is it that you cant do your work properly rutledge responded quietly you bought yourself a new cart behind him he could hear blevins fuming but the trick with a man like walsh was to encourage braggadocio to let him tweak the noses of the police aye with the savings from letting iris go the old one had got worm in it sitting in a shed all the time i was away fighting it had to be replaced i didnt have any choice if you didnt kill father james who did you were at the bazaar did you see anyone looking for a chance to pick up money pickpockets you mean walsh asked there were two but a constable run them off soon enough men in the line of housebreaking dont come to church bazaars the bloody things are advertised everywhere you look in shop windows on pasteboards or lampposts invitation to robbery right out in the streets all they have to do is watch for a family to leave for the day well make a note of that rutledge assured him will you tell us where to find iris now wed like to hear what she has to say about killing a priest walsh shrugged london probably how do i know she didnt work out and i let her go she wasnt what youd call happy about it either but business is business whats her full name iris kenneth is what i knew her by im not saying it was her true name shes a shill by tradeyou know standing in front of a show like mine and talking it up used to work for a gypsy fortuneteller from slough name of buonottibarnaby he called himself italian he was went home to fight in the war and never come back so she was at loose ends and suited me just fine blevins said what did you promise her walsh that youd take her on again if she helped you or was there someone else who owed you a favor walshs laughter was a deep rumble in his chest that welled up and spilled over into a bass chuckle id have had to promise to marry her to get her to come in with me again and im not the marrying kind not yet anyway after theyd finished with walsh blevins turned to rutledge and said i dont know hes hard to read but im ready to put good money down that says hes guilty too damned cocky by half do you think this iris kenneth was his accomplice no id say the shoes too large for a womans foot thats probably true but stuffed with rags it would be the perfect blind wouldnt it a mans shoe a womans foot he let the thought lie there blevins said in resignation watching his simple case grow to monstrous proportions ill see what london can find out about iris kenneth the sky was clear now the deeper blue of a storm passed and finer weather to come and even the wind had dropped the suns warmth was not augusts warmth but it felt good on his face as rutledge left the police station and walked down toward the hotel on impulse he continued as far as the quay and stood there looking out across the marshes he felt tired deeply tired and thought about a drink to ease his chest muscles and his arm but he knew it was better to fight through the pain if he could you didna sleep verra well last night hamish pointed out guilty conscience was it no rutledge was too weary to enter into an argument with his tormentor hamish said theres more on your mind than scotland this murderthis marshy countryi canna see what it is that has made you a hollow man it wasnt a hollowness rutledge thought that left him empty it was too much not too littleconflicting emotions divided passions an uncertainty he hadnt felt since june when he had walked into warwickshire an exhausted haunted man with no hope and no expectations and a great fear of going mad it wasnt madness now that he fearedthough he knew that his mind teetered on the brink of selfdestruction more often than he cared to admit but he was damned if hed let hamish pry and tear at him like a bird of prey pulling out his soul to examine it like some rare specimen from the dark corners of the congo the question was how to shut him out rutledge had never found a way hamish had the last wordas he so often did it isna a matter of a nights sleep ye ken that you willna sleep until you allow yoursel to live again trying to ignore him rutledge moved along the quay to stand so that he could see the little stream where the boats came in to tie up wildfowl took off from the reeds and grasses looking for their nights roost he watched them for a time and the long shadows of the late afternoon falling across the marshes they were golden in this light or a deep rufous or pale yellow and when he stood very still he thought he could hear breakers coming into the strand out beyond them tomorrow will be fair hamish said his countrymans instincts strong yes rutledge turned back walked to his car in the hotels walled courtyard next to a stand of late autumn flowers and retrieved his luggage from the boot it was early in the dinner hour when rutledge came down for the evening meal mrs barnett greeted him and led him to a table in the middle of the room under the softly lit chandeliers with a smile she asked if hed enjoyed his day and with equal courtesy he agreed that he had where he had eaten his luncheon a man was dining alone a heavy cane hooked over the back of the second chair mrs barnett turned to hover over him solicitously as he finished his cheese and rutledge caught part of the conversation the man was saying in osterley were a benighted lot here on the north coast mrs barnett smiled i saw nurse davies a time or two in the shops it was always the rain she the glass doors between the dining room and the reception hall had been left open sunday night it appeared was a popular time for local people to come in for their dinner and there were already six or eight couples by the windows and two families at the larger tables along the wall beneath the sconces their quiet laughter and lowvoiced conversation filled the spacious room with warmth and life a far cry from that noon when it had seemed much too large for its only occupants rutledge and the woman guest but it appeared that she wasnt dining in this evening waiting for his soup rutledge unobtrusively studied the man by the window the one mrs barnett had spoken with there was something in the shape of his head that had caught rutledges attention the way his hair grew thickly from its part and the line of his chin he was young perhaps thirty or thirtytwobut his face was lined with pain aging it prematurely a member of lord sedgwicks family the resemblance was there but softer drawn as if the bone structure was less formidable i canna see it mysel hamish said hes no as large framed it was true unless illness had whittled away the muscle and brawn and certainly this man appeared to be taller longer limbed later as rutledge finished his soup he saw the man by the window fold his serviette and set it by his plate his expression relaxed as if hed enjoyed his meal but he lingered as if reluctant to push back his chair and retire to the lounge for his tea and then mrs barnett came in from the kitchen as if alert to his needs and handed the man his cane he grasped the ivory handle and rose with visible effort his weight heavy on the thick shaft he straightened pausing to catch his breath rutledge looked away but not before he saw the sharp sadness in mrs barnetts face after a friendly exchange with mrs barnett the man walked on toward the lobby with only a slight limp as if sitting had left him quite stiff and motion improved the ability of his muscles to function he went on into the lounge to take his tea mrs barnett came to remove rutledges soup plate and set the roast veal in front of him and he said quietly the man with the cane is he related to lord sedgwick she nodded arthur his elder son his back was so severely injured in the war that they didnt expect him to live and now hes walking again its quite a miracle but its hard to keep help his last nurse was a london girl not used to the country i should think rutledge said lightly that the sedgwick family paid well enough to overcome even that reservation mrs barnett smiled but shook her head ordinarily they probably would but arthur sedgwick doesnt live in east sherham with his father although when he requires more surgery or physical rehabilitation he often comes to stay his home is in yorkshire and im told that compared to the dales osterley is second only to paris rutledge had nearly finished his meal when a woman came striding through the outer doors and walked up to reception where mrs barnett was adding up figures by this time most of the diners had retired to the lounge and it appeared at first that the newcomer was going to ask if the dining room was still open instead she leaned over rather imperiously to touch mrs barnetts arm interrupting her to ask a question mrs barnetts eyebrows went up and she turned to look at rutledge through the open doors hamish said it appears the news has got around that yere a policeman the woman turning her head followed mrs barnetts glance thanked her and came through to the dining room she stopped in front of rutledges table and said keeping her voice low are you the man from london scotland yard rutledge standing now his serviette in his hand replied yes inspector rutledge and you are my name is priscilla connaught pleasesit down and finish your meal but if i may ask you to meet me in the loungeits down the passage beyond the stairs afterward i wont keep you long i promise her voice was almost pleading as if she feared hed refuse her hamish said shes verra agitated rutledge was already answering yes i shant be more than a few minutes would you prefer to join me no thank you no this is a veryprivate matter glancing around the room at the remaining diners she shook her head as if to reinforce her refusal then ill join you shortly thank you she said again and turning walked swiftly out to the lobby in the direction of the lounge rutledge resumed his seat as hamish said its no a name you ken no but if shes already learned that im from the yard she must live here in osterley finishing his trifle quickly rutledge left the dining room and went down the passage to the lounge but it was empty except for one of the families who had dined at the hotel she hasna waited hamish pointed out a woman will change her mind if she canna be sure shes doing whats best rutledge turned back to the dining room and met mrs barnett coming through the glass doors ohthere you are i put miss connaught in the small parlor just there she pointed to a closed door beyond the lounge there will be other guests having their tea in the lounge i thought you might prefer a little privacy yes thank you he said could you bring us tea in about five minutes ill be happy to inspector her voice held a cooler note hamish said aye they know now who you are his anonymityhis role as a man with no ties to the problems of osterleyhad been stripped from him there had been a new reserve in mrs barnetts manner and it would soon be reflected in that of other people his questions would be met with reticence rutledge walked on to open the door mrs barnett had indicated priscilla connaught was sitting by the small hearth staring at the empty grate she rose as rutledge entered the room facing him as if uncertain whether or not she really wanted to speak to him frowning she gnawed her lip she was tall rather slim with dark hair showing only the first hints of graying but her face was that of someone who suffers constant pain not lined so much as the planes worn down to bone giving them a severity that was not unattractive over the dark gray dress she was wearing was a matching coat with a lovely little gold pin at her lapel stylish but somehow conveying a sense of mourning in the austerity of the cut her hat was a softer shade of gray with a small bunch of white feathers where the brim lifted on the left side a woman who would stand out wherever she was hamish murmured something but rutledge didnt quite catch it only the words a fierce pride miss connaught was saying i hope you didnt rush your meal on my account her voice was strained not at all he replied with a smile i did take the liberty of asking mrs barnett to bring us tea in an effort to put her more at ease he asked do you live here in osterley miss connaught he indicated her chair and after she sat down stiffly her back ramrodstraight he took the one on the other side of the hearth yesyes i do imnot a native of norfolk my family is from hampshire i was surprised to find the harbor has all but vanished iit has been silting up for well over a century i believe a silence fell the room small but comfortably furnished seemed to stifle her she looked at the chairs and tables the magazines on a low stand the several pieces of staffordshire porcelain on the mantelanywhere but at rutledges face the door opened and mrs barnett came in with their tea miss connaught seemed almost relieved at the interruption her eyes following the settling of the heavy tray on a table at her elbow rutledge thanked mrs barnett and when she had gone he said would you rather i poured priscilla connaught looked up at him startled yes would you i she smiled for the first time giving her face a little color i really think id drop the pot he filled their cups asked her her taste in sugar and cream and handed her one of them she sat back seeming to draw comfort from the warmth between her two hands after a silence she said ive come to ask you something that matters very much to me i went to see inspector blevins but the constable on duty tells me hes gone home and i didnt want to disturb him there im not on the best of terms with his wife i dont know that i can help you rutledge began it isnt a state secret she said abruptly surely not i need to know you seei need to know if the man they have at the police station is the person who killed father james the constable suggested that i speak to you ah rutledge thought aloud he said inspector blevins believes that the man is the murderer yes and what do you think parrying the question he asked do you know matthew walsh surprised she said is that his name no i have no idea who he is he came to the bazaar he was the strong man oh i do remember seeing him he was quite a spectacle actually why do they think he killed father james she sipped her tea and he thought for an instant that she was going to spill itthe contents seemed to move in tiny waves in concert with her nervousness why are you so concerned for him rutledge asked concerned she repeated as if bewildered for him noi have no interest in him at all i want to know who killed father james its very important to me to know thats why ive asked about this man are you a parishioner at st annes i attend mass there but youre not answering my question directly have the police found father jamess murderer or havent they we arent sure he said something in her face shifted disappointment was that what she felt he couldnt be certain there appear to be very good reasons to believe that this man could have committed the crime but there are also some unexplained problems the courts may have to sort it out i need to know she said again her voice harsh with that need i cant wait until the courts do their work why he asked bluntly did you care so much for the priest i hated him priscilla connaught said roughly for an instant rutledge was reminded of what mrs wainer had told him that father james had been killed for revenge thats a very strong word hate he told her and if you did hate him why should you care whether his killer is found or not because whoever killed father james has cheated me she cried her voice trembling and i want to see him hang for that looking back on the encounter rutledge realized that his face must have reflected his shock priscilla connaught set her cup on the tray with a clatter that sent tea over the lip of the saucer and onto the shining silver surface i shouldnt have come she said rising to her feet i didnt mean a word of what ive just said im upset thats all everyone in osterley is upset by this murder frightened by it its late i must go rutledge stood also no i think youve told me the truth and in my opinion you owe me some explanation i just want the killer found thats all that part is true enough and i wanted to know if that manwhat did you say his name was walsh matthew walsh yes if that man walsh was likely to be the murderer and you wont tell me straight out whether you believe he is or not she was flushed and rutledge thought she was close to tears suddenly he felt a wave of pity we dont have enough proof to charge him yet its circumstantial evidence at the moment but inspector blevins is waiting for information that might give us the answer to your question and as a precaution hes holding walsh until it arrives oh god her face seemed to close in on itself the features tightening as if the muscles were pinched together well at least thats honest she glanced around searching for her purse found it on the floor by her chair and stooped to pick it up im sorry i interrupted your meal inspector but i live alone theres no one to talk to about this i sometimes think ive lost my perspective i wish you would be as honest with me rutledge answered why did you hate father james she sighed in resignation brushing the edge of her hand across her forehead it was a very long time ago well in the past and nothing to do with the police it was before he became a priest i went to him for advice and he gave it to me i followed it because i trusted him and it ruined my life it destroyed everything i believed in and loved and cared about and this man who was so wise and compassionate and understanding became a priest i have often wondered just how many other lives he ruined in his righteous belief in his own infallibility but as long as i could hate him i had something to live for you see and now thats been taken away from me and i really have nothing left when that man killed father james he might as well have killed me too she swept past him and out the door rutledge staring at her stiff and uncompromising back let her go rutledge was halfway up the stairs when he thought about monsignor holston he went down again to the lobby found the telephone in the little alcove behind the desk and put in a call to norwich eventually the priest answered sounding out of breath rutledge identified himself sorry i had to make a dash to answer the phone is there more news no im afraid not but i do have a small mystery on my hands tell me do you know anyone called priscilla connaught monsignor holston considered the question connaught no i cant place her shes a parishioner here at st annes was she at mass this morning i didnt see her tall slim graying dark hair no i cant put a face to the name does it matter you could speak to mrs wainer shed be able to tell you surely probably not important rutledge said lightly apparently miss connaught knew father james a good many years ago his death seems to have upset her more than most priests have friendships like anyone else that shouldnt surprise you there was a smile in the voice at the other end of the line no as a matter of fact it doesnt rutledge responded and after thanking monsignor holston he hung up the telephone receiver hamish said she wasna the kind of friend yon priest in norwich would be told about if she believed that father james had ruined her life yes rutledge said slowly its an interesting thought isnt it i wonder if she came to confession every week to tell him how much she hated him the skeleton at the feast reminding the merrymakers of their fate or in this case the priest of his failure the dining room was closed the french doors shut and mrs barnett was just coming out of the lounge with a tray laden with the cups and pots of tea that she had collected there the contrast with priscilla connaught was striking mrs barnett looked tired her hands red from dishwater and her black dress rumpled from the heat of the kitchen rutledge offered to take the heavy tray but she shook her head im used to it but thank you she rested it on the polished wood of the reception desk and said thoughtfully i didnt know you were a policeman i wasnt here in a strictly official capacity not at first he answered her but inspector blevins is understandably eager to complete this investigation ive been asked to stay on until then yes id heard there was an arrest she looked around her at the lobby and the stairs to the rooms above i was glad it wasnt someone who had stayed here that week that would have been shocking we always have a few guests for such an event taking the opportunity presented rutledge asked would you mind telling me what you know about miss connaught alarm filled mrs barnetts eyes i cant believe she has anything to do with father jamess death she offered some information thats all i wondered if it was trustworthy ah mrs barnett turned the tray a little thinking it probably is because she has no particular reason to lie as far as i know she keeps to herself and then as if prompted by his attentive silence mrs barnett explained which hasnt endeared her to most of the women here in osterley many of them have put her down as a snob that reserve of hers shuts people out my late husband always believed shed been involved in some sort of scandal and was banished from society she tilted her head in the way women did when amused about the antics of men well thats the romantic view anyway whats the general impression rutledge asked as if merely curious that the only reason shed be content in osterley for so many years is that she has nowhere else to go occasionally shes invited to dinner to make up the numbers and if she accepts shes pleasant company but not the sort of woman another woman would sit down and have a good gossip with men seem to find her rather attractive and wellinformed but shes not a flirt id always wondered if she was married to someone rather unpleasant and there was a nasty divorce the woman who cleans for her helps out here at the hotel when were busy and according to her miss connaught has no photographs or other personal things in the house as if theres no past that she cares to remember hamish commented or no future to fill realizing that she had said more than she intended mrs barnett reached for her tray glancing up at rutledge she added i shouldnt have told you that its no more than idle speculation and id appreciate it if you didnt pass it on as owner of the only hotel my livelihood is dependent on my discretion i see no purpose in passing it on youve helped me make a personal judgment thats all lifting the tray again she smiled it must be the fact that youre a policeman you listen rather well and before i knew it i was rattling on or perhaps ive missed my dear friend emily more than id realized since she moved to devon to be with her daughter he opened the door to the kitchen for her and said good night chapter still mulling over his conversation with priscilla connaught rutledge went out the hotel door into the evening air the wind had picked up off the sea cold as night and he shivered turning toward the pelican inn he made his way up water street to the main road stopping for a time to look up at holy trinity the church had beautiful proportions in this light standing stark against the sky and framed by trees that marched south of it whoever had built it had had an eye for setting as well as architecture castles usually went up on the highest point in a district but here it was the church it must have been built after the black plague and the worst of the wars of the roses because there were no defensive aspects in the design gracefulness was its hallmark and the long windows the high clerestory the rise of the roof gave the tall tower at the west front and the round beacon tower at the chancel an elegance of their own among the trees in the churchyard rutledges nightaccustomed eyes picked out a solitary figure head bent standing among the gravestones then the figure straightened to stare up at the night sky above the towers a mourner or another lonely soul with no home he wanted to go to like you hamish asked softly turning rutledge walked along the main road passing the darkened windows of dr stephensons surgery the brightly lit ones of the police station and what appeared to be a small country solicitors office tuckedwith a prosperous airinto the corner where water street and the hunstanton road met his mind kept returning to the different view of father james that priscilla connaught had presented to him and before he could sleep he wanted to think it through right or wrong she herself believed it implicitly until half an hour ago hed believed that everyone had mourned father james the man and the priest in equal measure relegating the dead to sainthood hamish pointed out is no uncommon no one wants to speak ill of the recent dead unlike mark antonys wily promise over caesars bloody corpse miss connaught had come to bury father james in every sense of the word not to praise him which gave the priest human dimensions rather than saintly ones it might have made him a better priest knowing hed failed one person rutledge argued aye its true ye canna tell without knowing how hed failed the woman but that had been left unspoken had father james failed miss connaught personallychoosing the priesthood over marriageor had he given her advice that a young man devoting his life to the church might have seen as the only answer although not necessarily the most compassionate one and in spite of her agitation rutledge was prepared to believe priscilla connaught when she swore she hadnt killed the priest haunting him had clearly given her far more personal satisfaction than murder ever could the reserved woman that mrs barnett had described had been completely distraught unless father james had learned to come to grips with it hamish pointed out it wouldna satisfy her then still this second face of the man was intriguing turning down the other leg of water street rutledge could see the bowl of sky out beyond the water dark now but filled with stars their clarity almost breathtaking as he reached the quay he stopped and stood there feeling the distant whisper of the waves although he wasnt sure he actually heard them there was a line of luminescence out there as well as if far beyond his earthbound line of sight the moon was already rising something prickled along his spine a warning and he glanced to his right to discover that he wasnt alone here on the quay a woman had walked out of the hotel and was standing some twenty yards away lost in her own thoughts she hadnt seen him holding her coat about her more as comfort than as a wrap against the winds chill she was staring down at the stream that flowed in from the sea he stood very still unwilling to disturb her reverie she said something the words whipped away in the wind thinking that she must have been speaking to him he answered its a beautiful night but she looked apprehensively in his direction as if only just aware that someone was there sorry she said i have a most dreadful habit of talking to myself he walked toward her stopping some ten feet away she was he thought the other guest at the hotel and he realized possibly the woman hed seen in the churchyard on his first day it was the set of her shoulders and the way her skirts moved in the breeze im afraid im guilty of that as well he said then added as one does with a chancemet stranger i havent visited east anglia in a number of years and ive never been to osterley its a different world from london yes he thought for a moment that she was not going to continue that her brevity was a signal to him to walk on but then she added ive come here before it was a very long time ago this trip id planned to continue up the coast toward cley but for some reason ive lingered i suppose its because of the marshes theyre beautiful around osterley a very long time ago he had the feeling that she meant long ago in memory not in actual years that she was thinking of someone and unwilling to speak of him to a stranger a war widow hamish said you willna hear me speak of fiona no fiona who had loved hamish before the war and loved him still she was a part of scotland and rutledge refused to remember her but hamish did and the name hung between them like a bad dream the black ribbon of the tidal stream below the quay quivered as a small fish came to the surface and then vanished again the woman was saying pensively i dont know why but the rivulet there reminds me of something i read once i know a brook where the willow dips long fingers into water made sweet with summer where birds come to drink and a lone fox lies dozing in dappled shade rutledge finished the lines silently i know secret places where toads rest and a child sits mourning the passing of butterflies o a manning had written those in a poem called my brother he knew it well oddly enough he understood what this woman was trying to say that this barren little stream here in the marshes gone astray and all that was left of the oncebroad harbor was neither familiar nor safe as she too had managed to wander from the comfort and safety of a life she had once lived but with no offer of surety that either would find a way back again the stream or her world there was no answer he could make to that he had no sureties either only of hamish being there from waking to sleeping and unwilling to let him go in peace she lifted her head to look up at him and smiled there was a wryness in her smile that he found attractive how terribly dreary that sounds i suppose its because weve had nothing but rain until yesterday a rusting of the spirit perhaps as she turned away to walk back in the direction of the hotel her profile was outlined by the sky very patrician pale as a cameo against the darkness of her hair and her coat good night the farewell was formal indicating that the brief companionship here in the dark was happenstance and not at all an invitation to further acquaintance good night the air seemed to grow colder and he could hear the lonely rustlings of the marshes hamish had fallen silent rutledge let her continue to the hotel alone and stood for a time by the quay until she had gone up the stairs after breakfast the next morning rutledge made his way to the vicarage to speak to mr sims the sun was shining again catching the sparkle of flint the dark red of the brick window facings and the almost mediterranean warmth of the tile roofs of osterley water street was busy carts and drays maneuvering around each other to make early deliveriescabbages and turnips for the greengrocer a brace of ducks and a cage of live hens for the butcher and lumber for the smiths shop where a new wagon was in progress behind the houses mondays wash hung on the lines blowing in the surprisingly soft breeze climbing the hill toward the vicarage he could feel the coolness of the copse beyond the church and smell damp wood and wet leaves rotting beside the path he turned into the vicarage gates startling a half dozen birds busy at a bush along the drive they swirled away in a glitter of sound bright as berries on the wing overhead the old trees that sheltered the house spread heavy boughs reaching out for sunlight and casting an umbrella of shade and shadow across the roof thick roots had broken through the earth to form a tangle of enticing places for childhood gamestransformed into fortresses for lead soldiers and houses for dolls and sometimes even strong arms in which to curl up and sleep in summers warmth they dredged up memories rutledges grandfathers house had had such places an ancient oak which he had thought he would never grow tall enough to reach his arms around had stood near a pond of garrulous frogs and just beyond its shade was the swaybacked shed where bicycles and sleds and croquet sets lived the last time hed seen it at the age of seventeen the back garden had seemed small like his aging grandfather and the tree had been toppled in a storm ripped from rotting roots to sprawl like a drunken giant across the iron fence we worked hard for our bread in the highlands hamish answered his thought and didna play with fine toys on welltrimmed lawns instead we washed in the stream that ran through the glen and watched the sun go down over the mountain glad to call an end to the day rutledge answered it made you what you are as my childhood made me what i am i cant say that one or the other is better but hamish could the vicarage was rather plain sprawling built of flint designed more for a large family than for beauty but there was a small graceful porch over the door and a pot of lateblooming flowers had been set in a patch of sun by the step rutledge lifted the knocker and let it fall a man came to answer the door his shirtsleeves rolled above his elbows and a large paintbrush in one hand slim and fairly young his blond hair awry he looked more like someones younger brother than a vicar rutledge identified himself and mr sims said with some relief im in the middle of painting i thought you were someone coming to fetch me do you mind if i go on with my work before everything dries out paint is unforgiving not at all he stepped into the open hall and followed the vicar up a flight of stairs the house appeared to be equally plain inside with the kind of furnishings found in most vicaragesthe outgrown collections of generations of occupants left to the next man to serve or to be rid of as he wished the finest piece was on the landing a small queen anne table that must have belonged to sims no one would have left that behind intentionally my sister and her three children are coming to keep house for me sims said over his shoulder she lost her husband in the last year of the war and ive just persuaded her to move here the house in wembley holds too many memories and there really isnt enough space for a growing brood he disappeared into a large room down the passage where new wallpaper had been hung cabbage roses and forgetmenots on a cream background there was a piece of paintsplattered canvas the size of a carpet lying under the windows and along the baseboard rutledge stepping across the threshold thought how bright and airy it was sims said this will be claires room i can only hope shell like it his forehead was furrowed with doubt as he scanned his handiwork rutledge said im sure she will this is a barn of a place sims added i rattle around in it like my own bones childrens voices and laughter will make a vast difference he rubbed one hand over his forehead leaving a smear of paint and said with some intensity theyve got a dog a big one he began to paint the sashes what can i do for you inspector i take it youre here in regard to father jamess death yes im trying to cover the same ground inspector blevins explored before me we still have more questions than we have answers id heard there was someone in custody the strong man from the bazaar yes his name is walsh but it will be several days before we can be absolutely certain we have our man inspector blevins knows osterley knows the people here he was one of father jamess congregation but im at a disadvantage id like to know more about the victim for one thing i thought this was a case of housebreaking gone wrong sims said uneasily looking over his shoulder at rutledge as he smoothed the bristles of the brush along the sill we surmise it was but in murder ive learned that nothing is certain for instance did walsh know the priest before this autumn or had they met for the first time at the bazaar it was a roundabout process and rutledge was patient i have no idea sims answered theres been a bazaar at st annes for as long as anyone can remember most of the town attends it just as the catholic parishioners come to our spring fete there isnt enough entertainment in osterley to stand fast on religious lines he threw a smile at rutledge as he dipped his brush into the paint can as far as i know this was the first year the bazaar committee decided to allow outsiders to perform st john the lesser had been quite successful with such a program and it was the talk of norfolk a number of churches followed suit and found that this drew attendees from miles around many of the villages inland from osterley arent large enough to have anything approaching a bazaar and so this one wasnot surprisinglyrather popular the strong man was a lastminute replacement when the wire walkers couldnt come and suggested him instead at least thats what id heard did walsh use his own name for his act lord no he called himself samson the great which suited the man under lock and keydefiant and arrogant changing the direction of the conversation rutledge asked was father james a good priest as you would judge any man of the cloth sims turned studying the amount of paint on his brush ruefully he replied probably a better priest than i am my father was a clergymani more or less followed him into the family trade so to speak it was expected of me sims and son clergy like the greengrocer or the ironmonger he began to paint again concentrating on the strokes my father was terribly proud of me when i was ordained but i learned soon enough that i never had the deep calling that made him a sincerely committed man ill marry one day and raise a family and serve my congregation faithfully holy trinity is beautiful and ill be proud of what i accomplish here he bent to dip the brush again but father jamess church was his family and a more dedicated man youll never find and when my sons come to me to ask if they should follow in the footsteps of their grandfather and father ill encourage them to ask themselves why they want to be clergymen if im not satisfied with the answer ill dissuade them if i can he stopped appalled and turned to rutledge heedless of the brush in his hand dripping onto his shoes exclaiming im sorry i dont know where that came from youre not here to listen to me youre here about father james youve answered me rutledge said in your own way but sims shook his head and with a lightness that was assumed to hide much deeper feelings he said if i had your skill at listening id be a very grateful man it has haunted you that skill hamish said for rutledge remembered clearly every word hamish had spoken in the trenches as if each was carved into the depths of the soul out of reach and never worn away after a moment sims went on father james had no ambition to rise in the church even though his bishop liked him immensely he was content where he was he gave himself unstintingly to anyone who needed him and he wasas far as i could seea happy man aye hamish agreed with promotion a man is thrust into the glare of public notice was that what kept him content anonymity ive been told rutledge said slowly that his advice well meant as it may have beenhas sometimes caused great hardship for people sims knelt to work under the sill we talked a good deal he and i well we were both bachelors and on occasion id dine at the rectory or hed dine here and wed spend hours on whatever topic was uppermost in our minds sometimes we both feared we hadnt given the best advice thats an occupational hazard are you infallible as a policeman do you know one who is the vicar glanced up with a wry smile thats a tidy answer for the seminary rutledge answered perhaps in the scheme of a mans lifeor a womanswellmeant advice leaves abiding scars and misery we try sims said sadness in his voice we pray for solutions for guidance for understanding it isnt always forthcoming and so we do great harm sometimes he moved on to the next windowsill enough harm that a man might turn on a priest and kill him startled sims swung around to face rutledge god i wouldnt want to think about that but it isnt impossible he put the paintbrush down ino by the same token you must understand that when a human being commits a sin hes well aware of it he doesnt come to us to be told that he comes for a solution a clergyman must address the fact that the cost of paying in full may be heavier or more difficult than the sinner expects seeing him through becomes our duty we cant selfrighteously wash our hands of him and leave him to it but what if the payment for a sin is out of all proportion to what the sinner has done rutledge asked thinking of priscilla connaughts face sims said thats where forgiveness comes into the picture when restitution as such is not possible hamish growled a comment rutledge who understood better than most what restitution and forgiveness meant didnt answer instead he changed the subject tell me about herbert baker herbert baker good heavens what has baker got to do with father james surprised sims stared at him ohyou must be referring to the fact that he sent for a priest i dont know where you heard that story but it isnt so remarkable a dying man is likely to worry about his soul in ways that we with time to make amends still stretching out ahead of us cant imagine what would be on your conscience that youve never told any other person the question was rhetorical but rutledges face answered him thats what i mean sims went on when i tell you that a dying man is not like other penitents baker asked for father james and he came as a kindness i cant tell you what passed between them but father james never gave me any cause to think he was worried about what was said to him that night hamish judgmental in his own fashion said aye but would he the vicar is no a man long on wisdom did herbert baker confess to you rutledge asked sims sims said uneasily yes im not at liberty but rutledge interjected im not asking you to tell me what he said sims in his turn interrupted him if youre asking me if there were shocking revelations no i will say he was mainly afraid that he had loved his wife too dearly and god would hold that against him shes dead has been for a number of years apparently they were quite close and the dead mans will what about that i expect it was in order theres not a lot of money here in osterley to squabble over i daresay the house was left to the elder son but martin is a very conscientious man hell see his sister and his younger brother right leaving the vicarage rutledge crossed the road and walked up the hill to holy trinity when he tried the north door he found it was unlocked lifting the latch he went inside his eyes adjusting to the darkness over his head the kingpost roof was dark and lovely and the sun spilled through a great stainedglass window leaving puddles of color on the stone floor looking up he saw that it depicted orders of angelshe could recognize the archangels and angels seraphim and cherubim in rich shades of yellow and blue and blood red the orders were a very popular theme in east anglia in the center was the symbol of the holy trinity and at the bottom were four figures he couldnt identify although one looked suspiciously like early portraits of richard ii and another was selfproclaimed by the scroll spilling across his lap as the venerable bede hamish to whom stained glass was iconography close to idolatry was more interested in the construction of the marvelously carved wooden roof rutledge walked down the nave past benches capped with ornate poppyheads like inhabited fleursdelis and armrests carved as small animals from dogs to griffins to ponies his intention was to take a closer look at the window above the high altar but as he entered the small choir he nearly stumbled over a box of charcoal and a knee the woman hed spoken to so briefly the night before was sitting on a hassock making drawings of the odd figures on the misericordsthose halfseats on which a monk might rest his posterior without actually sitting down in the choir chair assigned to him she looked up as startled as he was and said sorry hamish remembering lord sedgwicks comment said the religious woman did i hurt you rutledge asked in concern oh no and its my fault for sprawling across the floor with my kit he looked down at the drawing she was making of a nun with ragged teeth dramatic and lifelike in bold strokes of charcoal thats quite good her expression became defensive its a hobby she said curtly to shift the subject he gestured around him this is a remarkably fine church yes it is i knew someone who was writing a book about old parish churches he brought it to my attention i shant distract you i only intended to look at the glass here he walked on examining the window with its fine colors and vividly detailed figures to his surprise she said to his back youre the policeman from london i think yes he didnt turn perhaps you could tell meis it true theyve caught the man who killed father james rutledge turned slowly you knew him father james a little he was interested in work i was doing and i found him quite knowledgeable about east anglian church architecture he was generous with his time and i valued that rutledge walked back to her her upturned face was attractive with intelligent gray eyes and a determined mouth above a very pretty chin the dress she was wearing a mossy dark green was very becoming but without the drama that was part of priscilla connaughts apparel we dont know if we have the right man in custody theres a good deal of work to be done before we can be certain of his movements between the day of the bazaar and the murder but inspector blevins expects to clear that up quickly she nodded as if satisfied yet something in her voiceor the way in which she had waited until his back was to herhad touched that deep well of intuition that rutledge had always relied on there had been some deeper interest than mere curiosity in her question he thought probing his mind still on priscilla connaught he asked were you here in osterley when the bazaar was held no i was in felbrigg having dinner with friends rutledge shifted to another direction did you see father james the day he was killed no was there anything about his death that worried you he waited continuing to look down at her it seemed to make her uneasy reluctantly she tried to explain i havent had much experience with murder investigations it was probably more my imagination than anything else but father james had asked me a question on the last evening i dined with him it was on my mind for several days and after he diedi found myself wondering if it might be important but if youve arrested your man then of course i was wrong it doesnt signify now rutledge replied carefully who can say perhaps it still has some bearing on the case have you spoken of this to inspector blevins she frowned no i thought it best not to say anything inspector blevins seemed convinced that the motive for the murder was theft not ancient history will you tell me what it was my names rutledge scotland yard sent me to osterley because father jamess bishop expressed grave concern over the time it has taken to clear up this business it isnt idle curiosity behind my questions and i wont repeat what you tell me to anyone elseuntil or unless i see the need the woman picked up her charcoal again and began to put wrinkles into the wimple of the nun capturing them perfectly no i justfather james was so kind that i sometimes one wants to help so badly that one starts to imagine that what one knows is important ive already explained the matter he was referring to had happened some time ago years in fact and really had nothing to do with osterley or anyone who lives here it was only the importance that father james seemed to attach to it that made me remember it at all was it a church matter or a personal one i rather thought it was personal most certainly the subject was a painful one for me and hefather james was helpful in dealing with that in return i tried to answer his question and failed a disappointment to him and a regret for me but it had nothing to do with osterley i give you my word she bent her head over the drawing and rutledge looking down at the nape of her neck and the dark sheen of her hair decided that this was not the time to press her if you change your mind mrs barnett will see that any message reaches me yes of course it was said with grave politeness but he knew she had no intention of doing any such thing he waited for a count of ten but she seemed to be absorbed in her work as if unaware that he was still there hamish scolded you canna leave it but rutledge was already walking through the nave listening to the silences of the shadowy church around him he was thinking that mrs barnett would give him the name and the direction of this woman and he could put sergeant gibson on to searching for her background with emphasis on what connection she might have to osterley or east anglia he had learned early on in his career at the yard that people who did not want to talk to the police could not be made to do so but he wanted very much to know what it was that father james had asked of a comparative stranger that had left behind it such unease chapter the firm of gifford and sons solicitors was a small country practice that had been in business for some time judging by the brass nameplate by the door the letters on it were worn almost to smoothness from years of polishing away the sea damp that etched it like freckles rutledge had noticed the location of the firm during his walk the night before now as he crossed from trinity lane along the hunstanton road he decided to speak to whichever gifford was available this morning the two unusual events in father jamess life shortly before his death had been the bazaar with its connection to walsh and the summons to the bedside of a dying man odd though the circumstances had been there was no indication that out of that deathbed had come like a phoenix rising the shadow that had dogged father james until it killed him all the same it had to be considered the policeman in rutledge was too experienced to leave the matter nor could he ignore priscilla connaught or the woman he had quite literally stumbled over in the church they too had some sort of personal link with the victim you canna face london hamish reminded him with some force its no experience its cowardice you willna face your own life better to delve into anothers and not think about yoursel and dying and scotland but rutledge knew he was wrong that father james was slowly becoming a puzzle he could not walk away from not the priest but the man as he came to the corner of the main road and water street rutledge paused and then opened the heavy door of gifford and sons he stepped into victorian elegance that had sufficed for two additional reigns and seemed to be in no haste to change the elderly clerk at the desk might have served through all of them he was tall and stooped with the soft very white hair seldom seen on any head younger than eighty but the blue eyes that turned rutledges way were bright as new paint good morning sir the clerk greeted him do you have an appointment with mr gifford no regrettably rutledge answered with equal formality recognizing the game however i hope that hell spare me a quarter of an hour my name is rutledge inspector rutledge from london the observant eyes took him in from head to toe ah i shall inquire sir rutledge wondered how he had fared in the summing up the clerk disappeared through a door into the private sanctum looking about him rutledge could see that little had changed here since the first gifford had begun to practice the three chairs set against the walls of the spacious room were covered in worn leather and the velvetshrouded table in one corner was smothered in photographs in gilt frames mostly of a man growing older his son following suit and then two younger men standing firmly in front of the camera with a look of nervous selfimportance a photograph of one of those men dressed in uniform had heavy black ribbon threaded through the openwork of the ornate frame grandfather father and sons hamish said and one didna come home fra the war the clerk returned standing on the threshold mr gifford will see you inspector he led the way down a narrow passage where two doors on the left were firmly closed as if with sad finality all they lacked was the black crepe of mourning the clerk paused before a third opened it and introduced rutledge with a victorian flourish rutledge walked into a paneled room bright with racing prints and glassfronted bookshelves a fine mahogany desk that was far older than the man seated in the chair behind it and on the broad windowsills an array of antique european snuffboxes and chinese snuff bottles each a small exquisite gem from enameled gold to cinnabar ivory to painted glass porcelain to jade in the indirect light of morning they were quite beautiful a miasma of cigar smoke hung in the air gifford rose to greet rutledge and hamishs first comment was hes small enough to be a jockey he was a foot shorter than rutledge with the small features that matched his frame thin and wiry his hair was a rich thick brown as was his beard im frederick gifford he said gesturing to a chair do sit down and tell me what i can do for you i assume youve come about the will surprised rutledge said as a matter of fact gifford nodded it seemed unlikely that inspector blevins would be interested in its provisions given the nature of my clients death im told that theyve finally caught the killer its chilling to think about still i suppose if someone is poor enough any sum is princely the words echoed those of monsignor holston moving the blotter to line up with the pen and inkstand in antique silver gilt gifford sighed but i must admit that im surprised father jamess reputation had reached london its a compliment to his memory that scotland yard should take an interest in the matter hes fishing hamish warned rutledge accustomed now to offering a placating sentence or two answered father jamess bishop was concerned enough to speak to the chief constable about the case the yard as a courtesy sent me to reassure him that all that it is possible to do was being done it has most certainly borne fruit as if satisfied that rutledges credentials were in order gifford went on well as to the will there was nothing extraordinary in it father james didnt leave a large estate and what there is goes to his only surviving relative a sister with a very young family theres a suitable bequest to mrs wainer for her years of service as housekeeper and a small sum for the church fund not im sure as generous as father james had hoped it might be in the fullness of time his eyes watched rutledge behind the pedantic mask of solicitor he couldnt have foreseen an early death rutledge agreed he had chosen the words carefully for there seemed to be something more and the solicitor was biding his time hamish at the back of rutledges mind was also advocating caution of course its too soon to be absolutely certain we have the right man inspector blevins strikes me as thorough and experienced he wont be satisfied until hes found the proof he needs it does no harm to keep the broader picture in mind meanwhile there was a subtle change in giffords manner as though he had been waiting for a sign that rutledge the outsider was not usurping the local mans position villagers looked after their own yes well we dont have many murders in osterley thank god but blevins is a good man we went to school together the three of usblevins my late brother and i he followed his father into the constabulary and we went on to take up law two sides of the same coin in many ways rutledge acknowledged the connection saying lightly unless youre arguing for the defense true enough giffords smile gave his face an unexpected strength reaching into a drawer of his desk he extricated a sheaf of papers he looked through them and selected one there was a codicil added to father jamess last will and testament some three or four days before he was killed i havent been able to carry out his instructions as the piece of property hed specified has been mislaid he stared at the sheet before him as if refreshing his memory but rutledge had the feeling he could have quoted the short paragraph from memory i leave the framed photograph in the bottom drawer of my desk to marianna elizabeth trent in the hope that one day she will have the courage to pursue the obligation that i must now entrust to her a photograph rutledge repeated as hamish echoed the words in his head and an obligation yes it was clearly of paramount importance to him because he had written it out to be certain id got it right gifford frowned as a rule a bequest is rather simple a pair of garnet earrings to a favorite niece or a collection of books to a cousin that sort of thing people generally want to ensure that a particular possession ends up in proper hands what did you make of this it isnt my role to question only to see that everything is regular as far as the law is concerned youve already contrasted father jamess bequest with that of a pair of garnet earrings rutledge pointed out quietly true enough when wed finished the codicil witnessed properly and so forth he told me that it was a debt he owed and wished to see paid if i thought anything and im not admitting that i didit was that father james wished to handle the matter discreetly whatever it was rather than ask his sister to act for him or it may be that it was a kinder way of returning a photograph he valued through a mutual friend orunfinished business of some sort rutledge said priscilla connaught coming to mind again was marianna elizabeth trent another failure on the priests conscience a task he preferred not to ask you as his solicitor to perform for him and using miss trent as the intermediary the gift remains anonymous gifford stirred uneasily perhaps miss trent knows this person and could be depended on to break the news gently or in the right circumstances but this photograph has been mislaid you said as blevins must have told you the desk was ransacked mrs wainer tried to put everything back poor woman as far as she remembers there wasnt a photograph among the contents at least not a framed one i myself looked and there were no photographs at all in any of the drawers it could very well be that father james simply hadnt gotten around to putting it in the desk and mrs wainer cant be sure which of the photographs on display he had in mind because apparently he never spoke to her about the bequest needless to say ive been reluctant to make an issue of it nor have i contacted miss trent since its rather awkward to admit we cant put our hands on it she might know which it is id thought of that but the will is under probate and theres still time to find it early days gifford restored the papers to his drawer a single photograph is not often the subject of a codicil but theres nothing wrong in it and as long as the request is legal and reasonable we are required to honor it hamish repeated something rutledge had said earlier he couldna know he would be killed which was true it might have been years before the priests will was executed ye ken this photograph might be for a child hamish demanded following rutledges thoughts and too young yet to be told who her mother isor her father rutledge answered him silently and that will bear looking into aloud he added to gifford will you leave a message for me at the osterley hotel if you locate the photograph i dont suppose it will matter to blevinss investigation but at this stage who can say yes ill be happy to do that gifford said jotting down a few lines in a small leatherbound notebook did you know father james well he was an ordinary man in many respects he never made anyone uncomfortably aware of his collarthere was never any fuss about it ive seen him down on the floor reading a book with half a dozen children but there was a dignity about him as well that i admired quite a good tennis player and possessed of a wry sense of humor he had the most persuasive voice gifford grinned with that gift id have been a barrister father james and the vicarmr simsand i sometimes dined together not out of deep friendship so much as for the company i lost my wife in ive learned he said ruefully that a widower with a good law practice is fair game to make up the numbers at a dinner party especially when a maiden sister or cousin has been invited rutledge laughed he had been introduced to all the sisters of his friends and half their cousinsuntil hed become engaged and thus considered off the market a twinge of memory swept him jean had been the first to make it clear that he was not a good prospect now even for the most desperate spinster gifford prepared to rise bringing the interview to a close but rutledge sat where he was theres another matter did you also serve as solicitor to herbert baker and his family it was giffords turn to be surprised herbert baker good god how did you come to know him i didnt but he died shortly before father jamess death and id like to know how his will stood bewildered gifford said i dont believe father james witnessed it if thats your point no but i understand from dr stephenson that he was in attendance just before mr bakers death what can you tell me regarding the wills provisions gifford steepled his fingers very straightforward there wasnt much in the way of money although baker owned the house he lived in itd been his wifes family home naturally he left that to the elder son martin with the proviso that the other son dick and the daughter ellen live there until they married dick just came home from hospital bad shoulder wound and ellen is the youngest a late child rutledge considered how to put his next question and decided to be blunt were the three children herbert bakers good lord i should think they were ellen looks very much like her mother and the brothers are the spitting image of herbert same spare frame and same high forehead same lefthandedness why on earth should you suppose they werent i dont i merely wondered if there could be any skeletons in the baker closet the grin reappeared herbert baker if youd known him was not the man for skeletons he was sexton at holy trinity until his health broke and while hed worked hard all his life he hadnt the money or the time to squander on wine women and song a devoted father most certainly and as far as i know an honest man the grin broadened into a smile if you want the truth he probably led as boring a life as anyone in osterley then there was nothing that might have rested heavily on his conscience at his death the only thing that ever worried herbert baker as far as i know was his wifes illness it was hopeless from the start but he sent her to london to be treated tuberculosis and too advanced when dr stephenson caught it to expect a cure he shrugged she was the kind of woman who never complained never sent for a doctor except in childbirth used her own remedies for whatever ailed her and generally died as shed lived as selfeffacing as possible but the sanitarium gave her two more years of life and i dont believe any of the family would have considered it money wasted sanitariums are expensive where did a poor man find the money charity if you want my honest opinion its happened before actually not three years ago there was a woman who needed surgery for her goiter and a generous contribution from her employer paid the better part of the cost it was done with circumspectioni handled the paperwork myself as the donor wished to remain anonymousand this woman has never learned the truth she believes she paid the entire fee rutledge said youve been very helpful one final question were both of bakers sons in the army martin was sent home compassionate leave when his fathers health began to fail and ellen wasnt up to running the household on her own dick was wounded as i think i mentioned both men from all reports did their duty but as rutledge had learned having used that phrase more times than he cared to remember the words were a catchall when an officer knew too littleor too much about a soldier under his command did their duty covered a multitude of sins had herbert baker begged absolution for one of his sons from father james rutledge had left the solicitors office and was walking back toward the osterley hotel when a large motorcar with a uniformed driver pulled up beside him in the rear seat lord sedgwick leaned forward i say have you had your luncheon yet rutledge turned good morning no its still fairly early it couldnt have been more than eleventhirty well come and dine with me and ill have evans here bring you back afterward my sons returned to yorkshire and im damned if i can stand my own company for another meal mrs barnett at the hotelsedgwick chuckledwill turn me out if i appear unannounced a second time within the week or have you made a commitment to her rutledge had not then come along and bear me company if you will we can talk about something other than the price of sheep and what cabbages are currently fetching hamish warned its no a very good idea rutledge hesitated then he opened the door noting the crest on the panel and climbed into the car the interior was beautifully done with velvet cushions and quite fine polished woodwork lord sedgwick leaned back and spoke to evans the motorcar purred into motion and moved off down water street between the carts and people as evans handled his gears with smooth perfection sedgwick said any progress in your murder investigation gossip hasna been slow in spreading hamish told rutledge youll soon be verra popular it was a sour comment we think we may have found our man rutledge said noncommittally but inspector blevins is making certain that hes done his job thoroughly yes well ive posted a sizable reward for information leading to an arrest i hope ill have the opportunity to pay it out to someone rutledge recalled that blevins had spoken of a reward did you indeed were you a parishioner of father jamess did you know him well good lord no anglican the east sherham church is on our estate still i keep a friendly eye on my neighbors right thing to do i rather dislike people killing people and i know that money can jog memoriesor tongues father james was a conscientious man from all reports a considerable force for good over the years ive applauded that we can illafford to lose men of his caliber osterleys best and brightest have already been sacrificed to that bloody war i saw you coming out of the solicitors office frederick giffords brother raymond was one of the finest men ive ever met and he went down in flames over the german lines giffords two clerks died at ypres anderson at the pelican lost his boy at jutland and mrs barnetts nephew was artillery shells blew up in his face sadly the list goes on they were turning back out of water street onto the main road again on the hill the flint walls of holy trinity seemed to shine with an inner light but thats a morbid line of thought tell me what do you do in london rutledge much the same sort of thing i do here ask questions collate information consider the evidence and try to draw conclusions from it search for motives hamish whod been silent since rutledge had entered the motorcar asked hobnobbing wi the great willna give you the answers either sedgwick grunted what you do requires patience evans had braked to allow a wagon laden with firewood to make the turn into trinity lane just a few yards beyond it there was a woman walking along the verge head down face hidden by her hat rutledge recognized her and apparently so did sedgwick priscilla connaught in wellingtons and a long coat sedgwick spoke to evans and they slowed he leaned forward to say good morning miss connaught i see you are on foot anything the matter with your motorcar i can have evans take a look this afternoon good morning lord sedgwick no im walking for the exercise but thank you for your concern something in her face gave rutledge the impression she was walking off a dark mood her eyes flickered in his direction and then came back to sedgwick sedgwick touched the brim of his hat and evans put the car into gear once more shes had the very devil of a time with her brakes the former explained to rutledge i told her shed wind up in the marshes if someone didnt fix the problem evans believes its in the linkage picking up the thread of what rutledge had been saying earlier he continued im not a patient man by nature never was cant sit confined for long but then i wasnt trained to it few of us are they were passing the school now on gull street where it became the sherham road after a time sedgwick nodded to rolling fields where sheep grazed in the late grass i wasnt born to farming anyone will tell you my father made his fortune in the city he bought the house in east sherham when the last of the chastain family died i spent my summers here to keep me out of harms way i was given into the care of an old sheepman whogod forgive himthought i was entirely spoiled and woefully ignorant on the other hand i believed that anything that allowed me to escape from my tutor was daring and rebellious before i quite knew what was happening id learned as much about sheep as old ned could teach me he lifted a hand deprecatingly my father was shocked to discover that i was breeding sheep and had a natural eye for the best rams to improve the flocks the chastains hadnt maintained the land or the pasturage and i was soon badgering him to buy up acreage and extend our holding he sent me off to oxford to cure me of such low habits he chuckled that finally made a gentleman of me but ive always kept my eye on the management of the estate and its prospered our sheep produce some of the finest wool in the world or did before the war turned everything on its head and all anyone wanted to manufacture was uniforms and blankets he turned to rutledge i neednt tell a policeman that life goes on but it does somehow it must theres never any turning back to what once was he fell silent looking at the window rutledge heard a hidden bitterness in the philosophy although sedgwicks tone had been light but money was not always a guarantee of perfect happiness the detective in him intrigued rutledge cast about for another subject of interest to the man at his side you spoke of a son i think he must have dined last night at the hotel arthur yes hes the elder he went to the front and came home a broken man hes still in and out of hospital wound in his back edwin the younger of the two had a gift for languages and was given the task of dealing with prisoners or the french whoever was most troublesome rutledge suppressed a smile the french were not always the most comfortable of allies and interrogating prisoners never went smoothly edwin keeps a boat in osterley sedgwick went on he and that fool dog of his go hunting in the marshes shooting isnt allowed but the dogs nose stays sharp edwin takes him to scotland for the season hamish reminded rutledge of the man rowing into the quay with a dog in the thwarts the woman who had offered him a lift had called him edwin edwin sedgwick rutledge rather thought it was the same man had been in the lounge bar in the hotel outside norwich they had reached the outskirts of east sherham and turned onto a road where tall old trees marched on either side overhead branches arched high to form a cool and shaded canopy and the undergrowth along the verges was still thick and full here at the end of summer ahead rutledge could see the walled grounds of an estate with ornate gates marking the entrance to the drive the crest on the heavy gilded wrought iron bore the motto i will persevere two handsome pillars on either side were surmounted by a griffin these apparently had belonged to the original owners time had etched them wind and rain had worn them but they had been carved to last a man came out of the lodge to let the car pass through touching his cap to sedgwick who responded with a nod they wound their way through a finely wooded park nearly as handsome as that at hatfield and turned to the left before sweeping up in front of a lovely old brick manor house the wings were set back from the main block and elizabethan chimney pots soared into the blue of the sky the lawn wide and still reasonably green ran down to a low brick wall and beyond that the park continued to a line of trees in the distance a small greek temple sat on the rising ground beyond what appeared to be a landscaped stream at the southern edge of the park there was a feeling of old money here and a long lineage nothing ostentatious nothing new an ideal setting perhaps for a newcomer to the aristocracy eager to present an appearance of having deep roots in the land evans pulled up and came around to open the door for lord sedgwick and rutledge sedgwick thanked him and led the way across the short walk to the house a housekeeper stood ready to greet them alerted perhaps by a bell from the gatehouse she was a trim woman in her late fifties with a serene face and an air of competence she nodded calmly when sedgwick told her there was an unexpected guest and said luncheon will be ready in ten minutes my lord shall i serve it on the terrace yes that would be fine they entered a wide flagstoned hall a narrow stair of ageblackened oak on the left led up to the first floor a massive hearth which must have been a great comfort in the damp of a norfolk winter covered the wall to the right above rutledges head the high plastered ceiling was delicately carved with tudor roses and garlands of fruit at the foot of the stairs a turkey carpet covered the floor and there were rare elizabethan chairs on either side of a small jacobean table it was quite an attractive room little changed rutledge thought from the day it was built they preceded the housekeeper down a passage and through a doorway that led into a drawing room where long french windows looked out onto a sunlit terrace an ornate stone balustrade reached like arms to embrace the broad shallow stone steps that gave access to the gardens urns shaped like roman amphora stood at the bottom and in the center of the garden beyond an aged mossy fountain spilled water into a bowl shaped like a tudor rose the effect was very pretty rutledge found himself thinking of his godfather david trevor in scotlandand banished the image before it had formed trevor was an architect by profession with a love of buildings that hed conveyed to his godson through the years it was hard to see a place such as this without recalling all that had passed between the two menor now remembering what had happened in scotland just over a month ago rutledge followed sedgwick out onto the terrace where comfortable chairs had been set up to take advantage of the garden views the housekeeper returned with a tray of glasses and decanters while rutledge was admiring the flower beds they were showing signs of autumn wear but they had been designed with an eye for every season the rare japanese chrysanthemums were glorious what will you have sedgwick asked and when told held out a very good whiskey as rutledge turned to accept it he noticed a remarkable stone rectangle set at an angle in the garden largerthanlife apes four squatting in a row stared at the house their eyes unblinking and focused as if sharing some knowledge that was theirs alone they had been carved in basrelief with a vividness that was both unusual and riveting exotic as the land theyd come from they rested on their haunches unperturbed by this english garden or by the englishmen who had stepped into view catching the direction of rutledges glance sedgwick said i dont know why my father kept the damned thing or for that matter why i leave it there except that the previous owners of the house felt it brought good luck and he was superstitious about that i cant think why it shouldits as ugly as anything ive ever seen its egyptian isnt it yes thats right eighteenth dynasty im told it once stood in the hall just by the stairs where the jacobean table is now god knows how the chastains came by it they were magpies collecting whatever caught their fancy i couldnt abide looking into those faces every night before i went up to bed and arthur swore it gave him nightmares as a child when my father died i banished it to the gardens rutledge walked down the steps and went to examine the thick slab of stone it had been cut from a buildings wall he thought longer than it was tall it was well polished not rough the figures of the baboons it seemed were meant to catch the morning and afternoon sun in a climate where the light was intense slanting rays would give them an almost threedimensional quality here in the much paler light of the english broads they possessed an almost preternatural air following him sedgwick went on theyre calledso im toldthe watchers of time set the task of witnessing what man and the gods may do through all eternity thats what the catalog says at least we bought the house furnished lock stock and phantoms he was smiling but when rutledge looked up from the stone he could see that the smile had not reached sedgwicks eyes hamish who had been silent since they entered the house was saying but they canna speak the apes what use are they as witnesses rutledge answered silently they dont judge they merely observe aye hamish said but a man with a guilty conscience wouldna find it verra comfortable that stare i wouldna care for it mysel chapter lord sedgwick showed himself to be a genial host he possessed a wry sense of humor which rutledge enjoyed and seldom put his views ahead of those of his guest even when he must have had far more insight into political matters moving as he did in such vastly different circles rutledge under no illusions policemen were not invited to dine with the gentryindeed they were seldom welcomed at the front door took care not to overstep his role all the same the hour passed very pleasantly the luncheon itself was excellent finishing with a plate of cheeses the loneliness of the man under the polish of a titled and privileged life was apparent sedgwicks wife had been dead some years for he spoke of her with an old regret rather than a recent bereavement her portrait as a young american bride now hung in the library he said at one juncture replacing a remarkably hideous work of dead rabbits and quail hanging from a nail that ralph the first lord sedgwick had fancied ralph had gone shooting with the prince of wales in his day and bagged enough to show his aim was excellent but was careful never to exceed his hosts count quickest way to see yourself off the royal invitation list arthur sedgwicks elder son had had a taste for racing cars before the war and had even won a motorcycle race of some note early on in his career sedgwick had traveled to france to watch him compete and he spoke with wistful enthusiasm for the excitement it rained often as not i lived in terror that hed spin out on a curve arthur had nerves of steel when he got behind the wheel and a feeling for the roadand that made him one of the finest drivers id ever seen his wife begged him to give it up but of course he couldnt she didnt understand that it was his life speed and risk racing is a dangerous sport rutledge responded and few women are attracted to the prospect of being widowed young sedgwick grunted she was the one who died young before theyd been married five years arthur took it hard of course but i must admit i was not particularly fond of her a pretty simpleton edwin the younger son appeared to worry sedgwick i see much of my father in him strange isnt it how a mans nature can jump a generation it seemed not to be a compliment but then the grandfather had made a fortune in the city and was not perhaps a rough diamond in his own sons eyes sedgwick dwelt on none of this but a word here and there told rutledge more than perhaps his host had meant to reveal it was often a failing of lonely men it doesna signify hamish pointed out if theres naught to hide certainly in sedgwicks case that appeared to be true as the table was cleared sedgwick looked out beyond the terrace at the expanse of formal beds and cropped lawns and sighed ive a mind to marry again myself if only to fill this garden with young voices and bring a spark of life to the house damned silly thing to do but im not by nature a man who prefers his own company have a wife do you no the war altered any plans i might have made never too late to start over he regarded rutledge for a moment its odd you know but you remind me of arthur i dont know quite how to put my finger on it its there in the way you carry yourself and something in your voice a holdover from the army rutledge said i suppose it must be youd like him a good man and a deeper thinker than the rest of ushe got that from his mother not my side i see it more and more often these days there was a sudden flash of grief in sedgwicks face as if arthur wasnt the man hed been before the war losing that edge that had made him a fast driver and a dashing figure to watch in a race wounds changed a man in more ways than the physically apparent damage nerve for one thing was easily worn down by constant pain there had been a man named seelingham on the boat to france at the start of the war rutledge remembered he tried to dredge up an image of the mans face and finally brought back a tall dark broadshouldered figure with a taste for books in german never too late hed said to learn about the enemy best way to outwit them in my view otherwise youre tilting in the dark hed been a racer too but never spoke of his family fast boats were his preference later rutledge had heard that seelingham had lost both legs in a lorry accident near paris and was invalided home he had shot himself a month later was sedgwick afraid that arthurs wound would lead him to selfdestruction because he too was shut off from what he loved doing rutledge changed the subject they spoke only once more of father jamess death and that in a roundabout way weve had good weather for the most part this autumn sedgwick was saying as he pushed back his chair favoring his gouty foot a little edwin has been down a time or two and one morning we went over to osterley it was the morning they found the priests body actually although we didnt know it at the time it had begun to clear and we left the car up by holy trinity church then walked as far as cley where evans met us again we had a look at the dikes and the big windmill ate our luncheon by the marshes and came home ravenous couldnt do that today bloody foot passing through the drawing room later sedgwick paused to show rutledge a watercolor of osterley in its primeone of the chastains had it painted its said to be by constable but theres no provenance rutledge also noticed a photograph sitting on the windowsill to his right a man standing by the marshes shotgun in the crook of his arm and a setter at his feet looking up adoringly as if eager to run if sedgwick saw his straying glance he made no comment he didnt have to rutledge recognized the face and the dog edwin the younger son who kept a boat in osterleys harbor a short time later he was on his way back to osterley the chauffeur had nothing to say and rutledge preferred his own thoughts hamish still mulling over the luncheon conversation was busy in the back of his mind coming around again to the subject of lord sedgwick himself hamish said hes no a man im comfortable with hes verra like sergeant mullins it was an odd comparison mullins had replaced sergeant mciver shot in the hip and invalided home both sergeants had come up through the ranks where the heavy attrition of the battle of the somme had given men seniority overnight prepared for it or not mullins was a seasoned soldier careful gruff and humorless he had been a butcher by trade and could determine at a glance whether a wound was likely to see a man relieved or just patched up at the nearest aid station and returned to the lines sentiment seldom played a role lord sedgwick had that same quality of practical reality that had carried mullins through the war he took his world in stride and dealt with it without sentiment and yet rutledge had sensed something else in this man a wistful desire to be the local squire as the chastains had been before him but he was tainted by his fathers roots and villagers were often greater snobs than their betters money could buy some loyalties but blue blood brought respect that explains rutledge answered hamishs line of thought why sedgwick was eager to put up a reward for father jamess killer the chastains would probably have done the same still the sedgwicks had in two generations gone from the streets of london to an inheritable title and weekends at sandringham with the royal entourage the first lord sedgwick ralph whose antecedents had probably been of questionable bloodlines had had to settle for an american bride for his only son but his grandsons with any luck would find themselves wed to daughters of the old aristocracy and their sons fully accepted as titled gentlemen with no lingering odor of trade about them three generations that was what it took to bridge the social gap the future of the dynasty now rested on arthurs shoulders and his brothers unless lord sedgwick was indeed considering a second and far more advantageously connectedbride to better their chances through a stepmothers connections it never hurt in present royal circles to have a very presentable wife coming into osterley again rutledge turned his thoughts to his own role here he was expected not to tread on blevinss toes the inspector had already made that clear but the more rutledge learned about the people who lived in osterley the better he saw the dead priestand was finding himself drawn into the theory that the mans life had some bearing on his death his fingers gently massaged the scar on his chest stilling the dull ache still walsh was the ideal solution to the bloody crime on blevinss doorstep he wasnt a local manand from the start the inspector hadnt wanted to discover that his killer was someone he knew walsh had a connection with the priest one that didnt in any way reflect on father jamess memory the bazaar was a public occasion finally the motive appeared to be simple greed no seduced wives in st annes congregation no abused choirboys no dark secrets that would destroy the man and the office simultaneously a very convenient solution indeed for everyone except walsh of course but rutledge was learning that blevins kneaded his evidence like a loaf of bread forming it to his own satisfaction whereas his london counterpart was more likely to gather the scattered parts of the human puzzle and look closely at them for bits of knowledge he could string together hamish said youd do better to go back to london then you willna convince yon inspector that hes made a mistake and youll be branded along with him if it all goes wrong rutledge answered nothing less than a signed confession will serve he had meant it lightly but realized all at once that he had unwittingly defined the course of his own inquiry at the door of the hotel rutledge thanked the chauffeur and turned to find three local people staring with interest at the sight of a policeman alighting from lord sedgwicks motorcar the news would be all over osterley in an hour rutledge walked up water street to the police station there was a constable on duty he shook his head when asked for any news the new cart was ordered well before the bazaar half down then and two payments to follow the last one on delivery which was after the murder the inspector is happy about that but theres a scissors sharpener whos come to light the man swears he was with walsh the night the priest was killed whats the likelihood that hes telling the truth inspector blevins has gone to speak to the man himself the inspectors not in the best of spirits i can tell you there was a man sitting on the edge of the quay when rutledge came back to the hotel under his dangling feet a dozen or so ducks padded about in the muddy trickle of water catching the bits of stale bread that were being thrown down to them the mans concentration was intense as he fed them the slump of his shoulders was familiarrutledge had seen him bent over a newspaper at a table in the back corner of the pelican a gray cat curious about all the feathery activity sat some ten feet away watching the ducks it seemed to ignore the man as if he had no reality but was only a part of the quay closer rutledge could see the strain on the haggard face etched by the bright sunlight into deep and defensive lines the dark hair was threaded with gray it was an odd time of the afternoon to see a man sitting idle rutledge passed him by turning toward the hotel as he entered the lobby mrs barnett stuck her head out of the tiny cubicle that served as her office she smiled and said inspector theres been a telephone message from london for you would you care to return it now it was a message from sergeant wilkerson and after nearly three quarters of an hour of searching for the man wilkerson was located and instructed to contact rutledge again wilkersons rough voice came down the line with such a roar that rutledge had to hold the receiver away from his ear the sergeant was of the school that believed that shouting compensated for any small insufficiencies in the telephone system chief superintendent bowles asked me to find you sir he wants you back in london as soon as may be im involved with the investigation here rutledge began defensively yes sir he knows that but weve found a body whether shes connected with your murder or not we cant say but the chief superintendent wants you to have a look rutledge felt cold there was no clear reasoning behind his reaction but he was afraid to ask the name afraid he might already know what it was hed only just heard it himself marianna elizabeth trent another dead end driving hard and fast rutledge reached london in the middle of the next morning stopping briefly at his flat to shave and change his clothes he went in search of sergeant wilkerson at the yard they had not worked together very often wilkerson was inspector joyces man and seldom free for other assignments joyce in his midfifties was a plodding but thorough policeman with no expectation of advancement and no desire for any he had said often enough that policework and not paperwork was his pleasure and the higher one goes the deeper the tonnage of paper wilkerson greeted rutledge with some surprise you must have driven all the night sir would you care for a spot of tea brought up to your office i did hamish was all that had kept him awake on the road after colchester and even hamish had lost his edge on the outskirts of london yes send someone for tea and then come upstairs the tea provided by the yard was black and strong enough to cope with any mans drowsiness coating the stomach with an unspeakable sludge that held the body upright for hours a few minutes later wilkerson stepped into rutledges office and took the chair by the door he waited until the constable on his heels had delivered rutledges tea before beginning his report the sergeant was as big as his voice florid of face with thinning sandy hair and a double chin that overlapped the collar of his uniform giving the impression he was on the brink of choking to death a man who had come up through the ranks but bore no malice toward rutledge who had come from a very different background he began his report diffidently about this woman sir it was the usual thing one of the boats on the river found her cant say whether she went in by accident or design bloated but hadnt been there long enough for the fish to get at her there were some bruises but nothing to signify anything more than the tossing shed taken in the water the problem was identification rutledge swallowing his tea with a grimace nodded identification of the corpse was the first order of police work she had none on herno letters or papers or the likeand she didnt match any of our missing persons records we advertised more than a week for information then a woman who keeps a boardinghouse walked into a local station and reported that a lodger had skipped without paying her rent and wanted her found right balmy old bitch im told arrogant and demanding but the sergeant on duty remembered the description of our lass and soon enough they had the landlady down at the morgue she couldnt have identified the bodyshe only gave it a glancebut she did say the hair was right we showed her the clothes the deceased was found in but she wasnt what youd call certain what the lodger was wearing the last time shed gone out or whether she could have been provided a new wardrobe by any gentleman she had taken up with but the landlady did fling another fit about not getting her money which made inspector joyce suspect she must be fairly sure it was the missing woman rutledge asked before wilkerson could put a name to the corpse any trouble with her before the landlady none except for the occasional lodger who disappears with back rent owing then shes demanding the police earn their keep she gets a class of women who arent steadily employed if you take my meaning why did chief superintendent bowles think the dead woman might be connected with the murder in norfolk stands to reason doesnt it the lass worked as a shill for an italian bloke whothe landlady claimsdied in the war then she spent the better part of the summer with a strong mans show called himself samson your man walsh it appears landlady remembers when he came to collect her because of his size they had a few words did the landlady and this iris kenneth on parting but mrs rollings took her back again when the strong man was tired of her iris kenneth then with no connection to father james after a visit to the morgue to look at the body and the womans clothing rutledge went with sergeant wilkerson to the small boardinghouse on a rundown street where londoners with thin pockets often took rooms it was just off eustace road where industry had crowded out anyone who could afford to move on mrs rollings was plump with tightly curled black hair a pinched mouth and an air of longsuffering when wilkerson introduced rutledge to her she looked him up and down then said bristling it doesnt do my establishment any good to have a policeman at the door every other day this is a respectable house rutledge smiled im sure it is she thawed visibly as the smile touched his eyes weve come to ask if you still have iris kenneths belongings lord love you why should i have kept them didnt bring in much i can tell you not near enough to pay what i was owed and i needed the room she looked up and down the street with the same suspicious air with which shed regarded rutledge and then stepped back from the door do come inside before i have to explain to half the neighborhood why im entertaining the police again they followed her into a musty entry where a flight of worn stairs ran up into darkness the windowless entry itself was nearly as dark for the glass panes in the door didnt cast light beyond the first step and the lamp was turned so low that it had long since given up trying to illuminate anything but the small circle of brightness on the gray ceiling and the first landing mrs rollings opened a door on her left and led them into her sitting room it was surprisingly comfortable if shabby there were odds and ends of porcelain on the mantelpiece including a demure shepherdess with a leering satyr at her shoulder the juxtaposition of the pieces was nearly lewd rutledge wondered if it exemplified mrs rollingss sense of humor or the tastes of her guests prints on the other two walls were of theatrical productions one sarah bernhardts hamlet and the other a popular act in the music halls some twenty years ago mrs rollings herself wore rouge that stood out like two fever spots under the powder and her hair was dyed the jeweled rings on her plump fingers were cheap paste one of them large enough to have poison secreted in it rutledges opinion was that it might have once been a prop in an italian play she offered them the horsehair settle and the two men sat gingerly side by side on the stiff upholstery it smelled of dust and old dog she herself took a very pretty wing chair covered with a faded but handsome brocade on the table at her elbow was a collection of shells and a number of pottery jugs with the names of seaside towns painted on them where her guests had worked hamish his covenanter soul offended by anything remotely smacking of the godless theatrical world mrs rollings inhabited declared shes no going to give you an honest answer it isna in her nature well see rutledge told him aloud he asked did you like miss kenneth what has liking got to do with it she stared at him genuinely surprised as long as my guests pay me on time and in full i like them very well was she a clever girl she was pretty she thought that would take her far but not far enough if she ended up in the river mrs rollings leaned forward now what was this about iriss belongings there was an avaricious glint in her eyes do you know if she might have owned a pair of old shoes a mans with a worn heel and a tear in the sole mrs rollingss eyebrows rose almost to her hairline old shoes mens shoes yes wed like very much to know if she possessed such a pair realizing that the concept was totally foreign to his hostess rutledge added perhaps from some role or other wilkerson stolid and silent was looking around the room as if he expected to find something nasty hidden behind the wallpaper well i should think not she wasnt the kind of girl who played in farceshe didnt have the talent for it it was more in her line to stand there looking respectable and drawing custom she was quite lovely in green youd have thought her a lady if she didnt open her mouth lovely was pronounced as luuvley wilkerson said then you are telling us that no such shoes were found in her belongings none that i know of and i was fairly careful in searching through them would anothererguest have searched them before you did the sergeant continued here theres no stealing in my house no surely not rutledge soothed but if you come across old shoes like those ive describedeven in an unexpected placewill you send a message to sergeant wilkerson here is there a reward for what you want to know she asked sharply no but it will be in the public interest her expression informed him what she thought of the public interest hamish had been right rutledge stood up and wilkerson lumbered to his feet as well youve been most helpful mrs rollings thank you for your time she regarded them warily uncertain if it was truly old shoes that had brought the police around theres nothing else you wanted to know about her things only if shed pinched any of them wilkerson answered that silenced mrs rollings anything nice enough to have been stolen had already found its way to the next owner or a shop dealing in secondhand goods no questions asked she saw them out with poor grace and shut the door on their heels sergeant wilkerson laughed shes a right old besom but there are any number on the street like her he gestured in either direction at houses no better kept than hers their paint peeling and roofs showing stains from years of damp but they serve a purpose many a pretty girl who went out to seek her fame and fortune would be lucky to wind up here and not selling herself in the stews theres not been a lot of work for this lot what with the war and all but theyve managed to survive somehow they always do this iris kenneth would have had an eye for the main chance and yet she ended her life in the river rutledge compared the street here with osterley where prosperity had slipped away but dignity and resourcefulness had kept up appearances well sergeant wilkerson added as he turned to walk back to rutledges motorcar it wasnt much to go on but you never know the epitaph of police work rutledge thought yes he answered but id give much to know if iris kenneth was pushed or was desperate enough to throw herself into the water you think that man walsh might have wanted to be rid of her its possible if she helped him rob the priests house or she may have been working for someone else with a better reason to kill her than walsh had the iris kenneths of this world seldom live to old age although mrs rollings had it depended he thought whether the woman was clever or naive whether she could protect herself or was destined to be a victim he started the motorcar and stepped up behind the wheel ill be going back to norfolk he told wilkerson will you pass that message to chief superintendent bowles and if theres any more information about this iris kenneth or her death i want to know about it aye ill see to that the sergeant promised he sighed i never fancied drowning myself id look to a quicker way of dying my first inspector told me that women preferred drowning because it didnt hurt and it didnt mar the face when i saw my first corpse from the river i knew he was wrong we never identified her no one could have rutledge went to his flat and slept for two hours then headed north again but when he reached colchester he pulled into the dark yard of the rose and crown and slept until dawn it was nearly dinnertime when he reached osterley the muscles in his chest ached and his stomach rebelled at the thought of a formal meal at the hotel after washing up he walked down to the pelican the cool night air with its tang of the sea and the earthy scent of the marshes welcomed him like an old friend chapter the pelican was busy with the dinner hour noisy with voices and laughter and the rattle of dishes and crowded with local people the bar had a line of patrons leaning on their elbows and talking to or over each other one seated on a wooden stool held a little grayandwhite dog in his lap the tables near the windows were occupied by small groups of diners already served or waiting their turn among them was the woman he had seen at the church two days agowas it only twositting with several men and another woman just finishing their soup they were deeply immersed in their conversation and no one looked up as rutledge walked past he took a small table nearer the bar where he would feel less confined by the press of people the tiny island of space around him was a welcomed relief hamish sensing his unease argued warily for a return to the hotel for it willna do to make a scene here i wont rutledge answered shortly but he could feel himself tensing as more customers came in one group searching for a table a smaller one heading for the bar hailed warmly by friends as he watched them pass he noticed in the back corner occupied with a newspaper the man hed seen at the quay feeding the ducks and another time here alone in the same seat crowded as the room was no one asked to sit with him the man had the air of a fixture at the pelican as permanent as the bench on which he sat and the table braced and nailed to the wall the strained face was bent over the opened paper and neither betsy nor the older couple helping her serve took any heed of him hed ordered tea for there was a pot and a cup by his elbow as if sensing rutledges glance his knuckles seemed to tighten on the page crimping it hamish said derisively hes no a verra popular man no doubt youll find you have much in common god save him then rutledge answered silently betsy finally stopped at rutledges little table her manner more formal than it had been the first day he had arrived in the village good evening inspector are you wishing to dine or could i bring you something from the bar no longer what would you like love rutledge smiled what would you recommend for dinner he asked her youre fortunate tonight she said theres a roast of chicken with dumplings and potatoes and i can tell you theres nothing like it this side of london rutledge felt an unexpected surge of sympathy for the woman in a book hed once read who had been branded with an a for adulteress everyone in osterley knew more of his business than he knew of theirs hed been branded with an o for outsiderno longer the visitor who was benign no longer the anonymous traveler who could ask questions and expect an honest answer there was neither coldness nor rudeness in their manner only a formality that precluded any expectation of breaking through it how long he wondered did it take a man to reach the status of one of ours in this village for a policeman who hadnt been born here perhaps never for a passing stranger there was welcome and courtesy for an intruder only suspicion and yet father james had come to be one of theirs he chose the chicken with dumplings and ordered a pint to go with it although he tried to keep his eyes away from the table by the window and to stop himself from speculating about the relationships of the four people sitting there rutledge caught himself glancing that way from time to time the woman had a quiet vivacity and seemed to be comfortable with both men it emphasized the formality she had displayed toward him on the few occasions when theyd spoken a stranger even among strangers he turned slightly to change his line of sight indirectly now he could see the lonely man sitting in the corner he served only to reflect rutledges own isolation hamish had struck a chord with his words as rutledge watched the mans hands began to tremble and he hastily shoved them out of sight under the table dropping the newspaper as if it had burned him shell shock rutledge shuddered hamish suddenly aware and challenging in his mind he himself had so narrowly escaped from that horror and the fierce agony of it still haunted him to be shellshocked was to be publicly branded a cowarda man unfit to be mentioned in the same breath as the soldier with a missing limb or shotaway jaw a shamea disgrace not an honorable wound but the mark of failure as a man he himself had been caged with the screaming shaking pathetic remnants of humanity in a clinic that kept them shut firmly away from the public eye until dr fleming had rescued him he made a point not to look back again after examining the oddities that decorated the pub and counting the number of diners rutledge set himself the task of cataloging from memory the framed photographs in the priests house but none of those he could call to mind seemed important enough to require a codicil to a will certainly most of them would go along with the rest of his possessions to father jamess surviving sister who would cherish those of the family and perhaps pass on a few to father jamess friends as was right gifford had already indicated that mrs wainer knew nothing about any bequest but if the photograph wasnt in the desk it must surely be somewhere there was no reason why walsh or anyone else should wish to steal it however there might be perhaps some way to jog a memory the housekeeper wasnt aware she had that would have to wait until tomorrow unwillingly aware of the occasional quiet laughter coming from the table by the window where the darkhaired woman sat rutledge felt a sense of depression settle around him and he fought against it without any help from hamish rutledge was more than halfway through his roast chicken when the woman sitting by the window got up from her table and walked toward him he thought for an instant she was coming to speak to him and had nearly risen to his feet when he realized that her eyes were fixed on something behind him he turned the man in the corner was shaking like a leaf in the wind his shoulders jerking with it the woman crossed to him and sat on the bench opposite him reaching out she caught his hands before he could hide them again and began to speak to him rutledge watching had the feeling it was not the first time shed done this something in her voicewhether the words or simply the soundhad a calming effect and for a moment rutledge thought she had actually stemmed the tide of whatever it was that drove the man into such a frenzy of trembling he was just turning away again when the man surged abruptly to his feet with such force that he overturned the bench on which he sat the unexpected clatter of the wood on the floor stopped conversation in its tracks every head turned toward the man and the woman and he stood there like a hare caught in the headlamps unable to move his eyes were shocked almost beyond seeing rutledge rose and strode forward reaching the man and taking his shoulder in a firm grip the man flinched away and the woman said sharply but in a voice that didnt carry beyond the three of them leave him alone hes done nothing to you rutledge ignored her he said to the trembling man whose face had turned away toward the wall all right soldier lets get some air it was the timbre of his voice that got through an officers voice steady and assured for a long moment the tableau was unbroken the furious woman the man in the throes of a breakdown and the outsider who had interfered and then it altered dissolving into movement the woman stepping aside lips tightly shut and eyes worried and rutledge seeming to walk away without looking back his shoulders as ramrod straight as if he still wore a uniform an officer expected a soldier to obey unquestioned loyalty to rank was the hallmark of training rutledge drew on that now hamish said he wont follow hes beyond heeding rutledge had taken no more than two strides when the man moved away from the fallen bench and with rutledge just ahead of him almost a shield walked through the gauntlet of staring eyes and through the door out into the night the woman her face pale with distress followed outside rutledge didnt stop until he was well away from the pelicans door nearly to the quay in the darkness of the waterside he stood staring out to sea not looking at the man who had stopped some little distance from him then he said as if addressing a comrade theres a wind coming up but its a beautiful night still the man just behind him cleared his throat thank you he said roughly as if finding it hard to speak he hesitated there were too many people in there claustrophobia rutledge knew it all too well yes suddenly i couldnt breathei thought i was dying but i never do worst luck there was almost a lightness in the words that belied their intensity but rutledge felt sure the man meant them he had himself on more than one occasion fraught with panic in the war were you it was a common enough question but the man flinched for a time he said and then he walked away unsteadily but strongly as if wanting to be alone more than he needed human companionship the woman watching the scene said he was in the war he was a sniper she flung out the last word as if daring rutledge to say anything daring him to condemn rutledge said snipers saved my life any number of times and the lives of my men why should i find that so terrible everyone else does her voice was bitter he tried to see her face but it was hidden the lights from the pelican barely touched her hair like a pale halo behind her head why he shot from ambush it wasnt very gallant it was assassination if you will not the thing you know her voice altered twisting the words as if she was quoting someone he heard an echo he thought of lord sedgwick in them but couldnt be sure he killed from ambush yes its true rutledge answered her tersely such men took out the machine gunners when we couldnt they could move in the night as silently as a snake or fox waiting for their chance then making their shot some of the other men werent too pleased about what they did i suppose it must have seemed unsportsmanlike but i can tell you they were life when we expected to die she said surprised youre a policeman i expected you to condemn what hed done as tantamount to murder was it murder he looked out across the dark silent marshes listening for the sea i suppose it was he said tiredly those men were deadly they seldom missed the german gunners never had a chance a good many of our snipers were scots with years of stalking behind them others had aknack for silence for stealth they were brave very brave to do what they did i never judged them his own father judged peter henderson alfie henderson was one of father jamess failures he never forgave his son not even on his deathbed even though father james begged him to heal the breach between them i think alfie would have been happier if peter had never come home from france he believed that being a sniper had brought dishonor to the family name rutledge swore under his breath it was often that waypeople at home soldiers families in particular seldom understood what war was all about their gallant men marched away in crisp uniforms caps at a jaunty angle flags flying and went to france to kill the hun how that was done never seemed quite as clear young men in the filthy trenches were not likely to write to their mothers or their young wives and tell the truth war was neither dashing nor colorful nor honorable it was simply bloody and terrible even the government had entered into the conspiracy of silence for as long as it dared wearily he tried to explain the germans actually trained soldiers as snipers did you know that they had schools to teach their best shots we quite cleverly used whomever we could find hamish was saying something but rutledge didnt hear it the woman in front of him was also speaking he caught the last of that wasnt given his job back after the war no one else in osterley will hire him hes nearly destitute and wont accept help father james believedbut now that hes dead mrs barnett and the vicar try to see that peter is fed but he doesnt want pity her voice cracked and she added its never the evil people is it who suffer its always the lonely ones who are already afraid she turned on her heel going back into the pelican to rejoin her party not hungry any more rutledge stood there for a time in the darkness of the october night and then walked back to the hotel he would settle his bill in the morning when he came into the lobby rutledge was greeted by mrs barnett she gestured toward the small parlor you have a visitor inspector a visitor he repeated his mind still on the darkness hed just left on peter henderson and father james miss connaught he brought his attention back to the present ah thank you mrs barnett with a nod he walked past the stairs and to the small parlor as he opened the door priscilla connaught got to her feet and faced him as if facing the hangman i saw you with lord sedgwick the other morning and then i was told you had gone back to london is it finished then the reward paid and the case of father jamess death finally closed she looked as if she hadnt slept dark rings under her eyes and a nervous tic at the corner of her mouth the handsome dark blue suit she wore seemed nearly black emphasizing her pallor rutledge recalled what she had told himthat with father james dead she herself had no reason to live he wondered what she did each day when not absorbed in her anger did she read write letters to friends or sit and stare out at the marshes waiting for something that would never come peace perhaps he answered with some care i went to london on other business as far as i know the probe into matthew walshs movements hasnt been completed there has been no mention of passing out a reward not in my hearing oh she seemed shaken as if she had been so very certain that she hadnt thought beyond the need to find out if she was right rutledge studying her face hought shes in worse straits than peter henderson father james was an obsession she couldnt live without like a drug only far more deadly hamish said aye but theres naught to be done you canna stop the investigation rutledge gestured to the chair she had risen from but she shook her head and then as if her legs wouldnt support her any longer she sank back into the seat do you know lord sedgwick well miss connaught lord sedgwick hardly at all i have met his son edwinbut that must be close to sixteen or seventeen years ago now she sounded distracted as if only half her mind was on what she was saying here in osterley rutledge persisted keeping to a neutral topic no edwin sometimes stayed with a family i knew in london he was little more than a boy at the time and i didnt like him very much why not he was very easily bored and more than a little selfish hed lost his mother and everyone rather spoiled him but ive heard that he turned out rather wellhe was on someones staff at the peace conference last spring and arthur i know him by sight of course but weve never met like his father he was married to an american womani did meet her once at a vicarage tea id been persuaded to attend one of those sweet girls with little to say for herself and unbelievably pretty they spent most of the year in yorkshire and seldom came to osterley later i heard that shed died she was beginning to breathe more regularly now finding it easier to carry on a polite conversation the intensity that had held her on the edge of breakdown was draining away and in its place was a precarious control again lord sedgwick was concerned about the brakes on your motorcar he rather enjoys playing lord of the manor and ive good reason to thank him for thathis chauffeur rescued me once when id lost my way and run out of petrol as if realizing that she was steadier she asked again are you surehave you told me the whole truth about walsh her eyes begged him for an honest answer yes he said gently i have no reason to lie to you and yet he thought he had shed been distraught enough to do something foolish before shed reasoned out the consequences aye hamish said it wouldna do to have her blood on your hands she stood up again i must be on my way whatever rumors you hear rutledge told her come to me and ill tell you the truth i give you my word priscilla connaught took a deep breath and let it out slowly im not sure i can believe you i dont know i cant somehow think straight it might be a good idea to speak to dr stephenson someone you trust she laughed a hollow and mirthless sound theres not much a medical doctor can do for a shattered life i wish you would tell me what father james priscilla connaught shook her head with finality it had nothing to do with his death only with his life and thats finished over and done with she looked around saw her purse on the table and as she picked it up spoke again ive lain awake at night wondering who could have murdered him if there was someone else hed treated as cruelly as hed treated me i think id be happier believing that than in the story of a thief then she turned toward rutledge again thank you for your concern inspector she said with great poise as if theyd spent an evening in pleasant conversation and she was leaving the party youve been quite kind and with that she wished him a good night and walked past him out the door another of father jamess failures he thought watching the door close behind her like peter hendersons father how many were there mrs barnett was still in the office when rutledge came back to the lobby and paused by the desk yes inspector she said looking up im told that mr sims frederick gifford and father james dined together from time to time did they come here yes about twice a month generally occasionally it would be just father james and the vicar ive always looked forward to having them come they were no trouble at all and id enjoy chatting with them when i brought their tea to the lounge the memory of that caught her for a moment its not easy running this hotel on my own i have so little time for anything else it was almost like having friends drop by because they would tell me about a book i might enjoy reading or where someone they knew had been traveling or even a bit of news from london that i hadnt heard my husband knew all of them quite well you see and in a small way it brought him back to me for just a little while something to look forward to it was a gratification rutledge did not have and he had after a fashion come to terms with the fact that how he lived today on the edge of breakdown and exhaustion would be a pattern he could expect in his tomorrows it was not selfpity whatever hamish drummed into his head but acceptance the price of living with himself mrs barnett hesitated on the point of wishing him a good night instead he asked would you give me the name of the young woman who is also staying here something altered in her face im sorry inspector shes a guest here and you must ask her yourself hamish said its no unusual for a hotel to guard the privacy of a woman traveling alone rutledge inexplicably angry as if accused of a breach of manners said curtly its a matter of police business mrs barnett not personal interest the words were hardly out of his mouth before he regretted them but it was too late to recall them mrs barnett stared at him as if she didnt believe him then she replied stiffly her name is trent inspector he didnt hear what else she was saying something about somerset is her first name marianna shes registered as may trent but may was often a diminutive for mary the queen mary was called may by her family had gifford known marianna trent was staying in osterley hed chosen not to tell rutledge that or was he trying to make sure that rutledge didnt go in search of the woman you didna ask hamish informed him the next morning rutledge found inspector blevins already in his office at the station a letter lay open on the blotter in front of him he looked up as a constable ushered rutledge into the room and nodded i hope your morning has been fairer than mine rutledge said the scissors sharpener yes a man named bolton he swears walsh was with him the night the priest was murdered it wont be easy to pry the truth out of him if there is any truth to be had i have another bit of bad news the london police believe theyve found the body of iris kenneth in the thames the woman who kept the lodgings where iris kenneth lived was satisfied enough to sell her belongings for whatever they might bring blevins was staring at him when was she found a week ago two days before you picked up walsh damn blevins leaned back in his chair its like dealing with a willothewispyou no sooner think you have your hands on the truth when it evaporates like morning fog do you think walsh might have killed her to shut her up god knows theres no real evidence to support murder she may have killed herself or someone else may have put her into the water i did ask mrs rollings about an old pair of mens shoes she couldnt believe that iris kenneth had ever owned anything of the kind blevins reached for the letter hed tossed aside read this it was a statement from the cart maker one matthew walsh had contracted with him for a new cart on august and had paid on account until the agreedupon sum had been reached the last payment four days after father jamess death was in small notes and coins the problem was the other three payments had been as well its a conspiracy thats what it is blevins went on sourly standing by each otherthe cart maker the scissors sharpener walsh i dont know what to believe its odd isnt it for a scissors sharpener to be friendly with a strong man who frequents bazaars and small fairs they arent of the same class one is an itinerant peddler the other a showman of sorts yes id thought about that but theres a connection in fact the two men were in the same unit in the war war changes things it did you learned to trust a man not because of what he had been in civilian life but for what kind of soldier he made whether your life was safe in his hands when you went over the top or whether he was likely to get you killed which could matter enough for this man bolton to lie for him hamish was saying orbolton might have been standing watch the night of the murder it might well have been boltons shoe print out by the lilac bushes rutledge said aloud id considered that i dont think i could prove it not without the shoe he was wearing at the time but theres a possibility all the same witnesses saw bolton any number of times that day but no one saw walsh bolton claims he came in just after dusk could be the truth what does walsh say what youd expect he was happy to claim it was true and he demanded to be released at once inspector blevinss lips twisted in a bitter smile as for helping us with our inquiries ive pried more information from a razor clam rutledge asked if walsh isnt your manfor whatever reasonwhere will you look next blevins said grimly i bloody well dont know id already looked at the good people of osterley before walsh turned up as a likely suspect and there was nothing i could find that made any sense nothing that pointed to someone wanting to murder father james theft was the most likely reason for what happened and walsh was the most likely thief but its early days yet ive yet to hear from the war office were still tracking walshs movements and i am going to crack boltons alibi if i can early days he said again as if to convince himself do you know a priscilla connaught yes she lives alone out by the marshes and seldom mixes with anyone in osterley as far as i know shes a member of st annes so are fifty other people sixty blevins leaned forward his elbows on the blotter my money is still on walsh until im satisfied that theres no earthly chance hes guilty he looked at rutledge pain in his face ive told you before i want the killer to be a stranger i dont want it to be anyone i know i dont want to think that any member of st annes parish any friend of mine any neighbor any enemy for that mattercould murder a priest and yet hamish said he was killed rutledge said it would be easier to watch a stranger hang blevins shook his head ill watch the murderer hang it wont matter to me if i know his face or not it isnt the hanging that i cant live with its the thought that someone i have seen every day in osterley is capable of such a crime he regarded rutledge for a moment youre not a catholic you may not see this the way i do i dont see that being a catholic has anything to do with it he refused to be drawn beyond that the inspector looked away his eyes moving on to the high sootstreaked ceiling as if searching for answers there murder isnt finished by killing thats what ive learned in this business its just the beginning a death opens doors that are better left shut im a very good policeman i do my duty and i mind my town like a bitch watching her pups i see that people live in safety and in peace if not in harmony and the harmony is gone now against his will rutledge said what do you know about peter henderson blevinss eyes came back to him peter i dont think hes capable of killing anyone ever again there was a pause but his shoes are old and worn and father james did his best to heal the breach with peters father when he couldnt he tried to make peter swallow his pride and go to the old man and beg forgiveness if only to be accepted back into the family at the end theyfather james and peterquarreled about that publicly down on the quay you could probably make a good case for peter henderson but i dont want to the poor devils suffered enough rutledge retrieved his motorcar from the hotel and drove to old point road his destination the rectory mrs wainer surprised to see him opened the door wide and said come in sir has there been any news no im afraid not i wanted to ask you from the kitchen came an old voice saying oo is it ruth is it tommy its the policeman from london dear she turned back to rutledge apologetic its mrs beeling shes come for a cup of tea and a gossip in the kitchen i wont keep you rutledge began but the housekeeper shook her head no come along back if you dont mindshes not well and i dont like leaving her alone too long he followed mrs wainer down the passage to the kitchen the woman at the table was swathed in shawls as if she felt cold her gnarled fingers closed around a cup of tea and her clouded eyes turned toward the door thats not tommy she stated regarding rutledge with obvious suspicion tommy beeling is her grandson mrs wainer said in explanation to rutledge no martha its the policeman from london inspector rutledge the old eyes sharpened oh aye mrs beeling nodded her head almost regally as if welcoming rutledge to her own house the one come to find out who killed our priest feeling as if he werent there rutledge bade her a good morning and then turned back to mrs wainer she was saying tommythats her grandsondrops her off here for a little visit on his way to market martha used to speak to father james for ten minutes or so and then wed have our tea here in the kitchen she gestured toward the kettle on the stove the waters still hot sir if youd care to have a cup i could bring it to you in the parlor thank you no i do need to ask you a question and then ill be on my way if mrs beeling doesnt mind martha beeling didnt in point of fact she was delighted to be a witness rutledge asked the photographs that father james kept about the house do you recognize the people in all of them as to recognizing mrs wainer said doubtfully no i cant say that but i knew who most of them were his parents of coursehis sister and her husbandthe brother and sister that diedmonsignor holstonfriends from seminary hed point them out sometimes when i was dusting and say to me ruth ive just had a letter from john there and hes taking up a church in gloucestershire or hed heard that one or another had gone to rome or to ireland it was like family you know the way they kept up with each other was there a photograph of anyone whose name he never gave you someone he never identified for you i wasnt one to pry sir he told me what he wished to tell me i never asked she bristled a little as if he had questioned her integrity if youre meaning that photograph that mr gifford was looking for i dont know which it could be hamish said you must tread wi care yon lawyer willna wish for you to make too much of the bequest and not in front of the inquisitive mrs beeling rutledge patiently explained im looking for information you see about father james about the people he knewand trustedand cared about not only the seminary and his family but individuals as well a soldier hed befriended at the front a woman hed known long before he became a priest nothing suspicious or doubtful only a personal memory that hed kept to himself youre welcome to see for yourself the truth is after mr gifford left ive thought about it a good bit and theres nothing out of the ordinary he tried another possibility do you know a miss trent the lady at the hotel oh yes sir shes called on father james a time or two the man she was to marry he was killed in the war and shes finishing the book hed begun as a memorial so to speak its all about whats to be found in old churchesmisericords brasses pew ends baptismal panels that sort of thing before he went off to france her young man had written all the book except the chapter on norfolk as youd expect father james knew the history of any number of the churches up here in the north and was helping her suddenly enlightened rutledge remembered that lord sedgwick had referred to may trent as having a religious bent he could understand why such a mistake had been made if she spent so much of her time visiting churches mrs beeling spoke up youre speaking of that pretty lady who was here to tea once when i came very kind she was asking after my tommy to rutledge she said tommy nearly lost a leg in the war he still limps something fierce the bones not knitting right and that carried her to a new train of thought you was the policeman in the motorcar tother day with lord sedgwick tommy was taking me to the doctor and he said he saw the inspector with his lordship but i took it to mean inspector blevins and that made no sense at all why not rutledge asked his lordships far above taking up inspector blevins proud man like his father and he was as mean as they come my grandmother was parlor maid to the chastains that lived in the hall before the first lord sedgwick took it over when she married the coachman they was given a graceandfavor cottage in the village for life no such thing when i married my ted head gardener ted was and the old lordralph this uns fatherhe knew the gatehouse cottage was coming open and he never said a word but this uns wife she tried to make up for it and was kind enough to give me a brooch to wear on my wedding day the old woman fumbled in her shawls and held out a lovely little enameled brooch a hunting scene of hounds and horsemen over a fence after the fox thats an american hunt that is not one of ours see the fence wood railings you can tell by the fence she had remembered exactly what shed been told about the little brooch and it was a prized possession one she wore when calling on friends rutledge admired it and she beamed with pleasure then as classconscious in her own way as any member of the aristocracy she added spitefully they both married americans you know the present lord and his son arthur couldnt find no titled english lady that would have them smelling as they did of london trade it wasnt old money you see she glanced at mrs wainers pursed lips well i should say the present lord found himself a wellborn bride over there and she was very kind died of her appendix she did mr arthurs was a love match they tell me he went one summer to visit his cousins on his mothers side and fell in love with one of them she ended triumphantly and i met that one too a pretty little thing shy as a violet but ralphs wifecharlotte i think her name waswas long dead when he was given the title just as well they say she was no better than she ought to be a londoner she was mrs wainer threw an apologetic glance at rutledge and said now then martha let me warm up your tea she rinsed the pot and turned to lift the kettle pouring the steaming water over fresh leaves but mrs beeling was delighted with a new audience arthurs wife is the one that drowned on that ship that went down she ran off from arthur they say though no one knows quite why except that he was away in france racing whenever he could and she must have been lonely out in the middle of nowhere like she was here in east sherham rutledge asked encouraging her lord love you not here they lived over to yorkshire where arthur had bought a house after the marriage he never got along with his brother edwin i wondered if edwin didnt care for his sisterinlaw more than he should the story was hed head to yorkshire on that motorcycle of his as soon as arthur set out for france both were motorcycle mad one time or another noisy smelly machines to my mind edwin still has one ive seen it mrs wainer brought the fresh pot of tea and added more small cakes to a plate now you help yourself martha and ill just see the inspector out mrs beeling was still enjoying herself i dont quite know why he took you up in his car she added returning to more recent events perplexed unless it was to hand over the reward money he put up for father jamess murderer as far as i know theres been no reward given to anyone rutledge said she nodded sagely im of two minds about yon strong man i was at the bazaar and he never exchanged more than a word with father james and him decorated like a clown but he was in this house in the afternoon mrs wainer said earnestly i found the strong man wandering about inside this house she cast a resigned glance in rutledges direction thats what alerted inspector blevins to look for him yes and a dozen other people were in here as well i saw lord sedgwicks son come to have a liedown when his back was paining him i asked him if i might bring him a glass of water and he said thank you but no there was also the doctors wife to put a plaster on mrs cullens cut finger and the sedgwicks were at the bazaar rutledge asked although he knew they were but mrs beeling seemed to have perfect recall osterley doesnt have a lord you see mrs beeling explained graciously though theres always been good blood here the cullens and the giffords and so on but theres no title still the family does try to make an appearance on special days and thats as it should be she nodded the sedgwicks were not old money but they were still money as for arthur hes in terrible pain they say but he can get about hed come down for the fete and stayed on for that herbert bakers funeral he was at herbert bakers funeral the garrulous old woman had given rutledge more information in a quarter of an hour than anyone else had done in several days of asking questions of course he was herbert baker had been his fathers coachman and then driven arthurs wife about in the motorcar until her death rutledge turned to mrs wainer and said if you dont mind ill take you up on the offer of a cup of tea she wasnt pleased to serve him in the kitchen and as it turned out he wasted the next quarter of an hour whatever her sources were for the gossip she had freely dispensed rutledge discovered that mrs beeling had nothing more of interest to tell him except that she most certainly had her own opinion on why herbert baker had seen two priests shortly before he died when youre old things begin to prey on your mind she told him affably as if from personal knowledge you wake up in the night dwelling on what was done or left undone and it seems far worse in the darkness than it ever was in the light until you take to brooding on it more often thans good for you you take to worrying that its too late to make amends i know myself sometimes it weighs heavily on me the things ive said and done theres nights when my bones are aching and i cant sleep and id even bow down to those heathen idols that his lordship has in his garden if i thought it might clear my mind the watchers of time rutledge said but what had herbert baker done that made him send for the vicar and the priest whos to say but i heard hes the one who let arthurs wife step out of the motorcar in kings lynn and then went off to get himself drunk while she was speaking with the shopkeepers about a birthday party only she never visited the shops she went instead to the station and took the next train to london and disappeared until the ship went down and they discovered the poor lady had been aboard it made sense hamish listening to the nuances behind the words agreed guilt might have tormented herbert bakerwho had the gift of loyalty not a sin of commission but instead failure to do ones duty for a single hour his drinking couldnt have set in motion any of the events that had followed all the same he might have bitterly blamed himself for them ififif if i had been thereif i hadnt been drinking if i had minded my duty was that what lay on a dying mans conscience driving him to try to buy himself absolution in two faiths chapter rutledge driving back to the hotel told himself that herbert baker was proving to be a dead end but the bequeathed photograph was still elusive he braked to a slow pace behind a wain piled high with hay rutledge was beginning to wonder if the killer hadnt taken it with him did that explain the ransacking of the desk but what would walshor his accomplice for that matterwant with a photograph how would they have known it even existed and what earthly value did it have and if it did have value why had father james made a sudden decision to leave it to may trent whywhen he could have given it to her on the same day hed brought that carefully crafted paragraph into the solicitors office and asked to add a codicil to his will the wain reached the turning for gull street and the sherham road and began to swing wide to plod around the sharp corner abruptlywithout any warning rutledge found himself locked in an angry exchange with hamish it had nothing to do with the discussion in the rectory kitchen not directly it was instead an accusing and angry personal indictment i canna ken why yere sae keen on proving yon inspector wrong are you sae certain the strong man is innocent when you walk away fra this town youll leave behind raw wounds that willna heal as swiftly as yon hole in your chest its a cruel thing to stir up secrets to no purpose ye were sae set on herbert bakers confession as the key to this death and now the auld woman has explained why it wasna any sich thing there are too many questions about walsh if he killed the priest it had nothing to do with the bazaar money id wager a months pay on that and i cant go over blevinss head and ask the war office for information about where walsh served but that will have to be dealt with one way or another before we can discuss guilt or innocence i canna see how a photograph is important it may not be thats a part of police work tooto eliminate the variables and when the photograph also turns into a wildgoose chase yell go back to london rutledge said nothing the wain lumbered into the turn topheavy and awkward two young boys along the road shouted at the driver and began to run after him as if trying to overtake the wain their laughter spilling out like silver threads the team of great norfolk horses pulling the wain ignored the rowdy pair heads down and shoulders into their harness rutledge watched them concentrating on shutting out the voice in his head but hamish was not to be put off you willna see it but yere running from yoursel you couldna find peace in your sisters house you couldna find peace in your flat and then you couldna find peace at the yard and ye willna leave norfolk because theres nowhere else to go youre afraid because in hospital you discovered a fierce will to live rutledge answered grimly ive been shot before aye thats as may be piddling wounds that didna require more than bandaging at the aid station or a dram of whiskey this was verra different it left its mark why are ye sae afraid of living rutledge realized that the motorcar had not moved and the wain was nearly out of sight down the sherham road he drove on past the intersection and pulled into a tiny lane that ran between two houses there he put the gears in neutral set the brake and leaned back to rub his hands over his face as if to erase the emotion there it was something he had tried to shut out from hamish but the scot used to burrowing deep into his secrets had ferreted it out in truth it had little to do with scotland on the night of his second surgery he had heard the doctors telling frances that the odds were against him he might not survive going under the knife too close to be sure one of them had said and he had listened to francess voice in his drugged state halfway between consciousness and sleep he wont leave me alone she said fiercely he wont and then someone had leaned over his bed hovering in what appeared to be a mist but was only the anesthetic taking hold at the time it had given the white hair and the kind face an insubstantial air as if half dreamed theres nothing to fear son whatever happens but if you want to livehell listen be sure of it the south country voice speaking softly in rutledges ear was confident serene after that the darkness had come down and there had been no pain only peace it was not until many hours later that rutledge had come back in worse pain to wakefulness it had startled him to find himself alive and he had been terrified that hed begged to live when he had no right no right at all much later frances had brought the corpulent little clergyman in to meet him the doctors rutledge learned had sent for the man to offer comfort to her if her brother died in the light of day mr crosson was neither insubstantial nor half dreamed but a practical and straightforward rector who regarded the patient with sharp blue eyes and said well then mr rutledge im glad to see you know your own mind it was far from the solace that mr crosson had intended instead it had shaken rutledge as deeply as the lines of sleeplessness on francess face and it confused him as well all his energies for so very long had been concentrated on dying and to live was something he wasnt couldnt beprepared for oh aye was that it then hamish asked derisively most men would ha been glad to live to see an end to the case you went to hospital and buried your head in sand you went back to work to bury your head in sand and you stay here in norfolk to bury it again what do you want from me rutledge said tiredly listening to gulls call from the direction of the harbor he tried to defend his answer but their wild laughter distracted him you know that blevins needs to sort out this murder oh aye a training program for the local constabulary is it rutledge nearly lost his temper but hamish got there before him yere the man with a fine understanding of people they say can ye no understand yoursel dye think i wanted ye to die no like yon connaught woman i havena any wish for you to die no until im ready in france god wouldna have you and he doesna want you now but i do had he wanted to live rutledge asked himself as he put the motorcar into gear once more and took off the brake there was no honest answer to that there hadnt been for three weeks and hamish fell ominously silent as they passed the turning for water street and slowed for trinity lane rutledge made the turn into trinity lane and pulled the motorcar into the web of shadows cast by a tree just by the churchyard wall switching off the motor he sat back against his seat for a moment before stepping out into the light breeze that tempered the suns warmth from the churchyard where he walked deep in thought he could just catch the glimmer of the sea struck by the sun and bright enough to hurt the eyes seagulls were wheeling above the tower like white rooks their hoarse cries almost human he found he was listening to them instead not wanting to think not wanting to feel and then a woman called to him from the north porch of the church there you are inspector she said as if she had waited there for half an hour or more for him to arrive i thought youd forgotten he turned toward the church where may trent was crossing the grassy churchyard toward him you had said something this morning about wanting to speak with me rutledge had said nothing of the sort but as she moved away from the north porch a man followed her out of the church it was edwin sedgwick her face was toward rutledge and there was a pleading smile on it it made her look young and vulnerable yes i have to apologize for being late rutledge said immediately removing his hat and standing there by the first row of gravestones penitent edwin sedgwick moved gracefully in miss trents wake and she turned slightly to introduce the two men they shook hands sedgwick was saying id heard that youre assisting inspector blevins any luck with the investigation into walshs background i had to drive my brother to london yesterday i havent heard the latest news weve come up with a few pieces of information that seem to point in his direction rutledge responded you knew father james i think we werent congregants at st annes but of course everyone came to the bazaar my father was offering a prize in the childrens games looking back on it it seems to me that walsh was affable enough minding his own business and something of a success with the ladies hard to believe he was the sort to come back later and murder anyone much less father james the sun was in his face the cold gray eyes warmed by concern was there anyone else there that day who might have had words with the priest or showed any signs of unusual interest in the rectory on the contrary as far as i could tell it was an orderly crowd and the amusements seemed to keep them entertained the afternoon appeared to be very busy and i think father james was pleased he frowned as he tried to remember there was one skinned knee as i recall when some boys ran out to play among the graves my father quickly put a stop to that and mrs wainer bound up the wound my brother was in some pain because of his back and shortly after that he asked my father to drive him home i left with them he turned to may trent the famous bidding war began just after that she laughed oh yes mrs gardiner and mrs cullen saw a pitcher at the white elephant booth at exactly the same time father james finally had to ask them to draw lots i thought it was clever of him sedgwick looked at his watch i must be going evans is waiting for me at the hotel inspector he smiled at miss trent ill speak to you another time yes indeed she watched him stride briskly down the walk and turn toward osterley as he went through the gates then she quietly apologized to rutledge im so sorry i was nearly desperate and you came along just when i needed rescue what happened he came looking for me in the church and asked me to have dinner with him in kings lynn i told him i had other plans for this evening and he was just about to ask me about tomorrow night when i saw you out here hes an attractive man and probably not used to rejection but imid rather not establish a precedent by accepting his invitations it was such a relief to see you do you mind very much not at all but surely you could have managed if i hadnt come along with a lift of her chin she said yes of course but you see peter henderson wasnt feeling well and he was resting in one of the pews down by the altar screen where it was cool wrapped in a blanket that the vicar keeps there for him i didnt want edwin sedgwick to jump to conclusions her face turned a becoming shade of pink rutledge smiled and it lighted his eyes i understand is there anything i can do for henderson if you could drop me at dr stephensons surgery id be grateful a headache powder would probably help him he doesnt eat regularly im afraid in spite of our efforts to see that he does and i suspect thats the root of the problem ill take you and then bring you back no please peter sometimes uses the church as sanctuary when its cold or wet he knows i go there often it doesnt seem to bother him but if you came in whatever seems best he told her they walked together toward the motorcar and she said apropos of nothing you dont believe matthew walsh killed father james do you i wonder why he studied her face why should you think that a womans intuition i suppose and the way you go on asking questions as if you seem to be waiting for something a mistake a false step i dont know i have this rather uncomfortable feeling that one day quite soon youll pounce it was a very different attitude from hamishs and it made rutledge feel ashamed how did one touch the spirit to test its scars the reasons a man did things the unconscious pressures behind ordinary decisions as he opened the door for her and went to crank the engine rutledge realized that hed missed his chance to ask her about the photograph outside dr stephensons surgery rutledge stopped long enough for miss trent to thank him again and then disappear through the waiting room door he pulled out again in the wake of a milk wagon and was halfway down water street when he saw blevins walking in the same direction blevins turned at the sound of a motor and recognized rutledge at the wheel he called out curtly youre a hard man to find when wanted ive been to speak to mrs wainer again a greengrocers cart came up behind the motorcar the horse snorting uneasily at the smell and noise of the vehicle blevins said dont clog traffic ill meet you on the quay rutledge nodded he left the motorcar in the hotel yard and walked out to the quay inspector blevins was already standing there staring down at the water sun streaked it as the tide trickled in it was moving the narrow stream sluggishly now but would do so with more method later blevinss shoulders were stiff angry rutledge said coming up to the other man whats happened the inspector turned looking around to see if they could be overheard i hear youve been hobnobbing with the gentry there was cold fury behind the words lord sedgwick he invited me to lunch i was interested in knowing why did you find out no at leastim not sure rutledge answered truthfully whats that supposed to mean rutledge held on to his temper look i dont know these people the way you do i couldnt i havent lived here all my life i have to depend on instinct to hear what lies behind their words you never warned me off sedgwick or anyone else sedgwick put up the reward for father jamess killer did he tell you yes he did what difference does that make does it remove him from suspicion blevins turned back to look at the marshes his profile was set hard i had asked the chief constable to speak to the yard about keeping you on here and a chief superintendent by the name of bowles agreed to it now im not sure i did the right thing suddenly rutledge could see through blevinss fury he resented the fact that the man from london with his polished airs had been treated with noticeable favoritism by the local gentry when he himself never had sedgwick wont make any friends for you i can tell you that blevins went on and if you have ambitions in london he wont do you any good hes not old money i never believed he was rutledge answered coldly and as for any favors he might do me i choose my own friends and pick my own enemies he let the words lie there a challenge blevins looked at him again there was a rumor the chief constable had heard that you came back from the war a broken man half the policeman you were if that unspoken was the rest of what blevins wanted to say you might be in need of patronage but the words hung in the very air between the two men accusatory and damning hamish was saying something but rutledge was intent on fighting his own battle i came back from the war broken by the waste of it he told blevins his voice harsh it was a bloody waste of lives and we brought home nothing nothing to show for four years of dying in trenches not fit for swine i asked no favors from anyone and i received none i did my job as well as i knew how just as every other man back from the front tried to do his no one gave me back my past and no one will hand me my future whatever your grievance is with me now it has nothing to do with the war and nothing to do with my skills as a policeman blevins stared at him and then looked away surprise in his eyes behind the thin face and the polite manner was a will stronger than hed believed all right i apologize he took a deep breath im at my wits end thats what it is look i have to put togetherand damned soona sound enough case against walsh that i can take to trial otherwise i have to let him go we cant hold him forever on suspicion and right now thats all ive got blevins took two quick steps away and then turned back to rutledge its like chasing wraiths nothing can be nailed down have you told him about iris kenneths death no i find i cant stand the sight of the man hes taken to sitting there smirking like a damned gargoyle one of my constables swears hell choke walsh into confessing a twisted smile crossed his face damned fool is half walshs weight let me be the one to break the news blevins considered the offer all right come and talk to him then nothing else is working this is worth trying they walked in silence back to the police station there blevins gave the key to rutledge and gestured in the direction of the small cell when rutledge unlocked the door walsh was sitting on the bed a smile pinned to his face that changed when he saw that it was not blevins or one of his constables a shadow of concern took its place what are you doing standing there in the doorway like the trumpet of god bravado in a deep voice hamish said he thinks youve come to take him to norwich or london it was a sharp observation rutledge said theres been an interesting development in your case walsh shoved himself to his feet a big man with hands twice the size of rutledges and what might that be iris kenneth surprise swept over walshs face whats she got to do with anything we thought she might have been the person you left on watch under the lilacs that clump of bushes is out of sight of the neighbors windows a clever place to stand and watch in my opinion she never stood there because i wasnt there and if she told you she was its out of malice shes a bitch shes got it in for me because i didnt keep her on thats what it is i could wring her neck rutledge waited to a count of ten watching the mans face it was a thinking face but not a cunning one the strong man wasnt just muscle and brawn he was capable of working out the ramifications of his position and dealing with the reality it represented but he didnt appear to have that extra measure of slyness that sometimes cropped up in people of his ilk as if in agreement hamish observed hes no one to lurk about in the shadows hes been larger than most men all his life and it was true walsh had probably never feared anyone or anything unlike a small man whose wits were all that stood between him and a bullying walsh had never needed to bluster or bargain his arrogance grew out of his certainty about himself in the scheme of things rutledge let his silence draw attention to itself when something changed in walshs manner less belligerent and more wary he finally said iris kenneth is dead did you kill her too the shock was real walsh sucked in his breath and there was a sudden tightness around his mouth an incredulity that left him shaken with a realization that he might have fallen into a trap youre lying to me he said the deep bass voice rolling around the walls of the small cell like thunder overhead why should i lie i can take you to london tonight and show you her corpse if it hasnt already been turned into a paupers grave shes not dead iris had a way about her a lively way but she kept her wits about her and she never i dont believe you with a shrug rutledge turned to leave i dont really care whether you believe me or not im not lying to you shes dead how by what means walsh asked quickly taking a step forward as if to stop rutledge from leaving drowning rutledge said coldly not a pleasant way to go surely and he walked out of the cell shutting the door behind him walsh was there as he turned the key in the lock his fists pounded furiously against the door damn you come back here but rutledge walked away down the passage to blevinss office to the drumbeat of walshs fists battering on the door as rutledge walked into the office and dropped the key on the desk blevins said whats that in aid of he inclined his head toward the savage pounding i dont see youve gained much of anything rutledge sat down in the chair across the cluttered desk from blevins i dont know who killed iris kenneth he said but id give you heavy odds that it wasnt walsh he could feel the weariness building up in him the strain across his shoulders that came from depression and stress not that it matters were far from proving she was on the scene the night of the priests murder he had the opportunity surely we didnt pick him up until after the woman went into the river from what youve told me of the timing he had a reason to want her silenced he could have taken a train to london finished her off and taken the next one back to norfolk and left his cart and his equipment with the scissors sharpener thats possible we should look into the trains a man the size of walsh would stand out other passengers might remember seeing him its best to be thorough rutledge agreed then he added choosing his words something was said earlier about having to release walsh if you didnt have incontrovertible proof perhapsas a precautionwe might be well advised to look at other suspects warily blevins asked starting where i was about to ask you that ive told you no one in osterley had a reason to murder father james we wont know that with any certainty until walsh is found guilty disconcerted blevins studied the londoner do you really believe im wrong about walsh rutledge answered indirectly if youre forced to let walsh walk out of here will you still be convinced he was guilty blevins looked away a long sigh expressing his frustration and uncertainty his fingers toyed with the edge of the blotter worrying a small tear in the corner he was reluctant to give up any part of his authorityand equally reluctant to exercise it this was his village his people to be seen rigorously investigating the private lives of those he lived with on a daily basis would bring their wrath down on his head to let rutledge usurp his position was an admission that he was not prepared to do it himself for whatever reasons finally he told rutledge i dont want to know what youre doing not at first but when you think youve got something i should hear then i want to hear it however unpleasant it might be do you understand me rutledge agreed with grace knowing that blevins had crossed a line that would come back to haunt him hamish in the back of rutledges mind added silently if the killer is no the strong man youve made an enemy and that was equally true down the passage the pounding had stopped and rutledge found the silence disturbed him blevins waited until rutledge had reached the door to the street before asking where will you begin after a moment rutledge answered where death begins with the doctor who examined the body as rutledge stepped out into the hazy sunshine of the october morning he heard hamish clearly as if the voice had just walked out of the police station at his heels no more than two steps behind his left shoulder theres no turning back hamish warned if youre wrong he willna let you live it down but rutledge answered unaware that hed spoken aloud so be it chapter rutledge waited nearly twenty minutes in dr stephensons surgery before the nurse connie summoned him and led the way to the small private office in the rear stephenson looking at rutledge over the tops of his glasses said id heard you went back to london he collected the sheets of paper hed been reading and set them in a folder blevins is a capable man i cant quite see the need of someone from london looking over his shoulder most of the town feels satisfied that walsh killed father james and if theres been any evidence to the contrary i havent heard about it when a man travels the country as frequently as matthew walsh did his movements arent always easy to follow and the timing on a given date can be critical rutledge answered without rancor waiting to be offered the chair on his side of the desk stephenson nodded toward it and rutledge sat down then what brings you here today walk lightly hamish warned i wasnt present when the body was found id like to hear what you saw and noted at the scene i wrote everything down for blevins the next morning in fact thats the official report wellconsidered medical opinions designed to stand up in court what id like is your personal opinionwhatever you felt and saw and thought whether you could support it with fact or not stephenson leaned back in his chair i cant think why it was a clearcut case of violent death no question about that rutledge rejoined mildly still you might provide a small piece of the puzzle thats been overlooked stephenson a man used to judging people and tracking down the site of illness from small signs considered rutledge more sharply his mind working swiftly behind the shield of his glasses you arent suggesting that someone in osterley rutledge cut across what he was about to say for instance monsignor holston tells me he was disturbed by the presence of something malignant and evil in that room mrs wainer on the other hand believes that the murder was motivated by revenge but neither of them would write such impressions in an official report nor would you hamish was saying something but rutledge listened to the silence instead stephenson scratched his jaw a rasping sound in the quiet of the room i cant say that i had an initial reaction unless it was disbelief the constable who came to fetch me told me that father james was dead i was short with him saying that it was my business not his to make that determination after we got to the rectory i remember thinking that this vigorous intelligent man seemed smaller in death than he was in life but we were standing over father james rather than looking him in the eye as we usually did which probably explained why he seemed diminished there were half a dozen people in the room and i could hear a woman sobbing somewhere down the passage mrs wainer that was after that i was too busy to do more than note the circumstances he stopped looking back at the scene imprinted on his memory rutledge said go on he was lying by the window facing it and partly on his left side his left hand outflung and open and i remember thinking that he couldnt have seen the attack coming but blevins was pointing out the destruction in the study chairs overturned papers and books scattered aboutand suggesting that father james had walked in on this confusion and then gone to the window to call for help thats an old house but the sashes work smoothly i tested them myself still even if father james had been successful in attracting attention it would have been too late the bastard had found the opportunity he was looking for and struck hard nevertheless the victim was facing the windows and blevins knows his business better than i do mine was to examine the body hamish said it wasna proper surely to influence the doctors view its done often enough setting the scene as it were rutledge silently responded human nature to pay heed to it stephenson took a deep breath and studied the ceiling there had been an emergency on one of the farms around five that same morningi was tired and blevins was taking it hardhe was one of father jamess flock as you probably know i saw no reason to doubt what he was telling me how did blevins look to you he was extremely angry but his face was pale his hands shaking i thought it likely that hed just vomited from the shock he said two or three times i cant understand killing a priest for a few poundsi didnt think we held life as cheaply here as in london or words to that effect tell me about the room itd been ransacked you must know that i could hardly set a foot down without tramping on papers or books and the like i looked for evidence of a struggle but didnt find any i said something to blevins about that as i remember id always had the feeling that father james could look after himself id see him on the road on that bicycle of his at any hour of the day or night and in any weather i was surprised that he hadnt made any effort to defend himself of course that was before blevins brought in walsh aye hamish reminded rutledge its a question you raised yoursel stephenson looked at the pen on his blotter i couldnt find any scratches on the hands nothing under the nails no marks on the face rigor was present and i was fairly sure hed been dead for more than twelve hours his eyes came back to rutledges face as if the medical details were more comfortable than speculation the back of his skull was crushed and that large crucifix lay on the floor near the body i could see hair and blood on it quite clearly i knelt on my handkerchief and someone held a lamp for me so that i might examine the wound better there had been at least three blowsi could identify the shape of the square base at three different points i would say that the first blow stunned him the second one killed him and the third would most certainly have made it impossible to survive each blow was delivered with considerable force judging from the compression of the skull which confirms rutledge said that the priest was standing his back to the killer thats true i was told later that there were no fingerprints on the crucifix where it must have been gripped for leverageeither it was wiped clean or the killer wore gloves women wear gloves rutledge said thoughtfully thinking of priscilla connaught who was tall for a woman i wont tell you that it couldnt have been a woman stephenson answered but i find it hard to believe a woman would have struck more than twice he shrugged still it would depend on her state of mind this was a bloody wound and in my experience few women are willing to splatter themselves with bone and blood and brain tissue no matter how angry or brave they are its not medical opinion of course but as a rule women avoid that sort of unpleasantness i pronounced him dead and called it what it was murder rutledge mused i come back to the question what would i do if i walked in on a thief ive never faced an intruder in my house inspector id feel violated walking in on such wanton destructioni know thatand damned angry as well if i recognized the person id tell him to stop making an ass of himself and get the hell out of my house if he wanted to escape charges id be in no mood to be charitable and probably get myself killed for it id be more wary of a stranger not knowing what he was capable of but id still go after him but then im not trained as a priest it would make a difference hamish said he was in the war father james would he turn the other cheek as if he had heard hamishs comment as clearly as rutledge did stephenson straightened the folder on his desk to march with the right margin of the blotter and added with an odd tension in his face if there was no thiefif it wasnt walshthen father james was confronted by an enemy rutledge said nothing stephenson moved uneasily in his chair no disregard that if you will blevins is a good policemanhe wouldnt have got it wrong again rutledge let the comment stand instead he asked did you know much about father jamess past thats the trouble with you people from london you dont live here you dont understand the people here you look for complexity and these are not complex people rutledge started to speak but stephenson said no let me finish some twenty years ago we had discussions to see if anything could be done to bring back the port experts from london preferred to keep the marshes as a sanctuary for birds we said what about the needs of the families who had to scratch a living here but nobody listened this was a good place for marshes and marshes we would keep he said with growing heat well im the man who sees the cost of the struggle to make a living out here i knew that romney marsh had been drained to make it fit for sheep grazing and we could do the same here along with dredging the port making it safe for small boats and a holiday place for people who havent the resources to travel to the southern beaches the experts would have none of it youre the expert here you want to find something to blame father james for something to excuse the time and money the yard has spent in sending you here well it wont wash i knew the man you didnt hes avoiding the question ye ken hamish pointed out rutledge said without rancor im not suggesting that blevins is wrong or that father james was guilty of some unspeakable crime but none of us is perfectand people will kill for reasons that you and i couldnt comprehend one of the worst murders ive ever seen had to do with a simple boundary dispute where a hedge ran over the line hardly a case for violence but it ended in one man taking the shears to the other dr stephenson looked at him for a long moment then as if against his will growing out of some inner need he couldnt silence he said in all my personal and professional encounters with father james i never felt any doubt about his integrity or his honor a but hung in the air between them like a shout that couldnt be ignored rutledge waited silent and as if goaded by that the doctor said damn you i dont know why im telling you this but there was something years ago that puzzled me and i suppose thats why i couldnt put it out of my mind it had to do with the sinking of titanic once when i walked in on himthis was several months afterwardthere was a great pile of articles spread out across father jamess desk a hundred or more cuttings with notes in ink in the margins and even photographs of passengers and recovered bodies he saw me looking down at them and before i could say a word hed gathered up the lot and swept it out of sight into a drawer as if it were somehow obscene material i made some remark about the disaster and his interest and he said no thats nothing to do with me it was odd to hear a priest lie and about something so ordinary dr stephenson frowned he never spoke of it again and nor did i but the lie never set well with me i in some fashion it altered my view of the man he studied rutledges face rutledge said perhaps he knew someone who had sailed on her i wondered about that but people in osterley seldom travel beyond norwich or kings lynn they most certainly dont have the money for passage on a ship like that i myself know of only one person who sailed on titanic and she didnt live here at all i cant believe that father james had more than a passing acquaintance with her who was she stephenson answered testily lord sedgwicks daughterinlaw his son arthurs wife an american it was hushed up at the timeshed left her husband and sailed for new york without a byyourleave sedgwick and young arthur had searched everywhere theyd no idea where she went or why she simply vanished until the ship went down and someone found her maiden name in the passenger list terrible shock to the family was her body retrieved i believe it was the family held a private service on the estate look i should never have spoken of this for all i know fa her james had dreamed of running away to sea as a boy titanic was a marvel she caught the fancy of the entire country he was probably embarrassed to admit to sharing that excitement stephenson took out his watch ive three more patients to see before i can go home for my dinner is there anything else you want to know he made it sound as if rutledge had been prying vulgar curiosity driving him rutledge rose and thanked him for his time he reached the door and was just putting his hand on the knob when the doctor said swiftly for a second time look forget what i just told you there was a harsh expression on stephensons face a fierce desire to recall his words and a strong dislike of the man whod heard them as rutledge walked down water street he found himself wondering if indeed father james had lied to the doctor it was a small lie of no great importance unless it was nested in a pattern of lies this was perhaps what lay at the center of the doctors unease in the hotel lobby monsignor holston rose from one of the chairs there and said ive come for lunch will you join me it was an unexpected invitation rutledge said yes let me wash up first if you dont mind of course rutledge took the stairs two at a time wondering what had brought the priest here from norwich he canna stay away for a man who doesna wish to stay here hamish commented dryly busy with that question rutledge reached the head of the stairs turned toward his room and in the narrow passage nearly collided with his fellow guest coming the other way i beg your pardon he said catching her arm to steady her i was in too much of a hurry startled by his sudden appearance may trent said hesitantly it was my fault as well i had just knocked at your door today in the churchyard i should have apologized for last evening you were trying to help and i turned on you like a termagant it was rude and ungrateful of me there was a rueful smile in her eyes not at all he said lightly you had no reason to believe my methods would work i had no cause not to believe in them but i have a way of collecting lost sheep and then defending them from imaginary wolves when i returned to my table my friends had a few pithy comments to make you may consider me chastised and properly chastened rutledge laughed and received a deeper smile in return he noticed a flicker of a dimple in one cheek and on the spur of the moment said i have a friend who has come to take lunch with me hes a priest and should know more than most about the old churches in this part of norfolk if mrs barnett can accommodate us would you care to join us hamish grumbled that it was unwise for an instant rutledge could see that she was tempted but she shook her head thats kind of you my friends are leaving for london tonight and asked me to come with them as far as kings lynn ive promised she started past him to the top of the stairs but he put out a hand to stop her miss trent i need to askits a matter of police business are you aware that father james has left a bequest to you in his will bequest there must be some mistake his solicitor has had some difficulty carrying out father jamess wishes because neither he nor the housekeeper has been able to find the item miss trent shook her head i dont know what youre talking about ive heard nothing of thisand i know of nothing that father james might wish me to have she was clearly mystified and a little apprehensive it was a photograph it was kept in the drawer of his desk but apparently it isnt there any longer did he by any chance give it to you himself and perhaps hadnt got around to rescinding the codicil she said no he gave me nothing and he said nothing about a bequest are you quite certainwhy should he leave me a photograph perhaps you should speak to the solicitor about it the name in the will is marianna trent of london but i havent used marianna since i was a child everyone calls me may marianna was also my aunts name you see and perhaps he meant her although he never said anything to me about knowing her the confusion in her face seemed genuine did he ever show you a particular photograph of himself of his family possibly of someone who was in some fashion dear to him someone he discovered you had known as well the confusion cleared but a frown took its place as if the reminder was not welcome i thinkits possible i know what you mean but i havent the time to discuss it now im already late my friends will be waiting when i come back to osterley tomorrow will that do he wanted to tell her that it wouldnt but she was eager to be gone and he had no choice but to step aside and let her pass she went quickly down the stairs her heels clicking softly in the carpeting and he heard the door to the street open and close behind her hamish said it doesna seem to be of importance to her this photograph on the contrary rutledge answered thoughtfully i believe she would much prefer not to talk about it at all mrs barnett had already seated monsignor holston and was chatting with him at the table she looked up as rutledge came striding through the french doors and smiled here he is now she said ill just go and fetch the soup except for the two men the dining room was empty no other tables set no other guests expected the scent of warm bread rose from a basket on the table as rutledge took his chair next to the window i have it on the best authority monsignor holston was saying this is one of the tallest loaves ever to come out of her ovens ive had no complaint about the food here rutledge agreed i dont see how she manages the hotel without more help ive seen a maid upstairs a time or two and theres someone in the kitchens to do the scullery work but mrs barnett appears to do most everything else shes a widow i think her husband was quite a gifted man he could turn his hand to anythingand it would flourish but barnett died just before the war of a gangrenous wound a horse stepped on his foot and infection set in they amputated the foot then the leg and in the end couldnt do anything to save him she watched him die by inches and nursed him herself did you know him as a matter of fact i did hed been hired by father james for work on the rectory and id approved the cost at the bishops request barnett was working there when he was injured you seem to know the parish here rather well are you equally knowledgeable about all of them no more than most old churches and rectories require an enormous level of upkeep and while the local priest does as much as he can the diocese has to fund many of the major repairs which means that i inspect and report approve agreements and pay the workmen he grimaced a far cry from the office of priesthood i prefer thats why im under consideration for st annes because ive asked to serve a church again dishes of hot soup arrived on the tray mrs barnett held aloft and she set them before the two men with an unobtrusive grace vegetable rutledge decided in a rich beef broth he realized he was ravenous cutting through the crisp crust of the loaf of bread rutledge said did father james find his parish troublesome thats to say the kinds of problems he had to deal with here i should think it would vary from church to church human nature is human nature everywhere still this was once a rich parish and now its not the kinds of problems shift with the economic balance give me an example monsignor holston was suddenly uneasy after some seconds he began slowly a priest counsels broken marriages and intercedes in disputes sometimes he has to take sides and thats never simple he tries to set the moral character of his parish he keeps an eye on wayward children god knows there are enough of those thanks to the war which tells me he knows the secrets of dozens of people monsignor holston shook his head were not speaking of the confessional neither am i only of secrets that might be more important to someone than we realized the vicar at holy trinity can tell you much the same story if you ask hardly the stuff of revenge if thats what youre getting at for instance there was a youngster here in osterley wild and heading for trouble we discussed what to do about him how best to redirect his energies father james discovered that the boy was interested in motorcars and aeroplanes and was all for becoming a mechanic his father was set on making him a farmer like his forebears it took some persuasion but the father finally relented and let the lad learn a trade he smiled wryly it isnt always quite that easy but thats more or less typical all the same not as typical as telling a straying husband that he has to confess to his wife that theres a child out of wedlock or telling a man angry with his neighbor that he has to apologize and make restitution for whatever hes done thats more the stuff of revenge leaving the thought lying there rutledge changed the subject tell me about father jamess interest in titanic surprised monsignor holston stopped with his spoon in midair staring at rutledge then he said slowly i suppose he was overwhelmed by it like the rest of us and of course lusitania as well theres great loss of life when a ship goes down its almost incomprehensible hamish said he willna gie ye a straight answer there was a particular photograph father james wished to bequeath to someone the solicitor cant find it it wasnt in his desk where hed indicated it would be found rutledge broke off a piece of bread monsignor holston put down his spoon let me see there were the usual photographs from seminary quite a few of his family that sort of thing he liked wales hed walked there a number of times on holiday as i remember hed had a number of those framed and of course a few from the lake district too speak to ruth wainer she will know i have she doesnt rutledge said baldly and paused to let monsignor holston finish his soup when the plates had been removed he went on what did you know about father james that frightens you so much did he have another side that we havent stumbled across a secret life perhaps an angry flush rose under the priests fair skin thats ridiculous you know it is he considered rutledge for a moment and added more calmly i thought the matter was settled that it was walsh whod done the murder i have a feeling you arent satisfied with walsh as the killer either you wouldnt still be afraid of that rectory if you were and its truethere are holes in the evidence against him even inspector blevins is aware of that the question is where to look if walsh is shown to be innocent i have no allegiances here in osterley you see or to the church that father james served im not afraid to turn over stones and see whats there i think the time has come for you to tell me whats behind your fear monsignor holston said earnestly look im in no position to tell you whether walsh is guilty or not what i can tell you is that father james had no secret life he wasapparentlyfascinated by the titanic disaster so you say monsignor holston interrupted but he never told me the disaster fascinated him for gods sake even priests have a life of their own i know one who has written quite knowledgeably about butterflies another who collects frontedge paintings and one who prides himself on having grown the finest marrows in suffolk i have an interest in grafting fruit trees i cant say that i talk about it very often but its a way of relaxing when i have the time hamish said hes a bloody master at shifting your questions mrs wainer believes father james was killed for revenge why would she tell me that if he had no enemies youll have to ask her and theres a priscilla connaught who said that father james ruined her life and she hated him it must have been true i watched her eyes as she said the words theres a man called peter henderson whose father disowned him and father james did his best to heal the breach to the anger apparently of both parties failures both of them potential murderers who knows mrs barnett came with another tray laden with dishes she took one look at monsignor holstons stormy face and at the coldness in rutledges and made no effort to talk to them as she deftly arranged the dishes of vegetables and roasted potatoes then set in front of them the heavy platters of baked fish when she had gone monsignor holston tried to recover his equilibrium struggling with something he himself found it difficult to express he made an effort to explain the boy who wanted to be a mechanic had secret dreams he couldnt tell his own father but he told father james people do confide in priests their dearest hopes darkest fears but we arent perfect and we arent always going to get it right failure means the person wasnt ready to come to terms with a problem perhaps a comfortable conclusion to draw as an excuse to walk away we cant work miracles where none is wanted and sometimes we cant stand up in a court of law and tell the secrets of others the words had slipped out and the priests eyes told rutledge that he was instantly regretting them are you trying to say that one of the secrets father james kept had to do with breaking the law monsignor holston lifted his serviette to his mouth giving him time to find the words he wanted im telling you that father james never led a double life i would swear to that in your courtroom as for what his parishioners confided in him father james took his knowledge of that to the grave i was never a party to it unless there was some way in which i could help which is as it should be what i dont understand if were getting down to bitter truth is why youre still asking me questions when there is already a man in a cell if as you say i have a feeling of dissatisfaction how do you define your own persistence monsignor holston let that lie between them for a moment then added you havent been exactly open with me either have you hamish who had been listening carefully said to rutledge he doesna want you to stop searching rutledge didnt answer his eyes on monsignor holstons face did father james ever speak of matthew walsh to you during the war or after it thats the name of the man blevins brought in isnt it no should he have just closing a circle and then rutledge changed the subject entirely to something more pleasant but hed learned what he wanted to know not even for the deep friendship that had existed between the two priests was monsignor holston willing to break whatever rules bound him or it could be that he suspected that something had disturbed father james over the same period during which mrs wainer had noticed a similar uneasiness and was afraid to speculate aloud on the reason for it because if he was wrong he might reveal matters best left hidden aye he canna tell you the lot and let you sort through them hamish agreed if the murderer was afraid that what one priest knew he might pass on to another surely that pointed away from a parishioner at st annes and toward someone who wasnt clear on how the priesthood worked it was an interesting avenue to explore rutledge had a sudden feeling that blevins was right about one thing that it wasnt the collar that had made father james a victim for the remainder of the meal monsignor holston appeared to be distracted as if behind the now ordinary conversation he was conducting with rutledge he was weighing what he had said earlierand what conclusions the man from london would have drawn from his words as they rose to leave the dining room the monsignor paused on the threshold to the lobby his eyes heavy with a personal guilt im a clever man when it comes to the faith i uphold i understand the nuances of church law and the responsibilities ive undertaken father james was a man who carried that a step further he was deeply involved with the needs of people thats why he was still a parish priest while i had moved higher in the church hierarchy if he hadnt been a priest i think he would have been a teacher please keep that in mind as you go digging through his life you could do a great deal of harm without ever intending to do it rutledge understood what he was trying to saythat it was important to exercise discretion in what was brought out into the open monsignor holston went on wearily im not sure what i believe anymore whether there was a sense of evil in that study or not i could have imagined it just as you suggested the first day we talked i could have been searching for a way to explain the death of a friend i dont even know how i feel about walsh whether i have compassion for him or not in the days just after the murder i was haunted by the need for action for answers for proof that this death mattered to the authorities that out of the shame of it would come some meaning a memorial to a good man rutledge said i dont believe you were necessarily wrong about the sense of evil there in the study my only question from the beginning has been why should evil reach out to touch a parish priest in a small town hardly more than a village on a bleak and marshy stretch of coast thats the answer i have to find monsignor holston started to say something then bit back the words instead he reached out and clapped a hand on rutledges shoulder ill make a bargain with youwith the devil as it were if you come to me with the truth and i recognize it ill tell you so and with that he was gone leaving behind an air of contradiction that was the closest this norwich priest could come to openness chapter needing air to clear his mind rutledge walked as far as the quay he was trying to pin down what it was that disturbed him about monsignor holstons vehement defense of his dead colleague and friend it was the subtle way in which the investigation was being manipulated dont look heredont look there he didnt do anything wrong you neednt explore that like a puppet master trying to untangle the strings of an obstreperous character who wouldnt play his role properly if it wasnt the churchif it wasnt the manif it wasnt the parishif it was not a fall from moral grace then the only explanation left was a theft or another crime that had been committed and that had never been exposed hamish said whatever it was that worried father james it couldna ha been a murderthere hasna been one yes rutledge said slowly all right what if its true that the priest knew of a crime he remembered the egyptian basrelief at east sherham manor the watchers of time the baboons who saw all that men and the gods did witnessesbut without the power to condemn or judge what if the priest had become just such a witness what if he had heard something that bit by bit had led him to knowledge that was dangerous like a bobby who walked the london streets a priest knew his parishioners by name and face and nature he knew the good in each person he knew the temptations they faced the needs and passions and hungers the envy that drove some and the greed that drove others he knew what they confessed to him and what by observation he had grown to understand about them it was an intriguing possibilityand for the first time it brought together a good many of the seemingly disparate facts father jamess noticeable uneasiness before the murder the unexplained sequence of actions in the priests study and the seeming difficulty in finding a connection with anyone who might have a personal reason for killing him if he didna have any proof of what had been done whatever the crime was then he couldna go to the inspector with suspicion but someone might ha feared he would yes especially since blevins was a member of his church secrets have more than one kind of power a very clever piecing together of a puzzlethat had destroyed father james in the end the only question was what crime had father james stumbled over and if the evidence of it had died with him then where were the small signs of his knowledge that must surely have existed somewhere or had the killer found them when he overturned the study and taken them away along with the bazaar funds that were kept in the desk a few pounds that provided an apparent motivebut were just an opportune shield for the real motive hamish reminded him the theft had sent inspector blevins off on a wildgoose chase that had yielded a suspect and walsh could still be the man were after that would be irony if he was but how long had it taken father james to weave together the strands of truth that had turned into knowledge begin with the bazaar hamish advised no im going back to the study rutledge told him he set out for the police station to ask permission of inspector blevins as before mrs wainer had no wish to accompany rutledge upstairs ive come to believe that inspector blevins has found the man who did this terrible murder he told me himself that the proof was clear and ive had time now to think about it a little i ought to admit that i was wrong about the revenge its just prolonging the pain and taking me nowhere and so ive begun to box up father jamess belongings to send to his sister if the bishop names a new priest soon the rectory should be ready for him its my duty rutledge glanced around the parlor it seemed unchanged from his last visit what have you removed she looked down at her hands her face torn i started with his old things in the garden shed and then the kitchen entry i find it hard to think about touching this parloror facing the upstairsbut ill manage its the last task ill ever perform for him you know and i want to do it right i do understand mrs wainer i shant keep you long id like to have a look at the framed photographs if i may and i need to ask you if father james stored any of his private papers in some other room of the house i shouldnt think so she answered doubtfully theres the study and the bedroom and a room just down the passage thats always been used to hold parish books and the like accounts for one thing and the church recordsbaptisms deaths marriages theres a grand number of them now the books fill two shelves it was said with pride but these would be passed on to the incoming man the public duty and not the private life im sure they do can we begin with the parlor perhaps show me if you will what belonged to father james personally she began by the windows picking up each photograph thats the little house in cumberland over near keswick where he spent an entire week just before the war it poured cats and ducks and he couldnt set foot out the door without a thorough drenching he played backgammon until he was blind he said and heres the young priest who was ordained with him father austin he died of the gassing in the war poor soul each of the photographs had a story but none of them appeared to have special significance mrs wainer moved on to the small treasures he liked pipes although he never smoked and he collected more than a dozen she reminisced as she touched each one and over there is the walking stick in that chinese umbrella stand that he carried with him to wales and the lake district westmorland the stand belonged to a greataunt it was a wedding gift to her and ill be shipping that along to his sister and the clock on the mantel there there were books on the shelves that were father jamess his name inscribed in a fine copperplate hand mixed among others that belonged in the rectory rutledge turned the pages briefly but found nothing of interest tucked between the leaves hardly secret vices and dark crimes hamish mocked when rutledge turned to the stairs the housekeeper said as she had before go on then ill have a cup of tea ready when youve done your work she had returned to the kitchen before he had reached the top step he went first to the small room where the ledgers of church and rectory business transactions were kept and where the heavy bound books with church records on their spines stood on a separate pair of shelves looking through the ledgers first rutledge found in various hands the long list of repairs and improvements wages and offerings that represented decades of activity the roof of the rectory had been repaired after a storm in and there was a faded receipt in the rough untutored hand of the man who had done the work you could rutledge thought identify with certainty every expenditure when it was made to whom and for what purpose and the name of the priest incumbent at the time every penny of income was noted every payment of wages due he found the entry scrupulously made in father jamess hand of the sum earned at the bazaar eleven pounds three shillings six pence the last entry was wages paid to mrs wainer two days before the priest had died the great volumes of church records listed the names of priests and sextons altar boys and gravediggers over the years a compendium of who had served god and in what capacity later pages recorded baptisms by date with the name given the child the sponsoring godparents and the parents by accident rutledge came across the name blevins and found the inspectors own baptism pages later that of his first child among the marriages were blevinss mrs wainers and others whose names rutledge recognized the deaths were more somber george peters aged fortyseven years three months and four days died this day of grace sunday twentyfour august in the year of our lord eighteen hundred and fortyeight of a fall down a well shaft in hunstanton on saturday the twentythird and later on infant son of mary and henry cuthbert stillborn this fourteenth day of march eighteen hundred and sixtytwo laid to rest beside seven brothers and sisters may god have mercy on his soul it was the chronicle of life and death in a small village perhaps the only mark many of these people had made in their short span on earth he found it sad to read jocelyn mercer aged three days short of her fourteenth year of diphtheria roger benning aged five years two months and seven days of cholera the last volume ended with seven july nineteen twelve the latest must he thought be kept in the church vestry the room yielded nothing more of interestit was as hed thought a public room where the church officers had as much right of access as the priest rutledge moved on to the study from what blevins had told him rutledge knew that mrs wainer had restored the scattered papers and books and other belongings to their proper places she wouldnt allow the police to touch them rutledge thumbed through the books studied the photographs on the table by the hearth and on the mantel they were a record of friends and family over the years of journeys to wales of the great fells in the lake district he even lifted the cushions of the settle this room was in some respects another public place where father james counseled his parish or talked to young couples on the brink of marriage or heard the grieving words of widows and parents and children where the deacons came and discussed church affairs where any person might wait and with natural curiosity look around him hence even the flimsy lock on the desk perhaps hamish said but the titanic cuttings were here on the desk when the doctor saw them yes thats true he walked in while father james was examining them most likely rutledge searched through the desk with care nothing of interest and no photographs framed or otherwise just as the solicitor had said moving on to the bedroom rutledge felt his usual sense of distaste he disliked what he was about to do hating the need to violate the privacy of the dead but murder victims lost not only their lives and their dignity but their innermost thoughts and secrets secrets they would have preferred to deal with if theyd been warned they were about to die he himself was careful not to preserve any record of the voice in his head there was no diary entry no letter not even a conversation with a friend that would distress his sister frances after he was gone only the private files in dr flemings office and fleming could be depended upon to leave them sealed was that what fashed baker hamish asked he couldna rise from his bed and he couldna ask the vicar to look into a drawer or burn a letter it was something to consider it would indeed explain why father james had wanted to be so certain of bakers state of mind before he carried out whatever instructions he may have been given for instance burning an old love letter rutledge searched through the priests meager belongings the clothing in the wardrobe and the church robes folded in the chest at the foot of the bed relieved to find nothing of consequence there he stood in the middle of the room thinking hamish said it was no a verra guid idea after all rutledge replied absently the frustrating part of the search is not knowing what im after or if it exists in any recognizable fashion monsignor holstons words came back to him if you come to me with the truth and i recognize it ill tell you so there were other rooms on the first floor but opening the doors confirmed what rutledge expected bedchambers made up for guests with nothing in them of a personal nature and all of them scrupulously clean you couldna hide a wee mouse in here hamish commented as rutledge closed the last of the doors he climbed the narrow uncarpeted flight of stairs to the top floor rooms here had been designed for servants small and without character unfurnished for the most part or cluttered with the collected debris of several generations lamps iron bedsteads rusted coal scuttles a wardrobe with one door warped on its hinges chairs with caned seats that had never been mended chipped mirrors and the like even a broken window sash leaned against an inside wall next to two rakes whose bamboo handles had splintered a few of the odds and ends appeared to have been used year after year for bazaars including a small cart half a dozen umbrellas and long wooden tables boxes of signs and ribbons and the kit of clowns makeup that father james must have favored for entertaining the children there was also near the top of the steps where rutledge would have expected to find such things a small traveling trunk and a valise that bore the priests name on the labels cheap conservative and well worn running probing fingers through the jumble of belongings stored in the trunk he came across the corners of an envelope fairly large and rather thick but unevenly so as if there were several things stuffed inside lifting out the assortment of hats and gloves and hiking boots that lay on top he picked up the packet testing its weight in his hands it had been neither hidden away nor in plain sight letters from father jamess dead sister judith or the ones he had written to her with that enigmatic reference to the giant inspector blevins would be pleased if they were rutledge sat down on the dusty floorboards his elbows resting on his bent knees and held the envelope upright between his spread feet there were no identifying marksit hadnt been mailed and there was no name on the outside as he opened the flap and looked in rutledge said ah in almost a sigh a fat collection of cuttings met his eye drawing them out careful not to lose one he could already see that they were newspaper and magazine accounts of the sinking of a ship that was unsinkable sorting through them at random he noted that certain developments had been clipped togetherthe publicity over departure the tragedy the search for bodies reports from ireland editorial reflections on the tragic loss of life lists of the dead and missing accounts of the ensuing inquiryas if father james had carefully cataloged each new addition to his accumulating data in the margins were handwritten notes referring the reader from one article to another dr stephenson was rightthis had all the hallmarks of an obsession not a passing fancy too much work had been done to coordinate all the information photographs from news accounts ranged from smiling society figures boarding the great liner to pitiable corpses lying in plain wooden coffins in ireland eyes half shut and faces flaccid it was in all conscience rutledge thought a gruesome collection he looked down into the trunk to see what else might have been stored there then ran his fingers again through the oddments of belongings that had formed the bottom layer a frame came to light one edge caught in a knitted scarf rutledge retrieved it and turned it over a young woman standing beside a horse her face bright in the sun smiled up at him her hair shiningly fair judging from the lovely hat in one hand and the stylishness of the dress she wore she was welltodo but who was she was this the photograph that father james had left to may trent there was no resemblance between the two women nor was there any to priscilla connaught rutledge hadnt met most of the other women in osterley frederick giffords dead wife the doctors daughter someone from the priests youth look on the reverse hamish suggested and rutledge took the back out of the frame to remove the photograph there was a date july and he words lightly inscribed so as not to mar the face gratefully v v victoria sprang to mind it had been a popular girls name throughout the late queens reign as mary was now in honor of the present queen vera vivian veronica virginia verity violet he ran out of possibilities still blevins could perhaps help him there or mrs wainer on the other hand hamish said it for him i wouldna be in haste to show it getting to his feet rutledge found a flat leather case lying in a corner of the room a coating of dust covering it and a cobweb linking it to the frame of the bottomless chair beside it the grip was broken at one end but it would do rutledge looked around him a last time at the waste not want not philosophy of householders who store in their upper floors and attics the ruined furnishings and venerable treasures they couldnt quite bring themselves to throw away in the event its ever needed and most of it lay there still forgotten and unwanted from generation to generation judging by the dust and cobwebs even mrs wainer seldom ventured up here he wondered if father james had kept that in mind when he stored the clippings and the photograph in his trunk or if that was where they were generally kept rutledge shook the dust from the leather case sneezing heavily and discovered that there was a mouse hole in one corner of the leather human flotsam and jetsam hamish pointed out sometimes served other creatures well smiling at that rutledge set the cuttings and the photograph inside closed the flap and looked into the small trunk a last timeeven stretching his fingers inside the torn corner of the lining on the right sidebefore deciding that he had the lot he carefully repacked the clothing before going down the attic stairs when rutledge walked through to the kitchen the housekeeper was standing at the back door in the midst of a lively conversation with the coal man his apron black with coal dust matched the color of his eyes and the bulbous nose matched the heavy chest that spread out from wide muscular shoulders rutledges tea was ready on a tray the kettle steaming gently on top of the stove an ironed white serviette over a plate kept sliced sandwiches moist hamish said if you didna stay chances are he will and in the same instant the coal man looked up with disappointment on his face as rutledge stepped into the kitchen rutledge said mrs wainer ive finished for the moment i have a few papers here that i shall need to look over and return to you papers she turned with some alarm her eyes flying to the case he was carrying old cuttings for the most part dated well before the war ill just look through them before you box them up with the rest of father jamess possessions but you never know do you where something useful might turn up she hesitated clearly uncertain where her responsibility lay rutledge added theyre to do with shipping not church business perhaps youve seen them on his desk a hobby of his was it to study maritime affairs it was as far as he was willing to go with the coal man unashamedly listening to every word there was nothing like that in his desk she protested but before she could ask to have a look at them the coal man stepped forward begging pardon sir shipping you said not that ship that sank back in was it his heavy hands with coal dust thick in the cracks and creases worked at his apron as if not accustomed to speaking to his betters before spoken to as i remember there was a reference to titanic rutledge replied guardedly yes then if i might offer a word sir there was a diffident smile on his face my daughter shes got herself a fine situation in london father jamesgod rest his soulasked if she might do him a small favor and he sent her twenty pounds to buy up all the london papers and cut out whatever there was about the ships sinking and the inquiry he wanted every word she could find and she must have sent him dozens of cuttings sir by post every week rutledge opened the case and pulled out the cuttings laying them on the table and spreading them with one finger like these the coal man came closer peering down his nose as if shortsighted aye i shouldnt be at all surprised though i never saw em jessie sent them straight to the rectory he paused and when rutledge didnt move the cuttings he added when tother ship was torpedoed that lusitania my daughter wrote him to ask if he wanted her to do the same again but he thanked her and said hed seen enough of tragedy his very words and so it would be your guess would it that this was a passing fancy he never spoke to me about that ship mrs wainer seemed hurt that shed been left out of his confidence it was the talk of england and i dont remember he ever said anything more than what a pity it was but do you recall seeing the letters coming from london as a rule father james collected the post she explained but youd have thought if they were that important he might have asked me to be on the lookout for them she peered down at the cuttings again id have put them in a scrapbook for him if hed wanted me to its just not like him not to say a word and no like him to lie to the doctor hamish added an echo of rutledges own thought turning to the coal man rutledge asked did you ever tell anyone about the favor your daughter was doing for the priest the jowly face flushed no sir it would be naturala matter of pride my work takes me into any number of houses sir the coal man said with a certain dignity and i never gossip about one to tother ask mrs wainer if shes ever heard me gossip mrs wainer shook her head no he never does rutledge collected the cuttings once more and put them back in the case thank you mrs wainer youll have these papers back within the week i shant have time for tea after all do you mind she was still more than a little concerned about the papers but said doubtfully if theyll help in any way sir then by all means rutledge spent the next hour in his room going through the yellowing cuttings they were dated in an untrained hand with the name of the newspaper or magazine written underneath the coal mans daughter anotherthe priestshad underlined names of passengers marking each with an s noting survivors an x noting the recovered and identified dead and an m for known missing this was a sad and depressing list but those who had not been recovered were sometimes mentioned by namethe wealthy the powerful the famous there were hundreds with no grave but the sea and no one to ask about them or grieve for them whole families lost together which was in a sense more haunting but at the same time perhaps kinder rutledge put the cuttings aside for a moment and stood by his windows looking out at the marshes he glimpsed peter henderson walking along the quay head down shoulders hunched and wondered if the man had a home to go to and then recalled that his family had cut him off where then did he live his mind on the clippings again rutledge felt a sadness that came from touching the tragedy of others one could claim that it was fate the invincible weight of the iceberg and the unsinkable ship colliding on a cold night in the north atlantic where there should have been no such danger at that time of the year who chose those who would live and who would die was that what disturbed the priest that so many could simply be left to freeze and drown in the sea by an omniscient and allpowerful god there were known to be dead or was it far more personal than an exercise in the definition of god he went back to work rubbing his shoulders as he concentrated on the cuttings looking for a clue and in the end he found not what he was looking for but what he had not expected to see in these articles the name of marianna trent she had been dragged into one of the lifeboats unconscious from a blow to the head a blessing perhaps with fractured ribs and a broken leg speculation was that shed been struck by another boat while floating in the water a sensation at first for she had no name and later of no interest to journalists hungry for fresh news she must have remained in hospital in ireland for some time because there was a small cutting dated three weeks after the disaster relating that this woman had been released and was returning to england her leg still in a cast but healed sufficiently to travel the article also contained a small and telling final paragraph miss trent whom the doctors have pronounced fully recovered has no memory of the tragedy but says that she dreams at night about falling into black water when interviewed by the shipping authorities she could provide no new information about the collision or the subsequent actions of officers or passengers to save the doomed ship how well hamish asked with interest did father james know this woman before she came to osterley titanic went down in april it was rutledge thought a question to pursue in the end rutledge went not to inspector blevins but to the vicar of holy trinity as the most likely person to give him the truth mr sims had been sitting in his study working on his sermon for the coming sunday service and he led rutledge to the cluttered bookfilled room with the air of a man just released from prison youd think he said ruefully that for a man of the cloth divine inspiration would pour forth like water from a holy spring ive agonized over this weeks message for hours and still have no idea what im trying to say he looked tired as if he hadnt slept shadows emphasizing the blueness of his eyes how is the painting coming rutledge asked for the smell of wet paint was still pervasive with greater speed than my persuasive powers my sister is wary about changing schools this far into the year her children are sad to leave their friends her own friends are asking her if shed be happy here in the broads i have run out of words for her too the last was said on a sigh when they were seated in the study with its dark paneling and almost grimly victorian austerity hamish said this is no a place of inspiration rutledge had to agree the gargoyles that surmounted the hearth and the agonystricken caryatids that supported it two wellmuscled monsters with their mouths twisted open with effort were depressingly vivid catching his expression as he glanced at them sims smiled i find this room most useful when im discussing appropriate behavior in church with small boys they cant take their eyes off the figures and it drives home my message quite well i think id find it more comfortable writing with my back to them rutledges voice was light unless the subject was judgment and damnation sims laughed outright it never occurred to me this was the study of the vicar before me and ive tried to follow his example better surely to follow your own there must be any number of rooms in this house that are more cheerful sims nodded actually there is a small office im fond of now tell me how i can help you with your problems any news on the man blevins is holding the police are still tracing his movements rutledge gave the stock answer he waited for a moment and then asked you were there when father james left the bedside at herbert bakers house yes he came into the parlor and the bakers offered him a cup of tea he was tired but he sat down andin my opinionmade the family feel a little more comfortable about what baker had done in sending for a priest did he bring anything with him that baker might have given him an envelope a small package he left the sentence unfinished no he had his small case with him with consecrated wafers and wine if there was something baker had wanted him to have it was small enough to fit in there or his pocket why does the family think anything is missing i cant believe nothing is missing rutledge replied quickly i found myself wondering if perhaps baker had given him a letter to post its as likely an explanation as any for bakers whim he shrugged as if it wasnt important put it down to curiositythe besetting sin of a policemans mind no what actually brought me are these he had folded a half dozen of the cuttings to fit into his breast pocket and now he took them out to hand to the vicar tell me what you make of these the vicar unfolded them and began to sift through the cuttings they appear to be news articles of the ship that sank back in he looked up a question on his face as if uncertain what rutledge wanted from him were they bakers i shouldnt think they have anything to do with baker no i found them among father jamess papers and this he took the photograph from his pocket and passed it across the desk something changed in simss expression how did you come by this his voice was carefully neutral do you recognize the woman no i think you must tell me first how you came to have this it was also in father jamess possession from what ive learned just before his death he chose to add a codicil to his will leaving what i believe to be this photograph to someone the vicars face had paled as if the blood had rushed to his heart and left his skin without its natural ruddy color not to me he would never have bequeathed it to me his voice was constricted by a tight throat but he couldnt take his eyes from what he held in both hands as if it were a treasureor a dangerous thing rutledge watching him said why not if you know the woman i know knew her can you tell me her name he moved gently carefully keenly aware that he was trodding on very emotional ground shes dead let her rest in peace she had nothing to do with father james he never met her rutledge deliberately took the words literally of course hed met herbut she wasnt a member of his parish she didnt live in osterley his words were disjointed as if he spoke without thinking responding to the tone of voice and not the sense of rutledges questions then she was a member of your parish no not at all with an effort the young vicar handed the framed photograph back to rutledge it was an act of denial as if by giving it back he was absolved of any more questions about it you havent given me her name rutledge reminded him look sims said his eyes wretched with pain this is a personal matter she had nothing to do with the priest or his church or his death how could she have she had nothing to do with me not really not in the true sense its been seven yearsshes been dead for seven years justleave it will you i cant until im satisfied that something father james kept seven years and then felt was important enough to bequeath to someone in his will shortly before his murder is not a matter of grave concern he chose the word purposefully not death murder violent and intentional murder it brought sims out of his shock his face seemed to collapse as if rutledge had so completely broken down his defenses that he had nowhere left to turn he had never been a forceful man he had never had the strength of a father james and yet in his own fashion he did have the ability to face the truth for gods sake he asked did he leave it to me when rutledge said nothing he went on all right if i tell you what you want to know will you leave us both in peace justleave us in peace he stopped as if afraid he might say too much what was she to you if you werent her priest simss eyes went to the caryatids the anguished figures howling in pain as they supported the heavy weight of the mantel rutledge thought he knows how they feelhis burden is as heavy hamish said he was in love wi her let it be but rutledge waited forcing sims to say what he did not want to say ii cared about her because she was in trouble but there was nothing i could do to help with all the might of the church behind me there was nothing i could do to help her chapter in the silence that followed rutledge gave sims a space in which to collect himself then he asked what was her name victoria vera ver i wont give you her name the vicar broke in wearily for gods sake man have a little sense shes long dead and youll only stir up whats best forgotten i gave that photograph to father james myself for safekeeping it wasit was part of a promise and i kept it that promise i did what was asked of me while she was alive and i tried to close the door once she was dead i dont know why he wished me to have it again i thought perhaps hed burned it years ago but i never quite had the courage to ask who knows about this gifford ill have to speak to him father james didnt leave it to you rutledge said finally but he did wish someone else to have it the impact of the londoners words left sims stunned not to me merciful god he tried to absorb that and then asked if not to methen to whom when rutledge didnt answer immediately sims continued look youve got to tell me that photograph could do unimaginable harm rutledge said if thats truethat a dead womans photograph could do such harmi cant imagine that father james would have kept it much less passed it on he wasnt from all ive learned about him either cruel or callous but dont you see it was given to me out of simple fondnessa gesture that was meant in all innocence thats the trouble it could be misconstruedinterpreted in another light it would sully her memory to no purpose if you wont tell me ill go to gifford myself relenting and at the same time testing the waters rutledge answered i cant tell you but if it matters this was bequeathed to a woman not a man sims leaned back in his chair a man emptied of all feelings yes that makes a kind of sense thank god and then he repeated silently thank god his lips moving without his knowledge as if they uttered a prayer hamishs first question came when the motorcar was turning through the vicarage gates into trinity lane he didna ask you who the woman was he didna care i think he caredbut he felt it was rightjustthat she should have it which means he already kens the name of the woman orthinks he does interesting isnt it mrs barnett was crossing the lobby when rutledge came into the hotel he stopped her and left a message for may trent to give him a time and place where they could meet he included the words official business she was still out mrs barnett informed him as she took the folded sheet of notepaper and put it safely in the drawer of the reception desk and might be staying the night with her friends he didnt think that was likely may trent was avoiding him rutledge went over the cuttings again looking for any connection between may trent and any other passenger on the ship and for anyone with a name beginning with v but he found no guidance in the reports of the sinking the survivors the missing or the dead nothing that leaped out at him as the answer he sought he was on his way down the stairs to put in a call to the yard to ask sergeant gibsonwho had an absolute gift for ferreting out informationto look into the shipping files at lloyds and the white star line for women passengers whose christian name began with a v the first words out of the crusty old sergeants mouth were likely to be and are there any other miracles sir that you might require of me instead he met mrs barnett coming up to find him theres a telephone call from the yard inspector its urgent he thanked her and followed her back to the narrow little office rutledge here he said into the phone sergeant wilkersons voice came down the line with the force of a foghorn that you sir ive got a bit of bad news or it might be good news depending on ones point of view what is it sergeant that iris kenneth we found dead in the river sir well it isnt her after all iris kenneth just walked in her landladys front door and like tove given the old biddy apoplexy on the spot thought shed seen a ghost she did but it was a very angry ghost who was soon threatening to have her up for theft for disposing of her personal property which the landlady if you recall sir had already sold are you quite sure rutledge said that the woman is truly iris kenneth this time oh yes sir there was quite a row and the local station sent a pair of constables along to see what it was about all the roomers living there swear that its iris but of course mrs rollings is fit to be tied claiming she never clapped eyes on this woman in her life well stands to reason he added suppressing a gleeful note in his voice shes likely to be taken up on charges rutledge thought it must have been quite an entertaining scene where has iris been did she tell you by the time i arrived there was some semblance of peace and she confessed shes been staying with friends in cardiff hoping for a part in some production there in my opinion she was short of money and ruralizing until something came up at any rate i took the liberty of contacting the cardiff police and they just sent word shes telling the truth if she was iris kennethwho was the woman in the river and what did the corpse have to do with matthew walsh hamish answered him nothing at all rutledge asked wilkerson if hed questioned iris kenneth about walsh that i did sir and she tells me hes a devious bastard who would strangle his own mother wilkersons laughter boomed down the line nearly deafening rutledge she hasnt had any decent work since he let her go and if she could point to him being jack the ripper shed be happy to do it its anger talking in my view revenge she doesnt sound afraid of him only furious with him i asked her if hed threatened her or hurt her in any way showing his violent nature so to speak she swore he never touched hershed had a little knife to use on him if he hadbut hes a brute and a niggardly bastard and selfish to boot a woman scorned if you learn anything about the other woman let me know shes gone into a paupers grave wilkerson replied there wont be any more interest in that one mores the pity but still she wont be the last if something does come up ill make sure you hear of it rutledge asked for sergeant gibson but was told that he was giving evidence in court for the next two days blevins took rutledges news with a shrug were not making much headway ourselves an old gypsy who scratches his living sharpening scissors and tinkering is not likely to hold the police in high regard theyve moved him along too many times and treated him like a pariah he wont forgive that and hell lie like a sailor to get his own back it wont matter to him whether matthew walsh killed a priest or not has this scissor sharpenerboltonever been charged by the police other than rousting him as a public nuisance nothing that could be proved against him in frustration blevins added theyre worthless that lot deserved or not it was the general view of gypsies thieves and liars and heathen filthy and secretive vagabonds inspector arnold who first interviewed this man is of the opinion that hes probably up to his neck in this which means hell stay with his story for his own sake not walshs rutledge said nothing blevins smiled ruefully well im glad of course for iris kenneths sake that shes alive and safe but it would have helped our case against walsh if we could have charged him with her murder as well your sergeant wilkerson is sure is he the other roomers in that boardinghouse had no reason to lie no he moved papers around on his desk and then said it has to be walsh theres no one else it could have been his eyes looking up suddenly dared rutledge to refute it he has the best motive for murder that weve found so far rutledge answered neutrally that has to count for something will you tell walsh or shall i that iris kenneth is alive ill tell him there was resignation in blevinss voice we cant charge him for the real drowning victims death can we it wasnt meant to be answered it was no more than a reflection of his mood ever hear father james speak of an interest in ships ships he was interested in the small boats around here handled the oars like a man used to the water weve been out fishing a time or two but he never said anything to me about ships why i wondered thats all i found some cuttings among his papers they had to do with titanic sinking im not surprised shocking the loss of life we all felt it yes rutledge let the silence lengthen before adding and lusitania did he ever speak of her im sure he was horrified everyone was whats this in aid of i dont know rutledge answered at the moment very little blevins grinned without humor youre reaching man at the dinner hour rutledge found his place at the only table set mrs barnett said im afraid its rather lonely tonight thursdays often are later as she brought his main course she informed him ive had no word from miss trent were you expecting her to join you for dinner no yes ive some questions to ask her her gaze sharpened oh rutledge smiled i wanted to ask her about a photograph i found i thought it might be of interest to her i cant imagine how she isnt local perhaps i could help you its in my room ill bring it down after dinner the front door opened and someone came into the lobby both rutledge and mrs barnett looked up it was may trent she found them staring at her and it seemed to startle her but she said nothing going directly to the stairs and starting up them leaving his meal to follow her rutledge caught up with her on the landing i need to speak to you he said im tired no i dont want excuses if you dont mind coming to my room it will take no more than five minutes when she seemed on the point of arguing rutledge said my food is getting cold will you come with me or not she looked back down the stairs as if hoping to see mrs barnett staring up at them but she found no help there the innkeeper was in the kitchens all right five minutes she went ahead of him and he opened the door of his room for her leaving it standing wide there was no one to overhear their conversation may trent looked about her with interest as if mentally comparing his accommodations with her own he went to the desk drawer and on a sudden whim took out the photograph first handing it to her rutledge said can you identify this woman it was a natural question he had no intention of upsetting her and was completely unprepared for her reaction her face crumpled as if she was on the verge of tears but none came her eyes were dry and furious jerking the photograph from his hand she turned it on its face and dropped it on the bed as if it had burned her fingers no i wont talk to you i wont she moved to go and he stopped her his hand on her arm let go of me she cried color flaring in her face you can talk to me here or you can talk to me at the police station he said angrily your choice im leaving osterley ive only come to pack my bags and go my friends are waiting theyve gone to london he told her guessing and i can put you under arrest if i have to to keep you here theres an empty cell next to walsh she rounded on him anguish in her eyes i wont talk about it do you hear i couldnt tell you anything if i had to dont you understand i dont know anything i cant remember anything hamish cautioned someone is coming there was the sound of someone walking down the passage a soft footfall it was mrs barnett she stopped in the doorway horrified by the sight of rutledge clutching may trents arm as she tried to fight free of his grip inspector rutledge mrs barnett exclaimed moving toward them he looked up speaking with the cold air of command that had served him on the battlefield when his mind had been too tired and too worn to think mrs barnett sit down now she opened her mouth stared at them and sat theres a photograph on the bed the one i spoke of earlier he kept his grip on may trents arm as he spoke the skin was warm through the cloth of the sweater she was wearing over her long skirt pick it up and tell me if you will whether you recognize the woman in it she reached for it turning it over frowning at the face looking back at her i thinkwell i know its a photograph of virginia sedgwick lord sedgwicks late daughterinlaw may trent had begun to cry her face averted half shielded by her shoulder she was the wife of his elder son arthur yes thats right but why should you be harassing miss trent with it she never even met this woman as far as i know how did virginia sedgwick die she disappeared no one knew where she had gone it was whispered that shed run away from her husband but i know that couldnt have been true she just wasnt the sort hamish said its been said of many a wife that she wasna the sort but who can be certain i dont understand what is this about mrs barnett was still wearing her apron and she wiped a smudge from the glass over the photograph please will you not let miss trent go did her husband ever find mrs sedgwick no that is o say not alive she went down on that ship you see titanic she wasnt using her married name and no one thought to look under any other until lord sedgwick hired someone to do what the police apparently couldnt she stopped biting her lip in embarrassment how do you know all this he asked my husband told mehed met edwin on the train coming back from london edwin was quite upset he said his father and arthur had gone to ireland to bring back the body id read that most of the dead were buried in unmarked graves so they were but lord sedgwick was convinced he could find her for arthurs sake and he must have been successful i heard there was a service in the little church on the sedgwick estate the queen sent flowers i was told rutledge released may trent hamish rasped ask her he said to her does the vicar know you were on titanic that you may have met virginia sedgwick and seen her drown or that father james was trying to awaken your memories no i have never told anyone here father jameshe had clippingshed seen my name among the survivors and he wanted she stopped unable to go on and you cant remember what happened the night of the sinking she shook her head her dark hair spilling over her face hiding it but father james had bequeathed her the photograph and asked that she do something about itfind the courage as hed put it the priest hadnt believed that her memory of that night had never been regained or else he had hoped that given timeand over the years he thought he still had to liveshe might yet remember still it was a strange way to go about itto leave a message in a will once he was dead what difference would it make the cuttings the photograph the bequest but why was it so important to father james it went through rutledges mind before he could stop himself from thinking the unthinkable that perhaps may trent had killed the priest to prevent him from prying into memories that she could not face and never wanted to face some eight months ago he himself had tried to kill the doctor who had forced the secret of his own ghosts out of the silence he had wrapped around himself like a dark and protective cloak may trent had suddenly found herself in the running with a better reason than walsh for committing murder abruptly realizing that both may trent and mrs barnett were watching him he made an effort to meet the younger womans eyes they flickered as she read his thoughts i didnt kill him she said quietly numbness washing all expression out of her face truly but what hamish was demanding if the worried priest had backed away from confrontation and written the codicil to his will instead hoping that in time may trent might relent and do whatever it was that mattered so much to him only to learn that it was already too late hed set in motion a chain of events that couldnt be reversed something that need never reach the light of day if he lived to old age rutledge said harshly to the two women in his room and to the voice in his head i dont know the answer i wish to god i did chapter there was absolute silence for a long disturbing moment mrs barnetts eyes were wide with distress the emotionally charged atmosphere had left her speechless unprepared to take up either side may trent who had borne the brunt of rutledges intensity found the inner resources to stare back at him a remarkable strength in her face you dont mean that she told him you cant but there were tears on her lashes the room seemed to shrink in on him the walls squeezing out the air the two women between him and the door a trap he couldnt escape from taking a deep breath to shake off the sense of smothering rutledge fell back on the one thing that had always brought him through his ability to command in a voice that sounded absolutely normal despite the turmoil that racked him rutledge said mrs barnett can you serve miss trent her dinner tonight i think she needs food and shes not in any condition to go elsewhere in her room mrs barnett asked doubtfully rising no in the dining room miss trent go and wash your face then come downstairs with me he added as she started to protest i promise you i wont bring up mrs sedgwick oror your own experiences but i need to hear about father jamess interest in titanic and her death and if you will tell me that i shall stay out of your way after tonight a fierce pride touched her i dont want your pity im not offering you pity im searching for answers if you can help me ill take that help with gratitude then he added with a surprising and unexpected gentleness go on its for the best may trent studied him he could almost read what was going through her mindthat she didnt want to be alone with her thoughtsbut neither was she up to enduring public scrutiny at the pelican if her emotional state showed as she must have felt it did give me five minutes she walked out of the room and toward her own mrs barnett watching her go said to rutledge that was inexcusable no murder is inexcusable he told her flatly i can probably understand her feelings better than most but i wont walk away from my investigation when there are answers to be had but she couldnt have known mrs sedgwick even if somehow theyd met on shipboard it wouldnt have anything to do with father james would it as for accusing her of killing him she accused herself rutledge replied weariness in his voice it got out of hand mrs barnettit sometimes does when people are being questioned im not sure why you came up here but once you were here i had no choice except to ignore you still rattled she said inspector blevins would never im not inspector blevins he turned to shove the photograph safely away again in the desk no hamish pointed out and mores the pity rutledge ushered mrs barnett out of the room as he shut the door behind them he said forget what happened just now you cant change it for one thing and for another you dont really understand all the reasons behind it meanwhile since youve heard everything that has been said id like to ask you what sort of woman mrs sedgwick was mrs barnett seemed to have trouble concentrating on his question they had reached the stairs before she began tentatively ii cant really tell you i hardly knew her she was always with one or another of the familyi seldom had an opportunity to say more than half a dozen words to her alone then she faced him i dont know why this matters because in one way or another she mattered to father james and even though we have walsh in custody we arent absolved from considering all the other avenues the victims life opens to us doubtful still she answered i didnt know her but she seemed nice enough well born ive heard she came from a very fine american family a niece or cousin to the present lord sedgwicks american wife quite pretty as you could see for yourself rather shy and quiet with a lovely smile did she attend church here in osterley here no not very often theres a charming little church on the estate in east sherham but the sedgwicks would come to osterley around once a month and the vicar tried to interest mrs sedgwick in good works she was too shy and always sent excuses for not showing up did she have many friends in osterley rutledge asked as he walked with mrs barnett through the french doors into the dining room he saw her glance quickly over her shoulder as if she would like nothing more than to escape from him to her kitchen i dont suppose there was anyone here quite suitable people generally appeared to like heri never heard anyone say anything unkind about her men found her quite attractive that soft american accent for one thing and she seemedi dont knowmy husband said that she brought out a mans protective instincts mrs barnett clucked her tongue at the congealed food on his plate and added quickly ill just warm this up did women like her i suppose they did but women of her class are often you either fit into their circle or you dont she paused pensive its odd ive just remembered something the sedgwick family came here occasionally for luncheon on market day my husbands mother who is gone now always called mrs sedgwick the little rabbit almost as if she imagined her huddled in the midst of the dogs trying to vanish she shook her head i never saw that myself she took up the plate and started for the kitchen then she turned and forced herself to ask you wont upset miss trent again will you i should hate to lose her as a guest just because youve badgered her there arent that many weekly guests this time of year and it isnt right that you should use your office to upset her shell be safe enough i promise you he said and she walked through the swinging doors to the kitchen without looking back miss trent came in reluctantly to join rutledge her face was exceedingly pale and she seemed uneasy when she realized that they had the vast room to themselves rutledge said immediately i ought to apologize but i have a job to do and i try to do it well it was a more effective apology than an abject capitulation and she accepted it i dont particularly care to take a meal with you she said in return but its probably more comfortable here than at the police station with everyone staring a quirk of sudden humor in her eyes told him she was giving him his own back he laughed yes i suppose it is but i promise to talk about father james not you i didnt know him well you told me once before that hed wanted something from you that you couldnt give him was it to do with mrs sedgwick yes like a swimmer plunging into cold water she shivered i dont know how he discovered that idthat there was a connection with the ship but one day as we were having tea he asked me if i remembered meeting her i told him i couldnt even remember sailing its all blacked out like amnesia only it was shock that did it do the doctors feel you might eventually remember they persuaded me not to try she said uncomfortably they told me it was better if i didnt ive had dreamsbut they were always terrifying and id make certain not to think about them afterward do you still have those dreams he stopped and said sorry i meant it from the point of view of understanding what youve suffered sometimes usually i dont know i dont want to know and father james felt that perhaps you could recall some of the voyage if you tried orgiven time yes he was convinced it was important to try to put it behind me instead of running from it but i didnt want to open that door i thought he was wrong to suggest it there were other survivors but he waswaryabout approaching them without some authority what was his interest in the sedgwick woman may trent frowned im not sure when she disappeared it was very trying for her family and everyone who knew her why this sudden whim this need to run away apparently there wasnt an answer and i suppose if father james found someone like me who might be able to define her state of mind when she took passage he would have been comforted no thats the wrong word satisfied shaking her head she went on i suppose what he really wanted to hear was that she was safe and happy it was almost as if he needed to know that to have any peace himself what if she hadnt been on boardwhat if shed bought her passage and then changed her mind oh i cant believe thatfather james never once suggested that she hadnt been on titanic after all hamish pointed out sensibly the remains were brought back to norfolk the proof of death was there a coffin was brought back to norfolk rutledge contradicted the voice in his head no one would have opened it to have a look at the contents father james seemed to be uncertain whether this was a planned escape or if she just took an opportunity that presented itself shed been on her way to east sherham from yorkshire and she decided to spend an hour in the shops in kings lynn because she was planning a party when she failed to meet the chauffeur at the appointed time he was patient he didnt raise an alarm for several more hours and later someone remembered seeing her at the railway station she was seen again in colchester on the train to london shed taken nothing with her which i found odd but of course she could have bought whatever she needed in london shops did father james tell you the chauffeurs name rutledge asked if he did i cant recall it what i cant fathom is the relationship between a priest and one of the sedgwick family rutledge said it doesnt fit into any explanation i can think of actually it was probably nothing more complicated than the fact that virginia sedgwick had a grandmother who was catholic father james mentioned that in passing mrs dabney had been terribly fond of her if virginia was homesick i expect shed be drawn to something familiar and father james had a very practical faith if shed come to him troubled or lonely or just needing comfort hed have tried to help her without proselytizing the vicar would have been closer to her age rutledge speculated but miss trent was saying i wasnt very attentive im afraid although father james did his best to bring her alive for me she had the grace to flush i didnt want to be interested in her i didnt want to find myself thinking about her and then starting to dig into the blacknessi couldnt face it her eyes pleaded with him for understanding it sounds quite selfish and callous to say that especially now that hes dead but there was nothing i could do for virginia sedgwick was there and the thing was i couldnt bear to go back and i couldnt explain why i couldnt go back its such a simple question isnt it do you remember i think he must have believed that given time you would rememberotherwise he wouldnt have chosen to leave you that photograph may trent said knowing thatnow that hes dead puts a tremendous burden on me i dont quite see how to cope with it i wish he hadnt but then he hadnt expected to die within a matter of days the shock of that left her silent for a moment yes i see your way of putting all this together if he harried me i must have killed him just for a little peace but he didnt i know he was the sort of man who believed that good would triumph that one morning id sit up in bed and suddenly remember meeting this woman on the deck or in the dining rooms the card rooms somewhere after all women traveling alone tend to gravitate toward each otherit wouldnt have been so amazing if our paths had crossed mrs barnett came in with a tray bearing hot platters and trailing an aroma of beef in a wine sauce she set their plates down with care studying the faces at the table im so sorry miss trent but there isnt any more soup im not really hungry but thank you when she had gone may trent said i dont think i can swallow a mouthfulwhat am i going to do at least make a show of trying rutledge told her bracingly youll feel better having eaten you dont understand she said irritably its not something i relish this black hole in my life it takes a revenge of its own i think i do he answered her their eyes locked hers widened in surprise as if reading the depths of his and turning away from what she found there he felt a spreading hurt her voice trembling she replied yes well is there anything else you want to know tell me about yourself what you do where youve been why you have stayed so long in osterley she grimaced as she tried a forkful of beef but she persevered he gave her credit for courage the last is easy to answer ive been looking at old churches and i found osterley to my liking i prefer to stay here rather than pack my bag every few days and move to another hotel i like the marshes they appeal to me the desolation perhaps or their strange beauty ive never quite decided which it is do you live in london somerset i grew up there and i feel at home there what took you to america is that a safe question to ask she turned away i had the care of an elderly lady who was the aunt of a friend she was going to new york to visit her son and i was asked if id like to make the journey with her as a companion actually but she was perfectly capable of looking after herself she broke off and fought to regain her composure clearing her throat with the effort he knew then that her charge had not survived which must have added enormously to the ordeal may trent herself had suffered rutledge said then youd have come back to england in a few months yes that was the plan id never been abroad except to france a time or two and once to germany i saw it as an adventure the words caught in her throat can we talk of something else she soldiered on valiantly through the rest of the meal he thought perhaps shed stayed at the table to prove to him that she could or because she didnt want to go upstairs alone where the ghosts in the night lay waiting for her it was something that they shared this fear of being alone after a long silence may trent put down her fork and considered rutledge how can you bear to question people the way you do prying and digging into lives as if none of us possessed a shred of privacy i should think it would be very wearing after a time its worse than gossiping oror eavesdropping hamish said its true its no a gentlemans way rutledge winced but said if people told the truth the first time they were questioned wed have less need to pry but lying shrouds what people say in layers of darkness these have to be peeled away and sifted and verified and even set aside as intentional misdirection playing with the bread beside her plate she said i cant believe that most people are honest enough arent they she had rolled two small marbles of the bread before she realized what she was doing were you honest with me earlier this evening she flushed and said i was protecting my own secrets not those of father james he hesitated if i come to you tomorrow and ask you if you killed father james will you tell me the truth of course why should i not im innocent would you tell me the truth if you hadfor reasons i couldnt fathomstruck him down and left him to die on the floor in his own blood something stirred at the back of her eyes im not mad i know youd hang me if i told you that but that isnt the same as prying it isnt the same as demanding the name of the woman in that photograph whenwhen speaking of that ship digs into my shadows not hers she held up a hand to stop him from answering her how would you respond if i asked you about the war you were in the fighting werent you you did see bodies blown apart and bones protruding from flesh your friends cut in half by machinegun fire and nothing but blood where their chests used to be you did kill people didnt you how does it feel to watch a man die as you shoot him with a sharp intake of breath rutledge got up from the table and went to the window the street was dark the last of the light gone and the quay empty save for a small marmalade cat trotting along sniffing the air im sorry i didnt mean she began startled by his reaction and then she lifted her chin a little trick she had when she was defiant no thats not true i did mean to hurt i wanted you to know how your wretched questions tormented me touche rutledge told her quietly may trent did not take her tea in the parlor with rutledge she went up the stairs without looking back but something in the set of her shoulders suggested that she was crying unable to sleep rutledge walked out to the quay to look up at the stars a whiff of pipe smoke made him turn in time to see dr stephenson coming in his direction well met stephenson said but without sincerity i had an emergency delivery and im still too excited to go to bed touch and go but mother and son are going to be all right whats your excuse rutledge thought i could tell you ive been tormenting two womenat least they feel i have instead he answered i have a liking for the marshes i suppose stephenson grunted whats the news about walsh among other issues inspector blevins has been trying to find out if walsh had encountered father james in france oh i shouldnt think that was likely besides what difference would it make the fact that theyd met wouldnt change what happened in the rectory or why blevins has learned that father james had written a letter from france to his sister judith he made some remark in passing about a story shed liked as a child about jack and the giant but judith is dead and the letter hasnt survived stephenson began to chuckle deep in his throat sometimes i dont pretend to understand the policemans mind jack the giant you say we cant leave anything to chance but stephenson cut him short youre fools the lot of you it wasnt jack it was jacques and he was tall and thin as a rail looked like a beanpolebut he was hardly a giant father james told me about this manfelt that id be interested in the way he treated wounds jacques lamieux was his name and he was a french canadian medical man he came to france for firsthand experience and he got his fill of it we still correspond he has a practice in quebec and a reputation for being the best there is at amputationsa very high percentage of his patients live still chuckling dr stephenson walked away then over his shoulder he said you can tell blevins for me that i can produce letters from lamieux dated this month hard to bash a mans brains in from that distance rutledge lay awake for hours staring at the ceiling his eyes following the pale ripples of light that clouds threw across the beautifully plastered finish as they moved in front of the halfmoon hamish talked about the war about the men theyd lived with for days at a time in the trenches and in the holding areas waiting for their turn most read talked played cards wrote letters home anything to while away the hours of boredom before the wild wash of fear when they were ordered to fall in no one spoke of the dead then it was not superstition as much as dread that this time their own names would be added to the long rolls of missing wounded and killed this time they wouldnt come back the chances were never good lucksometimes skillsometimes mere instinctcould change the odds in your favor but there were so many dead so many as if the war were a monstrous beast hungry for flesh and impatient for bodies no man who had fought in battle remembered it afterward without the rich coloring of his own fears scenes replayed themselves in slow motion unwinding like a ribbon of terror and a soldiers greatest fear was that his own gutwrenching cowardice would let his mates down and so he was brave in spite of himself but never brave enough never able to save them all and he dragged the unlucky ones back to the trenches while they screamed to him to leave them it hurt too much and he held them as they died and all the while furtively thanked god that he himself was whole only to lie awake at night drowning in guilt because he had lived somehow was that the fear that may trent carried with her that she had let the elderly woman in her care die that somehow in darkness and terror and confusion she had let go of a hand to save herselfhurried too fast to save herselfbeen blind when she should have seen guilt was what scoured the soul after it was over and she would protect the darkness because it was comforting or because she feared the truth about herself was that enough to drive her to murder when father james pushed her to remember hed have turned his back on her unwitting perhaps walk to the window and look out at the night while she found her handkerchief and pretended to wipe away tears and she would have found it easy to silence the voice that was somehow reaching into the depths of her mind and hurting what had dr stephenson said that father james had had such a beautiful voice and knew how to use it as a tool of his work hamish growled yon inspector wouldna care whether it was walsh or this woman he hanged ye ken it doesna matter as long as it isna someone from osterley drifting into sleep rutledge heard himself answer virginia sedgwick wasnt from osterley either chapter rutledge awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of thunder the guns he thought as he tried to shake off the dullness that weighed so heavily on his body like a mattress muffling and distorting the noise theyve started firing again he could hear one of the sergeants calling his name and cleared his throat to answer but couldnt and then sleep fell away and he realized there was a pounding on his door and the voice calling him wasnt one he knew rising swiftly he went to open the door and found a young constable standing there blood on his cheek and shoulder his face white rutledge struggled to recall his name franklin inspector blevins asks sir if youll come straightaway rutledge opened the door wider yes all right tell me whats happened he crossed to the chair by the window and began to dress adding a sweater under his coat the constable was saying all hells broke loose sir his voice was still highpitched from shock but steady enough that man walsh has escapedhe struck me over the head and was gone before i could do anything when i got my senses back i ran to wake up inspector blevins and on the way back to the station we saw mr sims coming from the vicarage there was someone trying to break into the house it had to be walsh sir rutledge found his shoes and stockings pulling them on hastily then ran his fingers through his tousled hair all right lets be on our way hamish was saying i canna believe hed run its sure proof against him may trent in a dressing gown her hair in a dark plait over one shoulder was at her door as he strode into the passage the words found their way into the jumble of thoughts in his mind shes damned attractive whats wrong she asked is there something amiss the constable started to answer her but rutledge said no its a problem at the station ive been sent for go back to sleep theres nothing to worry about there was doubt in her face but she nodded and went back into her room shutting the door as he turned toward the stairs he heard the click of the lock behind him just as well he told himself but walsh had no reason to come here they let themselves out quietly and mrs barnett in dressing gown and slippers shut and locked the door behind them as the two men walked fast up water street to the station rutledge said you were on duty then yes walsh was asleep when i checked at midnight snoring like the wrath of god he always doesyou can hardly hear yourself think and close on to two oclock i heard him making an odd sound as if he was choking i went back to the cell wary because inspector blevins had warned me he might try something but there he was hanging from the top bars choking his life out kicking like a mad horse i opened the door to get him down from there but he was tangled in a shirt and i had to struggle to make any headway then his fist came down on my face as i managed to lower him and i hit the back of my head on the door thats all i can tell you and he made a run for it all right what else for the life of me i dont understand why he didnt kill me he could have done easily enough and thered be nobody to raise the alarm as it was it took me all of a minute to shake off the blow i was that dazed and half sick but i got to my feet and went after him running out of the station and looking in both directions i couldnt think he would go to the quay theres nowhere to escape there i went up water street and looked up and down the main road i couldnt see anything or hear anything i went on to inspector blevinss house it took him nearly five minutes to come down and open the door and then he was accusing me of rousing the children with my clamor excitement had loosened the young constables tongue and he was finding it hard to conceal his reaction to blevinss rebuke when hed been trying to carry out his duty stumbling on the cobbles he caught rutledges arm to steady himself you should see the doctor rutledge told him as they walked through the open door of the station all the lights were lit and another constable was waiting for the two men youre to stay here harry and wait he said to franklin if youll come with me sir im to take you to the vicarage give me two minutes rutledge said and he walked back to the cell looking in he could see that by standing on his toes walsh could have reached high above his own head to an exposed pipe coming out of one wall and crossing to the other side wrapping his twisted shirt around it like a rope and giving every appearance of a man hanging there after all as hamish was pointing out the man was used to entertaining crowds he would have put on a good show long enough at least to lure the gullible young constable into the room hamish said blevins will have his hide rutledge silently agreed he turned on his heel and followed the second constabletaylor was that his name out to the street by the time they had reached the vicarage they could already see that all the lights had been turned on giving it a strangely festive air as if sims was about to hold a party there the front door stood wide and rutledge could hear the station sergeant moving about in the bushes near it his torch flicking first this way and that they found sims and blevins sitting in the study like two wary bulldogs distrustful of each other blevins said what took you so long his voice was querulous tired sims seemed to be happier to see rutledge he nodded and then looked over his shoulder out the black window as if he could probe the darkness in the treeshadowed garden i stopped by the station to see how walsh had played his trick quite clever clever hell a child of six could have seen through it blevins swore no thats not fair to franklin what matters when you come down to it is that the mans got away there was a prowler here rutledge asked the vicar i thought there was sims said uneasily i awoke with a start to hear something downstairs a banging i thought it was a summons to a deathbed i found my slippers and came down as quickly as i could but there was no one at the door i called out to see if whoever it was had given up and was walking away and i could have sworn i heard laughter distant laughter he shivered involuntarily i stepped into the sitting room and picked up a poker by the hearth there and went out to see if rowdy youngsters were having fun at my expense but there was nothing no one his voice changed on the last words as if still unsure that there had been no one on the grounds i decided to fetch blevins here to see if there was anything amiss in the church its too large and dark to search on my own hamish said it wasna youngsters he feared rutledge said do you often have problems with vandalism were more likely to find boys scaring themselves to death in the churchyard daring each other to raise spirits but before i could reach blevinss house i ran into him on the road rutledge turned to the inspector do you think it was walsh here at the vicarage i dont know he might have thought he could find something to sell to get himself out of norfolk as fast as possible it appeared that one of the shed doors has been opened he could have looked there for tools to strike off his chains thats far more likely rutledge agreed did you search the church not yet do you have another torch vicar yestheres one in the kitchen he went to fetch it brave man rutledge commented to tackle these grounds alone and in the middle of the night he was terrified for his life if you ask me blevins said sourly i would have been the surviving clergyman in the village sims hadnt been told about the escape and walsh would have no reason to kill sims so you say who knows what hes capable of sims returned with the torch and rutledge followed blevins out of the vicarage down the drive and up the hill to the church they walked in silence their path just visible in the light of the half moon but it was sinking fast the churchyard was empty the white stones ghostly in the pale light their shapes stark against the dark shadows of hummocky grass if there was anyone here hes gone now blevins said softly they walked on toward the north porch door it screeched like the imps of hell as blevins pushed it open and he swore from the start it gave him hamish said at least yon strong man canna slip away fra ye walsh are you here the inspector called the church is surrounded man you havent a chance of getting out of here might as well surrender now and save yourself a rough time of it if you try to run blevinss voice echoed in the stillness bouncing from the rafters and around the stone walls giving it a strangely unnatural sound there was no answer walsh you didnt hurt the constable you can go back quietly to the station and nothing will happen to you do you hear me but if we have to winkle you out of this church and you do any damage here ill have your hide for garters big as you are im not afraid of you nothing but his own words came back at him the moonlight seeping through the stained glass of the windows cast awkward patterns around the pews gray here black there and the shape of a poppyhead outlined against a pane rutledge thought hell be impossible to find before daylight if hes here blevins turned on the torch blinding them and spoiling their night vision flashing it around the stone floor across the backs of the pews toward the choir screen in sweeps that raked the great nave with crossbars of light he covered as much of the darkness as possible rutledge said he has the advantage now well have to guard the doors until morning no i intend to finish this now you go toward the tower ill move toward the choir he turned among the pews his heels scraping on the stone flags a man determined to get what he wanted rutledge went on toward the tower letting his eyes readjust to the darkness using the great window there as his mark hamish whose hearing had always been keen on night watches said there isna anyone here blevins blundered into something he grunted heavily and then called im all right rutledge made his way along one wall reached the tower and started into the opening his foot caught something on the floor and the rattle of chain startled him leaping back out of reach he knelt and began to sweep the floor with his hands nothing neither flesh nor cold iron he moved six inches forward and repeated his sweep his fingers touched iron this time and fumbled across thick links of chain blevins he called not raising his voice ive found something bring your torch blevins turned and came toward rutledge the silvery light shining on his face down here man rutledge snarled not into my eyes the torch reached rutledges knees and moved ahead on the stone floor lay a chisel a great hammer and the chains that had been around walshs wrists and ankles but there was no sign of blevinss prisoner chapter rutledge drove east on the main road out of osterley a ruddyfaced yawning farmer beside him in the motorcar in the rear seat hamish stirred uneasily and rutledge felt every shift and movement as if it were real blevins had acted swiftly sending constables and any ablebodied man they could rouse to knock on doors recruiting more men as the search for the strong man widened one party went out into the marshes to look for missing boats the greengrocer and the barman at the pelican accompanied dr stephenson in his motorcar driving out on the western road toward wells next the sea and hunstanton six men set out on the road toward east sherham while others fanned out through osterley looking behind fences opening the doors of sheds waking householders to ask if theyd heard anything seen anyone bobbing lanterns marked their progress through the darkness like a great chinese dragon and wives watched from windows shushing children who were unsettled by the nights noises the road east toward cley was the least likely direction to search but it had to be covered there was nothing here but the north sea and a dead enda man on the run would quickly find himself in a box with nowhere to turn but south still several roads that led down toward norwich branched off from the cley road and these were rutledges goals the farmer a man of few words roused himself to remark course he might be clever enough to come this way on purpose to throw the hunt off driving slowly his headlamps scouring the road ahead while the farmer watched the verges rutledge could feel nothingno sense of a fugitive hiding in the edges of the marsh or ducking behind trees and garden gates hed mastered that instinct during the war where german snipers were skilled at picking off the unwary and machine gunners hidden in cleverly disguised trenches and shell holes and uprooted trees waited for the onslaught of troops holding fire until the unsuspecting were well within range hamish behind him seemed to keep watch as well softly noting a high growth of shrub or a clump of windtwisted trees that provided a likely covert for the human fox they were hunting the one factor on their side rutledge found himself thinking was that walsh was too big to hide himself in smaller and hardertosee coverts but in the dark out in the marshes with their sluices and dikes shadows could play deadly tricks the farmer cleared his throat aint likely is it that were going to find him in the dark itud take an army searching in daylight he broke off as a dog turned out of a field and trotted down the road caught brilliantly in the headlamps thats old tom randals dogblessed beast got out again i never saw such a one for wandering off every chance that comes youd think hed be grateful for a good home they were nearly past the dog when the farmer sat up and added on second thoughts mayhap we should look in on randal can you turn this thing around rutledge saw a drive ahead next to a high wall he reversed into it and went back down the dark empty road the way hed come the dog had already disappeared into a patch of thick reeds and grasses just there the farmer finally said pointing to a turning a small cottage was set back from the road on the inland side half lost among trees and a wild tangle of shrubbery not much now but once it was a pretty enough place my wife treasured the plant cuttings mrs randal offered her shes gone now mrs randal some six or seven years back toms let her gardens run to seed rutledge drew up in the rutted overgrown drive the house was dark hunching in on itself vines running up the porch and struggling to hide the windows on the first floor hamish said if ye believed in witches rutledge smothered a chuckle the house needed only a cauldron smoking in the yard they walked to the door and with his fist the farmer pounded on the panels as hard as he could deaf as a post he explained when he wants to be my wife always claimed hed rather be left alone after a time someone threw up the sash of the window just above the porch it squealed with a shriek like a night birds as rutledge winced a gray head appeared in the opening and called down whos there its sam hadley tom we need to talk to you come down to the door its past midnight randal growled go home to bed rutledge called its a police matter mr randal please come down police there was a pause and then mumbled curses the window went down with a bang and after a long wait the door opened the tall thin man in a heavy robe tied at the waist like a sack peered out at them he turned to hadley and said thats not blevins it was accusing as if hed been lied to nor one of his constables inspector rutledge from scotland yard in london mr randal a man suspected of murder escaped from custody tonight in osterley a man named walsh were searching for him randal watched his lips closely as he spoke then looked up at his eyes walsh that the one killed the priest he could be dangerous hes larger than most with wide shoulders and noticeable strength he went on to describe the fugitive this time as randal listened he forgot to watch rutledges lips nobodys been here id have known that yellow dog of yours is out in the fields hadley said i saw him myself we thought we ought to come and find out if youre all right he had pitched his voice between a shout and a yell dogs out you say randal frowned i penned him up before i went to bed wed better have a look at the outbuildings then wait here he closed the door and came back shortly with heavy shoes on his feet and a heavy staff in his hands solid oak and thick enough to kill a man that a torch you have hadley hadley flicked it on and they made their way toward the back of the house where a barn and several sheds showed signs of age but were in better condition than the front garden randal rutledge thought had his priorities right the sheds were empty hadley shone his light around each in turn while randal peered intently at the contents farm tools old gear and wheels tubs and barrows often rusted and broken from time to time he poked the heavy staff viciously into the shadows behind them no nothing taken he said as they finished the outbuildings and turned toward the barn and not likely to be he muttered damn fool waste of time but it was a different story in the barn the stalls where randals horses were stabled lay on the far end past the heavy wagon and the plows there were four stalls two of them occupied with great gray horses staring back at the light with luminous eyes and pricked ears the warmth of their bodies and their breath filled the night air a homey scent of horse and straw and barn dust and the heavier odor of manure and urine god damn it to hell randal swore wheres honey he broke into a shambling run to throw open a stall door and lean to look inside hadley right behind him shone his light into the dark rectangle but the horse that occupied the space was not there trampled straw reflected the yellow beam and a clump of droppings randal beside himself cried shes my best mareif hes hurt her rutledge looked at the size of the other horses norfolk bred they were very large heavyboned and tall hamish spoke startling him one of those would bear walshs weight randal was nearly dancing with anger now clutching his staff in a whiteknuckled grip pounding it against the flagstone floor with every other word as he demanded to know what had become of his mare a string of profanity indicated what he was prepared to do with the thief when he caught up with him rutledge said waserhoney the same size as these two of course she is thats her son the darker one and tother is her daughter they hurried out of the barn and searched the yard but there was no sign of the horse and it was too dark to be sure whether there were other footprints in the dust besides theirs where would she go if she got loose rutledge asked she wouldnt leave the barn randal spoke with illconcealed impatience as if rutledge were daft shed never leave the barn unless someone came in and took her the dog rutledge said do you think he could track her that old fool hes not worth a farthing i keep him for his bark not his common sense randal was staring around the yard fuming as if expecting honey to come toward them head down sheepishly to snuffle his robe for apples but the mare was gone and rutledge thought the odds were very good that walsh had taken her the farm wasnt as the crow flew all that far from osterley and holy trinity he turned to hadley where would he go if hed taken the horse hadley shrugged heavy shoulders through the meadow there and the trees beyond after that who knows he could travel some distance without being seen if he kept his wits about him and didnt stir up dogs well have to come back in the morning we cant follow him now not across the fields on foot but randal was adamant that they go after the fugitive immediately honeys got a soft mouth but he wont know that will he bastardll ride her until she drops most like i want her back and i wont wait for morning by rutledges reckoning walsh had a head start of at least two hours the first part of it on foot as hamish was pointing out but with the horse under him now he could have covered miles in any direction south to norwich it was possible but rutledge had the feeling that walsh wouldnt box himself in for longhed leave east anglia as swiftly as possible and lose himself in the crowded midlands or the outskirts of london liverpool manchester when rutledge explained this to randal the farmer swore again went stumping back into the barn and began to saddle one of the remaining horses rutledge tried to persuade him to wait until dawn but tom randal had made up his mind he threw himself into the saddle with an agility that belied his years and said with cold determination if i find him ill get my horse back if you wait until dawn hell have ridden her into the ground and shed not be fit for anything but the knackers yard he brandished his staff at them as he touched his heel to the flank of the big gelding and clicked his tongue the horse snorting went placidly out the barn doors and trotted off toward the meadow for all its bulk it moved quietly on the thick sod hadley shook his head hes always been an ornery old devil randal has but hes right on horse he has a chance and i cant say i blame him farmer understanding farmer ingrained for centuries this caring for livestock was survival walsh wont let randal anywhere near him hell be tired frightenedand dangerous rutledge looked around the barn at the scythes and rakes and pitchforks hanging from pegs along the walls and a barrow with a tumble of trowels hammers shorthandled mallets and other implements god knows what hes armed with now therere enough tools here to fit out a small army randals no fool he wants that mare back in the worst way and hell be canny and that staff of his is no mean advantage hadley sighed wed best tell inspector blevins whats happened blevins was pacing the floor at the station trying to coordinate all aspects of the search but clearly wishing himself out in the field he looked up as rutledge walked through the door youre back soon enough anything rutledge made his report with hadleys commentary to support it blevins scowled the mare could be anywhere and whos to say that walsh is on her still precious little else has turned up he had an old map spread out across his desk and he bent to run his finger down the road toward cley stopping at the square marking the randal farm with its pastures and fields fanning out to the south it backed up to a much larger holding an expanse of pasturage that slanted toward east and west sherham toward the norwich road there was an unbroken chain of farms and estates miles of what appeared to be fairly uninhabited land a man on horseback could make good time even in the dark where only sheep would hear his passage rutledge leaned over the desk with blevins eyes scanning beyond the nowstill finger there was a maze of lanes and footpaths that led in every direction they were like small streams draining a basin converging at one or another village people in norfolk looked inland from the sea to market towns where goods and produce could be sold a more trustworthy livelihood than the shifting coastline in the north blevins was saying as his finger moved to draw a circle south of the farm ill get word to the villages in that district tell them to be on the lookout for a norfolk gray carrying a large man if the bastards ahead of us better to let someone else cut him off and well get on with the search in the town pointing to land that marched behind the randal farm rutledge asked who owns that property it was the old millingham estate the present lord sedgwicks father bought the lions share of it and the cullens and the henleys own the rest good sheep country he turned to issue an order to the harassed schoolmaster standing behind him filling in for the constables and then went on to rutledge if youll have a word with the vicar that we think our man is well away from here hed appreciate it hadley i want you to join the searchers down the lane past holy trinity ive yet to hear a word from themtell them to send a report the inspector here can drive you as far as the vicarage and rutledge after youve spoken with sims go directly to miss connaughts house if you will hadley can give you the direction she has a motorcarsee if you can persuade her to let us borrow it for the next few hours rutledge said by stealing the mare walsh marked his direction theres still a possibility that hell double back working his way west until he can find help if i were in his shoes id keep going counting on the head start to see me safe blevinss eyes met rutledges across the desk without wordswithout the need for wordsthe message was clear walsh wouldnt have run if he wasnt guilty as hell as far as blevins was concerned out of the nights disaster had come one comforting certainty as rutledge followed hadley back into the street he found himself thinking about what blevins had saidthat walsh would be counting on the miles between himself and osterley to see him safe was that true his mind reviewed the road system hed scanned on the map walsh was no fool he might well lay a false trail hed planned his escape and while it was a matter of luck that hed stumbled on randals farm where a horse could be taken without arousing the household or sending the dogs into frenzies of barking there must be a dozen farms where the barn was far enough from the house to allow walsh to break in and the yellow dog must have been an unwitting accomplice delighted to be set free and not questioning the manner of it sims was grateful for the news he looked haggard im not afraid of walsh he said and oddly enough rutledge believed him although blevins seems to think i was quaking in my shoes for fear id be the next victim and im not convinced somehow that walsh is guilty of murder why do you say that have you seen him met him no which is why ive kept my mouth shut but ive had long nights to think about father james and his death it seems to me that walsh took a chance coming back here weeks after the bazaar expecting to find money at the rectory most churches live hand to mouth it would have been easier to break into a house if he was desperate besides if he was wandering about in the rectory the day of the fair as mrs wainer claims he was hed have seen for himself that there was very little to steal he must have assumed rutledge said echoing hamish in his head that no one would connect his presence at the fair with a theft a good two weeks later that was blevinss opinion someone at the fair could have calculated roughly how much money had been taken in and there was a last payment to be made on the new cart before it would be handed over to walsh he was playing devils advocate to give sims an opportunity to get to the bottom of what he wanted to say sims took a deep breath thats a tidy assumption on the other handwas walsh that clever if so youll play merry hell catching him now then who killed the priest there was a long silence i dont know sims finally answered but i have the oddest feeling sometimes of being watched our festival is in the spring june why would anyone take an interest in the vicarage if money was all they were after look around you monsignor holston had also had the feeling that he was watched sims was saying youre fairly certain are you that what i heard was walsh chiseling off his shackles certain enough we found the chains in the church you identified the tools as yours and the latch on the shed door was broken rutledge reminded him it seems clear that walsh came looking for a shed or outbuilding he could break into and the church was a perfect place to hammer off the chains no one lives close enough to hear the racket except perhaps for you yes well from what you say hes running now and not likely to hang about in osterley he rubbed tired eyes all right thanks tell blevins if he needs me im available i wont sleep anyway after all this excitement i must be going im to make sure miss connaught is safe blevins has been trying to see that all the people living alone are warned a wry smile crossed simss face yes go by all means ill be fine but as rutledge walked out the door to the car he heard the bolt shot home behind him hamish said was the laughter realor his imagination yon vicar rutledge answered silently i dont know shock can play strange games with the mind on the other hand its easy to hear what you expect to hear aye well he heard something priscilla connaught lived in the house at the edge of the marshes lonely and isolated where the wind bent the trees and shrubs into gothic shapes and the grasses rustled like whispers the walk to the front door was dark flowers leaning dry seed heads and wilting blossoms over the path rutledge could hear the seeds crunching underfoot out on the marshes a bird called low and forlorn like a desolate soul looking for solace hamish said this is no a place for a woman alone but rutledge thought that it must have appealed to priscilla connaught who carried secrets with her and preferred to use her life as a weapon against a man she hated he knocked loudly on the wooden panels and then pitching his voice to carry he called miss connaught its ian rutledge from scotland yard will you come down please id like to pass on a message a light came on in a window on the first floor and he stepped back so that it would fall on his upturned face a curtain twitched and he could feel her eyes hat in hand he stood there and said again its ian rutledge after a time another lamp was turned up and another tracing her progress through the house the front door opened a crack what do you want there was something in her voice that struck him a resistance as if she was prepared to turn him away he thought for an instant that there was someone else in the house with her and then realized all at once that she was braced against his next words he said warily inspector blevins asked me to come and see that you were safe walsh has escaped and were trying to make certain that hes not still hiding in osterley escaped how when her surprise seemed genuine in the middle of the night weve tracked him east of town but its as well for you to be aware of the danger but you said hed killed the priest she cried how could you let him go we didnt offer him the key miss connaught he escaped rutledge was tired and in no mood to mince words have you seen or heard anything she cut across his words saying quickly i cant stand here in the night airi must go are you all right he asked again would you like me to search the house or the grounds to be sure i dont care what you choose to search where did you say he was last seen this man walsh weve found evidence that he was moving east of osterley toward cley or possibly south in the direction of norwich theres a horse missing from tom randals farm out on the east road inspector blevins would be where is this farm for gods sake she demanded impatiently he told her adding inspector blevins has asked but she was gone the door slamming shut in his face he could hear her behind the door a scream of outrage as if walshs escape had been designed to torment her and then silence he stood for a time on the walk in front of the house he saw the lights turn off and then the twitch of the curtain in what must be her bedroom he turned knowing that she must be watching and walked back to the car winding the crank he found himself debating with hamish what to do in the end he drove off then left his car down the road out of sight in a bank of thick shrubbery on foot now he had barely reached her road when he heard the sound of a motorcar coming from the direction of the marshes there were no lights standing in deep shadow he waited the motorcar was small and there was only a driver to be seen silhouetted against the clouds out to sea a womans profile stiff beneath a cloche hat he watched as she came to the intersection with the main road without hesitation she turned out into it gunning the motor with angry force the tires screeched in the grit of the road and then the car was gone speeding easttoward cley rutledge thought if she finds him before blevins does shell kill him if she can for taking away her vengeance hamish answered aye she drives yon motorcar like a spear but there was little chance of her overtaking walsh shed exhaust herself first and go home still it was his duty to stop her bring her back to osterley and ask mrs barnett to keep an eye on her time was running out and time just now was very precious its a gamble either way hamish agreed if she runs afoul of walsh theres trouble for her and for you if blevins canna stop the strong man and walsh kills again while youre distracted by this woman its on your head it was a gamble rutledge made his choice the most certain outcome of a night of turmoil was losing walsh once the man was safely out of east anglia he had every prospect of staying free he must have laid plans striding through the darkness back to his own car rutledges mind outpaced his feet what would he himself do in the strong mans shoes how would he use this one carefully crafted opportunity hamish answered aye it was well done his escape i canna believe hed leave the rest to chance no walsh had apparently been a friendly and popular showman whatever darker shades of his nature lurked beneath the smiling surface the success of his act had depended on pleasing the public step up ladies and test the strong man for yourselves see heres a bench and all you have to do is seat yourselves at either end dont be afraid youre as safe as a babe in arms i wont drop you wholl wager a bob to see if the strong man can pull this carriage as well as any horse all right lads who among you wants to lift the strong mans iron hammer there must be colleagues he could turn to someone who would offer him temporary shelter money to move onand silence it was by necessity a closed fraternity this showmans world people who traveled from place to place to earn their living put down no roots and counted on the goodwill of their own in place of family many of them had had scrapes with the law and theyd believe walsh when he claimed he was innocent the police were a common enemy a closed fraternity also meant that not even the redoubtable sergeant gibson at the yard had a ghost of a chance to trace him once walsh disappeared into it big as he was he could still vanish the key was to stop him before he reached that safety rutledge bent to turn the crank and then got behind the wheel of his motorcar but if the object of this exercise was to block walshs escape the question became how cutting across country as he was he could be anywhere hamish said what precipitated his escape at a guess he chose tonight because franklin was on dutyyoung enough and naive enough to be gulled innocent or guilty men of walshs ilk dont rely on justice to set them free blevins and his people made no secret of the fact that they were eager to see walsh hang or perhaps he wanted to find out for himself that iris kenneth was alive no man would choose to die by the rope hamish reminded him rutledge turned west it was instinct and not reason that guided him now somewhere before hunstanton on the north coast walsh must pick up the road to kings lynn key to the rest of england inland from the coast road were a hundred hills and meadows that would provide better cover but on the other side of the coin estates like lord sedgwicks and villages like east sherham would block walshs path forcing him slightly north toward the road hamish was swift to remind rutledge that he was counting on unadulterated luck yet rutledge had the strongest feeling that if he drove as far west as the turning for burnham market and then began to follow the tangle of roads that led back to the east from there he might just have that stroke of luck the sky was lighter now he could no longer see his face reflected in the dark windscreen andthank godnever hamishs he scanned the horizons eyes only half on the road a horseman silhouetted against the horizon wouldnt attract much attention but walsh would be no ordinary horseman he was a huge man on a large heavy mount blundering through fields and across plowed land depending on his sense of direction to keep him heading west he risked stirring up sheep and their guardian dogsand eventually someone was bound to see him the marshes on rutledges right were dark expanses of grass and shadow now caught for an instant in his headlamps and then gone a badger ambled along the road picked out by the light and scuttled into the underbrush around a small clump of trees a night bird swooped across his path and eyes followed his passage gleaming for the space of a heartbeat and then vanishing in the grasses this was no place for a man and walsh hadnt been bred to the marshes they would be a barrier he would avoid them another seaside town ghosted into view straggling along the main road rising out of the marshes before turning toward the vanished sea a uniformed constable stood at the turning watchful and alert the message from blevins then had traveled this far west rutledge raised a hand slowing so that the man could see he had no one else in the vehicle except hamish the constable saluted as rutledge passed the early morning was cool but he was grateful for the freshness of it keeping him awake the tires bumped on the uneven surface of the roadbed and clattered over a small bridge buildings loomed and then were gone trees spread heavy branches over the road casting deep shadow from time to time he saw other constables walking the streets or a straggle of men with them cutting across country toward outlying farms poking into hay bales searching outbuildings scanning the ground with torches for tracks ahead was the turning rutledge was watching for a church marked it stark against the sky malevolent and dark and secretive huddled beside the road hamish said yon church is no a comfort in this light small wonder that half the world is superstitious the night changes shapes and conjures specters in the shadows rutledge thought better them than you he could drive past the rest of them secure in the knowledge that they wouldnt follow he headed south now then turned a little east passing through village after village his eyes scanning the fields and peering into the light mist that was rising in the shallow valleys a horseman could pass unseen in its folds he stopped and scanned the white sea later wishing for his field glasses he studied one valley with care but there was only a cluster of thornbushes along a stream in the haze bent like the backs of hiding men from time to time there were other constables stationed at crossroads or climbing through the sheep toward an outbuilding on the side of a hill wending his way from road to road still following his instincts rutledge traveled in a zigzag back in the direction of osterley down this roadturning hereonly to turn back againall the while searching making the connection and deciding as he ran through sleeping villages where that warhoned intuition might carry him next it required patience and a mind focused and determined tiring he stopped once and rubbed his eyes with cold fingers wishing for a pot of tea and twenty minutes of rest his nerves tautly stretched to their limit kept him awake at the same time they drained his reserves of energy and all the while hamish doubted rutledges intuition and his decisions if rutledge was wrongif walsh had gone directly souththen blevinss counterparts would be in need of every man available to widen their own search but were they having any better luck and when full daylight came what were walshs chances then how close would he be to norwich if that was his goal thinking of norwich brought monsignor holston to rutledges mind a priest who searched for shadows outside his window as night drew on and listened to the creaking of his house afraid of something he couldnt identify like sims what would monsignor holston feel if he knew that the man accused of killing father james was on his way to norwich fear or acceptance but there were no horsemen riding out in the dawn in this part of the county save for a farm boy kicking the sides of a horse twice his size as he made his way across a stream by breakfast rutledge had circled back as far as the sherhamsnow all too aware that hed wasted the hours wasted his energy and for what nothing had walsh passed him just over the crest of a hill or behind a screen of trees or lost in the shadows that collected in the mists along small streams bisecting the land a bitter thought and hamish as tired and grim as rutledge was seconded this honest indictment of his abilities you arena the man you once were you havena come to terms with yoursel nor wi scotland and yet rutledge would have sworn if asked that hed been right in his decision to work back from the west another thought struck himhad walsh already been captured no rutledge had seen constables still guarding the roads west and at the junctions running through villages hed seen men searching and walsh would have seen them too as the day brightened he might even go to ground the intuition he prized so highly was failing him rutledge accepted the truth one man alone in a motorcar bound by the roads had no chance to work a miracle when walsh had the flexibility of so much space and today luck was favoring a fleeing man who must be as weary as his pursuers and as determined but with fortuneor fateon his side chapter between the sherhams and osterley rutledges fatigue swept over him like a heavy blanket it was hamish who shouted the warning barely in time to prevent the motorcar from heading straight off the road into a ditch that ran with black water rutledge pulled carefully to the verge and rubbed his face the autumn dawn had broken drawing long golden shadows across the road and among the trees and the flickering of light and dark had mesmerized him before he had even realized it he took out his watch and looked at it most of osterley would be at breakfast now and the searchers straggling in like lost sheep ready to sleep before going out again but it would be useless blevins had been stubborn and wrong walsh wasnt in osterley the man was well away on the road to norwich watching his back and praying that the next dip in the land didnt bring a police blockade into view choosing their spot where the twisting road allowed no escape even for a man on horseback if he had ridden the mare hard as her owner randal had feared he would have made good time if hed handled her with some care she could take him a long way in the morning light hunched on the saddle his head drooping in weariness his profile would be different rutledge put the car into gear again and drove several yards farther where he could stop safely and sleep for tentwentyminutes he thought of trying for osterley and his bed but the exhaustion went too deep hamish was saying something about duty but rutledge didnt hear him wasnt paying any heed he slumped between the door and the seat where his head would be cradled and was already falling heavily into merciful sleep a horn blew loudlyoncetwicea third time rutledge came up out of waves of blackness confused and unable for an instant to remember where he was or why another car was coming up behind him slowing voices shouting at him fighting off the last dregs of sleep he sat up and tried to focus on what they were saying it was blevins who pulled alongside for gods sake wake up man what are you doing out here where have you been ive had half of osterley searching for you rutledge cleared his throat i was driving back to osterley when i nearly ran off the road whats happened have you found walsh a report came in just half an hour ago and i wasted fifteen minutes hunting for you get in and ill tell you on the road constable take the inspectors car will you and follow us the constable got out and started toward rutledges motorcar in an instant of absolute panic rutledge found himself saying no ill follow you he couldnt leave hamish in the rear passenger seat with a stranger driving the car dont be bloodyminded constable do as i say but rutledge was wide awake now well aware that where he himself went hamish would follow yet in that wild halfworld between waking and sleeping he had responded out of habit hamish always occupied the rear seat as blevins took over the wheel rutledge turned his own motorcar over to the grinning constable coming around the boot he noted the bicycle lashed to the back of the motorcar blevins was driving the inspector snapped hurry man and barely waited for rutledge to close his door before the car was off down the road at speed thats jeffers from hurley its a town southeast of the sherhams he was sent to bring me back to where theyve found a body some fool thinks it could be walsh but i cant for the life of me see how he came to be there rutledge felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise body you said thats right a body constable jeffers doesnt have any information the other constable tanner who was out on foot searching the area stopped a woman on her way in to the hurley shops and asked her to send jeffers on to osterley jeffers couldnt find a motorcar and had to bicycle in took the devils own time doing it too and the horse they didnt say anything about a horse thats why im willing to wager this is a wildgoose chase if walsh has already run the mare into the ground he wouldnt be shy about finding himself another mount why would he be on foot because he had started on foot hamishs voice rang through rutledges head they were silent the rest of the way carts were on the road at this early hour and people walking to their fields or leading out the cows small boys on their way to school were trotting behind a pair of squawking geese laughing as the geese darted at first one boy and then another and they dodged the attack blevins shouted at them to mind what they were about and they dropped back sullenly you wouldnt have seen that sort of behavior before the war he told rutledge theres a generation growing up wild mark my words it was a frequent refrain in rural england these days when they reached the outskirts of hurley there was a farmer in boots and brown corduroy trousers standing by the road an old hat was jammed on his head and he wore a heavy green sweater with a ragged hem straggling down one hip inspector blevins he called as the motorcar slowed the doctors been and gone take the road just there to your left before you get into the village proper follow it near half a mile and youll see the farm gate blevins found the road and it soon dwindled into a lane hardly worthy of the name a farmhouse faced a sloping hill of pasturage where the white backs of sheep caught the morning spears of light the lane continued little more than a wagon wide now last summers wildflowers brushing dry heads against the coachwork on either side within a few minutes they came to an open gate where a muddy and wellrutted farm track began here i should think blevins said turning in the track climbed a hill for some distance angling toward the shoulder and a cluster of young trees blevins followed it for some fifty yards and then pulled in where bruised grass indicated that the doctor had stopped as well beyond that the tracks ruts offered a challenge blevins said shortly id not like to find myself bogged down up there rutledge got out and hamish said at his shoulder walsh could ha made it this far it was true they trudged in silence toward the copse of trees and a constable stepped out of it standing there waiting blevins was finding it hard to get his breath and rutledge glanced at him the inspectors face was nearly gray with strain his jaw set and his body tense with each stride he began to swear softly trying to contain the pressure that was building in his mind rutledges longer legs made easy work of the hill but his chest burned from the night of driving the constable hunched against the morning chill touched his hat to blevins and nodded to rutledge constable tanner sir i thought youd want to see this the doctor says hes dead and theyre sending up a cart from the farm to bring him in who the hell is it man blevins halted as if unable to walk another ten yards but it was his fear of the answer that had stopped him its walsh sir just beyond the trees tanner turned to lead the way and rutledge followed blevins moved slowly in their wake as if unwilling to confirm the truth tanner continued his report to rutledge i cant say how long hes been deadjust before dawn id guess or not long after his clothes are damp just beyond the trees the land sloped again this time to the south and about ten feet beyond the crest lay the sprawled body of a man rutledge could see at once that it was walshthe size of the shoulders the length of the awkwardly bent legs defined him before they had reached the head rutledge looked down at the bloody dent in the temple and had no need to squat on his heels and feel the hand nearest him for warmth or touch the throat for a pulse but he did it anyway to give blevins time to recover the hand was cold damp there was no pulse in the equally cold bare flesh beneath walshs collar the giantsized matthew walsh seemed shrunken a bundle of discarded clothes lying here on the wet grass his trousers soggy with dew and rutledge found himself remembering what dr stephenson had said about father james when the power of the personality had gone by that time blevins had stopped just at rutledges back and rutledge could feel his gaze running over the corpse of his prisoner he rose slowly to his feet not turning hamish said he died quickly how do you think it was but rutledge was silent tanner watching blevinss face shifted from one foot to the other waiting for his superior to speak to him and then blevins said harshly anger and grief thickening his voice until it was unrecognizable i wanted to see him hang no one spoke for what seemed minutes then blevins said all right tanner tell me what happened tanner flinched as if hed been accused of murdering the man himself he was young and all elbows and knees but he said with a confidence that belied his years if youll look just over here sir he led them some six feet from the body and pointed down at the iron halfcircle lying in the grass see here theres a shoe and i backtracked the horse some distance he cast it perhaps a quarter of a mile backi found a muddy patch where you could see clearly that the off hind hoof was bare blevins grunted then squatted by the shoe all right go on its my thinking sir that the rider didnt want to do anything about it exposed as he was its fairly open on the hill with the farmers out early hed have been wary of being seen but he brought it along with him and here with the trees to screen him from the farm looked to see what the damage was and if he could continue with this mount or if he needed to find himself another it makes sense blevins said nodding and when he lifted the off hind the horse didnt care for it backed away and when walsh bent to try again kicked him in the head with the shod hoof how do you read that the grass is trampled a bit just below where he fell sir see its bruised and the ground is torn in one place as if he might have been trying to make the horse stand still for him everywhere else you look theres no sign of that blevins went over to look at the grass are you certain the doctor didnt do this or you even tanners face was earnest no sir the doctor came in from the head he said it was a heavy blow caught walsh just right crushing the bone at the temple and killing him outright an inch lower and hed have had a cracked jaw but lived to tell about it an inch higher and hed have suffered a severe concussion he was clearly quoting the doctor the wound itself supports the possibility of it being the shoe he half turned looking around them theres really no other clear explanation yes i suppose thats true blevinss voice was flat he wasnt interested in how walsh had died he felt cheated and was already trying to come to terms with that the doctor says when he has the man in his surgery hell be able to tell if therere any grass bits in the wound but hed be surprised if his first opinion changes tanner finished diffidently he had grown used to the corpse guarding it but the inspector from osterley seemed to be dazed like a grieving relative blevins got heavily to his feet as if hed aged ten years in the last ten hours looking around him at the empty hillsides and the long twist of the lane below smoke rising from the farmhouse where a man in boots was hitching two horses to a long cart he was silent i hadnt counted on it ending like this he said theres no other way it could have happened tanner answered as if blevins had challenged his account if the horse wasnt his it might have taken exception to walshs handling especially if he was angry about the shoe and rough rutledge walked back to the body it made sense he sat on his heels and studied walshs face the expression was one of faint surprise as if he had died even as he saw the blow coming but was the shape of the wound right hamish said its deep the rim of the shoe must ha caught him i canna think what else would have struck such a blow but its tae bluidy to be sure shed have lashed out blindly and put some force behind it catching him before he could leap away behind him he could hear tanner and blevins talking quietly he isnt the first or the last to die this way and he was close to giving us the slip stillif hed stayed on this route with luck id have crossed his path somewhere near east sherham hamish said ye ken horses pulled walshs cart hed have known how to handle the mare he saddled her and got her out of the barn without fuss below the hill the farmer was bringing the cart through the gate to fetch the body rutledge put out his hand and roughly measured the wound without touching it as the suns light began to brighten the clouds he could see a blade of grass in the bloody edge the doctor was herewhat a good half an hour earlier while it was still dark enough to make such small details nearly invisible he got to his feet as blevins came to stand once more at walshs head ive let him down father james the inspector said with a heavy sigh i swore id find out who killed him and i did this was an easy way for the bastard to die rutledges motorcar arrived pulling up at the gate just as the farm cart reached the trees blevins went to meet the farmer calling leave the cart there better to carry him across to it than to muck up the ground ill just lower the tail then the farmer redfaced from years in the wind took out a handkerchief and wiped his glasses doctor says he was kicked by a horse the dead man not one of mine they never left their stalls last night no not yours blevins answered curtly the other constable was climbing toward them now the smooth movements of a countryman in his stride with the farmer holding the horses heads to steady the cart the four men lifted walsh grunting under his weight the body shifted awkwardly in their grip mocking them in death as it had in life they tried to move in step over the uneven ground until one of the constables slipped barely regaining his balance in time to prevent pulling the others down with him it was as if walsh were still struggling to stay free fighting their efforts and they were breathing hard by the time they got him to the wagon heaving the corpse into its bed they misjudged the weight again and the head brushed along the wooden bottom leaving a smear of drying blood blevins swore youll do the doctors work for him if you damage that wound then they stood back as if by unspoken command and stared mutely at walsh it was an unexpected ending to the night the adrenaline that had energized them through the long hours of searching beginning to fade and leaving them with an odd sort of feelingof having lost not won keyed to action there was nothing to do now but go home the dead mans eyes seemed to gaze at the side of the cart as if distracted by the rough pattern the horses stirred uneasily troubled by the smell of blood and sweat and death one stamped its hoof and the harness jingled rutledge thought of the corpses he had seen in france loaded like cords of wood onto wagons stiff in the cold air that did nothing to stop the heavy odor of maggotinfested wounds and rotting flesh from choking the men handling the dead there was no honor in death whatever the poets claimed o a manning the poet who had never seen the western front had said it best the bodies lie like lumber obscene without grace like a house uninhabited and not yet ready for ghosts as the sun reached over the hill behind them rutledge could see the wound more clearly now it reminded him of something and he was too weary to bring it to the fore of his mind something hed seen as a young policeman hamish said what think man but it had escaped him it didnt matter and he was too tired to care at his elbow blevins was saying to rutledge as the farmer raised the tailgate and turned his horses youll be wanting to start back for london i daresay what yes i suppose so rutledge looked back at the trees as the cart began its rumbling descent down the hill the farmer talking to his team as if they were old friends there was no reason to stay easy as you go nell theres no haste lass rutledge turned to blevins and said wheres the mare the mare what mare honey she isnt here theres no sign of her at a guess shes halfway home by now they started down in the wake of the cart rutledge said im surprised walsh hadnt made better time than this id have put him farther west by first light he rubbed his hand along his chin feeling the roughness of his beard against the skin of his fingers in the quiet morning air the clump of their boots on the muddy hillside and the harsh breathing of men and horses was a counterpoint to the creaking of the carts wheels echoing across the valley blevins was still finding it hard to manage what he regarded as failure she cast her shoe and it slowed him what difference does it make he continued impatiently im not in the mood to speculate on the late matthew walshs last hours im cold and tired ive not had my breakfast and hes dead its finished ill write my report and officially close the case and thats the end of it he stared hard at rutledge unless youve got a more likely suspect to hand me from all those questions youve been badgering people with oh yes its my town i hear whats been said right now to tell you the truth i feel like stringing up the bloody corpse a live one would be a hell of a lot more to my liking may trents name came unbidden into rutledges mind chapter the long ordeal wasnt over for rutledge someone had telephoned the osterley hotel and left a message for the man from london a farmers dairyman had come across priscilla connaught in her wrecked car weeping hysterically on a road a little east from where matthew walsh had been found dead rutledge had forgotten hershe had left her house in a rush looking for walsh and he had forgotten her the sleepless night showed in the dark circles under mrs barnetts eyes and in the faded color of her face he couldnt ask more of her instead he said will you go up to miss trents room and ask if shed mind accompanying me when i fetch miss connaught and her car i think it best to have a woman with me mrs barnett raised her eyebrows in surprise but she left last night shortly after you did miss trent i thought you knew she hasnt come back no id locked the outer door you see until a quarter of an hour ago of course id have heard the bell shed have no other way of getting in and ive been awake since the telephone rang never mind then erdo you think i could have a cup of tea before i leave he couldnt worry about may trent now she looked at him must have seen the weariness eating into the bones of his face must you go out again surely miss connaught is better off where she is while theyre still searching blevins has called it off the search walsh was found well thats a great relief isnt it it means were all safe ive just put the kettle on and i think theres some cold bacon and a little cheese if you want me to make up a sandwich please as rutledge climbed the stairs hamish said the womans right sleep for an hourthere isna any need for haste he answered she gave someone my namethe farmer or the dairymanand sent him out to find a telephone i should have stopped her rather than drive half the night on a fools quest in a way whatever has happened is my fault when he opened the door of his room it seemed to open its arms to him welcoming and silent and still dark with the shades drawn but he ignored the temptation of the waiting bed and walked across the carpet to run his fingers again over the bristles of his chin he felt grimy unkempt shaving and a clean shirt would help the face staring back at him from his mirror as he worked up a lather in his mug and applied the brush to his cheeks and throat was gaunt with the dark growth of beard lending it a sinister look hamish reminded him that he could pass more easily as a murderer than the dead walsh rutledge could still see the big hands lying limp without force on the grass and the flaccid muscles that had once given the impression of great power to the strong mans shoulders in his minds eye as he shaved he reexamined the wound an ironya horseshoe spelling the end of the road for an escaping murderer what were the lines hed found so fascinating as a boy something about for want of a shoe a horse was lostfor want of a horse a rider was lostand it went on in that vein until a battle was lost certainly for blevins the battle had been lost ten minutes to shave wash up and change and then rutledge was calling to mrs barnett as he crossed the lobby she was just coming through the kitchen doorway carrying a thermos of tea a basket of sandwiches and two cups she said dont break the cups will you i need them back ill be careful why did miss trent leave orders were for everyone to stay indoors until walsh was caught suddenly anxious mrs barnett asked you did say youd found him didnt you im afraid im beyond thinking just now we found him hes dead it was terse and he hadnt meant for the words to sound that way dead why did miss trent leave he repeated she was rather worried about peter hendersonall that searching people moving aboutand if he didnt know why itd be upsetting i expect peter could take care of himself hes quite at home in the night i mean from the war and all that ive seen him wandering about at all hours justwandering sometimes he stands on the quay and stares up at the hotel not in a threatening way you understand i think the light comforts him somehow i dont know how many times ive asked him to come in out of the rain but he always shook his head and thanked me and walked on i leave him alone now im sure hed hear the search parties long before they saw him or hear walsh blundering through the dark hamish reminded him ye wondered once where he slept at night so he had rutledge thanked her and went out into the brisk wind that had arisen thinking he ought to have brought his coat but he didnt have the energy to go back for it hamish warned him that he was in no shape to drive either and rutledge said curtly i dont have much choice you willna die ill no let you die stillwhat if you kill someone else it was not a pleasant thought he carried with him the directions that mrs barnett had taken down from the man telephoning the hotel on behalf of priscilla connaught the most direct route would have sent him back through hurley where walsh had been found but he chose instead to turn left out of water street and head east then south and west again he found himself wondering if this hadroughlybeen the path walsh had followed too it would explain to some degree why the man hadnt got as far as rutledge had expected and on such an erratic course it would have taken luck a phenomenal amount of luck for priscilla connaught to have caught up with him hamish said it wouldna do any harm to stop and see if the mares at the barn rutledge thought let blevins attend to it but as he neared the cottage he slowed and turned into the drive bumping down the ruts to the barn the instinct that had served him so well in the past had been erratic since the war as if deserting him and then finding him again he tried not to turn his back on it when it stirred and woke a dog barked furiously at him the yellow dog hed seen the night before it ran out of the barn stifflegged its upper lip curled back from teeth that seemed to gleam in the pale light rutledge stopped the motorcar some twenty feet from the barn set the brake and opened his door hamish said something but he ignored it speaking to the animal quietly his voice firm and ordinary rutledge said good doggood dog theres a good dog come here thats it easy my friend no one means you any harm matching his movements to the cadence of his speech he got out to stand beside the car slowly sinking to his haunches here now theres a good dog i wont harm your master is he at home fierce and staccato at first the barking changed to a loud and lengthy statement of duty the black nose rising into the air and the tail no longer rigid but dipping in the middle in another thirty seconds the dog came forward nose outstretched eyes wary the bark more for show than for attack soon rutledge was rubbing the rough head and tweaking the ears as he dug his fingers into the thick fur behind them tongue lolling the dog would have licked rutledges face if he hadnt moved in the nick of time laughing he stood and said all right then show me the barn will you do that hamish said you ken if you tamed him someone else could have walsh yes thats what i wanted to find out he moved casually toward the barn the yellow dog prancing at his heels licking his hand in an invitation to play but rutledge was intent on his own business he paused as he reached the barn door and then stepped inside the dog followed happily and rutledge turned toward the stalls in the dim light of the barn there was only one head raised to stare back at him with eartwitching interest the doors of the empty stalls stood wide randal had not come home and neither had the mare that hed gone to find satisfied rutledge prepared to leave and the dog sensing a lessening of tension brought an old rag to him offering it with a sloppy grin rutledge took it from the wet mouth and tossed it toward a bale of hay that stood beside a harrow the rag hit the back of the harrow and something fell with a clatter dislodged by the pull of the cloth the dog went after his new toy but looked back at rutledge with an air that all but said its out of reachnot fair rutledge crossed to the harrow and leaned forward to retrieve the rag it was entangled with something and he brought both objects up together tossing the balled rag toward the barn door before setting a hammer on the hay the dog raced off and a memory suddenly clicked rutledge stood still he was a young policeman again walking into a house where a shirtless middleaged man was in tears begging him over and over to believe that hed meant no harmno harm but in the kitchen at the back of the house lay the much younger wife a bowl of eggs shattered on the floor around her the shells broken and the whites as slippery as glass from the muddy earth on her boots shed just collected the eggs from the hens in the back garden her temple had been crushed by a carpenters hammer a single blow with the weight of the husbands heavy shoulders behind it the weapon lay on the floor where he had dropped it bright blood on its head he had he said been using it to mend the cellar stairs rutledge couldnt recall now what the pair had quarreled about only that hed felt like picking up the hammer and using it himself on the man hed been young idealistic still unused to murder the man was on his knees by the quiet body of his wife begging her to get up to clean up the mess on the floor to pull down her skirts before the policeman and rutledge had felt the upsurge of a fearsome anger and the woundthe wound was a bloody gouge on the temple not likeand yet somehow very likethe bloody hole in walshs temple why had he associated the two cases because he was tired enough for his mind to play tricks the dog came back with the rag tail waggling asking for another toss but rutledge was lost in the past his eyes turned inward his fingers moving involuntarily over the head of the hammer as he tried to bring back the images in his mind to observe them more clearly what was it that had stirred his memory not the shape of the woundnot the kitchen floor where the broken egg yolks ran into the thicker stickiness of the blood nor the man whimpering at his side he took the wet rag and threw it once more and realized that it had left a smear of saliva across his fingers he looked down at them as hamish said something and was on the point of wiping them on the loose hay when he stopped rutledge stared at the tool in his hand another thought rising among the confused images that exhaustion was fusing like druginduced dreams in hospital into a semblance of reality the mare hadnt been at the scene when the doctor arrivedhe wouldnt have been able to examine her shoe for signs of blood and hair and by the time she was found any useful traces on the shoe would have been worn away a pity it would have been clearer evidence in the chain of events blevins had to sort out indeed someone ought to wait here until the mare was brought in he himself should be on his way to priscilla connaught his mind fragmented by multiple lines of thought rutledge tried to find coherence and the fatigue riding him refused to let him how many hammers were there in osterleyin a twentymile radius of osterley it didnt matter the bodies of the dead often told their own stories of how they died but not always why it was the why that mattered now he realized what hamish had just said to him a needle in a haystack rutledge turned and walked toward the stalls that had held three norfolk grays only last night thinking that the hammer had been in the barrow with its brothers only last night hed seen them there when hed gone through the barn with the farmer hadley and tom randal but he hadnt been searching for hammers only for walsh the luminous brown eyes of the remaining horse met his and as rutledge neared the stall the animal blew softly interested in the mixed smell of dog and motorcar that he carried with him the yellow dog walked patiently at his heels panting and grinning a willing conspirator if rutledge took it into his head to steal this last mount rutledge approached the horse with care concentrating on speaking quietly reassuringly before reaching out to the nose stretched toward him where are your stablemates hmmm and whats keeping your master hamish said something fast and unintelligible there was heaving movement in the shadows at his shoulder hardly visible more a sudden blend of sounds and shapes so startlingly close that there was no defense against it rutledge ducked prepared for a wild attack a second gray horse awakened by a voice next to where shed been dozing head down in her stall swung it high and stretched forward to nuzzle him the mare she was home once his breathing had settled back into the range of speech rutledge stepped into the stall calling her name softly as he ran his hand down her neck and then along her flank before moving toward her hindquarters the mare quivered her coat rippling with the movement of the nerves under it but she stood still he kept one hand on her back and bent to lift the heavy hoof on the near side in the poor light of the barn he couldnt see well enough to examine it turning her head to stare at him she let him work with her without protest he put down that hoof and then moved to lift the other for an instant he thought she was going to kick out and he could see himself caught in the head just as walsh had been his back too near the stalls high side wall to let him escape the blow but she simply moved a step forward as if to give him more room the shoe was missing he put down the heavy hoof keeping his hand gently on the mares rump her coat was rough with the lather of sweat briars and leaves tangled in the thick hair she had been ridden very hard and she was tired he lifted the hoof again she turned her head the great brown eyes watching him but she did not kick she was safe in her own stall now and not likely to object in her present state he let the hoof down and moved around toward the big head clever girl to find your own way home he slapped the neck just below the ears twitching with interest as if wondering what it was he wanted hamish said left to hersel its no a great surprise where was randal had he come back yet there was no sign of the gelding this time rutledge moved on to the last stall to peer inside it stood empty randal was still searching for his lost mare rutledge laid the hammer by the harrow where hed found it and walked out of the barn he could hear ravens calling in the woods and somewhere the sharp whistle of a pheasant priscilla connaught was waiting he had to go it was almost a surprise when he heard hamishs voice saying the woman willna go away stay until yon farmer comes back rutledge thought ill finish what ive begun but in hurley the doctor would be ready to examine walshs body hamish was right he ought to be there too no matter what he did he was off tracklast night this morningand there seemed to be nothing he could do about it besides it was blevinss case the inspector would have to be present he absently fondled the dogs ears walsh was dead whatever hamish thought one had always to remember the living chapter the farmhouse where priscilla connaught had been taken after wrecking her motorcar was set like so many others back from the road down a winding lane that led up a slight rise and then into the farmyard it was muddy the warm smell of manure coming from a cart by the far wall where the milking shed had been cleaned the cows themselves some dozen of them were already plodding steadily out to pasture following a routine so well established in their lives that they needed no human direction a walk of paving stones led across to the house and one branch of it disappeared through a hedge around to the front rutledge left his car by a stack of bricks covered with a tarpaulin and picked his way across the yard to the walk there was a door at this end of it what he assumed to be the kitchen door into the yard it opened before he got there an anxious woman peered out at him she wore her graying hair in a bun at the back of her neck and a heavy sweater over her dark dress inspector rutledge she asked her voice rising mrs danning i met your husband along the main road hes brought the team down to pull miss connaughts motorcar out of the ditch she said disapprovingly i shouldnt wonder hell have his hands full she shouldnt have been driving so fast just there its a miracle she didnt do serious harm to herself it was he thought from her expression more a condemnation of a woman at the wheel of a motorcar than it was of speed priscilla connaught would have little in common with mrs danning they were brought up in very different worlds the farmers wife had workreddened hands and dressed much as her own mother must have done a generation ago youth had deserted her her life given over to chores and cooking and raising children to her priscilla connaught was a citybred peacock suddenly and inexplicably set down in a farmyard holding the door for him she walked ahead down a flagged passage past the dairy room and a larder then opened another door into the warm lamplit kitchen shes just in here mrs danning added over her shoulder and he stepped into the large room his hat in his hand although sparsely furnished there was a good round table handsome chairs the work sink and two oak dressers one of them held jugs and plates cups and bowls the glaze shining in the lamps glow priscilla connaught her hair pinned up haphazardly her coat dirty and torn a long scrape across her cheek from her ear to her nose was sitting hunched in a chair by the coal stove though the room was warm someone had given her a shawl to wrap around her shoulders it was handmade thick and appeared to have been knitted of whatever oddments of wool had been in the basket there was almost a frivolous air about it as if the juxtaposition of blues and grays and a very pretty rose had not been thought out as a pattern a childs first efforts perhaps for the stitches were sometimes too tight he said miss connaught she looked up her face streaked with tears and blood from the scrape the misery in her eyes shocked him thank you for coming she said i didnt know who else to ask these people have been very kindbut id like very much to go home now he crossed the room to pull out a chair from the table to set it next to hers are you hurt hurt she stared at him as if the word was foreign to her i dont think i am hed seen the car in the ditch shed have taken some punishment rutledge reached out and gently lifted the hair from her face his intent had been to make her more comfortable but she flinched as he touched it and he saw that there was a bloody cut at the very edge of her forehead turning to mrs danning rutledge said could you bring me a wet cloth please she went to the sink and pumped up water into a small bowl itll be cold shall i set it on the stove for a spell no that will do she brought him the bowl and a clean towel from a drawer rutledge got to his feet dipped the towel into the bowl and moving the hair aside began to clean blood from the wound priscilla connaughts breath caught at the coldness of the water her eyes fluttering but she held her head still like a good child and let him work mrs danning standing just behind him was saying my dear lord i never saw that and she didnt say anything it was deep and the blood welled up in spite of his efforts to stem the flow rutledge said i dont mean to hurt you and then he added to distract her how did you come by this i dont know she said faintly i dont remember anything except wanting to die lying there in the ditch wanting to die she began to cry silently at first moving her face away from his fingers and then the sobs shook her body and she hunched away from his ministrations into herself mrs danning took the bowl from his hands her voice was troubled as she said she was this way when michael brought her in hes the dairyman hed gone out with the milk cans and the dogs found her firstdark as it still was the motorcar was that hard to see in the ditch he discovered she was alive and ran back for my husband to help get her out of the vehicleher door was jammed they said and she couldnt walk they thought shed broke her ankle or worse rutledge looked down one ankle appeared to be swollen the stocking sagging around it torn and filthy a strap on the shoe was torn as well could you make us some tea rutledge asked to keep mrs danning occupied i think it might help i could use a cup myself it wont take a minute the kettles still hot as she busied herself with the tea preparations rutledge sat down again and reached out to put his hand on priscilla connaughts shoulder youre safe he told her its all right now come look at me he took out his handkerchief and pressed it into her hands but she just clenched her fingers around it like a lifeline and couldnt seem to stop the wrenching sobs that enveloped her if shed been a man if she hadnt had the head wound he would have slapped her lightly to snap her out of the hysteria instead he said harshly thats enough she took two or three gulping breaths startled into obeying her eyes lifting in surprise to his face rutledge took the handkerchief from her fingers and began to press it against her wet cheeks as if the words bottled inside had finally been unstopped she said shakily i tried to kill him i saw him there in the dark bent over in his saddle and i wanted to kill him i drove into the hedge insteadbecause i couldnt bear to hit the horse he waited letting her talk i shrieked at him blowing the horn screaming heading straight at him and the horse threw him then and i drove directly over him i wanted him dead and then i wanted to kill myself i tried to point the bonnet at a tree but the wheels slipped in the grass and i missed it and went into the ditch instead and was terrified that i wouldnt dieand it went black and i she started to cry again im still alive her eyes were on his begging i wanted it to be swift painless over within an instant beyond the table he saw mrs danning standing with the teapot in one hand the lid in another staring at her unexpected guest horror on her face she clearly hadnt heard this part of the story she knew only that there had been an accident is there someone dead michael didnt say anything about that rutledge his mind working swiftly through what priscilla connaught had said heard hamish ask it couldna be walsh she ran down how do you know hes dead miss connaught did you see him after you hit him hamish said therell have to be a search priscilla connaught frowned i drove straight over him he must be dead she brushed her hair back again and looked at the blood on her fingers is that his blood she asked confused she took the handkerchief from him and scrubbed the spot i dont know i canti cant remember any more except that its finished thats all finished she made a faint gesture and after a moment added as if bewildered its easier said than done trying to kill yourself she stared at him as if this was a new discovery something she hadnt foreseen she began to weep again mrs danning set down the pot lifted the teakettle from the black stove and poured in steaming water itll only take a bit to steep she said how do you kill yourself priscilla connaught asked weakly through her tears i thought of slashing my wrists but i didnt have anything sharponly the tools in the boot and they wouldnt do the job i wish i was dead hamish said she needs a doctors care she canna be trusted it was true rutledge took a deep breath and said this isnt the place to talk of dying or the time you mustnt upset mrs danning priscilla connaught looked up at the sturdy farmers wife im sorry she said and then repeated it but he thought the apology was more a response to his tone of voice than to his words rutledge coaxed a cup of sugared tea into priscilla connaught which warmed her but failed to make any headway in bringing her out of her depression and exhaustion instead she lapsed into a silence that seemed almost a blankness setting aside his own tea he said let me drive you back to osterley my cars just outside well fetch yours when youve rested the dannings will see to it meanwhile it will be safe enough here with visible effort priscilla connaught roused herself from her silent misery yes i cant stay here ive caused these kind people enough distress already but i dont know that i can walk my foot still hurts ill help you then her eyes were redrimmed and dark with pain i just want to go home will you take me home please yes if thats what you want it would probably be best to summon the doctor to her rather than bring her into a reception room full of staring people with the help of mrs danning at the doors rutledge managed to halfcarry miss connaught out of the house and set her in his motorcar mrs danning provided a pillow for her injured foot and stepped back as if glad to wash her hands of her troublesome guest he went back to the house with mrs danning promising to see that both the shawl and the pillow were returned and making arrangements for the car to be retrieved later the farmers wife began to collect the cups and spoons from her kitchen table her face creased with worry who is it thats dead i couldnt make head nor tail of her story should we ought to summon the police she wouldnt hear of a doctor for herself and we didnt know about anyone else being in the car rutledge said im not certain exactly what happened dr stephenson will give her something to make her rest then well be able to sort it out he was on the point of saying more but mrs dannings face cleared and she nodded ive heard hes a good man hell see her right then she added when my husband pulled her out of that car she begged him to look for a horse she thought shed struck it but there was no horse nor any other injured party he searched for near on to a quarter of an hour to satisfy her and never saw any sign of a horse a norfolk gray mare was stolen from a stable outside of osterley last night if you should find her please send word to me as soon as possible but hed already seen the mare and she showed no sign of injury rutledge turned the crank and climbed into his seat priscilla connaught pulled the gaudy shawl closer as he circled the yard and began the long rough descent down the drive to the main road im sorry he said glancing at her ill make the journey as comfortable as i can it doesnt matter she answered tonelessly shrugging deeper into the folds of the shawl her chin invisible they rode in silence for a very long time she hardly noticed when they passed her car and the farmer with his team though rutledge waved to him and then she seemed to throw off some of the lethargy that wrapped her in bleak despair as if the tea had finally helped he thought she might be recovering a little of her usual strength and was encouraged when she turned to stare at him he offered her a brief smile she didnt appear to see it you were in the war she said fiercely tell me how to die he thought of all the men hed watched die and tried to shake off the dark cloud that settled over his spirits theres no easy way he said bitterly trust me i know when they had reached the marshes turning toward osterley rutledge said in a neutral tone as if discussing the weather what happened to the horse she turned to look at him what horse she asked frowning i dont remember a horse dr stephenson came at once in answer to rutledges summons and listened with concern as the inspector explained what had happened to priscilla connaught then the doctor took the stairs up to her bedroom where she lay with the shades down her face turned to the wall when he came down half an hour later drying his hands on a pale yellow towel embroidered with white violets he walked into the sunbright parlor and took the chair by the window the room was pretty with walls of a very soft cream accented by the deep blues of the upholstery and carpets and a pale climbing rose entwined in the matching drapes a womans room and yet empty of the small treasures that usually adorned such an ornate mantelpiece or filled the polished tabletops in a way it seemed to reflect priscilla connaughts empty life she had over the years collected nothing but misery thats a nasty cut on her head it could be seriousid not be surprised if theres some concussion bruises stephenson told rutledge and a good many more will likely show up shes already sporting deep bruising on the shoulder and hip but nothing appears to be broken the ankle has been sprained and ive taped that to reduce the swelling the head injury serious enough to confuse her memory i cant say the woman is suffering from more than the effects of the car running into the ditchagitation and emotional collapse to head the list the sedative ive administered will keep her quiet for some hours and well see whether shes calmer then he paused the right eye is turning black now she wont want to look into her mirror for awhile and i took a stitch or two in another cut on her scalp bit of glass lifted a flap of skin and hair i daresay shell have a headache for a day or so ill find someone to sit with her ellen baker should do shes gentle and has a way with her highstrung women like miss connaught arent always the best of patients rutledge said you may want to make another choice she was looking for ways to kill herself she ran into that ditch on purpose from what i could learn and she believes shes killed a man stephensons eyebrows rose does she now i could tell shed been weeping i didnt know the rest of it and she didnt volunteer anything why does she want to kill herself because of this man walsh doesnt make any sense didnt realize she even knew him rutledge felt the fatigue burrowing deep into his very bones it has nothing to do with walsh not directly but theres a strong sense of guilt real or fancied i dont know i think she ought to bewatched in that case ill send for mrs nutley shes had seven sons all of whom have battled their way through life and shes nursed everything from broken bones to depression to drunken stupors shell manage well enough he crossed the room to stand at the window looking out at the marshes itll rain before dinner he turned back to rutledge theres a narrow line between love and hate sometimes you know and it can be crossed unwittingly i cant tell you whats behind it shesa very private person and he wasnt prepared to break her confidences not yet that isnt much help id need to know what signs to look for rutledge rubbed his face with his hands all i can tell you is that she went out last nightwas it only last nightto look for walsh she wasone of father jamess flock and afraid the man would escape justice and somewhere between that time and dawn this morning she believes she killed someone and she tried to kill herself went out on her own i cant see blevins allowing that rutledge was too close to exhaustion to fight a battle of wits with this very sharp man he didnt know ask him yourself if you like whatever secrets priscilla connaught possessed if the good doctor hadnt stumbled over them in ten or twelve years it was a salute to her deep and abiding need for privacy but dr stephensons curiosity was quite frankly aroused then what did she say when you walked into the farmhouse that someone was dead and shed tried to miss the horse but later on she was confused about the horse whether it was there at all it was a bald account rutledge left it at that dr stephenson grunted well the accident itself could have caused confusion between what she intended to do and what she did do he took out his watch and looked at it sighing ive a long day ahead of me ive had two men brought in with broken bones and a woman hysterical enough to deliver prematurely and that doesnt count the scrapes and cuts and sprains from people wandering around in the dark most of the night ill send my nurse to find mrs nutley and see that miss connaught is cared for if youll wait here for half an hour how long do you think it will be before her mind is clear hard to say stephenson replied considering wait until tomorrow before questioning her again she may be making more sense by then when he was gone rutledge looked in on priscilla connaught and then sat in a chair in the room across the passage from hers he intended to watch instead he fell heavily asleep when mrs nutley arrived letting herself in quietly he forced himself back to wakefulness but it was hardly more than that she clicked her tongue when she saw him a motherly woman with a strong face and an awesome air of competence she said if you know whats best for you youll get yourself in that spare bed over there and go back to sleep but there was still too much to be done blevins was working in his office when rutledge walked through his door he looked up with a sour expression and said i thought youd be asleep by now i wish to god i was if i look as weary as you do were both a fine pair of sleepwalkers matched set blevins leaned back in his chair the doctor in hurley tells me walsh was probably kicked by the horse and died where he stood the loose shoe fits rather roughly into the wound in his skull even though it wasnt the one that did the damage the doctors not sure what the angle was of course when the kick was delivered what matters was a luck of the strike delivered just exactly at the wrong place for any chance of survival death by misadventure rutledge said easily any sign of other injuries a fallrunning into something in the dark blevins laughed you dont give up do you london told me that when i asked for you all right just for the hell of it why should there be the searchers seemed to have had a rough night of it rutledge answered taking the other chair and sitting down he hadnt had breakfast he remembered only the sandwiches that mrs barnett had put up for him when hed gone to find priscilla connaught does walsh have any family have you notified anyone that hes dead theres the scissor sharpener i doubt hed walk to the corner to help walsh now that hes dead whats in it for him with no real proof that he was the lookout while walsh riffled the study hes home free theres iris kenneth she might know if walsh had any family yes well do you want the task of going to london to fetch her shes not likely to come north on her own i suppose youre right still if youre on your way there blevins said watching rutledges face you might do me the courtesy of calling on her yourself after a moment rutledge made a last effort to break through the emotional barriers that inspector blevins had set up put aside your personal feelings about walshand about the death of father james if youd walked into the study of a stranger that morning how would you have described the body lying by the window the same way an intruder had struck hard and fast out of fear of being recognized matthew walsh wont be giving us the answer to why he did itbut i dont suppose in the scheme of things it makes much difference he ran thats guilt rutledge said quietly thinking it through the killer walsh if you likedidnt strike once looking to buy time for an escape he meant to kill yes it was deliberate makes me sick to think about it on the other hand if there hadnt been any money in the tin box in the deskif it had been spent or given away by that timehow would you have decided on the motive for murder blevins said impatiently the same way no you couldnt have looked at it the same way there was no money in the desk nothing to draw a thief to the study nothing for walsh or anyone like him to slip into the rectory to steal youre setting up a scene that didnt exist walsh couldnt know that could he see it my way for once walsh was desperatethis was his last hope of finding the sum he needed to finish paying for that bloody cart he may have killed in a fury when he discovered the box was empty if this had happened before the bazaar rutledge began all right lets take your position and examine it a dead man and no tin box would tell me there was another reason a personal reason to kill that priest but i knew father james too welland in all your questioning you still havent answered that one either blevins tired as he was couldnt make the leap of imagination hamish said you canna expect it from him he was too close to the victim rutledge took a deep breath thinking hamish is right if father james knew something that worried him possibly involving a police matterwould he come to you with it of course he would id be the first person hed turn to blevins answered with a lift of pride but he hadntand for the same reason father james too had known the inspectors limitations as a man and as a policeman rutledge said i hear theres a chance that monsignor holston will replace father james until a suitable choice can be made im driving to norwich later shall i tell him that walsh has died suit yourself i expect half the county has heard that by now whats taking you to norwich rutledge smiled a personal matter by the way wholl be given the reward that lord sedgwick put up not the police blevins said wryly and lord sedgwick ought to make that decision himself i expect he will rutledge rose from his chair have you by any chance seen miss trent id like to speak to her before i leave for norwich she went out last night found herself badly frightened in the woods north of the church and spent what was left of it at the vicarage i stopped there to tell the vicar that walsh had been found he thought she was still asleep what frightened her god knows an owl probably or a badger women have no business out in the middle of the night on their own youve heard im sure that priscilla connaught was out looking for walsh ran her car into a ditch and was lucky to survive with only a concussion yes well rather proves my point doesnt it rutledge reached across the desk to shake blevinss hand if youd like a last piece of advice id wire iris kenneth if i were you save the ratepayers from burying walsh in a paupers grave i might at that he thought about it yes i will rutledge left glad to step out into the sunshine it had a grayness to it now that forecast rain later as the doctor had suggested after the early morning it had never been a clear day but even in this light the marshes seemed rich with color and the wind moved through the grasses like a wraith the walk from the police station to the vicarage seemed to stretch before rutledge like the great wall of china miles upon miles to travel on foot his body rebelled at the thought hamish ridiculed him for his weakness ignoring his tormentor he went back to the hotel and started the car chapter mr sims opened the vicarage door warily peering out at rutledge shrouded in the heavy shadows cast by the trees along the drive what brings you here half the town is sound asleep after the long night i understand walsh has been found and is dead yes thats true on both counts rutledge said it pleasantly i came to ask if miss trent is awake sims said i expect shes still asleep but if you care to leave her a message would you mind looking in on her its rather urgent his voice was still quite pleasant but the edge of command had crept into its timbre sims was on the point of arguing when a door opened at the top of the stairs may trent stood there above them in a dressing gown far too large for her her hair unbound and hanging in a dark stream down her back she didnt look as if shed been asleep the smudges under her eyes were as deep as rutledges own im awake vicar she said and then to rutledge but hardly dressed to receive callers a policeman isnt ranked as a caller miss trent i understand you were frightened last night what did you see or think you heard in the woods that brought you here in some haste were trying to track walshs movements how did you know she began and then realized that hed tricked her yes all right she said after a moment if youll give me a little time to dress he agreed and the vicar led him into the kitchen at the back of the house the curtains were still drawn a dresser taller than he was stood against one wall dishes were piled in a pan of soapy water on a small table by the windows and the remnants of breakfast were still on the stovetoast and sausages with fried eggs a jar of marmalade and a dish of butter sat on the main table next to three used teacups i was making fresh tea sims told rutledge nodding to the kettle on the stove my guess is that you could use a cup ive drunk my share this night remembering what hamish had said earlier that morning as hed finished mrs barnetts provisions rutledge asked with a little whiskey if youve got it yes indeed sims answered opening a cupboard and taking out a fresh cup ill just go and fetch it first id like to hear how miss trent arrived last night nothing much to tell sims peered into the sugar bowl i heard a knocking at the door and i called down from a window to see who it was miss trent said shed got separated from her search party and was uncomfortable about walking back to the hotel on her own i let her in telling her id just dress and then see to it that she got back to the hotel but she asked for tea to warm her and by the time id made it she was sound asleep in her chair i left her there with a blanket over her and sent her upstairs around six when she woke up disoriented and still half asleep it was told smoothly with enough detail to give it the air of truth but even hamish growled his disapproval yes thats a fine tale for the gossips of osterley rutledge replied taking the cup that sims poured him its the truth there was outrage in the vicars voice yes im sure it is but may trent doesnt strike me as the sort of woman easily frightened by noises in the woods if she was out with a search party and she came down that dark drive of yours when it would have been far wiser to hurry down the hill to the comparative safety of water street he paused after all walsh had been here just hours before as far as she knew he might still be hidden in the grounds waiting until the hue and cry faded no one thought to search the church tower did they or all the rooms of the vicarage hamish said its no an impossibility youd have got her out of here fast as you could if youd had any sense rutledge said but what she came to tell you made you both decide to stay here sims murmured ill just find the whiskey but before he could move the kitchen door opened and may trent came in you said it was urgent she wore her clothes wrinkled from sleeping in the chair like a badge of honor her eyes strayed to the teapot sims was already searching for another clean cup she sat accepted the tea he poured for her added sugar and sipped it as if it was warming her her fingers around the bowl of the cup they were rutledge thought sourly as companionable as a longmarried pair while he had only a matter of hours to finish what hed set out to do get your coats if you will were driving to norwich in five minutes may trent regarded him suspiciously im exhausted im not going to norwich or anywhere elseonly to bed and quite frankly so should you inspector you dont look as if youre rested enough to undertake youd have done it for father james what has this drive to norwich to do with father james she demanded i think he began by trying to solve a problem and found himself pitched headlong into something far more horrifying than he was trained to deal with he did what he could the man who may have killed him is dead nowthere wont be a trial no clear judgment of his guilt or for that matter his innocence blevins is satisfied that the case is closed but im left with an uneasy feeling that it isnt its convenient to blame matthew walsh and shut our eyes but i should think someone owes it to father james to get to the bottom of what troubled him im willing to try but i cant do it alone both sims and may trent were silent absorbing what hed said she was the first to recover then let that someone drive to norwich with you but something made her look away from him walsh is dead sims put in i cant believe that walsh would have tried to escape if he was innocent if the facts once theyre collected would exonerate him why not wait to be cleared because he was a poor man and terrified that justice wouldnt care if he went to the hangman which reminds meif youre convinced of his guilt tell me why the two of you spent the night in this empty barn of a house and wouldnt leave it or go for help may trent stared down at her cup im a silly woman the vicar asked me again and again if id walk with him as far as the hotel but i couldnt go back outside and feel safe you said yourselfa murderer was on the loose i think he was rutledge replied slowly but perhaps it wasnt walsh she spilled tea into the saucer and clicked her tongue in annoyance i wish you would tell us whats wrong what it is you want from us sims took the saucer from her poured out the spilled tea and wiped it with a serviette he said i have work to do here i cant abandon my parish on a whim miss trent is justified in asking what it is you want rutledge said quietly im a policeman have you forgotten i dont have to ask i can require you to accompany me now if youve finished your tea well be on our way listening to hamish battering at the back of his mind rutledge made one detour on his way to the road south he pulled once more into the rutted drive by randals farm but the gelding and the farmer had not come home rutledge was beginning to feel uneasy the motorcar was silent as they drove south rutledge uncomfortable because the vicar was sitting in hamishs usual place was not the best of companions and may trent kept her face turned away from him looking out the window hamish on the other hand was conducting a long and skeptical conversation with rutledge it isna the best way go to london and speak to yon chief superintendent tell him what it is you suspect let him reopen the inquiry bowles wont be any more receptive than blevins was and the case will be closed i have at best twentyfour hours to solve he mystery that surrounded father jamess last days but it was there rutledge paused and theres a secret binding these people together each seems to know only a part of it what i dont understandyetis whether the mystery and the secret are one and the same im willing to bet my career that they are aye it could be so but the days of the rack are over you canna force them to tell you or be certain in the end youve got the truth rutledge concentrated on the road for a time and then picked up the thread of his silent conversation with hamish if nothing else it kept him awake but it failed to satisfy either one of the participants hamishs last salvo was telling they willna like it in london no but were a long way from london rutledge shut out the voice in his aching head and tried to concentrate on the busy road south it was close to teatime when rutledge pulled the motorcar into a small space between a cart full of cabbages and the deep hole that still reeked like a cesspool he got out stretched aching shoulders and went around the boot to open the door for may trent but the vicar was already there before him saying why didnt you tell us that it was monsignor holston you were coming to see his voice was cross there was no need to be so damned mysterious he and may trent stood waiting by the road while rutledge went to knock on the door of the rectory bryony opened it beamed at rutledge and asked after greeting him will you be staying for tea ive got such a lovely bit of french cake for himself and she broke off as she saw the two people behind him looking up at her from the street ah thisll be business then i still wouldnt say no to tea rutledge assured her smiling on their way south by mutual agreement the three travelers had agreed not to stop for lunch may trent closed her eyes as if shutting out the watery sun that had been threatening rain for two hours or more bryony saw it and called to her come inside madam and let me take you upstairs for a bit you look like you could do with a rest she only smiled and shook her head no but thank you they were ushered into the study where monsignor holston looked up from his book in surprise i didnt remember visitors were expected he said to bryony setting the cat bruce on the floor the inspector has come again monsignor and brought guests with him she quietly closed the door as he greeted rutledge warmly then he smiled at the vicar and shook his hand before the introduction to miss trent was made their host seated her with courtesy and said father james spoke to me a number of times about the manuscript youre completing its quite an undertaking if i may be of any assistance you need only ask norfolk has a good deal of material to draw from as ive discovered she thanked him managing to smile memorials even so are often an excuse to go on mourning he tried to tell me that as well i expect time will take care of that too rutledge said were here about father james as it happens walsh is dead hediedlast night trying to escape killed holston asked by the police he was kicked by a horse at least thats what the evidence suggests therell be an official inquiry as a matter of course god rest his soul sims said altogether it was a harrowing night for everyone walsh appeared to have the best motive rutledge said there was a certain amount of evidence against him but not all of it was conclusiveor satisfactory on the other hand ive been exploring father jamess movements during the fortnight between the bazaar and his death his eyes turned toward holston and i need to learn from you monsignor what father james told you about the confession of herbert baker completely unprepared for the question holston said i couldnt even if i im not asking for a revelation of herbert bakers last words what i want to know is what father james told you about this man he never spoke to me about baker or his family im sure thats true but he came here one day shortly before he died and told you that he had just been given information that had upset him and that the person who had passed on this information had had no idea of its importance to father james personally it was an arrow shot into the air but the sudden tightness of monsignor holstons face told rutledge that it had come very close to its mark no it wasnt that did he also tell you that he was helpless to do anything about it rutledge kept his voice at a conversational level as if he was continuing to confirm knowledge he already possessed there was nothing he could monsignor holston stopped then he said look he didnt confide in me or confess to me he didnt tell me the circumstances but i could see hed come for comfortfrom a friend not a fellow priest how could you see that he walked in that door and paced the floor for over an hour i didnt ask him whyweve all been through that kind of personal despair to tell you the truth there was one family in particular that he was deeply concerned about i thought his visit had to do with them when he sat down in that chair where youre sitting now i made some comment to that effect he raised his head and looked at me no theyre doing well enough just now then he added simply god works in mysterious ways ive been given an answer to a question that has troubled me for years but i cant make use of it to set things right it came unexpectedly and in such a way that my choices are very limited he put his face in his hands and i could see that he was under a great strain i asked would it help to speak to the bishop and he said that door is shut but there may be another that will open and so i went back to the report i was writing to give him a little space half an hour later he was gone and that was the end of it but you guesseddid you notwhat he was referring to not then rutledge waited monsignor holston said it wasnt until the funeral mass for father james that i first heard the name baker during the service rutledge was surprised actually a young woman came up to me afterward to say that she didnt know father james well but that she had attended the mass from a sense of duty hed given her father comfort as he lay dying even though herbert baker wasnt a catholic she felt she was returning a kindness in her own fashion she was quite shy stammering out the story but i thanked her for coming and told her that father james would have appreciated her thoughtfulness and it was true later on i asked sims here about her dr stephenson overheard and added that father james had come in to the surgery to inquire about bakerwhether his mind was clear at the end his point was that father james had been a conscientious priest but i read more into the conversation than stephenson realized because i knew the one other bit of information that mattered that herbert baker had been coachmanand sometimes chauffeurto lord sedgwicks family rutledge said everyone in osterley could have told you that if youd asked no that it was herbert baker who drove virginia sedgwick to kings lynn the day she disappeared at her particular request the vicar listening apprehensively sat back with a sigh but monsignor holston had no more to say rutledge turned to may trent she had kept her composure a woman with hidden strengths learned from her personal suffering he chose a different course with her the other door father james mentionedit was you he wanted to know if mrs sedgwick had been on board ship if youd actually seen her spoken with her if you had then he no longer had to rely on bakers confession whatever it was to fill in the details of mrs sedgwicks disappearance no it wasnt like that he was trying to help me to stop the nightmares he said her voice was odd a tremor behind it she seemed on the point of adding more but stopped and when you refused to remember the priest went to his solicitor and added a codicil to his will father james left you a photograph of virginia sedgwickthere was a sharp intake of breath from the listening vicarbut not the cuttings that hed collected so painstakingly he wanted only your own memories and he wished you the courage to write down what had happenedto you and to her why would he have believed so strongly that youof all the survivorshad met her on shipboard i didnt refuse to remember as you put it and he didnt believe any such thing she was flushed her chin high and her eyes bright i cant understand why you keep harping on it he just felt that the nightmares would stop if i could face them once and for all and i couldnt i wasnt ready he never forced me to go back to that nighthe was careful we tried to discuss less frightening experiences who had the cabins next to mine the people i sat with at meals what i wore the first evening outand i couldnt even remember that hamish scolded the lass is tired let it go rutledge heard him he said to may trent trying to make amends im not hounding you you are she said angrily youre worse than father james ever was you dont know what it is like to be haunted youve never sat up screaming in bed in the middle of the night hearing the dying cry out for help and knowing that you will live and they wont exhausted as he himself was the strength of her emotions touched him on the raw his own anger flared with unwitting heat dont i i live it with every breath i take hamishs voice was sharp you mustna betray yoursel rutledges iron will shut off the flow of words even as he heard the warning his face had grown so white and so strained that may trent reached out a hand to him as if to stop him too and then she dropped it they stared at each other in horrified silence rutledge thought ive never come so close hamish was still yelling at him dinning in his head like the german guns until he could barely function yere vulnerable because shes the first woman whos been through the same horror but rutledge didnt care how far had she seen inside his own grief as far as hed seen into the depths of hers he didnt know it was not something he wanted to think about it didnt bear thinking about sims and father holston watching the two of them immobilized by the sudden silence after the fierce intensity of their exchange were unwilling witnesses and into the electrical atmosphere that no one knew quite how to cope with the door opened and the housekeeper bryony wheeled in the ornate walnut cart with the heavy victorian tea service gleaming in the lamplight chapter the vicar got to his feet monsignor holston if youll have your housekeeper summon a cab for us ill see miss trent safely on the next train monsignor holston rising as well cut across his words i expect that inspector rutledge can explain but it was may trent who collected herself with an effort and said no we need to finish this she turned to bryony and thanked her for the tea adding ill pour as the housekeeper left she busied herself with the cups her head turned away from the men in the room but her hands were shaking and her eyes were haunted in her drawn face rutledge his own face still as pale as his shirt stood where he was lost in the emotional storm that had swept him hamish his voice harsh was saying you canna be so foolish miss trent handed a cup to the vicar who awkwardly looked around for a table to set it on his eyes avoiding rutledges monsignor holston took his and sat down again behind the desk rearranging papers lying on the blotter as if giving everyone a little time to recover she brought a cup to rutledge and said drink it now while its hot and sweet he accepted the tea like a man sleepwalking and seemed not to know what to do with it after a moment he drank it hot as it was and seemed to draw strength from it may trent set aside her own cup and silently passed the slices of cake and the thin sandwichesegg and ham and cheeseeach a small white triangle of bread that seemed likely to choke them all it was ritualand in ritual lay some normalcy each of the uncomfortable occupants in the quiet room accepted his role in this charade and in the end the tension in the air began to subside a little monsignor holston bit into an egg sandwich and swallowed it in a gulp bruce the cat who had slipped into the room with the housekeeper came out from under the desk and stared impassively at the ham sandwich between simss fingers and the vicar seemed to consider offering it to the animal he couldnt think why hed accepted one in the first place except out of politeness his stomach was a twisted knot of despair he didnt want to hear any more hed had enough miss trent drank her tea in silence and then said i cant tell you whether or not virginia sedgwick was on the ship i remember sailing i vaguely recall dressing for the evening although i cant tell you what i chose to wear i remember going to dinner and faces and people speaking to me a hodgepodge of images unconnected in any way with me personally its as if i dont want to remember who lived andand who died it is such a terrible thing to drown i nearly didsomeone hauled me into a boat like a bundle of wet rags and i was coughing and sick and so frightened i couldnt speak there were others in the water she gulped for air as if drowning again and said quickly no i wont go back there she stopped and looked at the hearth as if to find something new to pin her attention on after a moment she continued her voice uncertain father james had worked with the wounded during the war he told me that talking might help stop the pain and the dreams but id buried it for so many long difficult years id reached a plateau of sorts where i was someone else people no longer remembered that id been on titanic when the war came i was planning to be married and looking ahead to a future that would be happier than the past but it wasi never told roger about what had happened to me i thought that if he didnt know id not see the reminder of my pain in his eyes and be forced to look back someone else told him a friend who believed that roger would want to know the truth and be better able to comfort me when the dreams wereworse than usual thats why im finishing his work i had already decided to break the engagement once he was safely home but he never came home and i carry that guilt too she looked from one to the other of the three men i didnt know father james had his own nightmare i wasnt much help to him im afraid there was a faint quality of the child in her voice begging forgiveness i didnt understand how great his need was rutledge sat down heavily trying to bring himself back to the task at hand he wished that the vicar and may trent had taken the train and he could drive back to osterleyor anywhereall alone except for hamish who never left him alone the vicar said into the silence picking his words virginia sedgwick was a woman hungry for affection i watched heri was invited to several of the parties at sedgwick hall after she married arthur she believed her husband loved her she most certainly loved him but he was mad for racing he lived in a world of fast machines and dangerous sport as far as i could tell he was oblivious to her dislike of living alone out in the middle of yorkshire where she had few neighbors and fewer friends he expected her to find pleasure in running the house as his mother had doneshe was a wellknown hostess and quite clever at smoothing over her husbands connections with trade it never worked their marriage when i heard virginia had left him and gone back to america i was glad it was over i couldnt bear to watch her suffer rutledge grateful for the change in subject asked you spoke of friends were there any close friends she confided in no as if to soften the harsh negative sims added she found it hard to find common ground with women of her own class and was too friendly with the servants they took advantage of her thats why she came to the vicarage to talk with me using whatever flimsy excuse she could think of father james and i were safe you see clergymen not likely to take advantage in any sense intrigued rutledge asked what did she talk about the flowers the music she liked music services for the family were usually held at the church on the grounds of the estate she preferred holy trinity because it was so beautiful shed spend hours sitting in the nave polishing the benches or mending the cushions i found her one day on a ladder cleaning out the cobwebs around the stainedglass windows impeccably dressed her gloves filthy he stopped they closed the house in east sherham when sedgwick went to london and she was sent back to yorkshire then monsignor holston said father james met her in london just after shed come to england they served on some committee or other together he said she was the happiest woman hed ever seen and he was the man she turned to when the marriage soured she was a woman of strong faith and he tried to bolster that thats one reason he wasnt prepared to believe that she could turn her back on her husband and leave england he always defended her and its my feeling that he always hoped she might try to get in touch with him the vicar said unexpectedly i thought it was better for her just to go father james and i quarreled over that he wanted to find her and i told him id have no part in it hamish said aye its the difference in age between the two men both wanted to play knight but no in the same fashion rutledge silently agreed it was that male vulnerability to their own protective instincts to save the damsel from the dragonthe dragon in this case arthur sedgwicks seeming indifference to his beautiful young wifeand somehow make her life better priest or layman it didnt matter each man had responded to virginia sedgwick monsignor holston pushed his plate away theres a more practical side you know its my understanding that she had a considerable inheritance from a grandmother who had heavily invested in railroads among other things what was the disposition of that if she died orif she just disappeared and another questionwhy didnt her family in america raise a hue and cry when she went missing no one could foresee that her ship would sink the vicar said father james told me in late that she wasnt listed among the passengers monsignor holston replied that is not until after the inquiry sedgwick hired someone to look into the matter for him and he finally found her name this would explain why father james was so interested in what miss trent could tell him rutledge said why was there a problem there was a record of her purchasing her fare but none of her boarding the ship apparently there was some confusion over names may trent said unexpectedly if i had wanted to get away and money wasnt an issue id have paid my fare and then taken another ship or no ship at all virginia sedgwick could very well be alive and still in england hamish said quietly or dead having never left england rutledge pursuing that thought asked in which case if herbert baker changed his mind on his deathbed and told father james the truth about that journey from yorkshire to kings lynnor even what happened in kings lynn itselfit must have been very difficult for father james to hold his tongue and its quite possible isnt it that someone doesnt want the truth about virginia sedgwick to come out monsignor holston replied slowly i hadnt considered that but it explains why ive been uneasy since i saw father james dead if you are not a catholicif you dont understand the sanctity of confessionit would be natural to believe that father james told me or even the vicar here whatever hed learned from baker sims spoke up suddenly his face unhappy eyes torn theres another part of the story virginia sedgwick wasa lovely child i dont think arthur sedgwick realized that when he met her in richmond she told me she was always surrounded by cousins brothers sistersthey seldom had the opportunity to be alone she and arthur and in company she was shy she spoke softly and she had the gift of listening whats more her grandmother worried about her future had left her a fortune rich beautifuland notnot truly whole they stared at him in his mind rutledge heard lord sedgwicks dismissive words attractive simpleton thats what she was rutledge had taken it as hyperbolebut it was the truth they brought her to england for the wedding you know sims said wearily her family a very fashionable affair in london i dont think arthur ever realized that she wassimple until they went away on their wedding journey her family had made certain they were never alone together may trent asked how do you mean simple virginiashed had a fever as a small child the family blamed it on that they swore it wasnt hereditary but by that time arthur was married to her and he discovered that this very pretty very sweet very young bride was not simply modest and shy her mental development was retarded rutledge said and he didnt like the feeling of being cheated sims agreed it may explain why he spent so much time in france racing with his friends why he left virginia behind in yorkshire isolated from his friends and from london society reading between the lines i gathered that this was the reason behind his brother edwins frequent visits when arthur was away he was making damned sure that the simpleton didnt fornicate with the servants or the stableboys and produce a halfwit bastard who would inherit the family title monsignor holston after much persuasion agreed to return to osterley with them and speak to inspector blevins it had been a heated argument i cant see that it will do much good so much of it is speculation the priest protested father james is dead baker is deadfor all we know mrs sedgwick is dead all we may succeed in proving is that the chauffeur baker was cajoled into letting his passenger flee her husband there in kings lynn and theres no crime in that rutledge argued it isnt a question of convincing blevins its a matter of strategy if there is sufficient doubt he must reopen his investigation how will you begin may trent asked turning to the vicar rutledge asked him think back herbert baker was your sexton can you recall when mrs baker was illenough to be placed in a sanitarium for her tuberculosis you must have visited her then sims rubbed his eyes she was very ill in november i think and they didnt expect her to live through the winter with sanitarium care she did by the spring of thenwhen mrs sedgwick went missingbaker could see that continued care was essential to keeping his own wife alive he never expected miracles sims corrected rutledge she was dying yes shed have been dead in november without that care she survived two years with it that mattered to a man who loved his wife very deeply sims responded herbert baker was a decent man loyal how did he define loyalty rutledge persisted if someone convinced him he was acting in virginia sedgwicks best interests would he shut his eyes sims said hed never harm her but would arthur sedgwick feel the same way the argument had ended there it was crowded in the car and hamish in the rear seat with the two men was restless and not in the best of moods rutledge drove like an automaton beyond exhaustion may trent sat in the seat beside him head bowed lost in her own thoughts once she turned to him and asked if virginia sedgwick wassimplehow did she manage to elude baker find her way to london and arrange to sail on the next ship leaving for america sims answered leaning forward with one hand on the back of her seat its what worried father james why he feared she might be dead god knows arthur received plenty of sympathy he could have married again any time an eligible young widower with more money than he knew what to do with and no children to share in it but hed been burned once he stayed clear of any entanglements and what did you think rutledge asked him there was a long silence i thought perhaps edwin sedgwick had engineered her flight i was jealous i had wanted her to turn to me i wanted to be the shining knight on the white horse who rescued her i sat there alone in the vicarage and told myself that shed been more clever than i knew and i asked myself what shed given edwin in return im not very proud of it but its the truth monsignor holston added unexpectedly shes never been declared dead you know it was all kept very quiet father james wrote to her family in america they swore virginia hadnt come home theyd agreed with lord sedgwicks decision to hire people to look for her and were satisfied that it was very possible she had been lost at sea but father james was convinced early on that if she had arrived safely they would have sent her back hamish added it doesna seem that her ain family cares ower much what happened they were eager enough to palm her off on an unsuspecting suitor sims swore to hurt her would be like hurting a child may trent said i shudder to thinkit was so wild that night when we went down shed have had no idea what to do she stopped waited until her voice was steady again and went on but there had been a great deal of talk about the ship she might have been attracted to the idea of sailing home on a famous ship it would have made it easier for her to plan then what did herbert baker confess rutledge asked if hed only helped her to find a train to london he didnt share in the guilt of her death hamish said morosely were back to who paid for the care of his ill wife baker had even asked the vicar if it was possible to love someone too much the question was if one of the sedgwicks had plotted virginias disappearance which one had it been arthur edwin or lord sedgwick himself rutledge could feel the weariness that dragged at him like an anchor when the story got out that herbert baker had sent for a priest as well as the vicar had someone been terrified that the past would come back to life if the priest delved too deeply in it it was a strong enough motive for murder if youd killed before when they neared osterley a low mist hung over the marshes and the dips and twists of the road the verges vanishing and reappearing like links in a chain the dampness in the air sometimes produced a passing squall rutledge stopped again at the randal farm unwilling to leave that loose end unraveled over the protests of his weary passengers he got out and went to hammer on the door a ragged and battered figure came stomping around the corner of the house yelling obscenities rutledge stared randal was bloody from a dozen cuts and scratches on his face and hands bruises marked his jawline and his left arm was held close to his body the mares run into the ground damn you and that bitch done her best to kill me im flipping lucky to be able to walk the farmers anger was a live thing too long pent up he kicked out at the corner of the house then kicked again ill be seeing that solicitor in the town ill be wanting somebody to pay for last nights piece of work rutledge said walsh is dead the mare killed him good on her so the constable told me when i rode home by way of west sherham it serves the bastard right and i hope he rots in hell where he belongs the son he looked up and saw the woman in the car in the drive is that the bitch he started forward rutledge in three long strides caught tom randals arm and held him back no its someone else the vicar is with her randal peered at the motorcar that ee vicar he called yes hello tom whats happened to you man randal shook his head i was run down by a crazed woman in a motorcar thats what happened damned near killed me she did and of a purpose too drove straight over me after frightening the gelding half to death it took me a quarter of an hour to catch him he turned back to rutledge still furious im in no fit state to ride into osterley id take it as a favor if youd see that a constable pays me a call out here you owe me that ive a claim to lay against the police and against that bitch and ill be calling on the solicitor in the morning you ought to see dr stephenson ill live and you can tell that damned fool blevins if hed been better at his job i wouldnt have two horses in my stable that arent fit for work and wont be for another week whos going to help me do mine i ask you he turned and kicked savagely at the house a third time before stalking around the corner muttering imprecations under his breath it was hard to feel sorry for the old curmudgeon but rutledge could sympathize tom randal had been caught up in something over which he had no control and priscilla connaught had shown him no mercy he walked back to the car it would be just as well to send dr stephenson out to make a call he thought when the fury and the sense of being wronged faded randal would be hurting rather badly at least he thought bending to turn the crank priscilla connaught hadnt killed the man rutledge left the vicar at his front door sims looked up at the dark shadows of his house and turned as if half afraid to go in then with resolution he unlocked the door and closed it behind him holston on the other hand refused to spend the night in st annes rectory its bad enough by daylight but with the mists swirling about it and the churchyard id just as soon be in a welllighted hotel he said wryly and so rutledge pulled into the hotel yard and delivered the remainder of his passengers into the care of mrs barnett who welcomed them with the news that dinner could be warmed if they cared to dine rutledge standing in the dark outside the door could feel the fatigue moving through him like a sluggish stream but he turned and went instead to the pelican for his meal betsy the barmaid who came to ask what hed have as rutledge took the last seat in the crowded common room was buoyant were doing a fine business tonight she informed him everyone slept away the day and now theyre eager for company and gossip she looked around her pleased then remembered what the cause of her good fortune was her mood shifted they tell me though that the man is dead still its a swifter way to go than a hanging any day what are people saying about walsh do they believe he killed father james rutledge asked curious well of course he must have done he escaped didnt he inspector blevins was here no more than half an hour ago and saying that hed spoken to the chief constable in norwich everyones relieved that the police have done their best even though theres to be no trial looking around her once more she waited expectantly for his order the death of walsh he thought had been papered over justice had been served perhaps it was true he was beyond caring he ordered an ale and a serving of the stew and betsy brought him a covered dish of warmed bread from this mornings baking and a slab of butter hamish said ye ken youll no make any headway against what blevins has been saying and theyre eager to believe him theres the sticking point it was no one of his friends or neighbors who killed the priest and no one of theirs thats what matters they can go to bed this night and no be worried about being murdered in their sleep there was an outburst of laughter from a group by the window every head turned to look rutledge could see the general mood was relief and it bordered on the hysterical hamish was right order had been restored their own sturdy faith that no one from osterley could be guilty of such a heinous crime had been upheld but a stubborn refusal to go against his own better judgment made rutledge argue with his nemesis the priest kept working toward a solution to virginia sedgwicks disappearance the story about two priests at one deathbed was bound to get out and someone began to worry i dont think father james expected to be attacked perhaps his visit to norwich was the last straw even the appearance of having confided in his fellow clergymen would have aroused unwelcome suspicion aye thats possible but it doesna signify truth is no more than what people want to believe rutledge answered or what they fear and yere as gullible as any man you canna face the question about yon englishwomans guilt i havent forgotten may trent but if she killed father james there wont be another victim if it was one of the sedgwicks whats to stop the murderer from biding his time until its safe to kill again he may already be suspicious of simsholstonor even miss trent where is my duty toward them aye duty thats all verra fine ye did your duty in france too and im dead for it chapter finishing his meal as quickly as he could rutledge paid his bill and then walked toward the hotel his fatigue had passed the need for sleep as he had so many times at the front hed ignored it and pushed his body and his mind to their limitsand then pushed both beyond that retrieving his motorcar he drove to the police station there he asked the sleepy constable on duty how to find two people and left word for blevins requesting that someone be sent around to speak to the old farmer in the morning the constable grimaced a year or two back a lorry hit one of his piglets out on the road odd place for a piglet to be wandering youd think and the inspector was of the opinion the sow had rolled over on it but randal swore it was a lorry it was three months before we could satisfy him he has a better claim this time rutledge warned and left dr stephenson lived on the main road toward hunstanton in a wellkept threestory house that backed up to the marshes rutledge turned into the yard where a gate led into the flintwalled garden with its flagstone walk up to the door a black spaniel waiting on the step to be let in again greeted him effusively trying to lick his hand when the housekeeper answered the knockers dull thunk the little dog darted past her crisp skirts and disappeared into the hall beyond the middleaged woman regarding rutledge with unconcealed interest as if his reputation had preceded him warned him that he had interrupted the doctor at his dinner stephenson himself coming out to speak to rutledge told him to make his call brief its brief enough tom randal was bruised in a fall from his horse it might be best to find out if hes more seriously hurt i shouldnt be surprised if hell be more grateful than hell care to admit by tomorrow morning hell be stiff as a board ive been trying to persuade him to hire a couple to cook for him and help with the farm he may listen now but hes as independent and stubborn as they come stephenson his serviette in his hand sighed all right yes as soon as ive finished my dinner and ill take someone along who can stay the night and see that he has a decent breakfast in the morning was it randal that priscilla connaught thought shed killed i have every reason to believe it is tom randal is damned lucky to be alive she was in no state to think clearly about what she was trying to do and whose fault is that hamish asked in condemnation rutledge ignored his voice how is she ive kept her sedated mrs nutley is staying the night with her ill look in there on my way do you have any idea how tired you are youre slurring your words man you ought to be in your bed or ill have a new patient on my hands good advice ill take it shortly rutledge said good night and strode down the dark path to the road as he cranked the engine his chest protested in fiery wires spreading deep ignoring that too rutledge drove next to priscilla connaughts house he was surprised to find that she was awake drinking a mutton broth that mrs nutley had made the nurse had explained to rutledge on their way up the stairs an empty stomach sees nothing good i always feed my patients before the next dose of medicines priscilla wearing a very fetching lavender dressing gown smiled at him as he walked through the door but obediently drank most of the broth before saying youre here to arrest me her voice was matteroffact but her expression bleak behind the smile id warned mrs nutley the police would come for me soon no he pulled a chair to the bed and sat down wondering if hed be able to get out of it again the man you thought you killed is alive though bruised and bloody and furious he must have gone through a hedge headfirst still id accept that as very good news if i were you nor was it walsh again good news from your perspective dear god she set the bowl on her tray and stared at him oh gentle god theres nothing you can do about mr randal tonight except to sleep and regain your good sense she said faintly you look like a dead man yourself yes i rather feel like one he smiled dont you think its time you told me what lay between you and father james biting her lip she turned away i told you once before it doesnt have anything to do with his death only with mine what did he ask you to do what ruined your life he pressed her it was unfair to force her in her present stateas hamish was pointing outbut he was afraid that when she regained her strength she would be more than a match for the police she glanced at mrs nutley im half drunk with whatever it is shes made me swallow i cant keep my mind clear he could see it in the pupils of her eyes mrs nutley her hands folded in her apron was unruffled its only what the doctor instructed me to give her i understand to the patient he added would you like mrs nutley to leave the room im sure shell be glad to give us a moment yes no priscilla connaught fell silent closing her eyes against his inspection and then unexpectedly she opened them and said in a despairing voice it was so long ago nobody cares nobody remembers not anymore but that doesnt make the hurt go away he could see the pain in her face stripping away what was left of her youth and turning her almost as he watched into a very different woman do you know what loneliness is inspector he answered quietly im afraid i do its how i live she embraced herself with her arms drawing them across her chest as if they offered a measure of comfort leaning into them as if desperate for human warmth i loved a very fine man we were to be married i was over the moon with joy he knew what she meant hed watched the same joy wash over jean when hed asked her to marry him on saturday next shed be married to someone else he didnt want to be in london then priscilla connaughts voice startled him stronger now and thick with grief and then one day gerald came to me to say that he had had anepiphanyof sorts a revelation i asked him what it was and he said he had always been drawn to the church and now he knew that that was where he ought to be it was what god wanted him to do i told him if this was what he wanted of course he should follow his vision we could marry when he finished his studies but he explained that he wanted to become a catholic priest there couldnt be any marriage now or later he broke off our engagement and you blamed father james for persuading him she squeezed her eyes tightly to hold back the tears as if on the back of the lids the past was still vivid and clear he wasnt a priest then he was only john james but he was geralds best friend i went to him and asked him to persuade gerald not to do this he told me the best thing i could do for gerald if i loved him was to let him go let him enter the priesthood the tears began to fall but her eyes were shut still closing rutledge out so i let him go ii truly believed that once he had his way once hed embarked on his studies hed quickly discover that it wasnt what he wanted after all i was convinced that he loved me too much for this this fancy to last i gave him my blessing and let him go rutledge waited in the bitter silence that followed uncertain whether or not she had finished he could imagine how she must have felt abandoned for whatto a womanseemed an inexplicable rejection of her and her love finally she opened her eyes and looked across at him her voice was shaking so much he wasnt sure he heard her clearly in his last year before being ordained gerald killed himself and neither god nor i had him in the end i couldnt torment god i tormented father james instead geralds death lay at his door and every time he looked at my face in his congregation he was unable to forget how wrong hed been how hed failed gerald and mewhat in his sanctimonious faith in his own judgment hed done to us just as i could never forget gerald rutledge waited by the bedside until the sedative mrs nutley had given her sent priscilla connaught into the comforting oblivion of sleep keep an eye on her will you he asked as they left the room you can depend on me inspector as he walked on down the stairs to the door the older woman following said quietly in my experience it helps sometimes to unburden the heart but he wasnt convinced that confession would do much for the sleeping figure hed left in the darkened bedroom the only certainty was that priscilla connaughts secret had had nothing to do with the priests death frederick giffords house was set well back from the road just past the school it stood in a small park of old trees that reminded rutledge of the vicarage at holy trinity driving through the gates and up to the door he could see that the house was gabled and probably very old the maid who admitted rutledge left him in the parlor from another part of the house he could hear people talking as if gifford had guests gifford came in with apologies a week ago id invited friends to dine with me we decided not to let the upheavals of last night affect our plans though to tell you the truth no one is in a festive mood what brings you here at this hour of the night shouldnt you be in your bed you look like death walking man rutledge laughed ive heard that enough to believe it i wont keep you long i need to learn who arranged for mrs bakerherbert bakers ill wifeto have the treatment she required for her consumption its rather important surprised by the request gifford smoothed the line of his beard with the back of his fingers i dont know that is i never knew nor did dr stephenson a bank in norwich sent me a letter instructing me that an anonymous benefactor had requested a sum of money be set aside for the care of one margaret baker wife of herbert of this town i was to use it to pay any medical bills as required by her doctors associated with her illness mrs baker wasnt particularly wellknown her illness wasnt uncommon why should she be singled out by a norwich bank for such a generous gesture gifford frowned i have no idea i didnt ask i saw no reason to the papers were in orderand mrs baker was seriously ill stephenson told me later that better care extended her life by several years but surely you must have guessed who was behind this generosity bakers employer for one the thought crossed my mind but i didnt pursue it stephenson does what he can on his own and there are other people in norfolk who support a variety of charitable activities the king has been known to act anonymously and he knew the sedgwick family i cant imagine how the king discovered that an obscure coachmans wife living quietly in osterley was in need no no the king doesnt handle such matters himself you misunderstand gifford answered but he has deep roots in norfolk and apparently feels strongly about them the staff at sandringham raised a troop of their own during the war he and the queen took a keen interest in the men its not impossible that someone in the household brought the bakers to the attention of the staff yes i understand but in my view theyd be far more likely to have a word with lord sedgwick rather than go to the trouble of making arrangements with a bank in norwich is there any way that thiskindnesscould be traced through the paperwork i doubt it bankers are worse than stones when it comes to divulging information immovable rutledge thanked him and left stones could be moved if scotland yard wanted the information badly enough hamish said even if his lairdship paid for the sanitarium it willna prove much it proves that a debt existed between herbert baker and the sedgwick family the sort of debt that baker would have gone to great lengths to repay as he lay dying he told the vicar that he feared hed loved his wife too much he could easily have confessed to father james how hed demonstrated that love aye but yon trent womanshe has depths you canna plumb i wouldna count her out of the running you canna know for certain if she abandoned an elderly woman when the ship was sinking to save hersel shed ha killed father james if he came too close to her secret only a few days ago when rutledge had seen the connection between father james and the watchers of time observers of deeds he had remarked that there were no bodies and therefore no murders that the priest could have uncovered now there were two the woman whom may trent had accompanied as a companion and virginia sedgwick who waspossiblyalso lost in the sea or hamish interjected into rutledges thoughts buried here in these marshes i havena seen more likely ground for disposing of a corpse on the way back to the hotel rutledge spotted a solitary figure walking among the trees just back from the road as the headlamps of his motorcar flashed across the pale expressionless face he recognized peter henderson he was about to stop and offer the man a lift and then mrs barnetts words made him drive on i leave him alone now peter henderson still had his pride rutledge was so tired his eyes were playing tricks on him as the motorcars headlamps picked out the turning for water street and he came close to swerving into the wall of a house he had done all he could this night and he wanted his bed but as he neared the hotel another thought struck him may trent and monsignor holston were staying there too and if they were waiting for him in the lounge it would be at least another houror morebefore he could walk away from them he passed the hotel drove along the quay and turned toward the main road considering even a pew in the church as a better alternative there was something that may trent had said about a blanket kept there for peter henderson it would do soldiers were used to sleeping rough but as he went up trinity lane hamish pointed out another choice one where his presence might be gratefully accepted gratefully enough that no questions would be asked the vicarage rutledge had to fight the wheel to turn in through the vicarage gates like a drunk whose reflexes were starting to fail he drew up in front of the house his hands shaking as he switched off the motor it was a minute or two before he could make it to the front door and lift the knocker after a long wait the window above his head opened the vicar said who is it in a flat voice rutledge i dont want to go back to the hotel but i need to sleep if i keep you company tonight will you trade me a bed and no conversation there was laughter from over his head bitter and without humor i havent slept myself all right ill let you in wait there sims was still fully clothed when he unlocked the door and opened it to rutledge he smelled of whiskey im beginning to think about posting a sign rooms for let he said you look like hell rutledge took a deep breath unsteady on his feet as do you have you been drinking sims asked suspiciously no im cold sober justnearly at the end of my tether five minutes later rutledge was deeply asleep in the bedroom that may trent had occupied only twentyfour hours before her scent still lingered in the room rutledge awoke in the dark startled by a figure walking close by the bed who is it he managed to ask coherently after clearing his throat sims its after nine i brought hot water for shaving a razor and a clean shirt breakfast will be ready in fifteen minutes if youre hungry thanks rutledge lay there an arm flung across his eyes stunned by exhaustion his mind working slowly after several minutes he forced himself out of the bed and across the room to draw open the draperies it was pouring rain out of heavy black clouds a sky that seemed to absorb all light no wonder hed thought it was still the middle of the night hamish scolded theres no any need for haste if youre no clearheaded rutledge went to the washstand and looked at his face in the mirror shadowed by beard and the dreary light coming in the windows behind him it was not a face he was particularly fond of lighting the lamp he set about shaving and dressing a quarter of an hour later he walked into the kitchen sims said if anyone came to the door and looked at the two of us they would be ready to believe wed had an allnight carousal my head feels like it in the lamplight he was haggard lines bracketing his mouth and heavy circles under his eyes he had found yesterday unbearably difficult i sympathize rutledge reached for the pot of tea ready to pour the steaming liquid into his cup and somewhere in the tangle of memories from the day before one stood out clearly there had been three cups on the table yesterday morning he looked across at sims who was putting a rasher of bacon on a plate while the toast browned who keeps this house for you i have a woman who comes in three times a week why she wasnt here yesterday no shes coming around ten today thats why i woke you then who was herebesides yourself and miss trent the vicar became very still you were here but his eyes swept down to the teacups and back to rutledge he didnt lie well as hamish was busy noting rutledge hazarded a guess it was peter henderson wasnt it sims said carefully peter comes sometimes yes when hes hungry he often sleeps in the church if the weathers foul i dont know where he sleeps the rest of the time poor devil a cold roof over his head the church with stone walls and stone flooring hed not be very warm theres a chest under the tower i keep clean blankets there he knows where to find them he paused the church has had a long history of offering sanctuary i can do no less miss trent and mrs barnett tell me that he roams the night more often than not ive seen him a number of times myself yes i expect he does perhaps its easier for him living in the dark fewer people to stare at him what did he see the night that walsh escaped rutledge insisted sims put down the plate and retrieved the burning toast from the stove you must ask him im asking you sims sat down reached for the pot and poured tea for himself look the mans little more than a vagrant now living hand to mouth most of the townspeople have no use for him they think hes beyond the pale his own father disowned him i do what i can and so did father james but changing attitudes is much harder than preaching profound sermons on a sunday a silence followed it was sims who reluctantly broke it peter was in the church that night he wasnt feeling well and crept in to sleep for awhile he was still in the church when walsh came in to hammer off his chains henderson heard him dragging them he didnt know who or what was there his tally of kills from the war for all i know it must have been rather appalling he slipped into the choirits quite dark in there and no one was likely to find him crouched among the misericords and he moves like a wraith when he wants to yes thats his training when walsh left he was on foot hendersonwho isnt a fool by any meanshad worked out who was in the church and what it must have meant he followed and kept an eye on him from a distance they walked through the woods and past the barn where trinity lane ends henderson stayed with him for nearly five miles to tom randals farm walsh didnt go anywhere near the randal farm not according to henderson he was moving as swiftly and quietly as he could walsh i mean covering the ground faster than most peter kept up with him until he was well beyond osterley then he turned back not wanting to be spotted rutledge shook his head that cant be true the mare at the farm went missing in probably that same time frame and it was her shoe that killed walsh sims said thats why we didnt tell you may trent and i ive never known peter to lie to me but he was very cold and hungry walking that far and he might have made up a story in exchange for his breakfast it seemeda little less like begging i suppose rutledge got up and helped himself to the bacon and a slice of burned toast sims said there are boiled eggs in that covered dish rutledge lifted the lid and set an egg on his plate cracking it and spooning out the yolk he said what else has henderson seen wandering around in the dark sims buttered his own slice frowning at the burnt taste he seldom talks about his lifeor what hes witnessed i think the only reason he told me about his encounter with walsh was his need for food and a little warmth yes it may be true rutledge added pensively i should have expected that between you you and father james could have found work for hendersondoing the heavier labor for old tom randal for instance and mrs barnett must need someone to help with upkeep at the hotel its a barn of a place for a woman on her own she doesnt have the custom to hire anyone else even for a pittance with room and board tom randal refuses to consider help on the farm no one else in osterley needs henderson too many people are out of work thats the troublethe shopkeepers and farms can find help two a penny without turning to a man with peters history lord sedgwick hired him until dick herbert bakers younger son was fit again for light duties the house in yorkshire is closed while arthur sedgwick recovers from his own injuriesif hes not in hospital hes here in norfolk or in london edwin lives in london most of the year ive been corresponding with a woman in hunstanton who may take henderson on she and her husband own a small pub and need an extra man but hes not local you seeand shes wary of that sims said tentatively what are you going to do about virginia sedgwick i dont quite see inspector blevins rushing to find out the truth most particularly if it involves the sedgwick family he wont like that hes already seen to it that most of osterley believes that walsh has paid for what he didthat justice has been served and he has to live here i cant fault him for trying to put as good a face on the situation as he can rutledge grimaced the most direct course of action would be going to lord sedgwick himself good god man you cant be serious simss face was the picture of dismay i agreedwe all agreedthat it was worthwhile speaking to blevins do you realize how powerful sedgwick is youll sink your own career and possibly mine as well rutledge considered him you still dont wish to know whats become of virginia sedgwick do you but sedgwicks son may well have committed murder and i think its important to give him an opportunity to refute such a charge hell be a worse enemy if half the town hears before he does he smiled thank you for breakfastand a nights sleep i needed both rather badly as he went to find his coat sims followed him to the hall im grateful for what youre trying to do its just im not sure that i want to stop thinking about her being alive iits given me a kind of hope he shrugged as if embarrassed by the admission its hard to explain but rutledge understood what he was trying to say he himself had never looked over his own shoulder to find out once and for all if hamish was there he didnt want to knowhe didnt want to see what was there and as long as he didnt he was safe as he buttoned his coat against the rain he said what if against all expectations we should find that virginia sedgwick left her husband of her own accord and is happily settled in a cottage in ireland living a life she much prefers to her role as arthurs wife would he welcome her back do you think idont know it would depend on the scandal to a large extent sims looked out at the rain and the wet trees overhanging the drive the sedgwicks came from trade they arent able to weather the scandals that established families can theyve climbed the social ladder as high as possible in three generations but they arent at the top theyve given money generously where it would do the most good full acceptance marrying into the best families eludes them arthur might have if he hadnt foolishly fallen in love with a cousin he might still as a widower im not sure he wouldnt prefer to learn that shes dead father james pursued her disappearance with unexpected fervor no not if youd known him he had a great capacity for caring he told me once that every time he looked out at his congregation he knew that he was not the man they believed him to be it drove him to strive for a level of service that few of us can ever hope to emulate as rutledge thanked sims again and walked out into the rain hamish said aye priscilla connaughts shadow fell across the priests pulpit every time he stepped into it a pity he never told her rutledge answered silently chapter hamish said as rutledge climbed behind the wheel if it wasna walsh who killed the priest youre up against a canny murderer he kens how to cover his tracks no loose ends to stumble over rutledge agreed when blevins allowed himself to be blinded by anger he tied his own hands he went looking for a monster rutledge turned out of the vicarage gates and he found himself one hamish answered it willna be to your credit if you fail i wont fail rutledge answered grimly sedgwick should have destroyed that egyptian basrelief instead of moving it out to the gardens it gave me the key to father jamess actionsa watcher after that it was only a matter of time before the rest made sense a milk wagon lumbered by on the main road in the rain the backs of the horses were burnished copper rutledge braked in this weather he reversed the motorcar backing as far as the gate to holy trinity the grass under his feet as he crossed the churchyard to the north porch door was heavy with rain and his shoulders were soaked by the time he reached the shelter of the church door opening it he brushed the water from his face before he stepped inside henderson inspector rutledge id like to speak with you if youre here his voice echoed in the silence almost an obscenity in the peace of the nave and the soft patter of rain against the stained glass this morning dark as it was the colors were deeper and richer but without life rutledge waited then he heard someone near the choir im here give me a minute peter henderson rising from a pew tried to straighten his coat and brushed a hand over his hair before walking toward rutledge what do you want verification thats all the vicar tells me that you saw walsh the night he came in here to hammer off his chains yes was he alone yes why did you follow him when he left i knew who he was id seen him at the fair at st annes i thought it best where did he go up the lane into that copse of trees past the houses he was bearing west and south its the direction id have taken in his shoes its mostly pasturage beyond the houses and easy walking he never turned east while you were following him no why should he it would be going into a box rutledge nodded he looked down at peter hendersons shoes they were old worn he said walsh stole a mare from a farmer just east of osterley why would he turn back on himself to do that henderson shrugged ive told you what i saw i cant tell you what he did after i broke off and walked back to osterley he had an odd dignity standing there in his creased and worn clothes a man shunned by others because he happened to be very good at killing from ambush it wasnt deserved the judgment local people had inflicted upon him and yet this was his home and villagers were often tied emotionally if not financially to their roots the money in the tin box at the rectory would have been a treasure trove to him he could have gone anywhere with ten or fifteen pounds in his pocket had it been tempting hamish said i canna believe it nor do you it was a rifle he used in the war distant killing that fair enough then henderson rutledge paused were you at the rectory the day father james was killed waiting to see him yes why id heard of work in wells i wanted to ask him to write a letter for me had he written letters before once the vicar has written them too where did you wait mrs wainer was just leaving it was growing dark by then i stood by those overgrown bushes so as not to frighten her someone else came looking for father james i left then not wanting to push myself forward hed stood in the lilacsthose overgrown bushes it wasnt one of walshs cronies acting as lookout after all it was a man wanting help to find a job rutledge said who came mrs barnett from the hotel but she only tapped at the door when mrs wainer didnt answer she stepped into the kitchen and called then closed the door and left mrs barnett never went beyond the kitchen not as far as i could tell she wasnt there much above a minute was there anyone else henderson said reluctantly yes lord sedgwick came to the front door and knocked you saw his car no i never did his voice was level a soldier reporting to his commanding officer but i saw him walk up the drive then he came round to the back along the far side of the house not close to where i was standing he was looking up at the windows of the conservatory next door they were dark then he went in through the kitchen calling to father james he must have gone on to the parlor to wait or leave a note thats when i left and you never saw father james that night well yes i did he was on his bicycle riding back to the rectory he waved and i walked on you didnt tell him he had a visitor it wasnt my place hamish said blevins wouldna believe it was a local man there in the shrubs he wished it to be bolton the scissor sharpener or iris kenneth rutledge said im driving to the pelican would you like a lift hendersons face brightened give me five minutes to clear up ill wait in the car rutledge turned and walked back to the motorcar hardly noticing the rain once hed dropped off henderson rutledge drove back to the hotel retrieved his umbrella from his room and walking briskly went directly to the police station he found that he was not the only visitor a youngish woman in a black coat over a green traveling dress was sitting in front of the sergeants desk her face buried in an overlarge handkerchief supplied by a redfaced blevins across the desk from her the inspector looked up as rutledge came through the door whatever it is it can wait he gestured toward his visitor this is iris kenneth she traveled up from london toersee walsh ive just given her the news iris kenneth raised her face from the handkerchief her eyes watery and redrimmed turning to stare at the newcomer blevins said this is inspector rutledge from scotland yard she nodded a faint acknowledgment and said to blevins as if she had been interrupted in the middle of her grief i was so angry with him matthew for sacking me but i decided that if i stood by him now he might take me on again after he wasnt a bad man to work for he enjoyed posing in his costume and being admired i was jealous he wasnt likely to be taking on a helper ever again blevins said he cast a wary glance at rutledge he was more likely to find himself waiting for the hangman fierce in walshs defense iris kenneth cried but i told you matthew wasnt a murderer he wasnt a bully he didnt have a temper yes i know miss kenneth several times she began to cry again rutledge standing by the door could read the embarrassment in blevinss face over the womans head the inspector shot him a pleading glance for help i dont know what you want me to do miss kenneth he said plaintively i cant tell you what the arrangements are for a funeral not just at the moment but if youd like to take a room she glared at him through her tears i dont have the money to stayor to bury matthew i spent nearly every penny coming hereive barely enough to see me back to london hamish said hes no a man for the ladies he doesna ken that its no so much walshs dying as it is the disappointment of her expectations she canna face what to do now rutledge stepped toward her chair miss kenneth its been a very difficult morning for you a cup of tea and an hours rest at the hotel will help im sure inspector blevins will meet with you in the afternoon blevins glowered at him and she caught it iris kenneths shoulders slumped i could use a cup of tea she said this has been a terrible shock im sure it has mrs barnett at the hotel is very kind shell see that youre taken care of she looked more closely at the tall man by the door he could read her eyes as they swept over his face and across his shoulders and back again with the resourcefulness of her class she recognized that she would make no headway with the stolid man behind the desk and she was desperate willing to try any port in the unsettled climate of her life just now she got to her feet with some grace and said youre very kind if the inspector here she groped for a name blevins he said relief already spreading across his features inspector rutledge is right miss kenneth take your time and youll soon see your way clear again the false heartiness in his voice was almost insulting blevins she acknowledged will give me a little more of his time later oh yes to be sure he said hurriedly rising from his chair to escort her to the door rutledge glanced at iris kenneth and then said cryptically to blevins id come to ask the doctor was satisfied that it was the mares shoe that was the cause of death oh yes theres no doubt im completely satisfied rutledge nodded holding the umbrella over his companions hat rutledge took her arm to guide her toward the hotel im sorry that youve come so far he told her to hear such tragic news he wouldnt have killed anyone much less this priest matthew was always on his best behavior at church bazaars superstitious if you like and he never cared for being penned upim not surprised he escaped a big man like him in such a small space it would have been torture rutledge though god id have tried to escape too shut in away from the air and the lightsmothered by the walls hamish said ye ken murderers are always locked away if theyre half mad like you its the cell its no the rope iris kenneth kept up her earnest defense of matthew walsh all the way to the hotel one hand holding her skirts out of the rainwater washing down the street toward the quay when they reached the door she looked out at the marshes and rutledge could feel her shudder through the arm inside his what a dreary place she remarked enough to turn anybody into a murderer living here long enough mrs barnett stepped out of her tiny office and said good morning inspector youre about early on such a nasty day i believe miss trent and monsignor holston have been waiting for you in the lounge shall i bring tea to warm you up meanwhile ive brought you another guest she reluctantly took charge of miss kenneth eyeing her with some dismay in the calm gracious lobby of the hotel iris kenneths style was decidedly out of place garish her voice a little loud her clothes a little shabby her face rather too heavily made up for a country town her rouge and the line of kohl beneath her eyes had run from her tears giving her a clownish expression of surprise iris kenneth seemed equally reluctant to give up rutledges company she said you will take me back to see inspector blevins later yes and see you safely on your way back to london he promised undone by the fear in her eyes it was real not feigned this woman had lived a life with little security on the edge of poverty as often as not and never climbing to the dizzying heights of the great names of the legitimate stage it had already taken its toll in her skin and in the hard lines around her mouth he remembered all too well the woman dragged from the thames had she chosen the water rather than falling into prostitution if iris was despairing enough of her future prospects to swallow her pride and anger and come to offer matthew walsh her support she was desperate indeed hamish said clicking his puritanical tongue youre a fool and will be taken for one hardly rutledge answered curtly he left miss kenneth in mrs barnetts care and walked into the lounge where may trent was writing a letter at the small white desk and monsignor holston was reading a book they looked up their faces mirroring an expression of impatience where have you been miss trent asked we expected to see you at dinner last night or breakfast this morning there was neither censure or anger in her voice but he detected an undercurrent of strain ive been busy im afraid rutledge replied ive spoken with the vicar for one and peter henderson after that peter tells me that walsh walked away from holy trinity through the trees just south of the vicarage and past the houses there taking a southwesterly course where he could make good time in the pastures beyond may trent said but you said walsh hadnt done any such thing you said hed taken that poor farmers horse thats why we said nothing monsignor holston interjected if walsh had come across a search party he might have doubled back found himself some faster means of getting out in his shoes doubling back could mean certain capture there were farms ahead mrs barnett came in with tea ive settled miss kenneth for now she said i wouldnt be surprised if she sleeps for an hour or so she tells me she came all the way from london it must have been a very difficult journey for her rutledge said thank you eri understand you went to see father james the same day that he died no thats not true she paused oh you mean to the rectory i stopped to ask ruth wainer if i might borrow a roasting pan for the weekend when there would be a christening party here i didnt expect to find father james inat that hour hes usually in the church did you go to the kitchen door or to the front of the rectory to the kitchen door of course i was hoping ruth hadnt left did you see anyone near the house when you went there she smoothed the collar of her gray dress i dont recall seeing anyone else should i have peter henderson was there near the lilacs waiting to speak to father james no but of course i wasnt looking for him was i why didnt he speak did you meet a member of lord sedgwicks family by any chance she considered the question not lord sedgwick no i did pass his motorcar near gull street i didnt see who was in it the lamps were right in my face and it was traveling fast it went on toward wells as far as i could tell occasionally that chauffeur of his takes it to the pelican if lord sedgwick is out of town it could have been edwin hes a fast driver like his brother do you know the randal farm oh yes everyone does i used to buy cut flowers from his wife for the diningroom tables she was a wonderful gardener whose property is adjacent to randals to the south my guess is it belongs to the sedgwick family lord sedgwick has made a practice of buying up acreage when he can i shouldnt be surprised to hear hes bought the randal property when toms too old to run it himself theres no close family you see what shed told him agreed with the map hed seen in blevinss office thank you mrs barnett youve been very helpful will you be staying in for lunch her glance ran around the room yes if thats convenient rutledge answered for them you know something we dont holston said as the door closed behind mrs barnett little things henderson saw lord sedgwick arrive at the rectory just after mrs barnett left when there was no answer to his knock sedgwick went inside furthermore if sedgwicks property adjoins the randal farm its very likely hed also know about the horsesand that the old man is hard of hearing monsignor holston said i dont follow youare you telling me that sedgwick arranged for a horse to be available to matthew walsh once he escaped no may trent said slowly watching rutledges face no he thinks someone else rode that mare she was quick its possible rutledge agreed he saw again the hammer wound on the dead wifes temple all those years ago reaching into his experience and deeper into his intuition he said when matthew walsh escaped from his cell it was seen as an admission of guilt if he was killed before he could be recaptured and tried all the better with his death the investigation would be closed as it has been if hed been retaken and sent to norwich for trial anything could have gone wrong insufficient evidence to convict him she asked intrigued then youre saying that someone went after walsh and caught up with him not long after the mare cast her shoe her face changed but look here if walsh wasnt riding it he wouldnt have been the one the mare kicked interesting isnt it rutledge smiled after luncheon i intend to pay a call on lord sedgwick monsignor hols on said good god are you telling me that his son arthur is behind all this killing ive met the manyoull never sell him to a jury as a coldblooded murderer charming and very well liked we were all searching for walsh and by sheer luck someone caught up with him in my opinion thats what happened theres a torn patch of grass just a few feet from where the body lay some sort of struggle went on there but no ones going to tackle a man walshs size it would be suicide unless walsh was on foot and his killer was on the mare which brings us back to lord sedgwick if he was at the rectory when father james was killed may trent said then hed want walsh dead monsignor holston said no what i think rutledge is saying is that just as peter henderson was a witness so was sedgwick without necessarily knowing the importance of what he saw may trents eyes on rutledge and speculative were skeptical rutledge looked at his watch we have five minutes before the dining room opens i should go upstairs and change out of these wet clothes as he closed the lounge door behind him he overheard monsignor holston commenting to may trent when i asked my bishop to send for the yard i thought i was doing something good what have i unleashed luncheon passed in relative silence each member of the small party lost in his or her own thoughts over the main course may trent said suddenly im going with you when you call on lord sedgwick its not a very good idea rutledge answered it probably isnt she agreed all the same im going but they were held up a fire in one of the houses west of water street jammed the road with firefighters and a tangle of buckets people and frightened horses the pouring rain dropping out of a gray and lightabsorbing sky soon accomplished what the firefighters couldnt and the smoking blackened rafters filled the air with the reek of burned wood as they loomed starkly against the clouds but much of the house survived and a great many of its contents had been saved one of the men fighting the blaze was edwin sedgwick sleeves rolled high face smeared with sweat and soot as rutledge joined the line passing buckets from the well edwin shouted orders and encouragement taking charge as if by right and showing unusual skill at coordinating the mob of people observing when he could rutledge saw that edwins skill lay not so much in cajolery or goodhumored bandinage but in the role of the local squire the natural leader everyone turned to in time of trouble or danger it was a role edwins father played to the hilt and the son had learned well he took full advantage of it now hamish said hes no sae overbearing as his father as rutledge spelled an older man needing a breather he agreed with hamish command came more naturally to edwin as if by this generation it was bred in the bone not learned edwin was everywhere at once taking as many risks as the next man and not complaining about lending his weight where it was needed a hand on a tired shoulder a word of support swift advice a cry of warning hamish whose independent scottish spirit seldom allowed him to bow his neck to any man commented hes no the elder brother he willna be the laird in his turn rutledge cast a glance around to find may trent not in the motorcar watching from a safe distance but busy comforting the distraught woman lamenting the overturned lamp that had started the fire picking up the thread of hamishs remark again he found it interesting while arthur had been buried in yorkshires dales with his young wife or racing across france edwins had been the face that osterley had seen most frequently this presented a different aspect of the man rutledge had encountered returning from boating in the marshes with his dog and drinking alone in the lounge bar of a tiny hotel outside norwich what had taken edwin there hamish answered mischief and perhaps there had been a woman with him that night their work done the firefighters began the onerous task of cleaning up the muddy yard and trying to get the salvaged belongings under cover edwin sedgwick accepted the gratitude of the householder as if it were his due noblesse oblige and to satisfy the general euphoria he shook hands with all comers when he reached rutledge he smiled and added thanks for your help we needed every man treating him casually as an outsider nothing in his demeanor indicated that he was aware of rutledges close observation but rutledge had the feeling that edwin sedgwick like his father was a man used to battling the world and winning he would be mindful of the smallest detail as rutledge turned to collect may trent sedgwick retrieved a motorcycle from the side of a tree and roared away toward east sherham in the distance caught by the echoes of the rolling land the sound dulled from thunder to a quiet chuckle it was hamish who called his attention to that rutledge spent what was left of the afternoon asleep in the chair in his bedchamber he was awakened by mrs barnett in time to arrange for iris kenneth to speak to blevins again and it was close to six when he saw her off to kings lynn in a lorry that had brought boxes of hams to the butcher in osterley and as far east as cley he also made certain that she had money enough to make the journey in reasonable comfort and she thanked him profusely matthew wouldnt have hurt anyone she said earnestly that inspector blevins wont believe me but i hope you will i cant say any fairer than that he helped her into the lorry ill keep that in mind thank you miss kenneth at the last moment she leaned down speaking for his ears alone i owe you and i pay my debts a friend of mine did a bit of work once for a man in norfolk i never knew what village but he was rich and he paid her well to impersonate a lady but she never did live to enjoy the money i always thought hed killed her two months later they found her in the river like that poor girl you thought was me naked as the day she was born and drowned when was this he asked his curiosity aroused it was before the war about two years before the war id like to see you find the bastard yourself and put that sanctimonious policemans nose out of joint serve him right to be made to look a fool and a bit of his own back for matthew and she was gone the empty lorry lumbering down the road in the rain like a drunken walrus may trent who had stepped out in the shelter of the hotel doorway said shell manage you know her kind always does somehow we more frequently find them floating in the thames i hope to god shes not taken out of the water one day soon rutledge opened the umbrella and held it over her head as they walked to the yard where the motorcar stood waiting he was hearing monsignor holstons admonition offered quietly in the lobby of the hotel dont start something you cant finish he said thats what father james did hamish had silently answered in rutledges mind aye its worth heeding chapter as he was about to crank the motor rutledge said to may trent ive just thought of something ill be back shortly he turned and walked with long strides to the pelican ten minutes later he was back with peter henderson who nodded at may trent and climbed into the rear seat of the car without a word hamish was a hum of wordless admonition in rutledges mind reminding him that this nights work could become a debacle dusk was falling quickly the rain shifting for part of the way to a drizzle that seemed to coat the motorcar and its passengers in tiny drops of moisture as they passed down the avenue of trees in east sherham that led to the gates of the sedgwick estate rutledge slowed to a walking pace and peter henderson like a wraith was out of the car and gone in the mist before may trent had even turned to see what was happening the gatekeeper reluctant to come out in the rain called from his doorway whos there inspector rutledge lord sedgwick is expecting me the man a hood over his head hurried to open the gate and let them through rutledge drove on halfway down the looping drive to the house he said to his passenger if youve changed your mind you can stay in the car i dont expect this to take very long no i have a stake in this in a way as you wish but he was not pleased with her answer the house was in darkness save for lights on the first floor and in the hall he lifted the knocker on the door and let it fall the two of them huddled under the umbrella as they waited hamish was a constant barrage now in the back of rutledges mind like very distant thunder warning him to walk carefully may trent said i think its turning colder as if to prove her words her breath came out in a small white puff she shivered the door opened the housekeeper holding the lamp high to see their faces in the shadow of the umbrella inspector rutledge and miss trent to see lord sedgwick he said briskly she said its such a nasty night isnt it do come in ill let his lordship know youre here they stepped into the hall the umbrella dribbling a tiny stream of water across the floor as rutledge furled it and left it outside the housekeeper was gone only a few minutes she led them to the salon with its broad windows and the dark wet sweep of the lawns beyond lord sedgwick was sitting there a glass of whiskey in his hand he rose and greeted his guests with warmth do sit down youve come about the reward have you has blevins made up his mind who should have it i rather think hes leaving the decision to you but i havent come about walsh im here about your late coachman herbert baker surprised sedgwick said baker what does he have to do with walsh can you tell me who in your family made it possible for his wife to have the medical attention she required his expression gave away nothing but polite interest it must have cost more than baker could afford in a lifetime bakers wife ah i have a feeling that must have been virginia my daughterinlaw she no doubt arranged for money to be sent anonymously very much the sort of thing she would do there was a blandness in his voice that rutledge found irritating even if shed had no idea what she was signing virginias name would surely be there in the banks file of correspondence because thats when the planning must have begun rutledges glance crossed may trents she smiled pleasantly as if they were discussing a mutual acquaintance but her gloved hands gripped each other that brings me to the next question in regard to your daughterinlaw this time sedgwicks eyebrows rose virginia you seem to have a great deal on your mind this evening baker and now arthurs late wife i dont see how you could have known either one of them as a tangent to inspector blevinss efforts to investigate walshs role in father jamess death ive been looking into the priests background and interests he did know virginia sedgwick im told can i offer you something to drink tea a little sherry for you miss trent they politely declined virginia was sweetnatured and she had half of norfolk at her feet father james was no exception as i remember sedgwick smiled indulgently she seemed to feel comfortable with older men baker myself the priest was quite anxious about her when she disappeared sedgwick crossed his legs and flicked a small bit of mud off his shoe yes his support meant more than we can say a great kindness that was as soon as wed learned what happened to her i sent him word as i understand it she sailed on titanic rutledge said it was some time before we realized that she was among the victims it came as quite a shock his voice was heavy shed had a quarrel with arthur you know one of those things that happen in any marriage apparently she took it to heart when she told him she wanted to go home he told her not to be ridiculous expecting it to blow over tragically she left anyway her body was never recovered sadly she wasnt identified when the bodies were brought in we didnt know you see that shed even sailed not until after the fact arthur was the one i worried abouthe was frantic when the police failed to find any trace we worked through private sources and in the end arthur went straight to ireland id have accompanied him if id realized he was going to be subjected to those pathetic photographs of the deadimagine if you will trying to see a resemblance to someone you loved but money has its uses in the end she came home to us so many of the dead couldnt be identified it wasrather horrible to think about them he set down his drink unfinished for a time i was afraid id lose my son as well ive tried for five years now to persuade him to put her death behind him and marry again he wont hear of it theres another school of thought rutledge said quietly that she never sailed at all that somewhere between her home in yorkshire and kings lynn where she intended to plan a party she was murdered sedgwick sat forward his face a picture of dismay good god man where did you hear that wild tale she was recognized in kings lynn no she was seen a woman in a veiled hat it could have been anyone remembering iris kenneths parting words rutledge improvised it could even have been a hired impostor a shopkeeper might be pleased to say your family patronized his business whether you did or not but no one who knew her well ever came forward sedgwick looked over rutledges head he said quietly youd better fetch your brother edwin rutledge turned to find edwin sedgwick just walking out of the room behind him hamish asked how much did he hear enough rutledge answered i expected one of them to be listening in a moment or two edwin returned with his elder brother the family resemblance between them strong although arthur was still quite thin and walked with a distinctly stiff back as if he wore a brace tonight he came in and sat down gingerly as sedgwick made the introductions you ought to hear this arthur he concluded rutledge said this isnt my fancy lord sedgwick and then to arthur he began mildly someone in this family paid for the care of herbert bakers ill wife and he was deeply indebted to you i can prove that and you used him in return after a fashion i can prove that as well in the early spring of you sent him to yorkshire to fetch mrs sedgwick for a journey to east sherham she enjoyed being driven by baker i think with his oldfashioned manners he didnt know that he was going to be a witness to a staged event her disappearance whatever it was that happened he was led to believe it was what she wanted and so he agreed but he was rather a simple man and it went against his conscience to wreck a marriage he got drunk when he was supposed to be waiting for mrs sedgwick to return from her marketing he knew she wasnt going to be meeting him we can prove that as well arthur sedgwick nodded youve got your facts straight actually its the interpretation thats wrong virginia did want to help bakers ill wife and the bank can show you the letter she wrote asking for sums to be made available anonymously and weve believed from the beginning that she cajoled baker into turning his back while she made good her escape we couldnt blame himhe punished himself enough as it was hamish said a jury would believe this man it was true but it wasnt a jury that rutledge wanted to reach just now the only wrong assumption that baker made in this affair rutledge told arthur was believing that your wife was the instigator of these arrangements youd been planning her death since the november before hadnt you and quite cleverly when virginia sedgwick vanished baker was hamstrung his own wife was still in the sanitarium and he refused to put her at risk by asking questions after that one bout of drunkenness he lived an exemplary life until he died of natural causes yes we went to the services sedgwick put in noblesse oblige which brings me to the services for virginia mrs sedgwick i can order the exhumation of her coffin you see to discover if theres a corpse inside but i rather think its empty when titanic went down it provided the most unexpected windfalla marvelous explanation for the disappearance of your wife youre right money has its uses including bribing london clerks and irish gravediggers no one would ask a griefstricken family for proof and if a coffin silenced father james and herbert baker who meant well but were persistent in asking for news then it must have been worth every penny the scandal of a possible runaway wife allowed you to use great discretion in suppressing the whole story lord sedgwick started to speak but arthur waved him to silence he said in a strained voice its bad enough to lose my wife the way i did inspector i dont understand why youre tormenting us rutledge coldly replied my guess is that somewhere on that long drive baker simply walked away from the motorcar for half an hour what did you promise virginia to entice her to come with you a surprise a new pony a trip on a boat youd borrowed from your brother if we search the marshes will we find her rotted bones edwin and his father had listened to the account with tight faces expressing anger and disbelief but theyd support arthur whatever hed done guilty or not he was their flesh and blood surprisingly they didnt defend him hamish said if it was a lie youd ha been booted out ten minutes ago but arthur canna afford to have that coffin exhumed a flush had risen in arthurs face perhaps if baker had met her at the hotel at the hour hed promised she wouldnt have taken it in her head to show she could fend for herself and as for titanic you dont know what youre talking about he got up from his chair and moved about the room rigidly at first and then with more ease as the muscles in his back stretched he was plausible his voice and his manner carrying indignation and a sense of injustice nicely blended but was it real rutledge couldnt tell just as he refused to submit to the pain in his back arthur sedgwick refused to be intimidated hamish said he canna be shaken arthur walked to the rainwet window peering out at the dark gardens his back to the room his father and brother waited for him to speak again and rutledge remembered something that sedgwick had told him about his elder sonthe watchers of time had given the boy nightmares when arthur said nothing else sedgwick cleared his throat inspector i think you ought to leave miss trent we apologize for this distressful business you shouldnt have been subjected to it hamish spoke swiftly and rutledge shifted in his chair to look at edwin edwins eyes were still on his brother as rutledge had noted once before on the quay in osterley they were as cold as the winter sea edwin was the physically stronger now and harder he had made no effort to come to his brothers defense and it had become a telling silence his intuition alive and working rutledge suddenly realized why a jealousy lay like acid under the skin of the second son it had nothing to do with virginia sedgwicks death the title would go to arthur not edwin rutledge was on the point of continuing when may trent spoke for the first time but it isnt true she said with conviction to the room at large that the inspector doesnt know what hes talking about and it isnt true that your wife was on board titanic mr sedgwick because i was you see and id have met her father james made a study of the ship thats how he found me the logs on the hearth crackled and sent sparks flying but no one noticed a gust of rain rattled against the windows may trent waited rutledge forced himself not to look at her but lord sedgwick and edwin were staring at her with an almost malevolent expression as if she had called them liars and she had my dear lady sedgwick said virginia was a wretched sailorits very doubtful that she ever left her stateroom may trent answered but id have known that too women gossip on shipboard lord sedgwick just as they do at a garden party we knew who was assigned to our table to our lifeboat stations who was available for bridge who had been confined to bed her name wasnt there she looked at arthur and her face wisted with disgust how could you callously use that tragedy for your own ends i find it appalling arthurs mouth tensed but he said nothing his reflection in the dark glass of the french doors was a study in control yet his hands locked behind his back clenched until the knuckles were white rutledge turned to lord sedgwick and as herbert baker lay dying he couldnt face the prospect that he was taking with him the one bit of knowledge that might clear up the mystery of what really happened to your daughterinlaw trying to set his soul in order he sent for father james not because he was a priest but because this man cared as much about virginia sedgwicks fate as baker had the one man in osterley who could be counted on to use the information wisely and thats why father james had to diethere was no way of knowing whether what baker confided to the priest was under the seal of confession or had been told man to man with a simple promise binding the priest there was the shock of truth in lord sedgwicks face now arthur and edwin swung around to look at their father and he gave them no sign rutledge frowned at arthur i was convinced you killed father james i was coming here to break the news to your father until today when i discovered two witnesses who placed not you but your father at the rectory that night and i realized then that hed been the killer facing sedgwick he said intent on angering the man it was quite clever to empty the tin box to leave a false trail certainly inspector blevins was convinced by it you have a flair for planning murder lord sedgwick met rutledges eyes with arrogance it doesnt matter if you have a dozen witnesses i think its time you left this house there was an uneasy moment in the room edwin leaning over the back of a chair his hands lightly gripping the wood frame was watching the fire arthur started toward a chair and then changed his mind toying with the photographs on the table hamish said watch your back indeed there was an odd intensity in their postures these three men had spent a lifetime with no leavening to counteract the ferocious ambition that had driven them since the day they were born it was what their character was all about the paramount importance of a goal set in the first generation rutledge rose as if preparing to leave he wasnt comfortable sitting any longer he said to sedgwick when walsh escaped you sent your sons to search for him and then borrowed old tom randals mare and went after him yourself you found him because you know the land around here better than anyone elseyoud grown up on it with an old sheepman training your eye and you killed walshwith a hammeror the shoe honey had cast using it with a polo swing and the full weight of the galloping horse behind your arm and the sedgwick luck heldyou caught him just right the police inquiry into the death of a priest was closed dont be ridiculous how could i have got to this randals farm without my motorcar being seen as i drove through osterley besides arthur was using it in the search and theres my gout sedgwick was on his feet if you wont leave of your own accord ill have my sons throw you out i wont stand for this in my own house yes youve taken every opportunity to remind me of your gout your son edwin rides arthurs motorcycle i wouldnt be surprised if you do as well he turned to the sons if you try to cover up what your father has done if you refuse to help me youll be tarred by the same brush it will be the end of your family he read cold calculation in hard eyes an uncompromising facade of unity they were ranged between him and the door a solid phalanx of enmity hamish warned its no what you think rutledge felt shock like cold water thrown in his face how could he have got it so wrong he said may will you wait for me in the car please ill be out in five minutes his voice was pleasant but there was command in it she started to protest then stood up the atmosphere had changed subtly and his order had frightened her if you dont come ill drive back to town shall i yes by all means she nodded and walked into the hall drawing her coat back around her shoulders they could hear the outer door openand then shut behind her rutledge walked to the windows and stood there with his back to them he could feel the draft coming through the glass cold and damp it felt like hope i was wrong he said into the waiting silence i realize my mistake now sedgwick said you wont be able to pursue this and your career will be destroyed i have that power you know i do if you leave now ill undertake to guarantee that your silence will protect that young woman who just left you would be wise to heed me rutledge said wearily arthur killed his wife didnt he and you lord sedgwick killed father james but it was edwin who killed walsh arthurs back wont allow him to ride that strenuously and you were busy ordering your staff to search the house and grounds the outbuildings and the sheepfolds he paused hed blended conjecture and experience and intuition in a unholy weave of truth but he didnt want to hear the answer to his last question in gods name why she was a pretty ninny who charmed the men around her lord sedgwick replied but couldnt hold a fiveminute conversation with anyone much less conduct a household properly she had the attention span of a tenyearold she had no idea that she could conceive a child just as halfwitted as she was he shook his head her mother swore to arthur after the wedding that shed had a fever as a child i discovered later that there had been a cousin and an aunt who were also mentally deficient it was a trick from the start and arthur here thought hed discovered guinevere sedgwicks voice was sour with anger do you have any idea what its like living every day of every year with someone as stupid as she was the endless repetitions the tantrums the constant refrain of but why cant i as if god had given her the keys to the bloody universe edwin or i kept an eye on her when arthur was abroad but even that was getting to be difficult arthur drew the short straw as it were hed married her after all we never asked how or where it happened and said edwin for the first time baker didnt know either only that she wouldnt be going all the way the day we buried that damned empty coffin he promised my father hed never speak of what happened we expected him to carry whatever he thought he knew to his grave instead he made himself the laughingstock of osterley when he died shriven by two clergymen too many people began to wonder why rutledge said his mind working at speed when you were playing night games outside the vicarage windows to keep sims silent did you see walsh dragging his chains to the garden shed why should i frighten sims edwin demanded i reserved that for holston who knew father james too well it was very likely peter henderson who hung about the vicarage not me but yes i was coming back from cley on my motorcycle when i saw walsh hurrying toward the church he glanced at his watch your time is up it doesnt matter to us what you do with the knowledge you have the risk is yours your medical history might be of interest in certain quarters and prospects for publication of miss trents manuscript may be unexpectedly limited what else lurks in your future is of course unforeseeable i spent four years in the trenches rutledge answered contemptuously i daresay i shall survive the sedgwick family id set my house in order if i were you he turned to look one last time through the rainstreaked panes of the french doors and across the wet lawns of the lovely unseen gardens then he walked unmolested between edwin and arthur and over the threshold chapter but it was on the threshold that rutledge stopped facing the elegant room and its three occupants let me remind you gentlemen that there are many ways that a man can be judged i leave you to the tender mercies of the watchers out there in the dark when you begin to feel themand you willyoull start to turn on each other it will happen its only a matter of time a stolid wall of baneful resistance met him sedgwick was flushed now a look of frustration and malevolence in his face arthur was resigned his eyes on the carpet but there was no remorse in his stance edwin first looking from his father to his brother turned on rutledge a hungry glance he was already bringing to bear a formidable determination for an instant rutledge thought edwin might be the first to break ranks but the moment passed rutledge leaned against the closed door feeling the cool rain breathing in the damp heavy air it wasnt finished yet concerted murder it was as monsignor holston had claimed violent and primeval this family cared for nothing but their power their will it had made them implacable coldblooded virginia sedgwick had been doomed from the day her husband discovered hed been deceived her family was to blame toofor their selfishness in pushing a bewildered child into the ranks of consuela vanderbilt and jennie randolph a fortune traded for a title nevermind happiness hamish said of the night i didna think they would let you go rutledge answered they havent they just didnt want to dirty the carpets a voice out of the rain called tentatively inspector rutledge he had forgotten that may trent was waiting in the motorcar he found her shivering in her coat im so very glad to see you she exclaimed its been more than five minutes i thought you werent coming at all i was safe enough she laughed nervously its been frightful out here in the dark ive seen and heard all kinds of things mostly my overworked imagination but thats small comfort he turned the crank and when he took his place beside her behind the wheel she said wheres peter we arent going to leave him are we its a long wet walk back to osterley actually he was outside the french windows just beyond the terrace he knows where to meet me he waited the rain dripped from the trees as the wind stirred them and somewhere they could hear what sounded like a woman crying it was a peacock out on the grounds but may trent caught his arm im frightened more frightened than i was in there you shouldnt be that was a very brave thing to do in there facing your demons in front of the sedgwicks i didnt face any demons i lied for father jamess sake she confessed listening to what was being said i suddenly realized what it was that hed actually expected me to remember i did it for him i think hed already guessed that she wasnt on board she couldnt have been could she if she was already dead father james had talked to herbert baker by that time and he was nearly sure but he hoped i could give him proof rutledge took out his watch but couldnt see the face in the darkness shouldnt we return to osterley soon its barely been a quarter of an hour give it a little longer give what a little longer she said her gloved hands snuggled into her coat pockets for warmth im not sure it was nearly fortyfive minutes later when hamish behind him heard something rutledge stiffened straining to catch the direction of the footfalls then peter henderson walked swiftly around the corner of the house and climbed into the rear seat hes coming henderson said whos coming may trent asked its edwin youre waiting for isnt it still they waited and then the door of the house opened on a long rectangle of light that seemed to reach toward them a man stepped out into the silvery path it made across the wet slate walk he seemed relieved to find rutledge there he came to stand beside the motorcar looking in at rutledge the rain falling harder now like tears on his face it was arthur sedgwick he handed rutledge the umbrella hed left by the door i dont want to hang he said after a moment but im the one wholl die next one way or another my spine is wrecked i wont live to old age ill never father a child edwin wont wait very long for the title he wants it too badly he has for as far back as i can remember and my father grieves for a man who raced like the wind and never thought twice about danger and dying thats gone too rutledge said nothing arthur sedgwick said can you protect me if i agree to testify against them i can try they tried to persuade me for the good of the family to take a pistol to my head driven by despair over my back hush it up inspector blevins doesnt want walsh resurrected he wouldnt dare to point a finger at us my death would be a nine day wonder and then fade away he walked around the front of the motorcar and joined henderson in the rear seat rutledge turned on the headlamps the occupants of the car were ghostly in the reflected glow after the pitchblack of the night as rutledge turned the wheel and started down the drive arthur said ive always hated those damned baboons in the garden they stare at me as if they can look through the flesh and blood into my very soul i could see them tonight watching i always know theyre there id promised myself that when i inherited the title id destroy that damned stone but my father has always had some sort of superstitious regard for it like the chastains did they reached the gates and drove through may trent asked rutledge as if it had suddenly occurred to her but whats going to happen now youll see i wish youd stayed in osterley you wouldnt have been dragged through this it was not your choice she replied it was mine id let father james down once rutledge pulled off the road in a wide patch of brush the stiff dry fingers scratching against the paint a shower of raindrops dislodged from the branches sprinkling down on the car then he drove deeper into the thickest shadows and switched off his headlamps be very quiet in a few minutes a motorcar came flying down the road from the direction of the sedgwick gates roaring past them like a thunderbolt it disappeared into the darkness from what rutledge could tell there were two people in the front arthur sedgwick said theyre hunting for me already there was a mixture of resignation and despair in his voice there are weapons in the house shotguns rutledge said no theyre hunting me but your turn will come where is your wife buried in the marshes i killed her but i couldnt bear to bury her there edwin did it for me he goes out there in the boat from time to time to be sure shes still there beside rutledge may trent gasped after a moment rutledge said sedgwick were taking you straight to norwich henderson as soon as we reach osterley id like you to find monsignor holston at the hotel and tell him to come to holy trinity well meet him there by the church ask mrs barnett if you will to send my luggage on to london and miss trents as well then go to the vicarage and stay there out of sight will you do that henderson agreed and thank you rutledge added for tonights help there was unexpected pride in peter hendersons voice my pleasure and ill keep my mouth shut you can be sure he slipped out to crank the engine they waited by the church its towers high and black against the sky arthur sedgwick was morosely silent rutledge tense and watchful the bark of a fox was sharp and close may trent said quietly are you sure this is the right thing to do theres no choice the yard has to make this arrest if i leave it to blevins hell lose another prisoner arthur sedgwick will be safest in norwich rain was falling hard again by the time a very wet and somber monsignor holston climbed into the seat peter henderson had vacated not ten minutes before youd better get out of here the priest warned as fast as you can edwin is searching the town peter told me a little of what has happened hes already gone to ground theyll never know he was protecting your back outside their windows tonight hell be safe enough the motor rumbling quietly in the darkness picked up a stronger note and the motorcar drove down trinity lane to the main road and headed east for the turning to norwich but it was a very long time before rutledge stopped listening for the echo of another vehicle behind him
