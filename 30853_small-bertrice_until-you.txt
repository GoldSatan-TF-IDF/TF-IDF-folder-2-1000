bertrice small until you the second book in the friarsgate inheritance series for pat of seaaire limo and car service in mattituck ny a longtime reader who gets me where i need to go on time thanks pat prologue the border december you are absolutely mad sir thomas bolton said to his cousin rosamund as they rode across the border into scotland it was a cold but clear day why she demanded because for once in my life i would do the unthinkable and dare to be the one to choose i am tired of being told who i shall marry and tis always for someone elses benefit not necessarily mine i was fortunate in hugh and again in owein but next time i dare not take the chance i want to make my own decisions from now on and i intend to dear tom besides i am not particularly interested in being someones wife again i have been a wife one way or another since i was three years of age i am yet young and i want to visit king james court quite unencumbered by a husband perhaps i shall take a lover you are surely planning some mischief dear girl and if you are you simply must share it with me he told her with a wicked grin oh tom she laughed please dont ever leave me i do not know what i should do without you you are my best friend in all of this world now wench dont go getting sentimental on me he replied but he was smiling for he loved his young cousin every bit as much as she loved him his much younger sister had been like rosamund and how lonely he had been when she died in childbirth and her child with her and then thanks to the queen he had found rosamund the heiress to the major branch of his family she could never take his sisters place but she had made her own place in his heart do you think logan hepburn will be too upset when he discovers i am not at friarsgate rosamund wondered aloud you still question his sincerity then her companion said rosamund sighed i probably should not but aye i yet do at least in part i have never before been sought after just because i am me if he really wants me he will take my sensibilities into account and be patient besides when edmund tells him where we have gone he will certainly come hotfooting it to edinburgh or wherever the court is located at the time but by then i should be well into the round of christmas revels and there will be other men to pay me court logan hepburn will have to do more than tell me that he has loved me since i was a child and it is now his turn to be my husband he does not really love me he lusts after me that is all she concluded sir thomas bolton chuckled i can foresee that the next few months with you are going to be most interesting dear girl until now dear tom i have lived a most circumspect life rosamund replied i have done what was expected of me what i was told to do what i knew was right what i knew i had to do now however i mean to do what i want to do and i want to do something different something exciting something that would never be expected of me oh my her cousin said softly looking at rosamund with new eyes you are i fear in a dangerous mood sweet coz you are obviously ready to kick over the traces that have constrained you for your whole life just be cautious i beg of you caution dear tom was for the old rosamund the new rosamund wants more out of life now and when i have had it i shall return to friarsgate to my daughters and aye probably even to logan hepburn if he will still have me tom shook his head but then he looked up and smiled at her i shall be by your side if you wish it dear cousin no matter the danger you will probably get us into i understand these scots lords are very different from we english more savage and reckless i have heard so meg has written me and in doing so she has quite piqued my interest rosamund responded with a little grin has she indeed he answered and then he grinned back at her well dear girl it sounds as if we just might have a little bit of fun eh if he noted dryly seeing the first few flakes of snow beginning to fall we dont freeze to death before we get to edinburgh shivering he pulled up the collar of his cape it should not be much farther to lord greys home rosamund said and then she pointed look on the next hill that is our destination for tonight then for pitys sake let us ride faster tom said he turned to the captain of their escort is it possible dear sir to move more quickly lest i turn into a block of ice aye the captain said slowly his tone clearly scornful of this english milord but then he raised his gloved hand and signaled their troop forward at a much quicker pace rather surprised that his two charges kept up with them quite well come dear girl sir thomas called to his cousin rosamund we are in scotland and adventure awaits us chapter who is she patrick leslie the first earl of glenkirk asked his friend lord grey who is who the woman who sits on the footstool at the queens right side the earl answered his friend ahh lord grey said understanding at last the lady with the auburn hair in the green gown she is the queens childhood friend the lady of friarsgate come from england at the queens invitation she is lovely isnt she she spent a night at my home on her way to court but i was not there of course i would meet her the earl said what lord grey chuckled you have shown no interest in a respectable woman in over twenty years patrick and you could be her father he teased fortunately i am not her father the earl replied a faint smile touching his lips can you introduce us andrew i have not yet myself been introduced lord grey said it was the christmas season the two men stood among the crush of king james ivs court in the great hall of stirling castle the hall had been built by the kings late father james iii it had a hammerbeamed roof large heraldic stainedglass windows and five great fireplaces above the fireplace that was behind the high board where the king sat hung his embroidered cloth of estate the interior of the great hall was painted a rich lime yellow called kings gold the court of king james iv of scotland was a very cosmopolitan one at least six different languages could be heard spoken among the guests the king was an educated man with eclectic tastes he could speak on the most modern sciences and theories architecture poetry and history he was urbane and had great charm and as well liked as he was by those who peopled his court he was beloved of the common man as well the earl of glenkirk stared again at the auburnhaired young woman andrew grey was correct it had been years since he was last attracted to a woman like the lady of friarsgate he had been widowed for twentyeight years and when he had lost his wife agnes he had vowed never again to kill a woman with the bearing of his children oh he had enjoyed his share of mistresses but they had been mostly for the release of his lustthough some of his mistresses had been his friends as well they had all been women considered of low estate not women from respectable families who a man paid court to or married his boyhood mistress meg mackay had borne his daughter janet and his wife agnes cummings had given him his only son the earl of glenkirk sighed remembering these two women never since their untimely deaths had he looked at another woman as he was now looking at the lady of friarsgate the very sight of her stirred something in his heart he had long thought immune to such tender emotions was he being a fool you really want to meet her andrew greys soft voice pierced the earls thoughts i know one of the queens ladies elsbeth hume i could speak to her do it the earl of glenkirk said now if you can gods foot patrick lord grey said i cannot remember the last time you were so eager over a wench he chuckled very well come along and let us find elsbeth they moved through the crowded hall until finally the lady they sought was found she was a pretty girl with black hair and dancing blue eyes lord grey moved next to her and slid an arm about the ladys waist elsbeth you adorable and fascinating lass i have a favor to ask of you my pet mistress hume turned to look up at lord grey her blue eyes twinkling and just what is it you seek of me my lord and what will you give me in return for this favor she purred her cherryred lips pursed questioningly lord grey quickly kissed the offered lips and replied my friend the earl of glenkirk wishes a proper introduction to the queens english friend the lady of friarsgate can you aid him elsbeth hume turned and smiled up at patrick leslie i can my lord rosamund bolton is a most delightful lady there is naught highflown about her as there is with most of these english who come to our court from the look in your eyes i expect you would meet the lady sooner than later eh she smiled mischievously at him i would mistress hume the earl of glenkirk replied with an answering smile come then and i will present you your intentions will be as honorable as any man at this court i expect the lady however is no fool and she can defend herself mistress hume said be warned my lord more than one gentleman has felt the sting of her outrage when he exhibited bad behavior before her she moved across the hall with lord grey and the earl of glenkirk following behind her reaching the throne where the queen sat elsbeth hume curtsied low and said your majesty the earl of glenkirk would pay his respects to the lady of friarsgate may i have your permission to introduce them margaret tudor queen of scotland smiled at patrick leslie and andrew grey you have our permission she said wondering what it was the earl could possibly want we have not met my lord earl you have not been at court in my time here have you patrick bowed with an elegant flourish he might have been a highlander but he remembered his manners i have not your highness he replied what has brought you back to the court then she queried his majestys personal request madame although he has not yet seen fit to share his wishes with me the earl said but whatever it was patrick considered it was important to james stewart or he would not have sent for the earl of glenkirk the king knew how this earl felt about his court or any other court for that matter he did not share these thoughts with the queen however how intriguing the queen said i shall have to ask jamie about this mystery you have provided me with my lord then she smiled at the earl you have our permission to make the acquaintance of our dearest friend the lady of friarsgate beth you will make the introductions then the queen turned away her curiosity satisfied for the moment and her attention engaged elsewhere now lady rosamund bolton patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk and my friend lord andrew grey elsbeth hume said making the introductions rosamund held out her hand to be kissed and her gaze met those of the two gentlemen lord grey took her hand saluted it and murmured lady bolton but when rosamunds amber eyes met those of the earl of glenkirk she was overcome with shock the green eyes locked on to hers and he was not a stranger she had known him forever and yet she had never before this day seen the man she struggled to maintain control over herself while the most disturbing images bloomed in her head and when his lips touched the back of her hand rosamund felt as if she had been scorched by a bolt of lightning madame he said his big hand yet holding hers his voice was deep my lord she managed to say she felt as if they were a single entity her voice was soft it was patently obvious to their two companions that something extraordinary had just happened and though neither lord grey nor elsbeth hume understood they moved away discreetly leaving rosamund and the earl of glenkirk alone patrick tucked the small hand still in his possession into the crook of his arm saying as he did so let us stroll madame and we will tell each other of ourselves there is naught to tell rosamund began she felt better now that they were speaking than she had in the odd silence that had enwrapped them previously you are english he said but not from the south for i understand you too well she smiled now my home is in cumbria my lord and how did a lass from cumbria come to be margaret tudors friend a good enough friend to be invited to king james court he asked he shortened his steps to match hers for he was very tall and she while not as small as the queen was petite when my second husband died he put me into the care of king henry not he now upon englands throne but his father rosamund explained i was just thirteen at thirteen you had outlived two husbands madame are you so dangerous then he asked and she heard the humor in his voice i am twentytwo now my lord and have buried three husbands she teased him he laughed aloud you have children then it was a statement three daughters philippa banon and elizabeth rosamund answered they were born to me and my third husband sir owein meredith i was wed first at the age of three to a cousin who perished when i was five i was married again at the age of six to sir hugh cabot an elderly knight chosen by my uncle who wished to retain control over friarsgate hugh however taught me how to be independent and cleverly thwarted my uncle henry by placing me into the custody of the king when he died my uncle was furious for he sought to wed me to his second son who was but five it was the kings mother the venerable margaret and your queen margaret tudor who chose my third husband for me owein was a good man and we were content together how did he die the earl of glenkirk asked her owein loved friarsgate every bit as much as if he had been born and bred there he had a peculiar habit of climbing to the top of each tree in the orchards come harvest so that no fruit was wasted no one else had ever done it usually that fruit was left to rot or to fall and be scavenged by the deer but he would not have it he thought it wasteful he fell from the top of one of those trees and broke his neck a branch gave way she sighed i had lost our only son several months before i lost my wife in childbed but my son survived he told her he is now a grown man with a wife of his own he was your only child she asked i had a daughter he replied shortly and his tone indicated he did not at this time choose to discuss it further they had reached the end of the great hall let us go out and view the night sky he suggested it is very clear and the stars are always their brightest over stirling on a winters night we have no capes she answered but she very much wanted to go the earl of glenkirk snapped his fingers at a passing servant the man stopped yes my lord two warm cloaks for the lady and for me the earl ordered at once my lord if you will wait here the servant responded and he hurried off they stood silently until he returned a few moments later with the required garments the earl of glenkirk took a long nutbrown wool cape lined in warm marten and draped it over rosamunds shoulders he moved around before her and carefully fastened each of the polished brass frogs that closed the garb tightly then he gently drew up the furlined hood each time their eyes met rosamund had this incredible sense of dйjа vu there he said and then turning took the other cloak from the servant when he had dressed himself he thanked the servant and took rosamunds hand to lead her outside into the winter gardens it was very cold but the air was still above them the night sky was ebony in color and dotted with stars that twinkled crystal blue and red they walked in silence until the lights of the castle were but glittering gold points and they could no longer hear the murmur of the many voices within the hall then suddenly he stopped he turned her so that she was facing him pushing back the hood of her garment taking her small face within the enclosure of his two big hands rosamunds heart began to hammer with her excitement each time their eyes met it was as if this very moment had happened before she could not for the life of her look away from him and when his dark head slowly descended his lips brushing gently over hers several times as if tasting her it was she who cupped his head in her palms and drew him down to kiss him hungrily she shuddered as their mouths met that first time or was it for the first time finally he drew away saying as he did i am hardly a young man madame i know she replied i have seen a half century he answered i could be your father but you are not my father my lord rosamund told him you are older than owein meredith but younger than hugh cabot we are drawn to each other although i do not know why or how this is i know that you feel it too for i have seen it in your eyes she reached out and gently caressed his cheek so here we are my lord earl and what are we to do will you believe me when i tell you that i have never before felt with a woman as i do with you madame my name is rosamund she told him nodding and like you i have never felt quite this way before my lord my name is patrick he answered are we bewitched patrick she asked him by whom or what he wondered aloud she shook her head i do not know i am new here and know few as am i he replied i have not been to court since i returned to scotland from san lorenzo many years ago san lorenzo she looked puzzled it is a small duchy on the mediterranean sea i was sent as the kings first ambassador to set up a friendly port where our trading vessels might find safety water and supplies the earl explained then you have traveled patrick i have never wanted to travel for i love my home i always hated going to court but now suddenly i am ripe for adventure she smiled mischievously and his heart contracted almost painfully he reached out again and enfolded her in his embrace i want to make love to you he said softly he kissed her slowly his mouth demanding yet gentle i cannot believe i would be so damned bold with someone i have only just met and yet i feel as if we have known each other forever and you feel it too rosamund i saw the surprise of recognition in your eyes earlier i do not understand it and yet it is happening i know she agreed i do not know what to do do you should we follow our instincts or should we decide this is some madness and part from each other you must decide for us patrick for i am much too afraid to do so and i have never before been a coward when facing life neither have i he said so despite what common sense would tell us my fair rosamund let us follow our instincts and see where they will lead us he kissed her again are you ready for the journey my familys motto is tracez votre cheminmake your own path if we are to follow our instincts my lord then that is exactly what i shall do she told him looking up into his handsome face he did not look to her as if he had lived a half century even if there were small lines about his eyes and looking into those eyes she once again felt an overwhelming sensation of giddy excitement so dear cousin this is where you have gotten to a familiar voice broke into her thoughts into the privacy of their new world and who dear rosamund is this gentleman who would drag you out into the cold night gods foot i am frozen just seeking you dear girl she laughed as his voice brought her back to reality this my lord of glenkirk is my cousin thomas bolton lord cambridge he escorted me from friarsgate and is he assures me enjoying himself immensely having never believed the scots could be so civilized he says patrick knew immediately what thomas bolton was and the irritating jealously he had felt at the arrival of the other man drained away he smiled and held out his big hand to shake that of rosamunds cousin i saw her well protected before i brought her out my lord the sky above however is well worth it the earl drew up rosamunds hood again in a tender gesture we should nonetheless return to the hall so you find us civilized do you he chuckled aye tom agreed your court is much more open and less pretentious than our good king henrys court perhaps it is his spanish queen who requires such formality your king however keeps a merry company about him and habits here are far more relaxed i am quite enjoying myself and i am tempted to purchase a house in edinburgh and here in stirling would not your king object the earl queried nay i am not important to henry tudor i am simply a rich man whose wealth comes from trade and whose title comes from the guilty conscience of a longdead king tom said with a chortle i am not considered important enough to be bothered with but for my connection with rosamund tom her voice held a warning note i have no importance in the english court but that i helped our good queen in her time of need once poor spanish kate he responded and then he turned to the earl of glenkirk there she was dear creature widowed by one tudor and considered for another but that her father would not pay all her dowry the old king was hardly noted for his generosity and would scarce support her her attendants were shipped home but for a few who would not leave her wise creatures they were they suffered for it though they were all in rags and halfstarved with the old king blowing hot and cold on the marriage and then rosamund learned of it spanish kate had been her companion along with princess margaret when rosamund lived at court my goodhearted cousin sent little purses to she who is now englands queen they were much for her but barely enough for the poor princess to keep herself and her few ladies for several weeks it was gallant of her to do such a thing and in the end she was rewarded when spanish kate finally became englands queen my cousin stands in the queens favor my lord the queen believed she owed me a debt which she did not but has now been more than repaid rosamund said quietly you are most voluble tonight cousin i was concerned when i could not find you anywhere in the hall dear girl he answered her smoothly and what brought you out into the cold night the earl inquired amused i overheard one of the queens ladies saying she had introduced the lady of friarsgate to the earl of glenkirk and they had left the hall together he replied you cannot deny me my curiosity and there are others in the kings hall equally as fascinated i understand my lord that you have not been to court in many years i do not enjoy the court with its gossip and intrigue the earl of glenkirk said pointedly but i am a loyal servant to jamie stewart and when he calls i come not another word tom rosamund scolded her cousin and before you even ask he does not know yet why he was summoned rosamund i am crushed dear girl that you would think me a common gossip lord cambridge said dramatically his hand going to his heart you could certainly never be called a common gossip tom she replied wickedly patrick laughed my lord when i learn of why i have been sent for i assure you it will not be long before the entire court learns of it i admit to being curious myself for the king knows i am not a man of the court and that i am content to remain on my lands at glenkirk but he also knows my son is there to oversee our estates in my absence you have a wife then my lord tom asked i am a widower my lord the earl replied or i should not have approached your cousin rosamund i am pleased to see what a gallant protector she has in you lord cambridge nodded slowly rosamund is dear to my heart my lord she and her daughters are my only living family i should not like to see her hurt you understand of course the earl of glenkirk said quietly dearest tom i cannot explain to you what has happened rosamund began for i do not even comprehend it myself but we have always trusted each other you must believe me when i tell you that whatever is to be between myself and patrick it will be all right she turned to the earl will it not my lord aye he said amazed to realize that he actually believed it she did not know what was happening between them well neither did he he had walked into the great hall of stirling castle this evening and seen this young woman for the first time and yet something within him had refused to believe it was the first time and speaking with her he felt that he had known her forever and he instinctively knew that she felt exactly the same way tom could feel the magic that surrounded the pair and it startled him what sorcery was this he wondered and yet there was nothing dark in it at all but at the same time he could feel himself almost fading into the background as the intensity between them began to grow once more i will bid you both good night then he said as they reentered the castle then he hurried back to the great hall to consider just what was happening he needed to get away from his cousin and the earl of glenkirk if he were to think clearly for the atmosphere surrounding them was simply too deep and too ardent and it was most disquieting as well do you reside within the castle rosamund asked patrick as they watched tom disappear he nodded i have been given a chamber for myself as i am a guest of his majesty he told her and you as the queens invited guest i have been given a chamber as well for myself and my servant annie she told him we will go to my hideyhole then madame as i have no servant to dispossess he told her if your annie is seen spending the night in another place there will be gossip i am not of a mind to share what is between us at the moment are you nay she agreed whatever this magic is i want to keep it for ourselves patrick for the first time in my life i am being selfish but i dont care then she slipped her hand back into his and followed him as he led her down several corridors and finally up a flight of stairs he opened an oak door ushering her into a simple room with but two pieces of furniture a bed and a stool there was no fireplace and the room was cold there were wood shutters drawn across the single window but no curtains it was spare but they were unlikely to be disturbed he laid his cloak upon the stool then gently unbuttoned the frogs fastening her outdoor garment and removing it put it with his own taking her face in his hands he smiled down into her eyes this is not fine enough for you he told her then he found the candle and lit it before closing the door behind them and turning the key in the lock kiss me she responded softly with a sigh he complied his chill lips warming atop hers rosamund slid her arms about his neck drawing him closer her full breasts pressed against the velvet that covered his chest their kisses blended one into another until her mouth ached finally she drew her head away from his saying as she did i can but hope you are a good ladys maid my lord he laughed softly it has been many years since i have undone such finery rosamund but i hope i may remember patrick told her then he turned her about and began to unlace her bodice while placing small kisses upon the back of her neck she smelled fresh and of a scent he recognized as white heather he put the elegant little bodice atop the pile of cloaks next he unknotted the drawstring holding her skirt up and let the heavy material drop to the wood floor then he lifted her from the velvet heap setting her back upon the floor now what is that thing you have fastened about you he demanded puzzled rosamund giggled tis called a shakefold and it is used to plump my skirts out in a fashionable manner she explained it looks dangerous he said can you get the damned thing off without me she unfastened the shakefold and stepped from it kicked it over to the stool where her other garments were piled then she added her flannel petticoats sit on the edge of the bed and i will remove your stocking for you he said rosamund sat watching him as he first removed each of her squaretoed leather shoes and then set about unrolling her wool stockings when her feet were finally free she wiggled her toes in an attempt to get some warmth back into them get beneath the coverlet he said and then he turned away to undress himself she watched him in the pale flickering light of the single candle he had lived a half century he had said yet his body was hard and firm he was obviously not a man who was idle or lazy his buttocks were tight and his hairy legs long his back was broad and he was very fair of skin entirely naked he turned about to enter the bed and she caught a glimpse of his manhood at rest it was large and she shivered with anticipation then blushed with her own lustful thoughts what was she doing here in bed with a stranger and yet it was right he drew her into his arms his fingers undoing the ribbons that held her chemise closed when the delicate fabric spread itself open he looked upon rosamunds breasts and then his dark head bent he rubbed his face against the perfumed skin gaining the most intense pleasure as he did so she shivered and held his head against her bosom enjoying the act every bit as much as he was i have never she began i know he said understanding instinctively what she was trying to say he raised his head to look into her face i have conceived little of what has happened between us tonight rosamund all i know is that you and i are meant to be together like this you are not one of the ladies of the court with their light morals this is as much a surprise to me as it is to you there is yet time if you wish to leave me now you may go unimpeded i cannot she admitted i feel exactly as you do though it be confusing to me then she removed her chemise and let it fall to the floor i am a practical woman patrick and have not garments to waste he drew her back into his embrace so he might caress and fondle her lovely round breasts he had never before seen such perfectly luscious spheres her skin was firm and silken to his touch she sighed with her pleasure as his hands petted her tenderly singling out one breast his head dropped he rained kisses across her sentient flesh his mouth fastened upon a taut nipple and he began to suckle upon her eagerly rosamund had always loved the touch of a mans mouth on her breasts she almost purred her contentment how long had it been since she had lain in a mans arms enjoying his attentions it seemed like forever her fingers glanced over the nape of his neck his hair was dark and just lightly sprinkled with silver she entwined her hand into his locks kneading his scalp with what became a growing urgency he raised his head and his green eyes were glazed with his rising passion for her he began to kiss her hungrily their bodies twining and untwining with their lust his mouth touched her throat her shoulders her chest their lips met and burned as they kissed seemingly without end he could feel her heart beating wildly the pulse at the base of her throat leapt like a netted salmon his lips moved to her breasts again then down her torso rosamund was making little mewling noises that alerted him to her pleasure the white heather that scented her body warmed growing stronger with her passion it intoxicated him and he could feel himself growing harder with his desire for her he could not ever remember a time when he wanted a woman so very much god help us she halfsobbed and he understood her concern his fingers began to brush the curls on her mons a single finger explored she whimpered softly her thoughts jumbled but then for a moment her practical nature pushed to the fore and again she questioned what she was doing yet when his long fingers began to brush the insides of her thighs with a seductive stroking she felt herself concentrating only upon her need for him but why him because it is he for whom you have waited her voice within replied oh yes she said aloud knowing but not quite understanding the big hands caressed her pulling her into his arms again sweeping down her back to cup and fondle her buttocks i cannot get enough of you he said quietly your skin is like silk your body perfection i need you inside of me patrick rosamund heard herself telling him i need to be inside of you he replied then his big frame covered her the fingers of their two hands intertwining as he slowly possessed her she felt the lengthy hardness tenderly seeking entry into her body he was bigger than the two men she had previously known but rosamund opened like a flower for him absorbing his length within her love sheath until he filled her their eyes met again as they had earlier when this madness began she felt as if her soul were flowing into his and for a moment she was frightened he saw the look upon her lovely face and quickly reassured her tis all right my love he told her i sense it too we are one now in every sense then he began to move upon her and within moments rosamund found herself lost in passion as they sought to satisfy each other her eyes now closed she was enveloped in sensation the rhythm their bodies created overwhelmed her she moved from delight past pleasure to pure hot ecstasy she cried out as stars and moons exploded behind her eyelids her voice rising to a scream of utter satisfaction as her nails raked down his long back the thrust and withdraw of his manhood did not cease he drove her further and further until her cries of gratification echoed again and again within the stone walls of the small chamber and his own shouts of enjoyment mingled with hers until with an intense howl of triumph his love juices gushed forth in a tremendous rush flooding her body with their heat with a groan of repletion he rolled off of her pulling her into his arms as he did so i have no words he finally gasped nor i rosamund sighed deeply she had never never never ever been made love to with such tender such passionate such fierce intensity owein had never taken her like patrick leslie and as for henry tudor his only desires were for himself what just happened between herself and the earl of glenkirk had been achieved by the two of them together there was almost something mystical to it it was as if they had been together like this before from that first sensation of sudden recognition until now it was as if they were old and dear friends lovers i cannot be parted from you he said quietly his hand smoothed down her auburn hair nor i you my lord but shall i shock you if i tell you i do not wish another husband now she almost held her breath waiting to learn what he thought i can understand your feelings rosamund but someday you may change your mind i however will not like you i do not choose to wed again i have a son older than you i suspect he is wed and has sons and there is the matter of why the king has asked me to leave my highland home and come to stirling i shall be your mistress then and gladly rosamund told the earl of glenkirk something happened tonight my lord you know it and i know it i suspect you do not understand what it is any more than i do but there it is something deep within me knew you at first sight that same something bids me stay with you for now there will come a time when i will seek to return to friarsgate or perhaps you will need to return to glenkirk and when that time comes we will know it and we will part again as we obviously did at some other time and in some other place my poor cousin tom will be most shocked for this behavior is very unlike me and there is something you should know i have a suitorlogan hepburn the laird of clavens carn he expected to wed with me on st stephens day though i told him nay he will come to court seeking me and attempting to foist his will upon me but i do not wish to remarry do you become my mistress to thwart him rosamund he wondered aloud she propped herself upon an elbow and looked down into his face i become your mistress because i choose to be and because there is something obviously unfinished between us from that other time and place you know it patrick aye lass i know it he said i am a scot and i understand these things he reached up and pulled her down into his embrace once more kissing her i loved you once rosamund i know she replied softly and i loved you i will love you again he told her i know she said with a little smile i already love you though it be madness to say it patrick he laughed softly the king has the lang eey or long eye as you english would say i shall ask him about this wonderful insanity that has afflicted us my love he drew her even closer and pulled the coverlet about them will you remain with me for a little while my love she responded my poor annie will wonder where i have gotten to and fret she is one of my own friarsgate folk and i would prefer that what we have be between us alone for now soon enough there will be talk and speculation about the earl of glenkirk and the queens english friend you are very discreet he teased i dont want to be discreet rosamund told him i want to shout from all the rooftops of stirling that i am in love and am loved in return she chuckled people would think me mad especially if they knew the circumstances of our love my lord he nodded i can hear the gossips now there is old glenkirk come down from his highland eyrie and carrying on wi a lass young enough to be his daughter but there will be others who say old glenkirk is a lucky devil to have such a lusty young mistress and keep her satisfied too rosamund teased him back he laughed i suspect you care no more than i do what people say rosamund i dont care she admitted once i might have cared but no more i have outlived three husbands i have spent my entire life doing what was expected of me doing what i was told for i am naught but a mere woman but i have given friarsgate three little heiresses and i have kept the land well and will continue to do so with the help of my uncle edmund now i wish to live for myself if only for a little while tell me about friarsgate he said it is beautiful and fertile the house sits above a lake i raise sheep we prepare our own wool and weave our own cloth which is highly sought after by the mercers in carlisle and the low countries i have cattle and horses as well we are safe from our border neighbors because the land about my valley is ringed with steep hills no one can steal our livestock because they cannot escape with it without being caught i love it there it is the best place in all the world patrick now you tell me of glenkirk it sits in the eastern highlands between two rivers my castle is small until i was sent to san lorenzo by our jamie i was naught but the laird of glenkirk the king wished to honor the duke of san lorenzo by sending a nobleman and so i was created the earl of glenkirk we raise sheep and highland cattle i have two children a daughter janet and a son adam yet you speak only of your son rosamund noted my lass was stolen away by slavers when we were in san lorenzo she was to wed with the dukes heir we had just celebrated the betrothal when she was taken we tried to regain her custody but could not his face wore an expression of intense pain i cannot speak of it rosamund please understand and ask me no more she kissed him tenderly i understand she said for a moment all was silent in the chamber and then the earl said tell me of this logan hepburn who pursues you a most irritating man rosamund replied he claims to have been in love with me since i was six years of age he says he saw me at a cattle market at drumfie with my uncle he appeared at friarsgate just before i wed with my owein he had he said come courting i told him i was to marry and then the bold creature showed up at my wedding with his brothers and their pipes they brought whiskey and salmon i should have sent him packing then and there but owein found it amusing after oweins death queen katherine asked me back to court she thought to cheer me though if the truth be known i hated to leave my home and could scarcely wait to return and when i did there was logan hepburn he announced we were to wed on st stephens day and he would come for me then hes a bold fellow the earl said thoughtfully he is irritating and brash rosamund said heatedly thank god your queen sent me an invitation to come to this court i should have had to fortify my house to keep that damned borderer out he wants a son and an heir of me well he had best find someone more willing for i will not be broodmare to his stallion then her hand flew to her mouth oh patrick what if there is no possibility lass he told her before i returned home from san lorenzo i contracted an illness my face blew up like a sheeps bladder and my manhood ached and burned by turns the old woman who nursed me told me that my seed would be barren from that point on i have had several mistresses in the intervening years and none has claimed a bairn by me i have never cared until now though i swear i do not consider you a broodmare to my stallion he finished with a small smile she giggled and reaching down stroked his nowflaccid rod you do however my lord have some most impressive stallionlike qualities her fingers teased his length and found their way beneath to fondle his twin pouches he closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensations she was engendering with her daring play i had been told you english were cold creatures he bedeviled her wickedly whoever gave you such an idea my lord she murmured and then she squeezed him causing him to groan with his budding arousal i cannot remember madame but i am relieved to learn it a lie the earl said i suspect his majesty could tell you that it is said king jamie is hotblooded by nature so too is his queen considering the bairns born to them it would seem truth aye but among those bairns not a living heir the earl noted this time will be different rosamund said come the spring the queen will deliver a healthy son my lord we all pray for it do you have the lang eey like our jamie then he asked his hand cupped a breast and he tenderly fondled it the little nipple instantly thrust itself forth to salute him he bent his dark head and kissed it his tongue licked at it in a leisurely fashion rosamund sighed deeply every touch of his hand his mouth offered her the most incredible pleasure while she had loved owein it had never been that way with him not like this nor her own king who had taken her briefly for his mistress on her last visit to court nay henry tudor was always interested in only one thing his own gratification this man however patrick leslie earl of glenkirk a man she knew hardly at all this man opened her eyes in a single night of passion to the reality of what love truly was i think i will die if you leave me now she said voicing her thoughts to him with daring audacity he kissed her sweetly his lips brushing hers tenderly we are not meant to part for now my love but one day we will for your heart is at friarsgate and mine at glenkirk this is how it should be for we are both loyal to our lands and our people once i think we may have neglected our responsibilities in favor of our love we are being given the chance now to right that wrong do you understand me rosamund nay she replied i do not what i believe my love is considered a heresy but nonetheless i believe it i think that we live other lives in other times and places i recall that when i arrived in san lorenzo i had the most incredible sense that i had been there before i would find my way to certain locations without the benefit of direction throughout my life it has been that way an old clanswoman on my lands has the lang eey and she told me i have lived before as have most souls i believe her tonight when we first met in this time and this place we both experienced a sense of familiarity a strong feeling that we knew each other well you are not a woman with loose morals yet here we lie together in our bed and i am about to make love to you for a second time this night do you understand now rosamund she nodded aye and yet nay she told him can you accept this magic between us or shall we part and pretend that it never happened he asked her how could i possibly deny the wonder of what is between us she cried softly i cannot i hear what you tell me but it seems so impossible still i do lie here in your arms and i feel as if i never want to leave you that i shall die if you send me away i will not send you away rosamund yet there will come a time as i have said when we will both know we must part for the sake of others but that time is not now for a while the fates will allow us this idyll and we will be grateful he told her could you not have found me sooner my lord she said with utmost seriousness he smiled down on her his green eyes filled with pure love then he kissed her mouth and said be silent my love and let me join with you once more yes she said the single word her own love shining forth from her amber eyes then she opened her arms to him and took him into her embrace for a second time they met passion for a second time they cried aloud as it swept over them rendering them both weak with satisfaction the length and breadth of him filled her love sheath the rhythm they created was overpowering in the pleasure it offered her body arced against him in her great desire he forced her down thrusting and parrying with his lance as he brought them to a perfect heaven once again i die she sobbed as her desire grew and grew until it burst in a frenetic rush of his love juices that left them both halfconscious and gasping for breath you are the most incredible woman he finally managed to say his dark head resting upon her white bosom and you astonishing my dear lord of glenkirk you tell me you are past fifty and yet you make love like a younger man she said with admiration he chuckled it is only young men who claim excess virility and work to make the myth a truth a man of my years knows his limits although tonight i have surpassed even myself my love but that is due to you i suspect you inspire me take your ease then my lord for soon you must help me find my way back to my own chamber i have absolutely no idea where i am right now she told him laughing you are in my arms where you should be he said i will help you find your way back he promised but first let us regain our strength rosamund she nodded in agreement and closed her eyes feeling safer and more content than she had felt in many months this was what it was like to be really loved she thought happily if only the whole world could feel just like this they dozed for a short time wrapped in each others arms savoring the warmth of their love but finally the earl of glenkirk rose reluctantly and dressed himself when he was clothed he handed her the garments he had discarded upon the stool earlier ordering her to dress within the comfort of their bed for the air was bitterly cold finally he led her from his little chamber through the darkened corridors of the castle asking her as they went exactly where her own chamber was she told him and to her surprise they were quickly there they kissed hungrily desperately as if they would never again be together then he turned swiftly and hurried off back into the darkness of the hallway rosamund slipped quietly into her little chamber annie was dozing in a chair by the embers of the fire she started awake as her mistress entered i am glad you were not worried rosamund said to her lord cambridge come to me my lady he said you might be very late she rose from her place yawning and stretching then peeping through the heavy velvet curtain covering the single window she said tis already false dawn you had best get into bed my lady if you are to have any rest before the mass build up the fire rosamund ordered her and heat some water i stink of passion and cannot enter the queens presence until i have washed neither will i enter my bed until i am fresh annie looked shocked with her mistress pronouncement i have taken the earl of glenkirk as a lover annie rosamund said bluntly you will not gossip about it with the other servants even if they ask you do you understand me girl aye my lady annie said but it aint right a respectable lady such as yourself she burst out i am widowed annie and were you not my confidante when i was with the king rosamund asked her servingwoman that was different annie said you was just obeying our king there was no harm in it as long as good queen katherine didnt know or be shamed by it nay annie twas no different than all of my life before it rosamund said i have always done what i was asked what was expected of me now however i shall do what i want i shall live my life to please myself and no one else do you understand what of the laird of clavens carn annie asked he aint going to marry with a lady who lifts her skirts so easily my lady rosamund slapped her servant you presume upon our friendship annie she said do you wish me to send you home to friarsgate i shall do it for there are plenty who would be willing to serve meand keep their tongues silent i will tell you what i told logan hepburn i do not wish to marry again and i will not be forced to it friarsgate has an heiress and two more besides i will unite my daughters one day in marriages that will bring honor and wealth to our family logan hepburn wants a son he needs an heir for clavens carn let him get it upon some sweet young virgin who will adore him and be a good wife to him i am not that woman king henrys mother she who was my guardian once told me that a woman must marry first for her family twice at the most but after that the venerable margaret said a woman should marry where it suited her twice my uncle henry bolton has made marriages for me my third husband was the kings choice now it is my choice and i choose no husband do you understand me annie i will do as i please now annie rubbed her cheek and sniffled softly yes my lady she said good then we are agreed and you will serve me without question eh yes my lady go about your duties then rosamund instructed her servant and she sat down upon the bed while annie built the fire back up and began to heat the water for her ablutions what a night it had been she had been at court only a short time yet now as the day of christs eve dawned she was filled with a joy such as she had never known she knew not where this was all leading but she realized to her surprise that she had no fears in the matter she was truly deeply in love for the first time in all of her twentytwo years she would follow where the road led and when it ended well she would worry about that when it happened for now she meant to live for the moment and the moment was patrick leslie earl of glenkirk chapter king james looked closely at his old friend the earl of glenkirk by the rood patrick if i did not know better i would say you were in love he exclaimed patrick smiled why do you think it impossible for me to be in love jamie he inquired of the king am i not a man like any other a man aye but like any other nay patrick you are not you were my ambassador to san lorenzo it was an important assignment for an unimportant highland laird i created you an earl to honor san lorenzos duke and you served me well until the tragedy of your daughter janet then without even waiting for my permission you packed up your family and returned home you stopped at court only long enough to give me your report and then you disappeared into your highland eyrie for the next eighteen years you would still be there had i not called you back to me i do not know of any other man so loyal to my crown who would do that patrick you were ever my friend even from the very beginning unlike some whom i must smile at praise and bestow honors upon you do not dissemble your word is your bond i can trust you so you said when you asked me to go to san lorenzo the earl replied dryly and suddenly you have called me back to your side jamie why first you must tell me who the lady is patrick the king teased his old friend the earl smiled a gentleman does not gossip like a cotters wife he said i know you possess a good soul of patience jamie i will tell you in time but not now the king grinned ahh then it is love he chortled i shall be watching you my lord of glenkirk then he grew serious again patrick i need you to return to san lorenzo for me you have a competent ambassador there the earl responded aye ian mcduff is indeed competent but he is not the diplomat that you were patrick and i very much need a diplomat you know that the pope is forming what he refers to as the holy league he wishes the french out of the northern italian states and he cannot do it himself so he is declaring a righteous war against them inviting others to join in his cause with promise of eternal salvation among other rewards my bombastic young brotherinlaw henry of england is his loudest supporter i am invited to join them but i cannot will not this aggression is wrong patrick and the french are our auld alliance you are an honorable man jamie and i know that you would not turn upon a friend without good reason and there is no good reason is there only henry tudors intense desire to please the pope in order to gain more power than england now has james stewart replied spain of course joins the pope and england venice and the holy roman empire have joined as well but before it goes any farther i would make an attempt to stop them i must do it in secret and in a place no one would suspect if they knew of my plans i do not want the most powerful of the christian states fighting with one another when we should be mounting a crusade against the turks in constantinople and too my brotherinlaw knows that unlike him i am an honorable man i will not betray an ally even for my own advantage as he would he knows i cannot join this league against the french he seeks to turn the holy father against meagainst scotland you must meet with venices and the emperors representatives in san lorenzo patrick you must convince them that this league is but englands plan to achieve a dominant hold over us all there are parties within each of these countries who understand this i am in contact with them and they will arrange for delegates from their governments to be in san lorenzo to hear you out instinct tells me it is unlikely we can succeed but we must try patrick there will be war with england sooner than later the earl sighed i know the king replied my lang eey tells me so yet i must do what i know is right in this matter i do it for scotland patrick aye and we have never had a better king then you jamie the fourth of the stewarts but you should not have wed with england you should have married margaret drummond the drummonds had given scotland two queens and good queens they were he sighed i mean no disrespect to your wee wife jamie i know the king answered and you are right i knew i should not wed with england and i avoided it as long as i could but when my beloved margaret and her sisters were poisoned i had no more excuses many desired the match with the tudor princess and they believed that it would bring peace between our two nations the peace has been a fragile one at best but since my fatherinlaws death and the ascension of his son i fear for us all my wifes brother is a determined man and the wealth built up so carefully by his father makes him a powerful one as well but scotland is more prosperous and peaceful under your rule jamie than it has been in centuries the earl noted it is obvious that we desire nothing more than peace in order to continue on as we have aye but henry tudor is an ambitious man i fear the king replied he is jealous of the fact that i have been on good terms with the holy see he attempts to destroy that trust by his enthusiasm for the popes war and he will succeed i fear you have heard about the matter of my wifes jewels have you not the earl shook his head puzzled nay i have not of course the king said you are only just back at court my wifes grandmother the venerable margaret and her mother the late elizabeth of york left their jewelry in three equal parts to my meg to her sister mary and to her brothers good queen katherine but the king of england refuses to send his elder sister her portion making all sorts of excuses as to why he will not finally my wife wrote to her brother that she didnt need the jewelry as much as she desired these mementos of her mother and grandmother for i her husband would gift her with double their value i can but imagine the sting that gave arrogant king hal meg tells me he used to cheat at their nursery games and whined and raged if he did not win these are traits he has obviously carried with him into his manhood when do you want me to leave the earl asked not until after the twelve days of christmas are over and done with the king answered i want it to appear as if i have just lured you back to court for the christmas season for old times sake and you came because it had been many years since you had paid your respects to me the fact that you have involved yourself with a lady is all to the good after the holidays have ended you will disappear and all will assume you have returned to glenkirk you know that there are spies here at my court patrick and should they know my plans they would report back to england or spain or even the pope himself your mission must be secret i realize there is little chance of its success but i do not want the waters muddied before i have at least attempted to stop this madness three years ago the holy see formed an alliance with france to humble venice now france is the enemy i despair patrick of this chess game my fellow monarchs play and no one ever really wins these politicians will be the ruin of the world so what you actually desire of me is to convince some of the players of the foolishness of this matter the earl said which ones jamie which are the weak links venice who is suspicious of everyone and possibly the holy roman empire who never quite trusts spain spain will side with the pope no matter especially as the english queen is spanish born and bred if i can but weaken the league the pressure will be off of me to join it and betray the auld alliance we honor with france and learning of this new coalition the turks are bound to make some hostile move that should turn the popes attention in other directions after all he is the father of the christian church the king chuckled wickedly so venices and the emperors representatives will be in san lorenzo the earl said the king nodded well patrick said my son adam is a grown man and can manage our lands without me for a short time and while i do not imagine my trip across a winters sea will be a pleasant one january and february in san lorenzo as i recall it are most benign it has been a long time since i have enjoyed a mild winter and you will not regret leaving your lady the king queried leave her nay jamie i shall not leave her i intend to take her with me to san lorenzo you are correct when you say i am a man in love i am i adored my daughters mother i married my sons mother a sweet and gentle girl whom i came to care for most deeply because i needed a legitimate son and heir her sudden death broke my heart it was not fair that agnes die as janets mother had she was so damned good even making me promise to legitimatize janet when our son was born but i have never never until this moment in time been truly and deeply in love i am a man long grown i have grandchildren but nonetheless i am in love i feel like a young man again jamie will her absence from this court be noted the king asked his friend the earl of glenkirk considered a long moment and then he said mayhap she is the queens friend does she have a husband we should be concerned about the king wondered aloud is her family an important one she is widowed and of unimportant lineage the earl said it will be said that she has returned to her own home unless the king responded suddenly knowing of whom the earl of glenkirk spoke my wife wants her here for the birth of our child in the spring you know that damned lang eey of yours jamie the earl said with a small smile or are you merely guessing you have fallen in love with the little lady of friarsgate patrick havent you was the kings answer the earl nodded we met two nights ago he began but two nights ago the king exclaimed surprised hear me out jamie it was the oddest experience i have ever had i saw her across the chamber suddenly i had the most overwhelming urge to meet her lord grey managed the introductions through his friend elsbeth hume our eyes met and we both knew in that instant that we had known each other in some other time and place and that we were meant to be together for the here and now i cannot explain it any more plainly than that there are many who would think me mad but i know you do not jamie stewart nay the king agreed for it was the same with margaret drummond and me rosamund bolton is lovely i will concur but she is english patrick and she was according to my information briefly mistress to my brotherinlaw was she the earl was intrigued rosamund had not told him that but why would she nonetheless jamie i do not believe the lady is politically involved whatever her past he said you cannot believe she seeks to curry favor with her king i do not believe that of her she need not know why i go to san lorenzo just that i would take her there that we might be lovers in peace far from the prying eyes of your court and our friends arcobaleno the capital is a most romantic place i am certain that rosamund having never until she entered scotland been out of england will find it delightful the affair was most discreet neither my wife nor queen katherine knew of it the king said brother henry had attempted to seduce the lady when she was a young girl at court he was prevented from doing so and she was wed to her husband on the kings orders he obviously sought her out when she returned to court a grieving widow to correct his previous failure he does not like losing at games i am told you are extremely well informed jamie the earl noted admiringly almost nothing a king does is truly secret james stewart replied there is always someone in this case a servant of her cousin lord cambridge with information to sell to the appropriate buyer i think this fellow thought i might be interested in bedding the lady myself i have at the moment however a perfectly satisfactory mistress in isabel stewart the daughter of my cousin the earl of buchan and my wife is again with child i would not distress meg as i know that this child she delivers in the spring will be a son and he will surviveunlike the other wee frail bairns she has borne me the queen does not really need rosamund but i do the earl said i am your most loyal servant jamie and well you know it but i will not go to san lorenzo without my lass i will speak with rosamund when the time is right and she will convince the queen that she must return home to her beloved friarsgate but that she will return in the spring when the queen has her bairn a lad you say the lang eey again eh jamie aye a lad he sighed i can but hope i live to see him grown but i will not the earl did not argue for he did not want to know what the king knew james stewart was known for having incredible intuition and sensitivity to supernatural forces patrick knew if the king was concerned then this mission was of great importance ill be an old man jamie before i serve your son he said comfortingly the king laughed his mood now suddenly lightened youve already bedded her it was a statement not a question within hours of our meeting jesu jamie i feel like a man of thirty again when i am with her god knows i have had mistresses aplenty in my lifetime but none of them ever captured my heart as this girl has they say she has a suitor the king replied aye the earl of bothwells cousin the hepburn of clavens carn she told me he chuckled he told her he would come on st stephens day to wed her i think he will be most surprised not to find her waiting meekly and eagerly for his arrival st stephens thats today the king exclaimed laughing what a wench she is patrick are you certain you would have her as long as it is meant to be jamie the earl said ah then the king remarked you do not believe it is forever you will not wed her i would wed her if she would have me but though she will have me as a lover she will not have me as a husband the earl explained she has no wish to remarry and i know she would not leave her beloved friarsgate any more than i would depart glenkirk forever but one day i will ask her he finished with a small smile so we may both be satisfied that i truly love her that is why she has rejected the hepburn of clavens carn she believes his only interest in her is getting a son i pity the lad for what can he possibly do to convince her otherwise that he loves her if he does the king nodded you may expect him here at court patrick when he finds the lass gone i have not a doubt hepburns are not noted for giving up easily and he will have his cousin bothwell plead his case for him as well rosamund is english and you cannot order her to wed with this man the earl of glenkirk said quietly can you such will be my defense but meg will undoubtedly become involved in the matter my wee english wife is a romantic a discovery i find astounding in a tudor rosamund will have to confide in my queen or meg will not be silent or rest in her quest to gain her dear friend another husband the queen believes that no woman can be truly happy or even content without a lawful mate in that mood she becomes dangerous patrick your affair may become public knowledge perhaps it will be better if it does the earl said thoughtfully the better to deter the queen the earl of bothwell and this hepburn of clavens carn but i must consult with rosamund first she is not a woman to be surprised in matters that are important to her ah to be in love once again the king chuckled you are a fortunate man i have not felt that way since margaret drummond i am the earl of glenkirk agreed with a smile the two men were seated companionably in the kings privy chamber at stirling castle settled before a roaring fire handleless silver drinking vessels containing peat whiskey cupped between their hands they talked on into the night while the king was thought to be with his mistress a french vessel will ferry you across the sea to france the king said from there you will travel by land to san lorenzo i would not risk your life at this time of year crossing the bay of biscay with a woman however it may take you longer than i had anticipated james stewart considered rosamund is a country girl as is her servant a coach with all its accoutrements would but attract someones attention we will ride my lass has said she wanted adventure in her life after all those years of doing her duty patrick chuckled this will surely be an adventure for her and her clothing and all the gewgaws so dear to a womans heart the king wondered aloud we will carry what we need and i shall have an entire new wardrobe made for her when we arrive the earl said i will be interested to see if your lady is so eager for adventure when you tell her that the king remarked with a broad grin she will come the earl said quietly we cannot be parted yet we will talk again before you leave patrick the king told glenkirk go and find your bed as i am going to find mine the two men arose from their places by the fire shook hands and went their separate ways james stewart to visit his current mistress isabel and the earl of glenkirk to find his rosamund rosamund had decided that her chamber with its small fireplace was a better space for she and the earl to inhabit annie had been banished to the dormitory shared by many of the young servant women when a tiring woman who usually shared her mistress bed appeared in those quarters it was always assumed her mistress had taken a lover annie had been warned by her mistress to be discreet but she kept her ears open for any tidbit of gossip that might be of interest or use to rosamund rosamund was sleeping when the earl entered her room he quietly divested himself of his garments and after climbing into bed drew her into his arms kissing the nape of her neck as he did so she murmured a sound of distinct contentment and he whispered in her ear are you awake lovey i have news one hand moved to cup a breast and he caressed it tenderly what news she asked him softly and she ground her hips into his body suggestively youre a bad lass he teased her his lust being aroused at a fierce pace what was this sorcery she possessed to do that to him and at his age because i want to fuck she queried turning about to face him pulling off her chemise as she did her arms slipped about his neck and her round full breasts pressed against his broad chest he yanked her against him by her buttocks because your delicious little body and your eagerness set me aflame as no other woman ever has my rosamund he told her because now that you have caught my fancy in this manner i shall have to satisfy us both before i share my news with you you wicked wench his mouth found hers in a hot kiss demanding insisting and she returned his ardor you know i love you sweetheart dont you he said breaking off their kiss aye my lord i do and you will not be surprised to learn that i return your lordships passion i am mad for you patrick i feel as if my whole life has been leading up to this moment in time how in the name of god is that possible i loved hugh for he was a father to me i loved owein for he loved me and friarsgate but this is different this lunacy has naught to do with friarsgate it is only us i could stay in this chamber with you forever he lay her back against their pillows and covered her small body with his big one the fingers of their hands intertwined as had become their custom their eyes met as he entered her and she sighed deeply he stopped all motion for a brief time enjoying her as she absorbed his size with such pleasure it almost brought him to tears then he began to move upon her again and finally her eyes closed and she sighed once more as he brought them to passionate perfection oh patrick i love you so very much perhaps too much she admitted when she once again came to herself her head upon his chest i wonder he replied if we can ever love enough let alone too much his big hand stroked her auburn tresses your hair is so soft annie thinks me mad for i insist it be washed weekly she says it is a wonder i have not caught my death of cold putting my head in water so much rosamund said is she very angry at being banished patrick asked i think she actually likes the company of the other servingwomen rosamund replied do you think she would like to travel my love he queried casually i dont know rosamund responded why i am of a mind to spend the winter in a warmer climate i want you to go with me rosamund the earl of glenkirk said quietly which means crossing the sea in the worst weather she noted then she said do not treat me as you would some foolish lass patrick he understood at once and told her it is for the king lovey i can say no more now which i know you will comprehend even saying that much i put my fate in your two little hands rosamund why would you say that she wondered because you were once king henrys mistress he answered bluntly how on earth did you learn that only tom and annie know it had to be a servant not mine i hope nay it is not annie or you would not have asked me if she liked to travel since you expect her to come with me and having learned this fact your king fears that i will betray you please tell me that meg does not know nay nor queen katherine either he reassured her i did not seek to attract hal rosamund began but he would have me willing or nay for my familys sake i acquiesced as graciously as i could patrick there was no real love between us and while i am loyal to england i do not believe whatever you do in your kings service will harm my country king james appears to be a man of great intellect and peace i know henry tudor well enough to know he is ambitious and vain he has a bad habit of always making it appear that god is on his side alone it would be amusing if it were not so dangerous i would not under any circumstances betray you my lord she concluded i know that he told her and then he kissed her mouth again you will come with me my rosamund i will come with you patrick leslie for where you are my heart is i fear she responded and what of logan hepburn he queried her logan needs a son and an heir he should have married long ago but that he has this fancy for a child he saw at a cattle fair when he was sixteen i was the child he saw but i am no longer a child nor do i wish to be married because i am considered good breeding stock rosamund told the earl a man expectsis entitled tochildren on his wifes body the earl said quietly i will not disagree she answered him but that and his silly story seem to be his whole rationale for wanting to marry me he says he loves me but does he really i dont know but i will not take the chance of marrying him to discover that it is only my fecundity that attracts him i have never known love patrick until you i will not give that up for what is considered a respectable marriage i wont we might marry you and i he said softly only when you are ready to give up your glenkirk and i friarsgate she replied with a small smile how can you know me so well on such short acquaintance he chuckled and you me she responded ohh patrick i do not care what anyone else may think i love you i do not need to be your wife nor do you need to offer me the honor of your name for me to know that you love me from the moment our eyes met we knew it was so aye he agreed it was sweetheart when are we to depart court she asked him after twelfth night he said it will be thought that i have returned home to glenkirk as i am not a man of the court your departure must be considered a return home as well rosamund will it be difficult for you to take your leave of the queen rosamund was thoughtful for a few moments and then she said aye but i will tell her one of my daughters has taken ill and maybel has sent for me she will accept that although i know she will be disappointed she wanted me to remain with her until her child was born she fears so that she cannot give her husband a son the kings lang eey tells him the child will be a healthy lad he frets that he will not live to see the boy grown the earl noted then i need not feel so guilty about my wee lie rosamund said and your cousin lord cambridge a most amusing fellow but very astute beneath his droll wit i think patrick said tom is clever but i will have to tell him the entire truth of the matter he is the best friend i have ever had and no one not even my husbands have been as good to me as thomas bolton has frankly he will be very disappointed not to be invited along with us rosamund chuckled however i will need him to return to friarsgate to explain to my uncles and to maybel where i have gone and why i will need him there to watch over my lasses and wield my authority in my absence my uncle henry may still have hopes of gaining friarsgate through one of his sons edmund could not prevent his mischief but my darling lord cambridge certainly can i need not fear to return home eventually to discover my philippa wed to one of my wretched cousins as long as tom is there to watch over her she leaned forward and gave her lover a quick kiss i shall feel very guilty about leaving tom behind he is a most amusing traveling companion yet i prefer that our idyll be more private than familial the earl said will glenkirk be all right while you are gone so far will you tell your son adam is a man grown he is a little bit older than you are my darling love he has a sound head on his shoulders and as glenkirk will one day be his it is past time he handled its responsibilities on his own he drew her closer into his embrace his lips brushing the top of her head is he a married man rosamund asked aye though why he wed with anne macdonald i will never know they met at the highland games one summer she was young and pretty she knew he was an earls heir and he was vulnerable to her flattery adam is much like his mother though he never knew my sweet agnes he is kind and gentle his saving grace is that he has a leslies head for common sense nonetheless he is not at all like me he had no lasses mooning after him and so anne easily captured his innocent heart the family was a good one i had no cause to deny the match so they wed only afterwards he discovered he had married a shrew she fears me however and so my sons life has not been intolerable oddly i sometimes feel sorry for anne and god knows she has done her duty i have two fine grandsons and a wee granddaughter born just last year and named after adams mam the sweet agnes shes a bonnie little lass not in the least like her mother anne is content letting her daughter be looked after by her nursemaid i expect my daughterinlaw will very much enjoy being in charge while i am away the earl finished with a small grin then neither of us need fear for our lands and our families while we are in san lorenzo rosamund said we have earned this time together sweetheart he answered her and he enfolded her closely in his arms let us sleep now tomorrow we must begin planning we can take little with us as once we reach france we must ride the rest of the way a coach and all that goes with it would attract the interest of those who earn their livings selling information a small party of horsemen will not do you mind riding so great a distance nay she answered i think perhaps it would be best if i dressed in boys clothing and annie too it would be easier and it would attract even less attention he nodded aye lass it would can you ride astride i certainly can she laughed even in skirts my lord do you think i shall make a pretty boy in trunk hose and doublet he chuckled aye perhaps too pretty now go to sleep rosamund the morning will come quickly enough and you are expected at mass with the queen she lay against his chest the beat of his heart beneath her ear the comforting rhythm of his breathing lulling her to slumber when she finally awoke he was gone and annie was bustling about their chamber it was still dark outside rosamund saw so she was not late she yawned and stretched good morrow annie she said good morning my lady annie replied the earl has gone already and he says he will see you later he also says you are to speak to me oh my lady i hope i have not displeased him or you again annies face bore all the hallmarks of her distress nay you have displeased neither of us rosamund sat up in her bed put a bit more wood on the fire annie and bring me a basin to wash myself she swung her legs over the side of the bed shivering as she came from beneath the shelter of the coverlets and her feet touched the cold stone floor annie handed her mistress the chamber pot and rosamund peed then she washed herself as thoroughly as she might using a flannel and the little basin she longed for her daily bath but the servants at stirling grudged her even her weekly ablutions grumbling as they brought up the water to fill her little oak tub but they dared not deny her for they knew the englishwoman was the queens dear childhood friend what will you wear today my lady annie asked give me the tawny orange velvet rosamund said tom always likes me in that gown although i wonder if the gold embroidery isnt perhaps too showy tis beautiful my lady ill fetch it from the trunk and see the wrinkles smoothed out she bustled about the room as rosamund climbed back into the warm bed i would speak with you privily annie rosamund began i have never enjoyed having my life decided for me by others and so i will share a confidence with you that you may choose what it is you will do i am going away with lord leslie annie i would like you to come with us no one is to know they are to believe that each of us has returned to our own homes if you choose not to accompany me i shall see you safely returned to friarsgate with lord cambridge and i shall not hold it against you but however you decide you can say nothing to anyone of what i have just told you do you understand annie no one must know annie was more than surprised by her mistress speech she drew a deep breath and asked will we be going back to friarsgate ever my lady the velvet gown in her hands felt very heavy rosamund laughed softly annie she chided the servant you know i should not leave my girls and uncle henry so close by she laughed again why all three should find themselves wed to my uncles odious sons if i were to desert them and there is friarsgate itself i love it so i gain my strength from friarsgate i must always eventually go home annie annie nodded slowly when would we come back she queried i dont know but i suspect in a few months time no more rosamund responded we just want a little time together before we must part again why dont you just wed the earl annie questioned her lady begging your pardon mistress i do not mean to be forward but i do not understand the earl of glenkirk can no more abandon his home than i could forsake friarsgate annie were my lasses not so young i might consider a union with him but they are too young for me to leave annie nodded again understanding but not quite understanding she lay the orange tawny gown out on the chambers single chair where would we go across the sea rosamund replied simply across the sea i aint ever been on any boat my lady annie exclaimed neither have i rosamund chuckled it will be quite an adventure for us and how long would we be at sea annie asked nervously a few days at the most rosamund promised her and well come home after you have all this adventure out of yourself annie pressed her mistress you swear on the blessed mothers name i swear rosamund said with utmost seriousness i expect we will be back by autumn at the latest annie probably sooner annie drew a long deep breath then she said ill come my lady but what will mistress maybel and master edmund say and who is to tell them lord cambridge will tell them annie rosamund answered the girl have you told him annie persisted as she unrolled two pairs of stockings i shall tell him today annie now remember this is a great secret i shall have to lie to the queen i fear for she would not understand my leaving her now and it is not yet time for all the dissembling to begin put it from your mind now and i shall tell you when you may recall it again rosamund said now i would get dressed before i am late for the mass margaret of scotland signaled to her friend to come and be by her side just as the mass was beginning this was an honor and rosamund well knew it for a moment she felt almost guilty at the deception she would play on her old friend but then her eyes met those of the earl of glenkirk across the royal chapel and her guilt vanished when the morning services were over the queen linked her arm in rosamunds and they walked together towards the great hall where the morning meal would be laid out what is this gossip i hear about you and lord leslie the queen asked bluntly i do not know the gossip to which you refer madame rosamund answered formally for they were in public it is said that you have become lovers the queen replied then she lowered her voice is it true rosamund have you he is very handsome even if he is old he is not that old meg rosamund whispered a twinkle in her amber eyes ohhh then it is so the queen chortled what a naughty girl you have suddenly become rosamund i would not offend your highness rosamund quickly said offend me nay i envy you the queen answered do you remember how my grandmother always said a woman married first perhaps a second time for her family but after that she should find her own happiness does lord leslie make you happy rosamund i hope so have you ever had a lover before the first lie rosamund thought to herself nay meg she murmured softly never before and in a sense it was the truth for she had not really loved margaret tudors brother englands king but she was surely in love with patrick leslie tis rather sudden isnt it the queen pressed her friend further i cannot explain it rosamund said our eyes met and we both knew the queen laughed softly you sound like my husband with his lang eey she said her hand went protectively to her belly i dont want to be an empty vessel like my brothers wife pray god and his blessed mother that this child is a strong son rosamund pray hard for me i do rosamund said every day meg your highness the kings page was before them his majesty would break his fast with you this morning the lad said i am here to escort you the queen nodded and rosamund gracefully slid into the background seeking either glenkirk or her cousin lord cambridge it was lord cambridge who found her first my darling girl you have set the court upon its ear i fear is it true has lord leslie become your lover i have never before heard such delicious tittletattle the scots court is far more fun than the english court where poor spanish kate and her mate our stodgy king henry hold sway there everything is proper and ordered while the king casts his eye boldly about and then swives his little conquests in secrecyno offense my darling cousin none taken dearest tom rosamund replied dryly but in this delightful court lord cambridge continued people are not so damned au fait about their passions i quite like it now come along dear girl and tell me absolutely everything he linked his velvetclad arm in hers i am hungry tom rosamund protested we have only just celebrated the mass and i have not eaten since last night we shall go to my house and my cook will feed you he responded and that will allow us our privacy cousin for i do indeed mean to hear all you bought a house in stirling village rosamund exclaimed nay i have just rented it it is little more than a cottage but quite charming and the old woman who owns it cooks like an angel i had no intention dear girl of sleeping in the kings hall with those other poor disenfranchised souls who are at court you were given a little box to nest in cousin but i am not the queens friend i only accompanied you therefore i was on my own the royal hospitality does not mean to be niggardly but you see how many follow this court there is simply no room to house them all decently rosamund now come along my darling shall we invite lord leslie he teased her wickedly and he gave her arm a little pinch do i need my horse she asked ignoring his teasing nay darling girl tis only a short walk down the hill the house is but a few yards from the castle gates the old woman used to cook for the royal nursery when it was at stirling your little friend the queen however objected to the king housing his bastards in a castle she had a particular fondness for and she threw such a tantrum when she first discovered the little byblows there that the king moved his nursery to a more discreet location out of his queens sight the king wanted to make his eldest son alexander his heir you know and the queen still fears he might if she doesnt give him a nice healthy babe alexander stewart is the bishop of st andrews rosamund said aye he is and he is amazingly well suited to the task despite his youth he and the king have a great bond of love between them the queen is jealous she knows that even if she gives her husband a healthy son and heir alexander will always be his favorite but then of course he is the firstborn how do you learn all this gossip and in such detail rosamund demanded of her cousin we have been here scarce a week she laughed they had exited the castle walked across the great courtyard and were now passing through stirlings open gates into the street beyond it was a cobbled byway lined in wellkept stone houses with dark slate roofs three houses down on the left lord cambridge stopped and turned to enter the building calling as he did mistress machugh i have brought my cousin home and we are hungry having just come from the mass a tall thin woman appeared from the depths of the darkened hallway yer cousin is it my lord rosamund bolton the lady of friarsgate and the queens good friend mistress machugh ive spoken of her lord cambridge said he divested himself of his cloak and took rosamunds from her yeve done naught but chatter away since ye rented my dwelling from me mistress machugh replied sharply she looked directly at rosamund does he ever stop speaking my lady but her gray eyes were twinkling not often i fear mistress machugh rosamund answered with a smile then she shivered involuntarily the lady saw it and she tched come into the parlor my lady i have a good fire going there its the coziest room in the house ill bring yer meal there then she bustled off the parlor of the cottage was indeed warm with the blazing fire rosamund sat down in a tapestried chair next to the warmth tom placed a small goblet of wine in her hand advising her to drink it to restore the heat to her slender frame ill not press you until the meal is served he said i dont want to be interrupted and you i am certain dont wish to share your news with the entire world she nodded and slowly sipped at the sweet wine you are wearing one of my favorite gowns he noted the furtrimmed sleeves make it a whole other garment i vow it complements your lovely hair cousin it is pretty isnt it rosamund agreed and i thank you for the new sleeves the marten is just wonderful in both texture and color the door to the parlor opened and mistress machugh came in carrying a large tray she set it on a sideboard then said my lord help me with this table and together the landlady and lord cambridge set a sturdy oak table before the fire rosamund immediately drew her chair up their hostess filled two pewter plates with small trenchers of oat stirabout fluffy eggs ham and individual cottage loaves that were hot from her ovens she placed a stone crock of fresh butter another of cherry preserves and a generous wedge of cheese between them then with a small curtsy she departed the chamber they ate in silence until both plates were empty and half the cheese was devoured between them the wine rosamund thought was really quite good finally satisfied they sighed in unison laughed and tom said to his cousin well now dear girl i would know absolutely all hold back nothing we are lovers rosamund began and he nodded not in the least surprised anyone at court who thought otherwise was a simpleton and a fool i am going away with him shortly tom i would have you understand everything but you must keep what i tell you a secret for many lives depend upon it can you do that cousin he nodded you know rosamund that while i love england i am not a man to involve myself in politics do you swear to me that this will not be treason on your part or mine by hearing you out there is no treason tom she assured him then i will keep secret all you tell me but havent i always dearest girl you have tom but this is very different hal has entered into an agreement with the holy father in rome to attempt a removal of the french from northern italy venice spain and the holy roman empire have joined them they call themselves the holy league hal has been pressing king james to join them this scots king has always been in high favor with the pope that favor is now endangered by england insisting that scotland join their cause patrick has told me what king james would do ahh said lord cambridge seeing the problem immediately the auld alliance of course king james is an honorable man he has no cause to break his word exactly rosamund replied so the king is sending lord leslie to san lorenzo where he once served as scotlands ambassador to meet secretly with venice and the empire in hopes that he may convince them to withdraw from this league and by doing so weaken the alliance then scotland will not seem so out of step but if there is any chance of this plan succeeding it must be done clandestinely when lord leslie disappears from court it will be assumed that he has gone home he hasnt been to court in eighteen years after all and is hardly considered among the powerful or influential he has asked me to go with him i have said that i would but my absence would be questioned as i was asked to come to court by the queen and am considered her friend i must lie to meg i will tell her that i have been sent a message that one of my daughters is very ill that i must return to friarsgate immediately but that i will return to her as soon as possibleand indeed i will you want me to go back to friarsgate and tell edmund and richard is that it he asked her aye i do tom but there is more i would give you authority over my lands and my daughters until i return home again i will not allow henry bolton any opportunity to steal my lasses and by doing so steal friarsgate from me he would try to bully edmund and even prior richard but he will not bully you you are lord cambridge and he just plain ordinary henry bolton i realize that i am asking a great deal from you cousin you thought to spend the winter here with me at the scots court escort me home and then return to your own holding near london true tom said and i am more disappointed that i cannot travel with you to san lorenzo i have heard it is a most beautiful little duchy i told patrick you would be disappointed not to be accompanying us rosamund responded with a small smile lord cambridge chortled and i am certain he expressed his regrets at losing my company dear girl she laughed forgive us dear tom unexpectedly and quite to our mutual surprise we have fallen madly in love with each other we must have this time to be together before it ends you do not expect to marry him cousin tom looked troubled i will not leave friarsgate and neither can he leave his glenkirk we both understand this tom and are content to have what time fate will allow us that is why when the king asked patrick to go to san lorenzo he said he would only obey if i might come with him soon enough our duties will call us to our own holdings tom i do not comprehend really what has happened and i certainly do not understand why it has happened but for the first time in my life i am in love and i am loved in return i have spent my life doing what was required of me now i require this little time for myself and i shall have it i will keep your secret cousin i will help you create this subterfuge and then i will return to friarsgate with your authority to watch over your daughters for you edmund guards your lands and he is an amusing companion although he will persist in beating me at chess it is not quite the winter i had envisioned but you are my beloved rosamund and i will do it when must we leave not until after twelfth night she said and logan hepburn what of him what am i to say when he comes calling what if he comes here to court before you escape i shall cross that bridge if we come to it she said and if he comes to friarsgate seeking me you will tell him i went off with a lover and tis all you know rosamund instructed her cousin i will not be bullied by that wild borderer hes in love with you cousin her companion said he wants a son of me she replied i will not be his broodmare tom let him get his son on another his family may force him to it now dear girl what will happen when you and lord leslie part and you decide that you want logan hepburn after all he asked her candidly then i shall allow him to become my lover she answered pertly if he indeed does love me for myself and not my fecundity he will be content with that tom you have changed my darling since oweins death he told her once you were a sweet innocent but now you have become a willful wildcat i love you nonetheless however and i do understand then you are probably the only one who does tom and i am grateful for it she responded softly thank you for being the best friend i have ever had or ever will have he shook his head at her lord leslie will not hurt you i know tis you i fear who may hurt yourself do not lose your common sense rosamund enjoy this idyll you are about to embark upon but keep a clear head i beg you i will dear tom she promised i am in love but i am not a fool and patrick i suspect will protect me from myself but who i wonder he said quietly will protect glenkirk chapter logan hepburn came to court on the last day of the old year he should have arrived a day earlier he told his cousin the earl of bothwell but the weather had slowed him down ive come to wed with my lass he said with a grin patrick hepburns look was disturbed why have you set your heart on this english girl logan are there not plenty of fine scots lasses for you to choose from cousin this woman is not for you logans blue eyes were at once curious and wary you have seen her he said aye and i will agree that she is fair and charming logan but she is not for you i fear the earl of bothwell said quietly logan shifted his large frame in the toosmall chair in which he was seated and why is rosamund bolton not the lass for me cousin his tone was decidedly dangerous patrick hepburn sighed he was annoyed by the position in which he found himself and troubled by his cousins insistence that he marry this englishwoman did you ever consider logan that rosamund bolton might not want to marry you or any other man right now he asked the younger man but i love her the laird of clavens carn replied it isnt enough to just love a woman logan his cousin began what has happened logan demanded there was no help for it the earl decided candor was the best route to take in this matter the lady has taken a lover cousin he is the earl of glenkirk and their passion for each other is both public and palpable you cannot possibly wed her now i will kill this earl of glenkirk logan shouted jumping from his chair i warned rosamund that i should destroy any man who tried to take her from me where is she where is he sit down logan his cousin ordered in a hard voice the earl of glenkirk is a cherished friend of the kings he is a widower with a grown son and grandchildren he has not been to court in almost two decades but the king invited him to stirling this christmas and he actually came he and rosamund bolton took one look at each other and while i do not pretend to understand it they were lovers that same night i am told they have contracted that rarest of conditions love you can do nothing about it logan their hearts are engaged and that is an end to it she knew i wanted her for my wife the laird said and he slumped again in the chair by the fire in his cousins apartments why did rosamund not understand did she say she would wed you logan was there an agreement legal and binding between you the earl probed if there was you are at least entitled to damages for her betrayal i told her i would come on st stephens day to marry her he answered and what did she reply the earl asked quietly logans blue eyes grew thoughtful with his memories of that day he and his clansmen had helped rosamund entrap the thieves who had been pilfering her sheep he had told her that while he was named for his mothers family logan his christian name was stephen after the saint and so he would come to wed her on st stephens day december she had sat there on her horse and her amber eyes had looked directly at him when she said i will not marry you but she hadnt meant it she couldnt have meant it she was just being coquettish as all women were apt to be in situations like that what did she reply his cousin repeated she said no logan told him but she was surely being coy obviously she was not the earl told him tartly i have seen her since she arrived here at stirling logan she does not strike me as a woman who dissembles or who blows this way and that and her passion for patrick leslie is startlingly pure as is his for her when you see them together you will understand you say he is an older man the laird asked his cousin aye the earl answered two of her husbands were older than she while the second of them got children on her they were but lasses is it possible cousin that she fears to wed with a young and vigorous man is that why she appears to fancy this graybeard lover patrick hepburn laughed aloud put such notions from you logan he advised while the earl of glenkirk has seen a half century he cannot be considered a graybeard he is handsome and vigorous indeed he seems to be in his prime and his devotion to rosamund bolton cannot be questioned i would swear there was sorcery involved if i believed in such things which i dont i will not give her up the laird of clavens carn said desperately i love her you have no choice logan you have no other choice the earl of bothwell shouted angrily now your brothers have been importuning me for months to find you a wife i have put them off respecting your pursuit of this englishwoman i can no longer as head of this clan branch ignore my duty to clavens carn i will find you a suitable wife logan and you will wed with her and get heirs on her for the sake of your family put rosamund bolton from your mind it is not my mind in which she has entrenched herself patrick it is my heart the laird said sadly my brothers have sons let one of them take my place one day as laird i will wed no one but rosamund bolton now where is she i cannot permit you to instigate difficulty over this woman the earl of bothwell said if i bring her to you and she tells you that she does not wish to wed with you will you give up this foolishness logan bring her to me he said the earl of bothwell looked closely at his cousin what madness do you plan bring her to me the laird repeated you may remain in the room to assure yourself that i plot no mischief cousin very well patrick hepburn said tomorrow after the mass until then you will remain here in my apartments logan i suspect it is better for us all that way will you agree i am content to stay here cousin came the reply the earl of bothwell sent a message to the king informing him of his cousins arrival at stirling and one to rosamund informing her of the same thing and asking that she attend him in his apartments on the morrow after the morning mass a page returned from the king acknowledging his missive and also saying that the lady of friarsgate would come to speak with the earl but as she was to accompany the queen riding she would come before the main meal of the day tell the lady of friarsgate that the time is suitable the earl told the page yes my lord the child answered then hurried off the queen rides in her condition the laird asked her ladies ride she travels in a padded cart the earl replied the following day rosamund came to the earl of bothwells apartments she was accompanied by her cousin lord cambridge patrick hepburn felt a moment of sorrow for his young cousin for the wench was exceedingly lovely she wore a dark green velvet gown trimmed in rich brown beaver the bodice embroidered with gold threads her little cap which was set back on her head allowed a glimpse of her rich auburn hair the earl smiled to himself for the woman had the lush sleek look of someone who was well loved aye logan had lost a prize but lost her he had you wished to see me my lord bothwell rosamund said tis my cousin logan hepburn who wishes to see you madame he replied rosamund paled slightly but then she responded he is here he awaits you in the room beyond the earl said pointing to a door he knows of course for you will have told him she said quietly bothwell nodded silently and he is angry it was a statement did you expect he would be otherwise madame i never agreed to wed him my lord i would have you know that for i am not a woman to give her word and then take it back my cousin will attest to my honesty she told him nay though why i cannot fathom tom said the lad is quite bonny as you scots are wont to say and he seems to have a passion for her the earl could not refrain from the small smile that touched his lips we hepburns do not take lightly to refusal be it the surrender of a castle or the surrender of a ladys heart my lord i am but the intermediary in this matter the lady of friarsgate and my cousin logan must settle this themselves will you take a dram of whiskey with me while we wait for your relation and mine to resolve the difficulty between them i will tom replied he patted his cousin upon her shoulder run along now dear girl and conclude this unpleasant business so both you and the laird can get on with your lives he gave her an encouraging nod rosamund sighed why could he not have just accepted my refusal she grumbled she looked to the earl have you settled on a wife for him his brothers will want him to marry with all possible haste my lord and he should i have a prospect or two madame but he is stubborn you will have to work hard to convince him that you will not marry him then i shall my lord for god help me i am so in love with glenkirk i can barely stand to be away from him even to keep the queen company rosamund said the earl of bothwell nodded go then madame and try to instill some sense of that truth into my cousin rosamund moved past patrick hepburn and opened the door to which she had been directed stepping through into a small paneled room beyond and drawing the portal closed behind her good morning logan she said softly did you not believe me when i said i should not wed you nay i did not he said belligerently what is the matter with you lass i am a man of property and i have offered you the honorable estate of marriage and my good name you would bear my bairns and mother the next laird of clavens carn rosamund i should never take friarsgate from you if that is your fear philippa is its heiress i have already told you that his wonderful blue eyes scanned her face for some sign of hope rosamund sighed deeply you do not understand logan and i wonder if you ever will she told him he was a handsome man but he was not complex in character understand what he demanded of her what is there to understand me she replied you do not understand me logan or how i feel widowed for the third time in twentytwo years i do not want another husband at least not now and if one day i again decide that i do want to marry i will do the choosing my uncle henry shall not decide for me margaret tudor shall not decide for me no one shall decide for me but me i have always done my duty done what was expected that the lady of friarsgate do now i would do what i want to do and playing the whore to some ancient highlander is your choice if that is so rosamund i question your judgment logan said scathingly patrick leslie has seen a half century it is true she replied quietly but he is not old in any way but most important to me logan hepburn is the fact that he loves me not once have you said you really loved me you have told me the story of seeing me in drumfie as a child and wanting me for a wife because i was such a pretty lass you say you would give me your name and the honorable position of wife you say you want me to bear your bairns but not once have you said that you really loved me you lust after me i know well patrick does love me and i him our eyes met that first time and it was like being struck by lightning we both knew in that instant and neither of us has looked back since of course i really love you you daft woman logan shouted did you not know it how could i know you did naught but babble about bairns she answered him and you could not divine it rosamund he demanded of her there was more between us than just neighborly camaraderie there was nothing between us she said firmly how could there be i do not really know you logan hepburn and what i do know i am not certain i even like you are bold my lord and arrogant you insinuated yourself into my wedding day with owein meredith and then when i was widowed of that good man you informed me that i would wed with you and bear your bairns you do not ask sir you inform me of your wishes well i will not have it i am a free woman of property and i have wed thrice to please others now i will please myself and patrick leslie no others find yourself a wife logan there must be one woman in scotland who would please you besides me it is your duty as lord of clavens carn to sire an heir and the next generation to follow you and your brothers you are a good man and you deserve a woman who will love you i love patrick leslie so you seek to be a countess he snarled cruelly i do not seek marriage with the earl of glenkirk logan he is no more capable of deserting glenkirk than i am of deserting friarsgate but so you understand he would have me if i would have him but i will not what i will have is my small bit of happiness before i must return to my duty as the lady of friarsgate i have found that happiness with the earl of glenkirk your duty as the lord of clavens carn is to marry i have heirs i have done what i should you have not my brothers have legitimate bairns logan said stubbornly but you are the direct line of descent at clavens carn she reasoned with him it is your sons who should inherit do not be so damned difficult logan you are behaving like a child who is hungry and given a bowl of porridge but wants meat instead eat your porridge logan eat it and be happy i cannot be happy without you he insisted then you shall never be happy she told him besides it is not up to me to make you happy each of us must seek and find our own happiness i have found mine go and find yours logan hepburn now i shall bid you farewell she turned to leave he cannot love you as i would logan said bitterly rosamund turned back and her face was lit by a happiness he could not even conceive you have no idea how he loves me but it pleaseth me right well she said one day you shall have the good fortune to make the comparison rosamund and then i shall be interested to hear what you say he told her she swallowed back the sharp retort that came to her lips and laughed instead will you always be so overly proud logan she wondered aloud a young man loves a woman differently than an old man your husband was old and your lover is old i think you may fear a young man he said softly i fear no man logan hepburn especially you she replied then she swept him a deep curtsy and left the room did you slay him cousin tom asked her humorously as she came forth into the earl of bothwells dayroom again he was warm with the earls good whiskey he is quite unharmed but for his pride rosamund replied with a smile and is he convinced you will not marry him bothwell queried her he is an enigma to me my lord i can make myself no plainer than i did yet i think he still harbors the hope i will wed with him my advice to you is to find him a very pretty and complaisant lass and marry him to her as quickly as you can if he is allowed to persist in this futile pursuit of me his brothers sons will inherit clavens carn one day but that is a matter for the hepburns to decide i thank you my lord for intervening in this concern between your cousin and me she curtsied to him i bid you good day coming tom she departed bothwells apartments lord cambridge scrambled to his feet my thanks for the whiskey my lord he said and he followed after rosamund when they had gone logan came forth from the little privy chamber where he and rosamund had been speaking he took the chair lately vacated by thomas bolton well the earl of bothwell said are you now satisfied that the lady of friarsgate is a lost cause she says they will not marry logan told his cousin there is yet hope for me when she has tired of this love affair and he goes back to his highlands have you no pride cousin the earl said i love her but the fault here is mine patrick i never convinced her of it i assumed that she must know my devotion all these years bespoke my love for her but i never convinced her of it and women it seems must hear those words convincingly to believe them how could i have been such a fool did she say she loved you logan his cousin queried pointedly nay but when she is quit of this passion she has for the earl of glenkirk she will return to friarsgate i will court her properly this time patrick and she will love me i know it there is no time cousin the earl said you are past thirty now and you must sire a legitimate heir i have found a bride for you and you will marry her before you leave stirling she is a distant cousin on your mothers side her name is jean logan shes just sixteen she is an only daughter and her mother has birthed her father five sons as well its a good match for you the lass has a generous gold dowry and a respectable trunkful of linens silver and other bridal gewgaws the king has given his approval you went to the king without my permission logan was outraged you had no right patrick ill not have this lass nay a thousand times nay i have every right cousin as clan chief and as such i will sign the betrothal papers today you have no excuses not to marry rosamund bolton will not have you and there is no other engaging your heart logan you must marry for the sake of clavens carn jeannie logan is a good lass pretty too she will make you an admirable wife she will make a good mother for your sons logan slumped forward his head in his hands i will not lose her he said brokenly you have already lost her to glenkirk cousin wed with little jeannie logan and take your bride home by this time next year you should have a son if you do your duty by your wife and you will i know the earl of bothwell told the younger man but i cannot love this girl logan protested you will learn to love her and if you dont you will not be so different from most men we wed to sire bairns try to get along with the lass treat her kindly and all will be well the earl of bothwell advised the laird of clavens carn let me see rosamund with glenkirk first i must be certain before i marry another patrick tonight then the king and queen are giving a masque and the court is invited you will see what we have all seen the passion between rosamund bolton and patrick leslie is unique and unusual i have never seen its like nor has anyone else i will see for myself logan said his cousin nodded in agreement and when you have seen it you will allow me to set the date for your marriage the laird of clavens carn was silent for a long moment then he sighed and said aye i will patrick good good the earl murmured pleased your family will be content now and will cease importuning me over this matter you will not be unhappy with my choice logan the girl is gentle of spirit and a virgin her father was planning to put her with the church when i asked him for the lass for you she is convent bred well mannered and knows everything she should about housewifery she will be an obedient wife and because she is devout to the holy mother church she will bring order into your family and will raise your bairns to be equally pious you are fortunate in this lass logan looked glum a pious virgin what more could a man ask for in a wife he thought he sighed again is she at least pretty patrick he asked the earl chuckled considering his cousins question a good sign aye she is quite pretty he repeated for the third time her eyes are as bonnie a blue as are yours her hair is the color of wildflower honey not light but not dark either her skin is unblemished and she has all of her teeth her form is nicely rounded where it ought although her bubbies are small still she is young and with regular caressing she will fill out nicely your sons will nurse comfortably from her teats and when do you propose i meet this pious virgin with the small bosom cousin logan asked the earl i will point her out to you tonight she is among the queens ladies for her own safety logan although how safe she is there i cannot guarantee let us set the wedding for twelfth night after i am certain you have breached her you may take her home you do not trust me then the laird said with a sarcastic smile it is a requirement of her fathers that the marriage be consummated immediately bothwell soothed the laird robert logan is an oldfashioned man cousin he would see the bloodied sheet made public the morning after the marriage is celebrated it is his right and it gives jeannie the protection she deserves surely you cannot object for your motives are honest laddie if i agree to the match aye my motives will be honorable logan said then in a few hours you will see rosamund bolton and patrick leslie together afterwards you will see wee jeannie logan and the die will be cast you will not regret wedding this lass tis a good decision you have made you and my family have forced me to it patrick i do not do this thing willingly the laird said quietly you cannot wait forever for the lovely lady of friarsgate to decide she wants to be your wife logan she has made it plain to you that she does not bothwell said nay what she has made plain is that i was an arrogant fool and i will now pay for it came the distraught reply accept what fate has handed you logan the earl advised and make the best of it you will be unhappy otherwise logan laughed bitterly rosamund advised me in similar terms to do the same thing just a little while back he said i begin to admire this lady myself cousin bothwell said she is wise beyond her years if you will not heed me then heed her i have no other choice logan said fear not patrick i will not make this little lass unhappy if i take her for my wife i will treat her with kindness and respect it is not her fault that i am a fool and the lady of friarsgate does not love me good good the earl said relieved he had painted robert logan a rosy picture of his only daughters life as mistress of clavens carn he didnt want it any other way the lass was a perfect choice for his cousin when evening came the earl of bothwell his cousin in his company went to the great hall to join the rest of the court the minstrels gallery was full and music wafted throughout the chamber which overflowed with revelers servingmen and wenches dashed back and forth with trays bowls of food and pitchers of wine and ale the hall was decorated with holly and pine beeswax candles and tapers burned everywhere the fireplaces full with huge logs burned bright they found their way to a table and sat down and the earl was greeted by many and introduced his companion goblets of wine were set down before them there were silver plates quickly filled with food and bread there at the table next to us the earl said softly to logan the laird turned and he felt his breath catch in his throat as he beheld rosamund bolton and her lover they were totally absorbed in each other and he had never seen her so beautiful as she was at that moment her face glowed with the open love she had for the man by her side his expression as he gazed back at her was utterly adoring gods blood logan said under his breath then he turned back to his cousin set the match with jean logan he said the earl of bothwell nodded quietly now laddie look to the end of this table do you see the lass in the blue gown that is jean logan what do you think logan turned and looked quickly for he did not wish to appear as if he were staring the lassie had a sweet face and a quick smile when the young man by her side spoke to her she has an admirer he noted but then she is fair she would tell me patrick that her young heart is not involved with another i would not take her away from someone who loved her she has been schooled for the convent since age eight she is newly come to court under the queens protection there is no one that i know of cousin the earl said do you know her patrick i do her father and i are friends of long standing came the answer does the lass know of your plans cousin the laird asked the earl she has an inkling bothwell responded she was told there was a possible match for her and she was to come to court to meet the gentleman what if rosamund bolton had not fallen in love with another and had agreed to be my wife logan queried then i should have found bonnie jean another suitable husband the earl replied but i do not have to do i logan nay you do not she is pretty she is young and being convent bred undoubtedly amenable if i cannot have rosamund this lass will do as well as any logan said resigned tis not such a bad fate cousin the earl noted come then and introduce us my lord the laird of clavens carn said the sooner the better if you want me wedded and bedded on twelfth night we should give the lass a little time to know the man she is to be shackled to for the rest of her life he arose from the table the earl with him together the two men walked to the end of the long board and patrick hepburn stopped within the young girls gaze she looked up stood quickly and curtsied to him my lord bothwell she said breathlessly her curious gaze going to the earls companion her cheeks were pink and her heart was beating rapidly what my bonnie jean it was uncle patrick the last time we met bothwell said jovially he tipped her small face up and gave her a quick kiss upon her lips you are being treated well in the queens household oh yes uncle patrick she replied well lassie youll not be there much longer for you are to be married but then your father told you it might be so didnt he aye came the soft answer her blush deepened then allow me to present my cousin whose mother god assoil her good soul was a member of your own clan this is logan hepburn the laird of clavens carn jean you will be married to him on twelfth night here at stirling mistress jean logan said bowing over the girls little hand as he took it up and kissed it the small hand trembled in his and he immediately felt protective of her she blushed again but she looked directly at him my lord he smiled at her thinking the blush charming poor little lass she had no choice in the matter and knew not what she was getting into at all and then in a flash he understood what rosamund had been forced to endure we have little time in which to get to know each other mistress jean he said to her we will have a lifetime together my lord she answered surprising him besides many girls never meet their bridegrooms until they are standing at the altar which he remarked can often be a shock she giggled on both sides my lord she replied quickly in that moment he decided he was going to like her he could only hope that she would like him i shall leave you two to become acquainted the earl of bothwell said to the pair and he moved quickly off there was a long awkward silence and then the laird of clavens carn took jeannies hand and said let us stroll away from the revelers and talk mistress i should like that jean logan responded moving by his side she was very petite and he towered over her i would tell you mistress jean that i require honesty above all things and so i must ask you if you are content to make this marriage with me i am my lord she said her voice was soft but it did not quiver and your heart is not engaged by any other he asked her for if it is i would not force you into a match my heart will be yours my lord and no others jean logan said honestly he nodded i have two brothers he began clavens carn is in the borders we are not rich but we are comfortable the house is snug and it will be yours to rule have you ever been wed before my lord she asked never mistress jean he answered her why not she wondered it is a long story he said i like stories she responded quietly he laughed i see that i shall be unable to hide anything from you mistress jean very well i have for many years sought the hand of an english neighbor her guardian would not consider a match and after he had seen her wed to two husbandsfor she was a child when those marriages were celebratedi thought to have my chance with her but the english king matched her with one of his own knights it was a good marriage there were children and then her husband was killed in an accident i sought her hand but she would not have me since i am past thirty my family appealed to lord bothwell to make a match for me as we are kin and so he has i think her a foolish lady my lord jeannie said softly having stopped so she might look up at him when she said it i shall not be unhappy to be your wife at all he smiled down at the young girl it might have been far worse he thought and while he would always regret rosamund he was going to be a good husband to this sweet lassie then i will certainly be content as well mistress jean and i think myself fortunate in having found you he bent down and kissed her lips softly to seal our bargain lassie he told her she blushed again i have never been kissed before by a lover she told him naively and now mine are the only lips your sweet ones shall know jean logan he said to her i shall take you back now and we will tell lord bothwell that we are content with this bargain he took her hand again and they reentered the crush of guests in the hall he sought out bothwell telling him we are agreed mistress jean and i cousin you may affix twelfth night as our wedding day excellent the earl of bothwell declared let us go and speak with the king now and he led them to where james stewart sat observing his court well my lord and what have you come to say for you are looking most arch this night the king remarked i do not believe highness that you have met my cousin logan hepburn the laird of clavens carn the earl began and this is his betrothed wife mistress jean logan who is a relation on his mothers side they seek your highness permission to be wed here at stirling on twelfth night day james stewarts dark eyebrows quirked was this not the man who desired the lovely lady of friarsgate for a wife he considered asking but realized that if this was the man of whom he had heard the sweetfaced lass by his side might not have known of her future husbands lust for rosamund bolton it mattered not the englishwoman was enamored of the earl of glenkirk and this border lord was to wed another they have our permission the king said and the marriage may be celebrated in my chapel the queen and i will serve as witness to this union then he smiled at them delighting in jean logans blue eyes which grew round with her excitement come here lassie he said and give your king a kiss now he held out his hand to her oh sir she exclaimed rosy with her blushes oh sir and catching up the outstretched hand she kissed it fervently then releasing the hand she curtsied deeply thank you my lord for this great honor and you logan hepburn are you satisfied with this matter the king probed his look was sharp and very direct i am advised by my cousin the earl and the rest of my small clan branch that it is past time for me to wed my lord mistress jean should make me a fine wife the laird of clavens carn said politically the king smiled cynically may god and his holy mother bless you both then and give you many bairns he said the impulsive laird had obviously seen the truth of rosamunds infatuation with lord leslie and given in to his familys pleas well the little lass was pretty and obviously well bred she would probably suit logan hepburn far better than the lovely englishwoman although right now he undoubtedly did not realize it they were dismissed and the trio made a final obeisance to the king and moved back into the crowd of courtiers james stewart leaned over and murmured to his queen the laird of clavens carn will be wed in our chapel twelfth night day to a young cousin who margaret tudor asked her husband a little lass called jean logan the king replied quietly i know her the queen said she has been among the women in my household for a fortnight bothwell brought her to me a sweet child you will want your fair english friend to know the king advised softly aye i will tell her i wonder if she will care she is so wrapped up in her passion for lord leslie that i doubt it margaret tudor said how she has changed from our days at my fathers court she was so young and ingenuous then now she is proud and fierce in her determination to have her own way i imagine that you are not the girl you once were either my queen the king said amused by his wifes astute observation of her old friend many years have passed since you were together meg a great deal has happened in each of your lives since that time the queen nodded aye she has borne three daughters and lost another husband while i have lost four bairns but i will not lose this child jamie i feel different this time this bairn is strong it virtually leaps in my womb she looked up at him her pretty face both sure and hopeful aye the king told his wife this child will live meg i know it relief flooded the queens face as she understood what he was saying to her she took his hand up and kissed it ardently thank you jamie thank you now lass you will have the whole court saying that the queen is in love with her husband if you go on like that he said gently disengaging himself from her grasp but i do love you she protested i do jamie i know meg he replied and i love you too he patted her cheek then turned away to speak with a courtier who had been attempting to catch his royal eye the evening was coming to an end the queen signaled to her little page and he was immediately at her side find the lady of friarsgate and tell her that i would speak with her now in my privy chamber aye highness the child answered and he hurried off the queen arose and her ladies were instantly clustered about her nay she said to them stay and enjoy yourselves i will be in my privy chamber and am not yet ready for bed remain here then she glided off moving silently across the chamber and down the corridor to her own apartments entering she told her servingwoman the lady of friarsgate is coming send her to me when she arrives aye highness the servant said curtsying margaret tudor entered her privy chamber and after sitting down by the blazing fire in the fireplace kicked off her shoes wiggling her toes with pleasure the door opened and rosamund entered fetch us some wine the queen said and then come sit with me i have some rather interesting news to impart rosamund did as she was bid and then after seating herself opposite her old friend she too kicked off her shoes ahh that is much better she said and she took a sip of wine do you have any feelings for logan hepburn the queen queried her friend nay what on earth do you mean meg i still find him as arrogant and as irritating as i ever have he is here at stirling you know i saw him at bothwells insistence i told him i would not wed him that i loved patrick leslie he is to be married twelfth night day the queen exclaimed who is to be married rosamund asked puzzled logan hepburn he is to marry that sweet little jean logan who has been in my household these past few weeks that quiet little lass with the big blue eyes who hardly says a word rosamund asked gods blood bothwell did not wait long to propose that although i suspect he had it planned all along then you do not mind margaret tudor sounded disappointed nay meg i do not mind it is past time logan hepburn gave up this childish fantasy about me and married he needs an heir and he has a duty to his family nay i am pleased he has seen reason at long last you really are in love with patrick leslie then the queen asked i really am in love with him rosamund replied i hold myself responsible for what has happened to you the queen said if i had not invited you to visit me you should never have met patrick leslie logan hepburn might have even forced you to the altar rosamund i have saved you once again as i saved you from my brother all those years ago rosamund laughed it is true meg though until now i never thought of it that way if i had not come to see you at this moment in time i should not have met patrick leslie but believe me when i tell you logan hepburn would have never forced me to the altar if i ever marry again it will be for love alone and the choice will be mine to make and no one elses you remember grandmothers advice the queen chuckled i do indeed meg the venerable margaret was a great woman and i admired her muchly i wonder what she would think of us today i think she would approve of your exchanging logan hepburn for the earl of glenkirk no matter he is an old man she always considered a woman advancing her status in life a good thing will you marry lord leslie nay rosamund said quietly and before you ask meg or attempt to interfere let me explain patrick has a duty to glenkirk i have a duty to friarsgate neither of us will eschew our duty we both comprehend that and we are content this is the way it must be between us i know you will not understand but you must not meddle meg promise me that you will not involve yourself in this matter the queen sighed i just want you to be happy she said we are happy rosamund told her but one day you will part from each other meg replied i know rosamund said that is what makes whatever time we have together all the sweeter meg no one is ever happy constantly i should rather have these days with the earl of glenkirk than with any other man i should rather know this perfect happiness for even a short span in my life than to never know it at all what memories we are making together what dreams of the past we shall cherish when we are no longer with each other in the years to come you are far braver than i am rosamund and i should have never thought it of you the queen said softly she sighed i need the security of a marriage i need to know that my husband is there for me even if he does stray now and again you are really alone and you are not afraid i think i have been alone my entire life until now rosamund answered but you wrote that owein loved you the queen protested oh he did meg and i was so fortunate to have him as my husband but owein was raised to a life of service to his betters he always stood slightly in awe of me as the lady of friarsgate he always deferred to me bless him not once did he ever corrupt my authority and he loved friarsgate did you love him too the queen wondered he seemed like the right match for you back then when we were girls at my fathers court aye i learned to loved him which is why i know what i have with patrick leslie is so much more my love for the lord of glenkirk is something that comes only rarely meg that is why i will not let it go until i have to let it go she smiled what a serious conversation we are having and all because you wanted to tell me that logan hepburn is to be wed in a few days i wish him good fortune wish the bride good fortune the queen said and she chuckled she is certain to tell him if you do so and you will have your own back on him for teasing you the day you wed with owein i am certain that he still loves you rosamund this marriage is for his familys sake all he could talk about was his need for an heir when he was with me i felt like a prize mare or heifer yet when i spoke with him in lord bothwells apartments he said i should have understood that he loved me even if he didnt say so rosamund replied she shook her head how just like a man the queen exclaimed and she laughed aye rosamund agreed how just like a man then she sipped her wine thoughtfully i hope he will be happy for i am so happy myself i can but wish him the same you always had a good heart the queen said i am glad to have you with me again rosamund do you miss your friarsgate as much as you ever did she smiled not as i did when i was a young girl rosamund answered the queen it is my lasses meg that i miss the most kate insisted after oweins death that i come to their court and i could not disobey but it was hard philippa the eldest knew that i was gone and missed me the most though maybel says she is like me and is a good child the two little ones however did not understand i was almost a stranger to them when i returned and then my invitation came margaret tudor said i might have refused you meg but we were such good friends i could not besides it is not as long a journey as going down into england rosamund replied with a small smile and my invitation was a convenient excuse to escape the laird of clavens carn the queen said laughing mischievously aye it was rosamund agreed grinning the priest at friarsgate is his kinsman but he would not have forced the issue if i said nay still in all it would have been difficult here at stirling logan is overruled in his intentions by the earl of bothwell i do not think patrick hepburn was pleased with the idea his cousin might marry an englishwoman when i told him he need not fear i would wed his cousin i asked if he had a lass for logan he told me one or two the devil when all along he had the little mistress jean in mind hes a clever man this particular hepburn margaret tudor noted he supported my husband even before the breach with the late king jamie never forgets those who are loyal to him he was simply the hepburn of hailes until jamie created him the first hepburn earl of bothwell he has risen high in the hierarchy of this kingdom and he brings his family along with him as is right and proper my husband has a good friend in him if he had asked jamie for you for logan hepburn rosamund you would have been wedded and bedded whether you would or nay but i am english rosamund cried shocked that would have made no matter the queen told her if the earl of bothwell had desired it it would have been so had you not fallen so publicly and passionately in love rosamund you would not have escaped logan hepburn here at stirling indeed you would have been shoved directly into his arms she laughed softly but fate did indeed intervene to save you i have never particularly believed in fate but perhaps in light of all that has happened to you i will now rosamund had gone pale but now she laughed weakly mayhap i too will believe in fate as well from now on meg there was a discreet knock upon the door of the queens privy chamber come in the queen called and the door opened to reveal one of the queens chamber women yes jane what is it margaret tudor asked little mistress logan would speak with you madame she says she will not take a great deal of your time jane said margaret tudors blue eyes twinkled wickedly as she looked to rosamund tell mistress logan that she may come in jane she replied the chamber woman stepped aside and jean logan entered the room she curtsied deeply to the queen but her eyes were surprised to see the queens companion madame i have come to tell you that the king has given his permission for my marriage to logan hepburn the laird of clavens carn to be celebrated on twelfth night day i hope that we may also have your highness permission and blessing jeannie logan stood before margaret tudor her head modestly lowered her hands folded neatly this is sudden child isnt it the queen said tell me how this has all come about so quickly i hope that you have not been forced to any imprudent decision oh nay madame i am more than content to marry the laird i was to enter the convent where i had been schooled but uncle patrick the earl of bothwell madame was seeking a good wife for his kinsman and asked my father for me while i venerate our dear lord and his blessed mother i have no calling to the church but my dower portion is not large and none had asked for me my father thought in that light that perhaps the convent was the place for me when my father said my dower was slight uncle patrick added a purse to it at first my father protested but uncle patrick said since i was his goddaughter and he had scarce seen me in the last few years it seemed only right that he do it then he told my father what a fine man his kinsman was and how he had put his family and their welfare ahead of his own needs but now he was ready to wed my father could not refuse under such circumstances then uncle patrick told my father that his kinsmans mother had been a member of the clan logan but we are not closely related or within the forbidden bonds of consanguinity and so the church has given us a dispensation to marry you already have the dispensation my child the queen purred solicitously oh yes uncle patrick said his kinsman was eager to wed and so the sooner the better jeannie logan confided ingenuously how fortunate you are to have your uncle patrick the queen murmured the earl of bothwell has always been known for his kindness but my child how rude of me this is my friend lady rosamund bolton of friarsgate oh i know who she is jeannie said innocently do you rosamund answered her and who am i mistress logan you are lord lesliesfriend my lady the girl replied i am rosamund admitted and you shall be neighbors the queen said wickedly friarsgate is just over the border in england it is practically a stones throw from clavens carn do you not know logan hepburn rosamund slightly rosamund responded through gritted teeth i believe he and his brothers were guests when my late husband and i were wed had meg not been a queen rosamund thought she would have smacked her but madame it is late and in your delicate condition you need your rest she arose i shall leave you taking mistress logan with me do give her your permission and blessing for that is what she came fordidnt you mistress logan aye my lady jeannie said you have both then my child my husband and i shall come and bear witness to your vows on twelfth night day and rosamund you will come too with lord leslie the queens eyes were dancing with mischief if you so command madame rosamund responded but your chapel is small and mistress logan will want her family there oh no my lady my family is in the north and will not be here i think it would be lovely to have a neighbor with us on our happy day please come make your curtsy to the queen mistress logan rosamund said i will speak with lord leslie she practically pushed the girl from the queens little privy chamber murmuring softly to meg as she did i shall repay you in kind for this you bad creature god bless you my child the queen called and grinning from ear to ear she closed the door into her anteroom behind them chapter there was a storm on twelfth night day outside stirling castle the snow swirled in twisted whorls that were blown about by winds that howled mournfully through the narrow streets of the town and about the castles stone towers in the earl of bothwells apartments the laird of clavens carn adjusted his garments as he prepared to depart for the royal chapel you can have your privacy here tonight patrick hepburn said ill find another place to sleep you wont be able to leave stirling until this storm has blown itself out and down into england thank you logan replied glumly his cousin laughed all men feel this way on their wedding day a thousand questions run through your head did i do the right thing will i love her will she give me sons and not daughters will she object if i take a mistress will i have to beat her he chuckled but we marry nonetheless logan and young jeannie will make you a fine wife shes already half in love with you and eager to please keep her that way laddie and your life will be a happy one rosamund is coming to the wedding logan answered what the hell is she coming to my wedding for patrick i didnt ask her to come is it possible she regrets her hasty decision put the idea from your thoughts laddie the earl advised she is coming to your wedding because the queen insisted she come and she will be on lord leslies arm she has no regrets at all why would she trade a simple border lord for her earl the lass is no fool logan but you stand in danger of being one if you allow your bruised heart to overrule your common sense this day let her go and concentrate on the lovely lassie who will be your wife shortly he adjusted the fur collar of his cousins midcalflength burgundy velvet coat the garment was lined in the same fur as were its sleeves which were flared beneath the gown he wore hautdechausses and silk hose striped in burgundy black and gold a linen shirt with a ruffle was visible beneath his fur collar you look quite handsome cousin if i may say so i feel like a damned prized goose all done up for roasting logan grumbled i think you had these wedding clothes waiting for me patrick i did the earl admitted with a broad grin you had this whole damned affair planned too ill vow the laird continued i did patrick hepburn said what if rosamund had agreed to marry me what then cousin logan demanded come now cousin it is time for us to depart for the chapel the earl replied ignoring the question he took the younger man by the arm and together they walked from the earls apartments the queen and her women had kindly seen to the young bride margaret tudor giving the girl one of her own gowns which had been quickly altered to fit the reedslim girl it was peachcolored velvet with an underskirt embroidered and quilted with large gold flowers the neckline was low and square and fitted tightly the long tight sleeves had fur cuffs an embroidered hanging girdle was wrapped about the brides waist gracious rosamund murmured so that only the queen might hear her there is enough material here for another gown ill vow i do not remember you this plump meg she smiled sweetly jamie likes a woman with meat on her bones the queen murmured back besides this girl is very slim still her husband will put a bairn in her belly no matter do you think logan hepburn is a good lover i wouldnt know meg rosamund said softly do watch your tongue else poor jeannie will hear you then take back what you said about my being plump the queen muttered my memory of our youth grows faulty madame rosamund said the queen giggled i accept your apology she whispered now what shall our bride wear on her head ladies oh madame said tillie the queens chief tiring woman do you not remember a virgin going to her wedding wears her hair loose to indicate her virtue you did on your wedding day and i will wager that mistress rosamund did too i did indeed tillie rosamund replied where is your jewelry the queen asked jeannie logan i have none madame the bride answered here take these pearls rosamund said generously removing a strand from about her neck they are a wedding present jeannie logan from your neighbor the lady of friarsgate she slipped the long strand about the girls neck there they make the gown even lovelier oh lady rosamund i could not the girl cried but she was already fingering the pearls longingly of course you can rosamund replied they are perfect as are you logan hepburn is a fortunate man make certain he knows it jeannie thank you my lady i shall tell him how kind you have been to me the girl said ingenuously yes rosamund agreed do tell him and say i wish you both much happiness jeannie perhaps you will allow me to entertain you when i return to friarsgate she smiled at the girl as they escorted the bride to the royal chapel margaret tudor leaned over and whispered to her old friend you do have a bit of the bitch in you rosamund this is another revelation i have naught against the lass meg it is her arrogant mate my words were for and i know she will repeat them as i have said them and they will sting him this is repayment for what he did on my wedding day to owein at the chapel door the earl of bothwell was waiting to escort the bride they left her with him and entered the queen moved swiftly to the front of the room where her husband awaited her they would formally witness the vows rosamund slipped into her seat next to patrick he took her hand immediately in his no regrets my darling he asked softly none she told him smiling the bridegroom came forth and the bride was led to him by the earl of bothwell the priest shook his censer of incense over them while the candles on the altar flickered and the storm outside moaned mournfully the mass began logans eye went just once to rosamund she was standing next to the earl of glenkirk gazing up at him adoringly it was as if a hand had reached out and squeezed his heart to half its size then he felt the small hand slipping into his and he looked down into the sweet face of his bride she gave him a tremulous smile and unable to help himself he smiled back at her poor lassie she wasnt responsible for his heartbreak nay twas that brazen false bitch boldly standing with her lover he would put her from his heart and give what was left of it to this sweet lass who was about to become his wife the bride spoke her vows in a soft but clear voice the bridegroom spoke his in a loud almost defiant voice the ceremony over the wedding party adjourned to the great hall of stirling castle to join the rest of the court in the twelfth night celebration the long holiday was about to come to an end and the winter was setting in with a vengeance the entire court drank to the health and long life of the newly wed couple there was much jesting and the bride was soon rosy with her blushes patrick took rosamund aside we must depart in two days he said in a low voice remember you can take but a few necessaries my love i know but annie must pack for me as if i am leaving court for home she answered i can but hope the weather clears it may be better if it doesnt glenkirk told her were less apt to encounter the english at sea if the weather remains foul they have no real navy although the kings brotherinlaw seeing our jamies success in building ships is embarking on the same course youre sure you would come absolutely rosamund told him are you having second thoughts my lord nay i cannot imagine my life without you now rosamund he told her one day she began he stopped her lips with his fingers but not now she nodded i hope the queen believes me she said i had best speak with her now while i can she leaned over and gave him a quick kiss upon the lips then rose from the board where she had been seated with him and other guests finding her way to the high board rosamund caught the queens eye margaret tudor beckoned her forward and rosamund hurried to her side i have just received word highness that philippa my eldest daughter is dangerously ill how the messenger got through in this storm is a miracle but i must depart for friarsgate as soon as the storm clears rosamund said one of your own people came the queen said i would see him and commend him for his diligence nay madame not one of my people they are simple folk and would not know how to travel to edinburgh and then on to stirling it was a messenger hired by my uncle edmund i didnt even see him he asked for me and was directed to annie she took the message and came to find me immediately after the mass rosamund said ah the queen said disappointed must you leave me rosamund i did so want you here for this birth i have missed you and we have had such fun these last few weeks you have had fun teasing me rosamund said with a smile i will try to return in time for the princes birth meg she felt guilty lying to her old friend especially in light of how good margaret tudor had always been to her but the queen could not know the truth about the earl of glenkirks mission to san lorenzo and rosamund knew she could not allow her lover to leave her at this point the queen nodded you are a good mother rosamund go home and tend to your daughter but please come back when you can we will speak again before i leave you rosamund responded then she curtsied and moved off the festivities went on the day long and into the evening there was food and drink in abundance there was music and dancing a troupe of entertainers was allowed into the hall they had a bear with a polished brass collar on a chain that danced to flute and drum there were several men who juggled shiny balls and pastries from the tables there was a blind girl who sang like an angel while accompanying herself on a small harp and finally there were acrobats who tumbled and leapt across the hall causing the spectators to ooh and ahh with delight when the entertainers had departed the hall it was time to put the bride and groom to bed in the earl of bothwells comfortable apartments rosamund did not join in this rough rite it is as good a time as any for us to make our escape patrick whispered to her with a smile rosamund nodded i cannot imagine what poor logan would think if he found me among the women who prepared his wife for the bridal bed she chuckled i gave the lass my pearls as a wedding gift which should prick him enough revenge for your own wedding day my sweet lord cambridge said as he came to her side you are learning how to fight back my pet i am proud of you i have nothing against the lass tom rosamund said actually she is perfect for him she will obey his every wish and whim she will dutifully produce children and keep his house in perfect order and shell get little thanks for it for logan will believe it is his due if the pearls pleased her good if it distresses him each time she wears them good would you believe that she was once as meek and mild as one of her lambs tom said with a grin to the earl of glenkirk i like a woman with a wee bit of spice the earl of glenkirk responded with a smile then you have surely found her in rosamund lord cambridge chortled i have told the queen i must return to friarsgate because philippa is ill rosamund said quietly to her cousin ah so our time at this delightful court is finished he noted it was too short my pet we must come back one day promise me we shall if i am to spend my winter watching over your lasses i must have my reward you shall have it tom she promised if it were not for my girls i should leave you here to pursue all manner of naughtiness and there are so many delights for a discreet gentleman to enjoy he sighed of course one must really be quite discreet there are still those who remember this kings father and his favorites the stewarts do seem to blow this way and that tom bolton grinned glenkirk laughed and you have indeed been discreet tom i have heard no rumors of bad behavior at all in fact several of the ladies have remarked that it is a pity a gentleman of your breeding has no wife what they mean the wicked creatures he laughed is a gentleman with my purse patrick but i prefer an unencumbered life my dears and rosamund and her daughters are my heirs she is my nearest kin we are like brother and sister and a better friend i never had dear tom rosamund told him patrick and i will now retire but you are free to enjoy as much of this court as you can until we must go in a few days she blew him a kiss as she departed the great hall in the little bedchamber that was their sanctuary rosamund and her lover undressed each other slowly as they prepared for bed he was teaching her the lesson of patience although it was not easy for her again she silently asked herself how it was possible that she had fallen so deeply so desperately in love with this man who less than a month ago was totally unknown to her she had no answers today any more than she had had answers yesterday or would have them tomorrow she knew only that she must be with patrick in his arms in his bed in his heart what would your son think of us she asked him as she undid the silk ribbons holding her chemise closed he would think me fortunate to have found love again glenkirk said my daughterinlaw however would think me mad she would say things like at your age my lord and she would purse her narrow lips in disapproval anne has a hard heart would that adam had known it before he wed with her but he is content he seems to know how to manage her though she be shrewish he pushed the chemise from her shoulders and lifted her naked from the silken pile of material now about her ankles i wonder if we shall ever meet she said unlacing his shirt and pulling it off him does he look like you or does he favor his mother he is tall and is said to have my features but his eyes are his mothers agnes had the bonniest blue eyes i have ever seen on a woman and adam has those eyes i think that is what first attracted his wife to him he drew rosamunds naked form against his bare chest i love the feel of your nipples on my skin he told her she grew dizzy with the simple pleasure of his body against hers you are nothing like owein or even hugh she told him im glad he answered and his lips brushed lightly over hers rosamunds breath was coming in small quick bursts she could feel the hard length of him against her will you get out of those damned hautdechausses she said through gritted teeth her hand smoothed down along the rigid stretch tch tch lassie he scolded her have you no patience not where you are involved patrick leslie she told him i admit that i am a shameless wench where you are concerned i must teach you better rosamund passion is best savored and enjoyed slowly you want to gobble but i will not allow it he loosed his hold on her and pulled off the last of his garments then reaching for her again he turned her so her back was to him and he might gather her lovely round breasts into his hands to enjoy he fondled the fleshy globes tenderly all the while rubbing his manhood against her buttocks and between the cleft that separated those twin moons rosamund sighed and relaxed against him he was right this was much better than a quick coupling the teasing anticipation was arousing her to new heights oh patrick she said softly that is so very very nice my darling we have only just begun my love he told her then he turned her about to face him and kissed her deeply his mouth hot and eager their tongues met caressed dueled for superiority they tasted each other and then he lifted her up and carried her to their bed laying her gently down and joining her his big hands brushed over her torso and she sighed he turned her over onto her stomach and began massaging her back and her shoulders his fingers dug into her prettily rounded bottom and then her thighs he massaged her feet rubbing any soreness that might have been there from them it is better of course with lotion or oil he explained in san lorenzo they make the most delicious treats for the body rosamund and i intend to introduce you to them all they are lush and sensuous and you will love what they do to your body my love then he murmured a soft command to her and when she positioned herself with raised buttocks he entered her womanly passage slowly and then began to pump her vigorously until rosamund was whimpering with her pleasure thats it my pet he whispered hotly in her ear enjoy the delights i can offer you it has been a very long time since i wanted a woman as much as i want you and even having you it is not enough he thrust harder and deeper until she was screaming softly with her lustful satisfaction oh god patrick please dont stop i could not bear it if you stopped she halfsobbed there is more my love he promised her and then he continued on until he could no longer hold back his own desires his love juices flooded her and she wept i cannot bear to think of the time when we must part she told him her face wet with her tears do not consider it my love he counseled her we have much time ahead of us i promise you and he was kissing her face her lips and she was sighing with her happiness in their love while outside the single window in the room the storm raged on but they neither knew nor cared the following afternoon the snow had finally abated and the late day was clear as was the night that followed they would leave on the morrow to rosamunds surprise the laird of clavens carn and his bride were to travel with them then he shall know that i have not gone home to friarsgate rosamund said distressed i have already spoken to the king but he says there is no help for it the queen made the arrangements for she thought it would be safer for you to travel with the lairds party the king can say nothing lest he reveal his plans he dare not or england will learn of scotlands plans glenkirk said i can but appeal to logan hepburns patriotism when we leave them for the leith road he can certainly keep his wife quiet and i shall keep her friendly and amused for the journey tom added she will be feeling a bit strange going to her new home for the first time and i will help to ease her fears i shall keep logan hepburns friendship for friarsgate despite your bad behavior cousin tom teased and he grinned at her with a wicked wink glenkirk laughed you are a valuable ally tom and i thank you for it do not think to wheedle me my dear lord tom said i am still quite put out that i must go back to friarsgate in the snow while you whisk my fair cousin and best friend off to the balmy shores of san lorenzo i shall expect a great favor in return one of these days and you shall receive whatever it is your good heart desires glenkirk replied within reason of course one mans reason is anothers unreason tom said with a chortle you must bring me sweet mediterranean wines and some of your own whiskey if i am to be recompensed and i shall bring you jars of olives stored with lemon and oil in stone crocks for a year san lorenzan olives are considered a rare delicacy the earl of glenkirk told lord cambridge i wish you could taste their grapes they are the sweetest i have ever known say not another word dear man for i am already regretting my decision to remain at friarsgate oh tom you must my lasses will not be safe without you there rosamund cried dear cousin i have given you my word and i will indeed go to friarsgate to watch over those three little angels you spawned but i will nonetheless regret that i am not with you tom said you can teach them court manners rosamund teased him they can certainly use my tutelage he sniffed especially philippa who should know better than to squat and pee when she is outdoors with the other children and nature calls to her a proper young lady uses her chamber pot you will tell her that of course dear tom rosamund said laughing you are quite enjoying my distress he grumbled well i am not the one whose bottom will be red each day from all the riding you have ahead of you while you gallop through the worst of the winter weather i shall be snug at friarsgate with your good maybel watching over me and cosseting me with her kind heart and good cooking and what am i to tell her cousin i have written a letter to her tom she will ask you all manner of questions despite it but you may answer her honestly rosamund told him quietly she will blame poor meg for my behavior of course rosamund concluded with a smile aye she will not believe this reckless behavior of you my dear girl he agreed i must go and bid the queen farewell now rosamund said and she left the two men together by the fire in the great hall where they had all been seated the queen was feeling quite well when rosamund arrived to see her i have never felt better in these circumstances she declared the kings prediction will be a true one then rosamund responded his predictions are always true margaret tudor replied it is sometimes quite eerie so you are leaving me my old friend my visit has been wonderful rosamund declared and i promise i shall come back to see you when i can you will not let the war separate us the queen asked what war rosamund was puzzled the one that my brother henry will certainly force upon my husband and scotland the queen said this marriage between us was to settle the matter for good and all but it has not and it is all hals fault he presses jamie at every turn my husband however is far wiser than my brother but eventually hal will make war on scotland and you and i will be separated again rosamund if there is indeed a war i shall not allow it to harm the friendship that we formed back at your fathers court when we were children meg whatever the men of this world may do we women shall remain friends i shall try and be here for your sons christening she promised if not sooner what of lord leslie the queen asked unable to help herself he is coming with me rosamund said he says he is not needed at glenkirk now as his son is capable of managing their lands and besides it is easier for him to come with me to friarsgate than to get back into his highland eyrie with this weather then you shall not be separated the queen said oh rosamund i am glad for all i have teased you i can see that you love him and he you it is so strange but there it is god bless you both why thank you meg rosamund said and then she embraced the queen the following day dawned clear and very cold it would take them two days to ride to leith scotlands main port on firth of forth logan assumed that they were riding to edinburgh they might have made the journey in a single day but that lord leslie did not feel young mistress hepburn was up to such a trip she is young but delicately made he noted it will be a hard enough venture for her i fear they overnighted at an inn near linlithgow it was a small establishment and the two women were put into a chamber with another female traveler and annie while the men were shown into a dormitory with others of their sex rosamund found their situation very amusing until the bride sought to confide in her madame jeannie began you are a lady of some experience and i mean you no disrespect when i say that but i need a womans advice gods boots rosamund thought to herself but she drew a deep breath and said are you certain you are not violating a confidence mistress hepburn some things are meant to remain between a wife and her husband nay i do not believe i tell a tale i should not i simply wish to know whether all men are so enthusiastic in their bed sport and how often is it proper for a husband to couple with his wife she blushed as she spoke the color rising swiftly to stain her pale cheeks you are fortunate in your husbands enthusiasm rosamund replied it means he enjoys your company and he may have your favors as often as he desires them unless of course you are well along with child or your monthly courses are upon you men enjoy their bed sport differently than women do it is the way god made them aye you are right jeannie said slowly thank you my mother died when i was ten and i was sent to the convent the nuns do not know about such things nor would they speak of them if they did it is too worldly rosamund asked were you unhappy to leave the convent mistress hepburn nay but i had no sister or friend or other lady with whom to speak about these intimate things and i went to my marriage bed quite ignorant but my husband was very kind and most patient with me jeannie concluded i am glad rosamund told her men sometimes do not understand innocence they can be rough creatures they mean no harm usually it is just their way oh thank you madame jeannie said and the gratitude in her voice was palpable i did not know what to think may i ask one more question of you oh lord save me but rosamund nodded smiling of course is it proper that i enjoy it when my husband and i couple came the naive query did you enjoy it rosamund was fascinated in spite of herself oh very much jeannie admitted blushing deeply once again it is proper rosamund told her indeed it is good that you do i suppose we should get some sleep jeannie said softly i expect tomorrow and the days to follow will be long ones is it far to clavens carn if the weather holds it will take you several more days past edinburgh rosamund told the young girl your home is on the border and you are nearer to england than anything else scotch i have been told the english are very fierce madame is it true jeannies blue eyes were wide with her interest i am english mistress hepburn do you find me fierce rosamund teased the girl gently jeannie giggled nay madame go to sleep then lass and do not worry yourself so much you have married a good man and you will be happy at clavens carn rosamund told her in the morning they departed even before the sun was up riding for several hours until they reached a fork in the road where there were two directional signs one said edinburgh and the other said leith the earl of glenkirk stopped in the crossroad and tom rode up next to him tis here we part company tom patrick said quietly and he signaled to logan to join them keep the ladies company and make your farewells to your cousin while i speak with the laird godspeed patrick lord cambridge said i hope we will meet again he shook the earls hand then moved off to join rosamund and mistress hepburn what is this about my lord logan demanded he was not at all happy that he had been traveling with this man and rosamund for the past two days what i am about to tell you logan hepburn must go no farther i tell you this on the kings order do you understand the laird nodded now intrigued i understand my lord and you have my word that whatever you tell me i will not repeat the queen the earl began enjoys a good jest she found it amusing not aware of why we were really departing the court to put us together in our travels she believes that rosamunds daughter is ill and rosamund is going to her she believes i am accompanying rosamund she is fully aware of the relationship you desired to forge with the lady of friarsgate and thinks it humorous that you and your bride travel with us but rosamunds daughter is not ill and we are not going to friarsgate the king has delegated me to undertake a secret diplomatic mission for him as you are aware i have not been to court or out of my highlands for eighteen years consequently no one would even consider that the king would appoint me to such a duty nor is anyone other than the king aware of what i am to do or where i am going i cannot even tell you logan hepburn i told the king i would do his bidding if rosamund could come with me what if she hadnt wanted to go the laird demanded he was in spite of it all jealous of this man who had somehow stolen rosamund from him rosamund loves friarsgate and dislikes being away from it for very long nonetheless she agreed to go with me the earl of glenkirk said quietly how can you love each other so on such short acquaintance logan burst out unable to help himself from the question i do not know the earl admitted honestly all i can tell you is that until rosamund i had just existed and i never even knew it from the moment our eyes met we have desired nothing more than to be together she will never desert friarsgate logan said nor will i desert glenkirk but until the time comes when we must return to our duties however long a time that is we shall be together do you love her he asked his look tortured i have always loved her came the strange reply she loves you logan said almost bitterly aye she does patrick said simply that you are leaving us here says you are going to leith the laird of clavens carn said we sail tonight was the reply rosamund was never a girl for adventure logan remarked she has changed so suddenly that i cannot believe she is the same girl have you bewitched her my lord the earl of glenkirk laughed nay he said although we both considered such a thing that first night she has told me she isnt adventurous and yet she is willing to come across a sea with me such is the power of our love but it is not witchcraft logan hepburn now tom bolton will travel with you as far as clavens carn and rosamund would appreciate it if your clansmen would escort him over the border back to friarsgate he holds her authority so that her uncle henry cannot interfere should he learn she isnt there she fears for her lasses will you do that for her there is nothing she could ask me that i would not do logan said laddie laddie the earl replied shaking his head at the younger man bothwell gave you a sweet wife be true to her and put my fair rosamund from your thoughts she would not have wed you even if we had not met she is not ready to remarry and i know she tried to explain that to you but you would not hear what she had to say you wanted a wife upon whom to get your heirs you have one take her back to clavens carn and put a bairn in her belly rosamund and i will be far away from scotland and when you return my lord the laird asked i do not know but when we do return i hope we shall hear that you have a healthy son logan hepburn he held out his hand now shake my hand for i already have your word that you will not divulge what we have discussed then bid us godspeed if i can accomplish what the king desires we may prevent a war the laird of clavens carn took the earl of glenkirks big gloved hand and shook it then i do bid you godspeed my lord and reassure you again that my lips are sealed in your secret matter tell rosamund that i will see tom bolton is brought safe and sound back to friarsgate then he turned his mount and rejoined his wife and the clansmen who were accompanying them rosamund and tom moved forward the englishman took his cousins hand in his be careful dearest girl and come home safe to us when you can he said you have the letter for maybel and edmund she asked him for the third time i do he said and he kissed her hand godspeed cousin tom told her and then he rejoined the lairds party as they moved off down the road to edinburgh you are certain patrick asked rosamund she nodded i am then she turned to annie tis now or never lassie im coming annie said firmly twill be something to tell my grandchildren one day she finished with a grin then let us go the earl said and he signaled to his manservant dermid more the little party of four each mounted turned onto the leith road and headed for the port the day remained very cold but bright they reached leith in the late afternoon as the sun was setting behind them making their way to the mermaid inn on the waterfront it was a large and prosperous establishment and its courtyard was bustling busily dermid dismounted first and went into the inn he returned a few moments later captain daumier is awaiting us in a private room my lord he reported well go in then you know the way dermid the earl asked sliding off his horse and then helping rosamund from hers dermid nodded then aided annie to dismount my bottom is fair sore annie said with a sigh she followed her mistress and the earl into the inn as dermid led the way it was a back route and they neatly avoided the public rooms by taking it at the end of a narrow hallway was a door and dermid knocked upon it then opened the portal to usher his master and their party inside a portly gentleman arose from a chair by the fire and came forward lord leslie he asked i am patrick leslie the earl replied the gentleman nodded jeanpaul daumier captain of la petite reine he said i was told we are to sail tonight captain is everything on schedule patrick leslie queried but of course my lord came the firm answer the weather is fair and will remain that way for a few more days thanks to le bon dieu we have good northwest winds and your passage should be a swift one be advised that i will be hugging the english coast for several days so that if the weather turns we can make port safely well cross the strait of dover to calais then sail on to boulogne and if the weather is still good i can get you as far as le havre but no farther the weather will turn sooner than later and ill not cross the bay of biscay at this time of year im just a coastal freighter i understand the earl said and having made that passage several times i will certainly agree with you captain daumier will we be safe however within sight of the english coast oui the english for all they proclaim the french their enemies are always happy to see me my lord especially the wine merchants and their rich customers captain daumier said with a broad smile if we should be boarded i have enough empty barrels aboard to confirm my story and you are just a gentleman running away from his wife with his amour eh he chuckled the earl of glenkirk laughed nonetheless i hope we are not stopped it is unlikely the captain told him these english are not good sailors but their king i am told seeks to build a great navy so maybe one day they will be for now they fish near the shore and run for land at the slightest blow we will be safe the earl nodded when do we sail he asked you have time for a good supper my lord but then you should come aboard i will send my cabin boy for you and your party the captain responded then he bowed and taking up his cloak departed i am ravenous rosamund announced it has been a long cold ride dermid find the landlord and order us supper do it discreetly and try not to be seen by any who might recognize you leave your plaid and badge here man the earl instructed his servant aye my lord dermid said and hurried out why did you instruct dermid as you did rosamund asked patrick because leith is a port and it is full of spies seeking whatever bits of information they can find to sell a leslie tartan would give rise to questions in certain quarters and so i prefer that we not be seen or identified he explained to her but the landlord how did we get this private accommodation and how will we pay for it she questioned him the landlord of the mermaid is in the kings pay he collects bits of information for jamie stewart he was instructed to have this room available for captain daumier and his friends and he was paid well to be silent about it the earl explained to her this is certainly a world of which i had no idea rosamund said to him why would you my love he said in answer you are the lady of friarsgate a prosperous estate in the borders of england intrigue is not something with which you would be familiar but you will soon learn much of it for you are with me this is more than likely a useless business i undertake but the king will attempt every means he can to avoid a war with england would that your king were as careful henry tudor has a great sense of his own importance rosamund began when he decides that he is right he will follow a course to its end and god is always on his side she finished with a smile the earl of glenkirk laughed aloud at this i think my darling he said that you have a very sharp eye and will be very useful to me in this matter i will not act against england patrick she told him i am no traitor nay lovey he responded we do not act against england but scotlands king is older more experienced and has more wisdom than your henry tudor and do not forget that scotlands queen is englands sister but we would prevent a war and our king will not betray his alliances to serve his own ends as your king attempts to make him do it is most dishonorable rosamund i know she sighed meg always said her younger brother was a bit of a bully and now he is englands king and jealous of king james good relations with his holiness he attempts to destroy that relationship for his own ends the earl noted he is not a man who likes to lose or even take second place rosamund admitted patrick tell me exactly what it is you go to do when we are aboard la petite reine the earl said you do not trust me she was astounded and hurt he took her in his arms aye i trust you but i cannot know who is listening at the door my love do you understand me her amber eyes grew wide with surprise and then she silently nodded a moment later the door opened to admit dermid and a servingman bearing a tray the tray was set upon a table and the servant left after a swift glance about the room there was nothing of note and it was just as his master had told him lovers escaping to another land no one would pay good coin for that unless they were people of importance and while their clothing was fine it was not extravagant and the gentleman wore neither a plaid nor a badge that would identify him disappointed the servingman was swiftly gone hes got a sharp eye in his head annie noted pithily nothing to see here dermid grinned at her the two young servants served their master and mistress the meal that had been brought and then invited sat down to eat with them there was a joint of beef a fat capon with apple and bread stuffing there was a bowl of mussels steamed in white wine and bread that was freshly baked and still warm from the oven with softened butter melted on it a wedge of cheese had been supplied along with a pitcher of october ale they ate in silence and they had barely finished when there was a soft knock upon the door it opened to reveal a young boy madame and monseigner will follow me he said turning to go annie set her mistress furlined cloak around her shoulders and then stuffed the pockets of her own cloak with the apples and pears that had come with their meal then she and dermid followed after the ships boy they exited the inn through the same back entrance through which they had entered and followed their guide away from the courtyard and down a narrow alley out onto a long wide dock at the end of the wharf was their vessel a fairsized boat that appeared to be in good condition they boarded and the boy led them through a door at the ships stern this will be your cabin he said and then he left them rosamund looked about the room it wasnt very big she thought nervously there is still time he said to her nay she responded a large wide bunk was built into the wall and above it was a single bunk you and annie will sleep here the earl said dermid and i will take turns sleeping and watching tis cold rosamund said he nodded we wont be warm again for several weeks he told her traveling in winter is never very pleasant but we will manage you and annie get into bed now for that is how you will stay warmest remove only your shoes lovey the two young women climbed into the larger of the two bunks after taking their shoes off they burrowed beneath a surprisingly warm down coverlet its better here rosamund agreed you can sleep safely dermid and i will not leave you he told her i think i am too excited to sleep rosamund told him but both she and annie were soon snoring lightly get your rest ill take the first watch the earl told dermid and the servant climbed into the top bunk without another word patrick settled himself in the small window seat of the stern window he listened while the ship was freed from its moorings he felt the shift of the vessel as it began to get under way slipping out into firth of forth riding on the outgoing tide he could see the royal shipyard with the black masts of great michael the kings pride and joy the night was fair and as they moved farther down firth of forth and away from the port the stars began to appear in the dark skies above them patrick thought back to the last time he embarked for san lorenzo his daughter janet was no more than ten and adam six he traveled as king james first royal ambassador to san lorenzo he hadnt wanted to go to leave glenkirk but duty had called him the king had said it would not be for more than a few years when he had returned again to scotland his daughter was lost to him forever he and his son and mary mackay who had been his daughters maternal grandmother had gone back into their highlands mary had died several years later in her cottage where his daughter had been born jan janet mary leslie what had become of her was she even alive today and now here he was once again on his way to that exquisite mediterranean duchy traveling this time with a girl younger than his daughter would be now what madness he thought with a small smile and what incredible happiness he was experiencing such as he had never known in all of his life silently he thanked the fates for giving him rosamund that she was as passionate about him was astounding the mode of their travel was hardly romantic it would take them several days to reach france traveling as they were and then a long and weary ride stretched before them he had been mad to ask her to go he had been mad to consider going himself it was a fools errand the king was sending him upon but james stewart would do whatever he had to do to keep the peace with england amazingly the weather held as they sailed south down the coastline never letting the land disappear from their sight it was cold but the brisk winds sent their vessel speeding along and then one morning as annie and rosamund stepped from the cabin for a walk about the deck captain daumier approached and pointing said france madame we crossed the strait of dover in the early hours of the morning as the weather is holding we shall make for le havre with luck we will be there by the morrow that is very good news captain does lord leslie know rosamund asked him aye madame twas he who told me to come and tell you he is at the wheel even now look up the captain replied rosamund did and to her surprise saw her lover piloting their vessel laughing she waved at him and called be sure my lord that you do not bring us back to england the next morning la petite reine sailed into le havre and was made fast to a sturdy stone wharf to rosamunds great surprise their horses were brought forth from the belly of their ship and led out onto the pier i never thought about the beasts from the moment we dismounted at the mermaid she said its less noticeable if we retain our own animals and do not seek to purchase new ones the fewer people we deal with the fewer remember us these ports and many of the inns are nests of intrigue the buying and selling of information is a brisk trade the earl of glenkirk said then he turned and thanked captain daumier for their safe passage it was le bon dieus own good fortune my lord the seaman said you know this is not a good time to cross from scotland we were very lucky certainly le bon dieu is smiling on your endeavor whatever it may be then he shook the earls hand and turned away rosamund annie and dermid were already mounted the earl joined them we have the day before us and we have eaten aboard ship let us get away from the port and be on our way as quickly as possible glenkirk said they rode each day that followed from sunup to sunset bypassing paris moving crosscountry usually staying off the main roads both rosamund and annie were garbed as young men and anyone who noticed the riders saw four gentlemen rosamund remembered her trips to the english court from her northern home they had been far more civilized than this travel was there had been monasteries and nunneries in which to stay the night in france they sought their shelter where they might find it but mindful of the two women the earl did seek out farms with good barns in which they might overnight offering the farmer a coin in exchange for his hospitality more often than not the farmers wife would offer new bread which they gratefully accepted they purchased food occasionally in the market towns along their route the weather which was at first cold and some days wet with rain or snow began to grow milder as they traveled south and east suddenly it was spring and the sun shone more often as they rode along finally after many days on the road the earl said we will reach san lorenzo tomorrow the first thing i want is a bath rosamund said fervently they had settled into a comfortable barn for the night having been invited to the farmers table for a hot supper we shall not meet the duke until we have bathed and are properly clothed he promised her putting an arm about her shoulders i am to meet the duke of san lorenzo rosamund was surprised by this revelation she sat up then she said but of course it will complete the illusion of two lovers running away together you are my beloved companion sweetheart he said the duke is a most urbane gentleman i look forward to seeing him again although i admit i wish i did not have to see his son and daughterinlaw the boy who was to wed your daughter rosamund asked aye the earl said softly i always thought he wed that princess from toulouse too quickly i wonder if he ever really loved my jan let the past be done with my lord rosamund said softly nothing will change by allowing bitterness to take hold of you you are here on a specific mission for your king do your duty and let what happened all those years ago remain but a dim memory you are not here to treat with san lorenzo but rather with venice and the holy roman empire he nodded at her you speak wisdom sweetheart he responded how is it a little girl from cumbria should be so clever i think it is due to hugh cabot my second husband who taught me to have a care for myself and friarsgate and i think it is due to my youth at king henry the sevenths court most of my care was in the household of the old kings mother called the venerable margaret she was very wise you obviously learned your lesson well rosamund he complimented her go to sleep my lord she advised tomorrow will be a busy day for us i will be glad to sleep in a bed once again bathe and wear beautiful garments i am weary of being a lad she leaned over and gave him a quick kiss on the lips good night my dearest love she told him and i am eager to have you in my bed again the way you should be he murmured in her ear and then he nibbled teasingly upon it i very much need you rosamund and i you she whispered back if the duke can supply us with a large tub we shall bathe together rosamund murmured meaningfully if we do you know what will happen he told her and he nuzzled her neck i certainly hope so rosamund replied now go to sleep patrick you will not get much rest tomorrow she promised him and the earl of glenkirk laughed drawing her into his embrace one hand cupping a breast nor will you sweetheart he agreed nor will you chapter the capital city of the duchy of san lorenzo lay be fore them as they looked down from the mountain road on which they had been traveling i have never seen houses in so many colors rosamund exclaimed our houses are either natural stone or whitewashed the towns name is arcobaleno it means rainbow in the tongue of the italians he explained to her the people of san lorenzo their duchy set between france and the italian states speak both tongues equally i speak some french rosamund told him i understand better than i speak however that can prove to be to my advantage i shall learn a great deal more in my ignorance she told him with a smile he laughed you are too clever by far sweetheart he responded they moved down now into arcobaleno about them the hills were turning emerald green in the midfebruary sunshine they had come up the hills from a valley newly plowed and planted grain patrick had told her on the heights about the town he pointed out the vineyards to the south san lorenzan wine was excellent he assured her as she would shortly learn the town itself was perched on the hillsides above the blue sea not one house set along the neatly cobbled streets was of the same color and rosamund was amazed to find so many hues in the spectrum of the rainbow what is that building rosamund asked the earl pointing to a complex set just above the town itself the palace of the duke he responded and see the pink marble villa facing the sea that is the scottish ambassadors residence we are going there first soon enough it will be known that i am here for like everywhere else this is a hotbed of spies for now id like to keep it secret the duke will not be officially involved in this matter for his own safety and the safety of san lorenzo will the ambassador be expecting us rosamund asked nay the earl chuckled we shall be quite a surprise to him but i am carrying a letter from the king and so it will be all right they rode past the dukes palace at the open gates were guardsmen in seablue and gold uniforms peering into the courtyard beyond rosamund saw to her surprise a gentleman she recognized she stared hard at the man dismounting his horse do the english have an ambassador here my lord she asked patrick aye but only recently why as we passed the palace courtyard i saw a gentleman i recognized from the english court she explained would he recognize you sweetheart the earl asked her concerned i do not know patrick we were never introduced nor did we ever speak but i know who he is he is one of the howards not an important one just a distant cousin but he has obviously been given this posting to please his more powerful relations glenkirk noted we will have to see he does not become involved in our little business it would not do for henry tudor to learn we are attempting to weaken the alliance the pope seeks to build they rode farther down towards the town coming to the pink villa that was the residence of scotlands ambassador patrick felt the years sliding away as he remembered his own tenure here like san lorenzo itself he had never thought to see it again they rode through the open gates into the courtyard and immediately there were servants to take their horses the majordomo came out to greet the visitors he was an elderly man but his eyes widened with recognition as he approached them my lord leslie he said welcome welcome back to san lorenzo pietro how wonderful to find you still here glenkirk said wringing the old mans hand is your master inside i have brought a message from our king come in my lord come in he led them out of the sun which was surprisingly hot i will tell my master that you are here we were not expecting visitors pietro said he led them into a beautiful lightfilled chamber overlooking gardens if you will wait here my lord there is wine for refreshment he hurried out as fast as his old legs could carry him he was my majordomo when i served the king here patrick noted he obviously likes you rosamund said his daughter liked me too came the mischievous reply she had dark hair and eyes and golden skin from what i have seen along the road my lord i imagine she is now a plump and wellsettled matron a grandmother perhaps rosamund murmured sweetly you are jealous sweetheart he said and his tone was exceedingly pleased why are men so vain rosamund wondered aloud ouch he cried falling back clutching his chest in mock distress your claws are all the sharper for these weeks on the road my sweet rosamund then he chuckled my lady annie said excitedly look out in the gardens there are flowers blooming and tis but february and didnt the sun feel good and it still winter winter does not visit san lorenzo annie the earl explained except on very rare and quick occasions you mean its like this all the time annie was astounded surely youve brought us to paradise my lord i once thought it so he replied the door to the salon opened and a tall grizzled gentleman walked through my lord earl he said and he bowed lord macduff patrick said is there someplace we may speak privily and if my lady and her servant might be taken to comfortable quarters we will be staying with you dermid go with annie and lady rosamund the earl of glenkirks voice rang with authority of course my lord the ambassador replied pietro the majordomo was immediately in the room my lord show the lady to our guest quarters and see that everything is done to make her and the earl comfortable my lord come with me and lord macduff led patrick from the salon pietro bowed i speak english a little bit my lady he said and i speak french a little bit rosamund told him with a smile the majordomo smiled back then if my lady will follow me he responded they followed him from the lovely salon out into the round marble foyer and up two levels of a wide marble flight of stairs on the third landing he opened the gilded walnut doors and ushered them into a spacious apartment is there anything you need at the moment my lady he asked her we have been on the road for many days pietro i should love a bath she told him at once my lady he told her and he hurried off and what will you be wearing after i take these stinking clothes and have em burned annie demanded to know do i not have at least one clean shirt or chemise rosamund asked well you can hardly meet anyone in just your chemise annie replied pithily well then i suppose after my bath i shall need to see a seamstress rosamund told her servant the earl has promised me that he would have a suitable wardrobe made for me and you will need new garments as well annie id actually like to have a bath myself and some clean clothing annie admitted dont think ill ever get the stink of horse out of me hair lets explore this apartment and see what we have while we are waiting for my bath rosamund suggested together the two young women began walking about and opening doors the apartment had its dayroom in which they now stood but it also had two bedchambers adjoining each other and two small chambers each containing a single bed a chest and a little table you have your own room rosamund told annie and there is one for dermid choose now you two and set your possessions inside dermid i did not ask you before but were you with the earl when he was last here in san lorenzo nay twas my uncle dermid said i was just newly breeked when the lord came home my uncle chose me to go with the earl when the king sent for him he has no lads of his own just daughters dermid explained he said he was too old to go traipsing about any longer and so was the master but when the king called a loyal man answered and that man would need his servant hed been training me to take his place these last few years anyway hell be surprised when he learns where ive been if you can tell him rosamund said quietly aye lady i may not be able to say dermid answered her oh my lady look annie had opened the windowlike doors across the dayroom beyond was a balcony that stretched across the villa and beyond it was the blue sea aint it beautiful annie said yes it is rosamund replied joining her servant i dont think i have ever seen anything as beautiful outside of friarsgate thats the first time ive heard you mention home in weeks annie noted i wondered if you had forgotten it nay friarsgate is my first love and it will always be my love annie we will go home eventually but this is so exciting i never thought to see a place like san lorenzo or live through a winter without chilblains on my hands once i should have been content to never leave friarsgate and one day i will feel the same way again but not now not today the door to the apartment opened and a line of footmen led by pietro began to enter he signaled with his hand to dermid here man help me he said then he entered the more feminine bedchamber pressed a hidden lock on one of the walnutpaneled walls which sprang open to reveal a huge bathing tub and with dermids aid wrestled the tub from its place out into the room where will you have it my lady he asked her rosamund looked about the room and then seeing that the windowed doors opened onto the terrace said put it out there pietro the majordomo smiled broadly ah he said as he and dermid wrestled the tub to its desired location madame is a romantic rosamund smiled back at him it seems a perfect place she murmured the tub was set out upon the marble terrace and the footmen began to fill it with their buckets slowly climbing the twin sets of steps placed on either side of the tub and dumping the water into the large vessel which was made of hard oak and bound in polished brass bands it was a laborintensive effort but finally the tub was filled i shall need a seamstress pietro rosamund said the earl and i traveled swiftly and upon horseback all the way from the french coast none of our party has suitable clothing for the dukes court that must be remedied as quickly as possible at once madame pietro answered her with a bow my daughter is the finest seamstress in all of arcobaleno i shall send her to you is she the one who was once lord leslies mistress rosamund inquired the very same madame he answered her with a twinkle his lordship will not recognize her for she has grown well rounded with her marriage her children and her enterprise he bowed again and then turned and left her send her to us late this afternoon rosamund called after him after siesta of course madame the majordomo replied and she will bring a fine selection of fabrics too then he was gone maybel wouldnt approve of your being so bold my lady and you can smack me for it if you will but tis so annie said rosamund laughed i am at a disadvantage here annie and i know that lord leslie had a mistress when he was last in san lorenzo i would prefer no surprises now help me out of these clothes and into that lovely tub youre not going naked out on that terrace my lady annie fretted we are facing the sea rosamund replied there is no one to see me she sat down and pulled off her boots whew she exclaimed peeling her stockings off her feet dispose of it all annie and i mean it its beyond washing annie nodded as she helped her mistress to undress ive saved one clean chemise my lady she told rosamund when you are clean you can put it on dermid go and bring in our packs she instructed the earls man dermid gave her a wink and left them cheeky scots devil annie muttered he likes you rosamund noted aye and i like him but thats as far as it will ever go annie said why rosamund wanted to know because you aint never going to leave friarsgate and i aint never going to leave you annie said nay annie her mistress said if you love him and he you then you are free to wed him and go with him i will not have you unhappy on my account well as it aint got that far yet my lady i dont have to think about it do i annie remarked with a small smile one day you may and when you do i would advise you to follow your heart annie i have and what is sauce for the goose is surely sauce for the other goose she chuckled oh my lady you say such funny things annie giggled she picked up a coverlet that was lying upon the bed and wrapped it about her mistress you aint going out to your tub as naked as the day god made you my lady she said firmly wrapped in the fabric rosamund walked out onto the terrace ill have to unwrap it sooner or later she said and after climbing up the steps to her tub she flung off the makeshift gown and stepped carefully into the hot water with a deep sigh ahhh she said seating herself on the little stool within the tub this is wonderful reaching up she unbraided her long hair and began to wash it with the fragrant soap that had been placed upon the tub ledge annie climbed up the steps with a bucket and rinsed her mistress soapy hair with water dipped from the tub three times rosamund soaped her auburn hair and scrubbed it and her head free of the dirt of the long road that they had traveled and each time annie poured several buckets of water over the young womans head until rosamund bid her to cease give me a drying cloth to wrap my head in while i wash she said and she took the item from annie to enfold it about her head in turbanlike fashion then she set about washing the rest of her body when she had finished she exited the tub and said to annie get in girl tis not likely you will be given another opportunity annie didnt argue forgetting completely where she was she stripped her filthy clothes off and climbed into the stillwarm water to bathe her hair and her body rosamund sat upon a bench on the terrace wrapped in a large drying cloth and brushing her hair with her pearwood brush the one luxury item she had carried with her from scotland the warm air and the bright sunlight quickly dried her thick hair when annie had finished bathing her mistress handed her another drying cloth and the servant came forth from the tub smiling ah my lady thank you she said im not much for all the washing you do but after our travels it was good to have a bath but now annie we have another problem what are you to wear rosamund laughed i got a chemise like you my lady but naught else i expect that pietro will be able to find me a skirt and shirt however when dermid gets back ill send him off to ask she wrapped herself in her drying cloth and sat down next to her mistress rosamund handed her the brush dry your hair she said oh i couldnt use your brush my lady annie protested then your hair will dry a tangle annie rosamund said ill use my fingers annie told her tis what i do anyhow while annie was drying her hair dermid returned with their packs from the horses he flushed at the sight of the two women wrapped in their drying cloths ill leave your pack there my lady he addressed rosamund his eyes averted from her and ill distribute the rest as they ought to be he tossed one of the saddlebags on rosamunds bed and scurried away annie giggled he aint too brave now is he she said go and put on your chemise rosamund instructed her i can put my own on and then im going to lie down and have a nap on that softlooking bed you should do the same lass until the seamstress comes after siesta whatever that is there is naught for us to do she lay down upon the bed suddenly tired and unable to even pull out her chemise just for a little bit she said to herself softly and she closed her eyes im sending dermid for that pietro i cant go around without my clothes until something new can be made for me annie said and after putting on her chemise she went off to seek out her fellow servant patrick finally appeared to find rosamund sleeping seeing her upon the bed wrapped in the drying cloth so much of her bare to his view was tempting then he spied the tub still out on the terrace he stripped off his travelworn garments then walked outside and climbed into the tub the water was lukewarm and well used but he was nonetheless able to wash himself thoroughly using the scented soap upon the tubs shelf he sniffed and smiled the fragrance was a familiar one one he had not smelled in years annie returned to the terrace in her chemise and gave a little squeak to see him so ensconced oh my lord she blushed furiously give me your drying cloth lassie as i can see you are quit of it and then find your own place he ordered the serving girl gently aye my lord she answered him pietro is sending the seamstress to us after siesta what is siesta the time following the midday meal and the late afternoon when the sun is less hot he explained it is the custom to nap or otherwise amuse oneself annie thank you my lord she answered giving him a bobbing little curtsy shall i wake my lady nay annie she is fair worn i can see let her sleep i will shortly join her run along now lass he took the drying cloth from the girl yes my lord annie said obediently and she was quickly gone patrick pulled himself out of the tub and dried himself off before wrapping the cloth about his loins and seating himself on the marble bench the sun on his shoulders felt wonderful he had forgotten how good ones body felt when exposed to the air and the heat of the sun and he realized now that if rosamund was tired after their exhausting journey then so was he he stood and went back inside lying down next to her she murmured softly but made no other indication that she was even aware of him his eyes closed and he was swiftly asleep when he awoke several hours later rosamund was gone from their bed but he could hear her in the dayroom beyond he gave himself a few moments for his head to clear and then he stretched before arising to walk towards the sound of her voice ah you are awake she said seeing him she was seated at a table eating ravenously come and eat so we may siesta again she told him and she licked her fingers clean of grease from the chicken wing she was devouring i am going to enjoy this southern style of living my darling he sat down opposite her with a grin and helped himself to the full bowl of oysters which he began cracking open and swallowing whole i left them for you she said sweetly i thought you might need your strength my lord she picked up her goblet you are right this san lorenzan wine is delicious then she reached out for the pitcher and poured a generous measure into his goblet the seamstress is coming later she said so annie said he replied as he picked up the goblet to drink some wine she is pietros daughter an old friend of yours i believe rosamund said innocently he choked upon his wine celestina jesu maria rosamund giggled mischievously pietro says you will not recognize her for she has grown with age bairns and her busy enterprise i shall be fascinated to meet her you will behave yourself madame he said sternly now patrick it is not often that the current mistress is permitted to meet the mistress of ones youth she teased him wickedly his green eyes narrowed youre a bad wench he said i am she agreed but i promise to behave will you have some of this delicious roast kid she carved several slices and put them on his plate together with an artichoke that had been steamed in wine some fresh bread and a wedge of soft cheese the ambassador has an excellent cook she noted and then she returned to her own meal if you continue to eat like that you shall end up like celestina obviously has he teased her i have almost starved these past few weeks she complained you did not tell me that food would be so scarce or cold or tasteless along the road my lord i shall eat like this every day and bathe daily as well she told him was it you who suggested the tub be put out on the terrace overlooking the sea he asked her she nodded i thought how lovely to bathe while looking out at the hills and the sea and the town below he smiled at her then we shall keep the tub there while we are here sweetheart how did your meeting with lord macduff go she queried him he was surprised to see us of course but once he had read the kings letter he understood you were right the english ambassador is richard howard and he is an unctuous little man always bowing and scraping to the duke when he isnt being arrogant and making demands on behalf of his master and does the duke of this place know you are here and for what purpose rosamund asked her lover i brought a missive for duke sebastian and macduff will deliver it tomorrow glenkirk answered her i do not believe the representatives from venice and the emperor have arrived yet have you not taken a chance coming without the dukes knowledge my lord she wondered duke sebastian was sent a letter in advance of our arrival saying that i was returning to san lorenzo sometime this winter but that my coming must remain secret the earl told rosamund he is intelligent enough to know that something is afoot and he will cooperate until it is convenient for him to do otherwise glenkirk explained sebastian di san lorenzo is a politic and clever man he never does anything without reason or anything that will not benefit him or the duchy slow and steady is the path we must take unlike your king who wants everything immediately if not forthwith henry tudor is an ambitious man rosamund responded they say he looks like his grandfather king edward the fourth and some say he is like him in character with lofty grandiose plans and ideas for england i repeat what i have heard for i cannot vouch for his character he was determined to bed me although i was not pleased by his attentions he is a man who thinks only of himself and what he wants perhaps that is a good thing in a king i cannot say it is a good thing in a king when that king is thoughtful of his rule patrick replied how long were you his mistress a very brief few months she answered i lived in terror that the queen would learn of my betrayal for she was my friend when i was a girl at court owein and i aided her in the years in which king henry the seventh could not make up his mind if he still wanted her for a daughterinlaw or not she was treated very shabbily it was she who invited me back to court after owein died i did not want to go but one does not refuse a queen or a king he noted bitterly you are jealous she said surprised you need not be jealous my love i am jealous of all the men who have been in your life before me rosamund he told her i am jealous of the men who will know you after i have passed from your life i have never loved a woman as i love you when you are gone from me whatever is left of my life will be cold and bleak reaching out he took her hand and kissed it tenderly do not speak of our parting yet my darling rosamund answered him we have much time before us i know it she caressed his cheek with the hand he had kissed are you going to shave that dreadful beard away my lord certainly there is a barber in arcobaleno who could service you you do not like my beard he teased her nay i know you could not shave it on the road but we are no longer on the road she said i do not need a barber dermid will do the deed dermid he called to his manservant and the young man was immediately at his masters side my lady will have my beard off laddie let us do it for i am now clean and well fed and ready for my siesta at once my lord ill get a bowl and the razor came the answer ill await you my darling rosamund told him and she got up from the table wiping her mouth and hands with the linen napkin that had been in her lap with a seductive smile she walked slowly to her bedchamber and shut the door behind her dermid grinned ive been told that englishwomen are cold my lord but it certainly dont seem so if you dont mind my saying youve had your eye on my ladys annie glenkirk said shes a respectable lass dermid and her mistress would be most distressed if you treated her badly oh nay my lord no man will ever treat annie badly shed lay them out she would if they tried im thinking of courting her for there is none at home who pleases me as well shes got a good temper on her does annie shell make fine bairns for a man id even be willing to stay in england for her if she loves you as well dermid she will come home to glenkirk with you the earl said but there is time before either of you must make such a decision dermid nodded then he went to fetch what he would need to shave his master and after returning quickly he set to work removing the growth of dark beard streaked here and there with silver that the earl had grown in the last few weeks when he had finished he said frankly well you look better without a beard than with one my lord younger by far id say patrick winced at the remark dermid had meant nothing by it but it was a reminder of the years that separated him and rosamund he arose from the table and thanking his servant went into his bedchamber stripping off the drying cloth he looked at himself in the fulllength mirror by the wardrobe he was still lean and hard of body despite his years he knew men far younger grew flabby but he had not his hair was yet dark though here and there he saw silver he had all his teeth and none were rotting his gaze was still sharp and his appetite for rosamunds fair body grew with each passing day he was he knew still a very vigorous lover turning he looked for the hidden door that would connect their chambers and finding it pressed the lock and when the door opened he stepped through into the next room she lay dozing again the graceful curve of her back to him he realized how difficult a journey it had been for her though she had never once complained she had removed her cloth and was as naked as he was he lay down next to her and she murmured softly as she felt the bed sag patrick she said nay tis the king of your heart he told her and she rolled over into his arms to face him he gave her a slow sweet kiss that is nice she whispered against his mouth when he had broken off their embrace i have missed the leisure of laying in bed with you my lord is that all you have missed he teased her the touch of her the fragrance that emanated from her lovely body excited him he was shocked by his bodys swift reaction to the mere touch and smell of her my god he said quietly rosamund laughed softly i am as bad as you are my darling reaching out she caressed his love rod i am more than ready patrick i shall surely die if you do not put yourself into me now he complied finding her hot wet and indeed very ready to receive him he had barely begun the rhythm when he felt the head of his manhood drenched by her love juices now it was he who laughed rosamund rosamund he groaned against her ear and his own juices burst forth to flood her womb i need make no apologies sweetheart he told her and now that we have satisfied our lust we shall begin anew slowly slowly until you are weeping with your satisfaction he withdrew from her she sighed happily i have missed our passion so very much patrick forgive me for my eagerness which was but matched by yours she propped herself up on an elbow and stared down into his face i love you so much my lord i regret we cannot make a child together so do i he told her and he drew her down so that her auburn head was against his broad chest are your daughters like you rosamund philippa and banon are said to favor me but not bessie she is her fathers lass he was a good father owein meredith you were a good father too i think i tried he said if loving my son and daughter was being a good father then aye for i loved them both well janets loss broke my heart yet now that i am here again with you it is different sweetheart i remember that time but it somehow does not seem so cruel to me anymore we tried to get her back you know but we could not you have never told me what happened rosamund said the long and the short of it was she was kidnapped by slavers and sold in the great market of candia for a large sum of money she was young a virgin and very beautiful my son adam still seeks for her despite the years that have passed he is determined to find her though she may be long dead i do not know she is lost to me i am sorry rosamund told him i think it is better to know that someone is dead than to not know what has happened to them you know that i love you dont you he replied changing the subject adroitly and you know that i love you she answered him understanding that he did not wish to speak on the subject of his daughter any longer i shall have celestina make you a wardrobe to suit a princess he said you cannot meet the duke until you are properly garbed i am so proud of you and of your beauty that i would flaunt you rosamund i am not beautiful she protested perhaps very pretty but surely not beautiful if another woman demurred so he told her i should think her being coy but not you my darling however i find you beautiful and so will the duke he has a roving eye rosamund so beware of him he will charm you as he does all the lovely women who cross his path he has been widowed for years but is content to remain so as you have been she teased him you widowers do not dupe me you love being able to flit among the ladies like a bumblebee among the flowers buzz buzz he harried her nuzzling the soft hollow between her neck and her shoulder i am your bumblebee my darling and like the bumblebee i wish to make love to my beautiful english rose rosamund giggled as his tongue tickled the whorl of her ear and a frisson of a shiver rippled down her spine will you sting me master bumbles she asked mischievously indeed madame i will for i have a rather large stinger just waiting to dip itself deeply into your honey pot he growled in her ear his tongue licked at her shoulder and then slowly climbed the column of her slender throat you taste delicious he said softly she stretched her full length before him and he lowered his dark head and began to draw his fleshy tongue over her offered body rosamund closed her eyes and relaxed in the feel of the warm wetness which was followed by the warm breath from his nostrils cooling her moist flesh his head moved slowly for he did not miss an inch of her skin he licked at her breasts and suckled upon the pointed nipples then lower across her torso sliding across her taut belly finding the soft insides of her thighs which he spread without resistance he opened her secret place to his view his tongue touching her with the most delicate and exquisite finesse oh patrick she halfmoaned yes the marauding tongue lapped at the pearlescent juices that dappled the rose flesh it found the core of her womanhood and began to harass it with just the tip of his tongue he was becoming dizzy with his burgeoning lust and the hot scent of her dont stop she begged him oh god tis so wonderful my love you are a wanton he groaned unable to help himself she was open to him and he thrust his tongue into the cave of her sex pushing it as far as he could using it as he might his manhood hearing her whimper with her need for more rosamund was almost mindless with the pleasure he was giving her she wanted to give him pleasure as well when he raised his body to cover hers she pulled him forward so that he was kneeling over her breasts reaching out she drew him closer until she was able to draw his manhood into her mouth tugging on it gently with her lips and tongue she heard him moan she held him steady so she might lick the length of him run her tongue about the fleshy tip lap the pearl of his juices enough he finally groaned and he loosened her grip so he might enter her body in another way she wrapped her slim legs about him and helped him to thrust deeply into her eager and waiting body he almost wept to feel her love sheath tightening about him yes she whispered fiercely yes dear heaven how you fill me patrick she ached with the sweetness he offered and her arms drew him as close as they could she was tight she was hot she was an endless delight of which he could not get enough he thrust and withdrew thrust and withdrew moving slowly at first and then as their desires burgeoned his rhythm increased as did hers he heard her low keening and his own groans of satisfaction his head was spinning he felt her sharp fingernails raking down his long back and swore softly at her his fingers closing hard about her wrists and forcing her arms up where she could not damage him again bitch he growled against her mouth devil she hissed back and then she screamed softly as her body was convulsed with a series of shudders ohhh patrick she sighed his own completion met hers and he flooded her with his juices rosamund rosamund he halfsobbed they lay together until their breathing became slower and softer once again reaching out he took her hand in his kissing each finger as he did rosamund closed her eyes and sighed well satisfied she knew as she had known from the moment their eyes met that this passion they shared could not be forever but for now it was wonderful and she would not think about tomorrow if she died in her sleep tonight what they had was more than enough she reached out lifted the hand holding her and kissed it then she placed it on her heart neither of them said a word words were not necessary they slept awaking a while later to a tentative knock upon the bedchamber door yes rosamund called master pietro has come to say the seamstress will be here in half an hour my lady annie called we will be ready for her rosamund called back she poked her lover gently we have to get up my lord and wash the scent of our lust away the tub will be cool now but it will suffice they went back out upon the terrace and to rosamunds surprise the water was not at all icy for the sun had kept it lukewarm she and patrick climbed into the oak vessel and quickly bathed again she had forgotten to pin her hair up and the tips of it were wet when she exited the water she dried herself quickly and then dried patrick as well well i have a chemise to wear she said but what will you wear not that signora celestina hasnt already seen what you have to offer my lord she taunted him he chuckled dermid has had pietro find me some hautdechausses and hose and i have a shirt i shall be more than respectable when i meet with celestina again then go and dress my lord so we may at least give the impression of respectability she told him he nodded and walked back into her bedchamber and through the door into his own quarters rosamund looked for the saddlebag and found it on the floor by the bed opening it she pulled out a lacetrimmed chemise it was clean and of excellent quality she put it on and then sat upon the edge of the bed to brush her hair out and braid it up neatly she was eager to wear a gown again she heard voices in the dayroom beyond then came a knock upon her bedchamber door and rosamund opened the portal and stepped through into the dayroom at the same time the earl of glenkirk came from his bedchamber the large woman with the black hair and black eyes ignored rosamund and shrieked as she saw the earl patrizio santa maria be blessed for i never hoped to see you again she flung her arms about him enveloping him in a suffocating hug patrick was hardpressed not to burst into laughter this was celestina after eighteen years he remembered the seductive sulkymouthed girl who had become his mistress all those years ago he managed to squirm from her embrace and taking her by her broad shoulders he kissed her firmly upon her red lips celestina santa maria there is three times as much of you to love now then he set her back you have changed little cara he told her ive changed a lot she said with a hearty laugh for every bit of flesh i have put on my bones i have put as much in my purse patrizio i have six children as well and how many husbands have you buried cara he teased her husbands she burst into laughter who has time for husbands patrizio now her gaze swept across the room and lit on rosamund this fair little girl is your latest mistress we will have to feed her for she does not look as if she eats does she speak some language with which i can communicate with her they had been speaking in italian french celestina but speak slowly cara and do not attempt to cheat her she is the owner of a large estate which she manages herself and quite successfully scotch celestina inquired english the earl replied and your father has explained to you that i am here privately to visit my old friend the duke you will not gossip cara eh there is an english ambassador here now celestina said gauging his reaction i know the earl replied but rosamund would not be anyone of importance that he should know about she is not connected with the royal court celestina nodded madame she said walking across the room to rosamund i have brought a gown that will serve you until i can make you a wardrobe she was now speaking french thank you rosamund replied may i see it maria quickly she called to the young girl accompanying her the gown was brought unwrapped from its covering and displayed it was pale green watered silk with a very low neckline and full puffed sleeves trimmed lavishly in ecrucolored lace the seamstress and her helper spread the gown over a chair the color is certainly right celestina said considering i did not know what madame looked like it is plain the earl said it is lovely and celestina could not waste time or materials decorating a gown without a buyer patrick rosamund replied she smiled at celestina may i try it on the seamstress nodded and then she smiled at rosamund he says you are a clever woman with a taste for trade madame you were right about the gown my cotters weave wool from the sheep i raise rosamund said my wools are noted for their quality you do not send your raw wool to the low countries to be woven celestina was surprised why should i pay good coin to have done in a foreign clime what my own people can do besides it keeps them occupied in the winter months when the fields cannot be cultivated and too i am able to maintain the highest caliber in my product rosamund said in practical tones can you put some decoration upon the bodice just a little gold thread embroidery perhaps of course madame the gown but waited for an owner celestina said i can have it by tomorrow try it on now and we will see what other alterations need to be done to it and i have brought a variety of materials for madames inspection as well i will choose the materials for both the earl and myself rosamund said then she let celestina and her helper aid her in getting into the gown and bodice celestina spoke in rapid italian to her companion who from the look of her was the seamstress daughter the waist will need to come in maria and she is larger in the bosom than i would have anticipated given her slender stature the length seems fine the sleeves will need alteration this lady is delicately made but she is strong the earl murmured and celestina gave him a broad grin aye patrizio celestina said your heart is engaged my old friend and it does me good to see you happy again when you left us your poor heart was broken this lady has obviously mended it she has he admitted what are you speaking about patrick rosamund asked i do not understand the tongue in which you babble celestina is more comfortable in the italian tongue lovey she says you have mended my broken heart and i agree he told her you flatter me especially under the circumstances she told him i should rather have a year with you rosamund he told her than a lifetime with any other woman on the face of this earth now sweetheart let us decide upon the materials we are going to want the pale green gown had been pinned where it needed alteration and so rosamund removed it carefully celestina snapped her fingers at maria and the girl brought forth a silk garment in the most incredible shade of blue that rosamund had ever seen wear this instead of that pretty chemise she said proffering it what is it rosamund asked the people across the sea here where they are ruled by the turkish sultan wear them they call them caftans they even go out into the streets there in them i am told i thought it might make a better garment for you indoors than your chemise do you like the color it is the color of the persian turquoise its lovely rosamund said thank you celestina i shall very much enjoy wearing this caftan and now the seamstress said let us look at the materials i have brought for you and patrizio madame maria the samples vite vite the fabrics were brought and they were indeed a rich assortment in wonderful colors silks and brocades and lightweight velvets along with delicate cottons and linens how tom would love all of this rosamund said to her lover he has such exquisite taste i can but hope i have learned from him she fingered a brocade in a rich shade of green it would suit me she noted celestina nodded and this seablue silk and the russet velvet that matches your lovely hair perhaps this cream and gold brocade its beautiful rosamund agreed and the seamstress set it aside oh what a wonderful shade of lavender patrick watched indulgently as she chose and then she turned to him and began to seek his advice on the colors he would wear i am a gentleman and so will be less flamboyant he told her the two women gave each other a look and ignored him after that picking and choosing what they thought was right for the earls garments when they had finished celestina gave orders to her helper to pack everything up again it but remains for me to measure patrizio she said with a wicked smile come my lord and let me see how you have grown over the years you do not look greatly changed but one can never tell she took out her tape and began muttering to herself beneath her breath making little scratches with her charcoal stick on the tiny piece of parchment she had brought with her when she had finished she arose and tucked the notations she had made into the pocket of her skirts you are as fine a figure of a man as you ever were she chuckled i shall be back for a fitting tomorrow and i shall bring the pale green gown with me when i come madame its bodice will be nicely but simply embroidered celestina promised then she turned and was quickly gone from the apartment she moves swiftly for a lady of such girth rosamund noted he chuckled so you are no longer jealous he teased her i did not say that my lord for her hands were all over you especially when she measured the length of your legs i thought she came a bit too close to your manhood and i thought that you seemed to enjoy it rosamund said with a small smile celestina always had the most clever hands he remarked and then pulling her into his arms he kissed her soundly but you my darling seem to be clever all over and i adore you for it is there anything that we need to do now my lord rosamund asked him see that dermid and annie have supper on the sideboard when we want it and then disappear so we may be wanton together without fear of being disturbed are you suggesting my lord that we go back to bed she asked him innocently aye lass i am he replied a slow smile lighting his eyes we have several weeks of loving to make up for rosamund and i am ready to begin she smiled back at him then i shall not need this caftan for a while she said shall i my lord nay sweetheart you will not need it for some time to come he agreed and taking her hand in his he led her back into her bedchamber chapter sebastian duke of san lorenzo was a man now closer to sixty than he was to fifty he was still what would be considered a fine figure of a man if perhaps a bit portly his once black hair was now steely gray but his black eyes were as sharp as they had ever been he pinned his gaze upon the man he had never again thought to see they had not parted amicably how could they have the earl of glenkirks daughter was to have married his heir rudolpho but then the girl was stolen by slavers even if they had gotten her back and the blessed mother knew he had attempted to retrieve janet leslie there could no longer have been a question of her marriage to his son she would certainly have been despoiled his negotiations with toulouse for one of their princesses had been he thought secret but patrick had known immediately even before it was confirmed his daughter was lost forever that her match with rudolpho di san lorenzo was no longer a possibility and that the formal betrothal celebrated just a brief few weeks before was annulled and san lorenzos duke was seeking another bride for his son the duke and the scots ambassadors previously cordial relationship had soured badly they had parted formally neither expecting to ever see the other again while i am certainly astounded to see you patrick the duke said i welcome you back to san lorenzo i can see the years have not been unkind to you i thank you my lord duke the earl replied patrick my old friend the duke said jovially surely we may still be friends has time not softened the memories perhaps yours sebastian but not mine patrick responded but his tone was mild still here i am in san lorenzo again and returned with a beautiful lady i am informed the duke chuckled you were ever a man for the fairer sex my friend but why are you here the lady and i wished to escape the harsh northern winter and the curiosity of king james court the earl said nay i do not believe that i have a letter from your king asking me to extend to you every courtesy the duke answered if you were just an ordinary man with his lover i might accept your explanation but you are not patrick leslie the duke said the less you know of the purpose of my visit sebastian the better for you and for san lorenzo the earl answered him i am here to meet with some people but it is better that our concourse remain most private so your king has suggested but he has also said that if i am not content with that explanation you will give me a better one patrick sighed he did not trust sebastian di san lorenzo not after what had happened still he had no choice in the matter to gain the dukes cooperation and goodwill he must tell him the truth you know of the holy league he asked the duke nodded papal politics in gods name once more he said dryly the earl of glenkirk found himself smiling he might not trust the duke of san lorenzo but sebastian had never been a stupid man aye but it has put my king in a very difficult position why james stewart has always been a favorite of this pope i believe that julius even presented him with the golden rose for his devotion and piety to holy mother church the duke countered all that is true patrick agreed but scotland is married to englands sister this match was conceived by king henry the seventh in order to foster peace between scotland and england it has done just that with only minor border skirmishes over the years queen margaret is devoted to her husband and loyal to scotland now however her brother sits on englands throne he is young ambitious envious and filled with a great sense of his own importance and destiny king james is a man of peace he has brought much prosperity to scotland prosperity that comes through an absence of war or strife it has made him a distinguished figure among the other rulers of europe and henry tudor is very jealous of him he seeks to destroy what he perceives as scotlands influence for england he believes is more important it is not meet in his eyes that scotland take precedence over him and he is ruthlessly clever sebastian make no mistake about it he will have his way in this the first step in his plan was to encourage the pope who has previously had good relations with king louis to demand that the french give up their possessions north of the italian states you will recall that previously the pope was allied with the french in a campaign against the venetians in the north of italy the same venetians who are now members of the holy league the duke murmured ah the vagaries of mankind and of course pious spain is a part of the league along with maximilian and his holy roman empire the earl said but conspicuously absent is scotland the duke noted aye scotland has an alliance with france it is an auld alliance going back many years my king is a man of honor and he can find no reason to break that alliance so he will not henry tudor is not a man of honor he has engineered this situation in order to harm my kings good relations with pope julius and the holy see would your king send troops to frances aid the duke asked patrick only if absolutely forced into it if there were no way in which he could eschew it you know how well a ruler may avoid a situation like this when acting in the best interests of his country sebastian so in actuality scotland would remain neutral the duke noted aye which under any other circumstance would suit the pope the earl said except that the english king is pressing the point and making an issue of it us or them aye patrick this henry tudor is indeed ruthless and clever now tell me why you have come king james hopes that perhaps he might weaken the alliance and in doing so take the attention away from what our nation will or wont do if the pope must struggle to maintain the allies that he already has he is unlikely to be overly concerned with scotlands position as long as it is not overtly hostile towards his league i am here to meet with two gentlemen one from venice and the other from germany my king considers them the weaker links spain will not be moved because englands queen is ferdinands daughter it is a bold idea but you are not likely to succeed the duke said king james knows that but he also knows he will not break the auld alliance and if he does not england will use it as an excuse to invade scotland this means we must invade them first a faux invasion mind you for we have no interest in conquering england but we must direct henry tudors attention away from this mischief he is causing between the pope and james stewart patrick replied the duke of san lorenzo nodded thoughtfully then he asked why have they sent you patrick for two reasons once i was scotlands ambassador to san lorenzo its first ambassador and second since i returned from here eighteen years ago i have not left my highland home at glenkirk i am barely known by the court and it is unlikely that i would be considered a candidate for such a mission as this one if indeed anyone knew of why i have been sent here and no one does not even the lovely lady who accompanies you my friend the duke pried not even rosamund the earl lied facilely she is english and the queens friend i didnt want her put between her love for me and her loyalty to margaret tudor and england she departed the court under the excuse of an ill child it is assumed i have gone with her for our passion was hardly secret rosamund the duke said it is a charming name when am i to meet her because we traveled secretly we came quickly with but one servant apiece ahorse we carried only the bare essentials a wardrobe is now being fashioned for us both sebastian i come before you today in altered secondhand garments they are neat and serviceable but hardly what i would normally wear remembering your most elegant court i should be less splendid in my later years but that my daughterinlaw insists that we keep up appearances the duke remarked how is rudolpho the earl asked fat content and the father of ten daughters and two sons the eldest of my grandsons henrico the firstborn actually is my heir after his father the second son who is only a little lad of five will go to the church of course unless something happens to his brother it is good they are so far apart in age roberto is the youngest but ten granddaughters marone i do not know if i can find husbands for them all some will have to go into the nunnery and you patrick has your son wed and given you grandchildren aye two lads and a lassie the earl said he did not choose a warm wife the duke nodded neither did i he remarked but my wife was young and fair and i was filled with lust for her he chuckled it was the same with your son i assume patrick nodded aye was all he said do you want it known you are in san lorenzo the duke asked his companion we have an english ambassador now i know richard howard i believe the earl answered your ambassador told you of course the duke said rosamund saw him in the street as we entered san lorenzo and recognized him although she could not remember his name patrick replied your lady is a member of the english court the duke was interested now rosamund spent part of her youth as a ward to king henry the seventh that is how she became friends with our queen they were girls together but since she was wed in the same year in which our queen married our king she has remained home on her estates which are in the north of england and her husband the duke was even more curious she is a widow the earl of glenkirk replied ahhh the duke sighed a woman of experience as well as beauty you are indeed a fortunate man patrick our demeanor here will be discreet sebastian as is fitting for a man who has run away with his lover let the english ambassador learn of our presence when he learns of it and report it to his master if he thinks it would be of interest to king henry but i doubt he will as i have told you i am not known to the english or the scots courts i am unimportant as is rosamund hence my value to king james you are remembered here patrick the duke noted if the english ambassador should learn of my former position for scotland i will explain it by saying we are here because i thought this a romantic place to bring my lover does lord howard prefer the english winters and scots winters are far worse he grinned it suddenly had occurred to patrick that he was enjoying this adventure and he had certainly not thought he would the duke laughed seeing his companions grin i believe you like this game that you find yourself playing patrick he chuckled the earl of glenkirk nodded i think i do sebastian he agreed it has been a long time since i have enjoyed myself i am always filled with a sense of my duty but now i feel like a lad released from his studies i remember i like the feel of the winter sun on my back and the fragrance of mimosas in february i have not smelled mimosas since the day i departed san lorenzo last were you always this romantic patrick or is it just that you are in love the duke teased him i could not tell you sebastian the earl replied but aye i am in love i look forward to meeting her sebastian di san lorenzo smiled toothily will you marry her if she will have me patrick said feeling that the wily duke need not be privy to the truth of his relationship with rosamund perhaps the white lie he told would protect her from an attempted seduction but he would warn her nonetheless of the dukes easily aroused nature who is doing your wardrobes celestina i assume the duke queried aye i well remember how you stole her from me the duke said her first daughter is mine you know we gave her to the church to expiate our sin he said with a grin celestina had a generous nature patrick remembered with a smile she still does but alas i am much too old to please her now but still we remain friends the duke said i will see her girls work quickly so you may attend a small party i am giving in three days it is to welcome the artist paolo loredano who is coming from venice he has decided to spend the winter painting in san lorenzo it is a great honor to have him here i hope to commission him to do our portraits he is a member of the doges family and has studied not only with gentile bellini but his brother giovanni as well it will be a festive evening patrick will the english ambassador be at your gathering the earl wondered aloud of course the duke said but you must come if you do not it will seem odd little is secret in san lorenzo as you well know lord howard has probably already been informed of your presence he will be curious of course you can allay his fears by coming with the lady rosamund and being lovers for all to see you have not lost your knack for intrigue sebastian but you will keep the real purpose of my visit secret of course the earl of glenkirk said quietly sandwiched as you are between france and the italian states you would not want to be considered disloyal by either side i know the duke chuckled and eighteen years in your highland eyrie has not lessened your acute abilities to conspire successfully patrick as far as i am concerned your visit is just what it appears to be an older gentleman running away with his young lover the earl winced am i so old then sebastian he asked a bit younger than i am i will admit the duke said you cannot be so old however for you have attracted a young lover or is she after your wealth she has wealth of her own the earl said nay we have for whatever reason fallen in love with each other sebastian does your son know what was his name adam the duke remarked he knows nothing but that i am on a mission sub rosa in the kings service the earl answered but i do not believe he would be distressed by my love for rosamund his wife however is a different matter but he thought he loved her and the family was acceptable so i had no cause for complaint the earl concluded with a small grin how many marriages are made for love my friend the duke said sanguinely marriages are made for wealth and land and power if there is more one is fortunate my late wife god assoil her good soul the duke remarked crossing himself piously was not a woman to inspire passion she understood it and accepted her lot she was loyal and devoted she did her duty i could ask no more of her and i gave her my respect and loyalty in return i found love in other places although i wonder if there was not more lust than love it is usually more lust the earl said quietly but not this time i am old enough and hopefully wise enough to know the difference then i envy you patrick leslie the duke of san lorenzo said now let us have some of our good wine and toast the memories we have made and the memories we will make he clapped his hands and his servitors were immediately by his side afterwards the earl of glenkirk returned to the ambassadors residence walking in a leisurely fashion through the city he stopped in the main market square to purchase a large and colorful bouquet of mimosas from a flower vendor walking on he entered a narrow street going into a jewelers shop where he bought a delicately wrought filigreed golden collar dotted with pale green peridots it would adorn the green silk dress very nicely it was the first piece of jewelry he had ever obtained for rosamund he hoped that she would like it the late afternoon was warm and he was damp about his collar when he finally reached the top of the hill where the scots embassy was located lord macduff greeted him as he entered the building you have been to the palace come and tell me what has transpired between you and the wily fox yon duke the earl signaled to a servant take these to lady rosamund he said handing the woman the bouquet of mimosas tell her i will see her shortly smiling the servingwoman curtsied then took the floral tribute and hurried up the stairs patrick joined his host he hasnt changed he began accepting a small silver goblet of wine as he sat down what did you tell him lord macduff wanted to know what he needed to know we have put him in a delicate position situated as san lorenzo is between france and italy the earl chuckled if the truth should ever come out sebastian di san lorenzo will profess ignorance outrage whatever the situation calls for my lord he will protect san lorenzo at all costs which he should and which is his right and if lord howard is curious as to my presence you will adhere to the story that i am here with my lover you will profess ignorance of all else do you believe we can weaken the alliance patrick the ambassador asked nay and neither does the king but he felt that we must make an attempt at it even if venice and the holy roman empire insist on adhering to their agreement with the holy league they will have certain doubts which i shall plant in the minds of those who come to treat with me they will be less enthusiastic and more cautious than they have been that is the best that we shall do ian but we shall do it henry tudor has not won yet do you know who it is you will meet with yet lord macduff asked nay but i have a suspicion that the artist from venice who is arriving in another day or two and who the duke is feting may be one of the gentlemen i am to deal with he is a member of the loredano family and he has made a name for himself as a former student of both the bellini brothers no one would suspect a venetian artist of political intrigue the earl chuckled but i do not know i shall have to wait and see sebastian insisted that rosamund and i attend this fete he is curious of course to meet her and still i suspect fancies himself a great lover his adventures have not been quite so public in recent years lord macduff said with a smile as he has grown more portly and less fleet of foot he is not so apt to want to find himself facing an angry husband or father his son i imagine has taken over for him the earl said dryly nay lord rudolpho keeps a mistress but he is discreet the ambassador noted i thought he would be like his father patrick said i remember saying so to my daughter once he has fathered enough children aye and all those lasses to boot lord macduff chortled the earl stood up draining his goblet i want to thank you for your hospitality ian macduff rosamund has never been out of england until now except for her brief visit to our court she has been made to feel most welcome she is a fair lass patrick lord macduff said and has beautiful manners according to pietro who as you will remember values such things the servants are happy to have a woman in the house being that i am a crusty old bachelor i would like to remain until spring the earl said you are more than welcome came the smiling reply i think if i had such a lovely woman to love i would want to remain here until spring too patrick left the ambassador and hurried upstairs to his apartments where he found rosamund being fitted for her gowns he sat down to watch giving celestina a friendly nod i hear the seamstress said that you are going to the fete for the venetian patrizio it will be a grand event for the duke will be anxious to impress the artist loredano the festivals and fetes they have in venice are said to be spectacular our duke will have to go to some effort to affect any admiration from his visitor and she chuckled he laughed how the hell do you know we are going to the dukes fete i have only just now come from the palace she rolled her black eyes at him a gesture he realized he well remembered patrizio this is san lorenzo here everyone knows everyones business the english ambassador is curious to meet you by the way he wonders why a former scots ambassador to the duchy has suddenly shown up here now the english are always suspicious of the scots the earl said casually is that not so my love he addressed rosamund always rosamund agreed pleasantly the scots you see cannot be trusted celestina should the neckline be that low it is the fashion here madame celestina answered her it is higher at the scots court rosamund noted it is colder at the scots court the seamstress said pithily here in the south we like the breeze to caress our skin on a warm winters night is that not so my lord i think the neckline is most correct patrick agreed with her will you think it so correct when this duke ogles my breasts rosamund asked innocently he is permitted to ogle my darling the earl told her but nothing more the two women laughed i am doing the bodice of the pale green gown more elaborately madame celestina said you will wear it to the dukes fete along with the gift patrizio has purchased for you on his way from the palace you bought me a gift rosamund squealed i mean besides the flowerswhich are lovely my lord what are they called and where is my gift the blooms are mimosas and as for your gift i am not certain i shall give it to you now you are much too greedy he teased her that is your decision of course my lord but i should dislike seeing a lovely piece of jewelry go to waste rosamund murmured how can you be certain it is jewelry he asked her smiling isnt it she asked mischievously or perhaps you have bought me a villa here and could not carry it with you celestina chortled you have finally met your match patrizio and how glad i am to be here to see it there i am done maria take madames gown and be careful girl the fabric is delicate she gathered up her tools and put them in her basket in just a few more days time madame you will have a new and beautiful wardrobe to get you through the winter here then with a curtsy she departed the earls apartments we are remaining the entire winter months rosamund asked patrick he nodded it will be easier traveling in late spring or early summer my love i had not thought to be away so long she replied the earl of glenkirk put an arm about her your uncle edmund and your cousin tom are husbanding friarsgate for you rosamund tis my lasses i worry more about patrick she told him and do you not trust maybel to watch over them he asked aye but i do not like it that my daughters are so long without their mother she answered him still maybel raised me at least my girls are not being forced into marriages by uncle henry as i was and have you not said that you never think of yourself only your duty i understand because i am the same way but now for just this little space of time you and i are together away from those responsibilities i mean for us to enjoy ourselves but how will you tell the king what he needs to know she wondered when the die has been cast lord macduff will see a message is sent to the king under his diplomatic seal and you and i will remain here to bask in the sunshine make love and drink the wine of san lorenzo rosamund sighed it sounds wonderful she said softly turning in his arms to face him raising her head up for a kiss which he placed upon her ripe lips now she said where is my present patrick burst out laughing and reached into his doublet to draw out the flat white leather case here you vixen he said handing it to her rosamund struggled to maintain restraint she looked at it the fingers of one hand running over the soft leather finally she snapped the small catch and raised the lid her amber eyes grew round oh patrick it is beautiful she said lifting the filigreed gold collar from its velvet nest setting the box aside what are these tiny green gemstones i have never seen any like them they are peridots he told her their color matches the gown celestina first showed us there is a larger stone that can be mounted on a ribbon to be worn in the middle of your forehead i should like to purchase it but i wanted to be certain first that you like this patrick you are too good to me she told him has any other man ever given you jewelry he asked her she nodded aye she said and her lashes brushed her creamy cheek who he demanded his tone jealous my cousin tom rosamund laughed unable to taunt him tom as you know is an unusual gentleman he has a passion for beautiful things and possesses a great deal of lovely jewelry when we were in london he gifted me with many lovely pieces but none as beautiful as this collar my lord standing on tiptoes rosamund kissed him thank you my darling then i shall get the ribbon jewel he asked her would i be too greedy if i said yes she wondered aloud no he told her smiling down into her eyes it will suit you and every minute of the dukes fete i shall be jealous of all the men admiring you oh patrick you never have to be jealous over me rosamund told him i love you as i have never loved any man i knew nothing of love until that night our eyes met across the great hall at stirling did logan hepburn never attract your notice he pressed her aye he did attract my notice he is young and handsome and a very beast of a man but i never loved him rosamund said i dont know how it is possible you love me and not him the earl of glenkirk said quietly why have we met now in the autumn of my years and why are we both so duty bound to our families and lands sometimes i think i should like to run away from it all but of course i wont and you wont nay we shall both do our duty in the end patrick she replied but for now we have each other and we have san lorenzo do not speak on our parting again it will come in its time and we will know it but not yet he drew her back into his embrace his arms tightening about her he said nothing further but his lips touched the top of her auburn head how could they know each other so well on such brief acquaintance he didnt understand but he also didnt care she was here with him and he loved her it was all he needed to know for now he smoothed her silken hair with his big hand and she sighed contentedly the afternoon of the dukes fete celestina and maria arrived with rosamunds gown it cannot be the same garment rosamund cried as she looked at the beautiful gown spread across the bed there was an underskirt embroidered with gold thread in a design of leaping fish shells and sea horses the bodice was sewn all over with pearls the full sleeves were slashed to reveal delicate naturalcolored lace sleeves beneath the slashings were tied with gold cord the pale green watered silk overskirt had been left plain for in combination with the rest of the gown it needed no further artifice it is beautiful rosamund said looking to celestina i cannot thank you enough celestina nodded you will have all the gentlemen clustering about you tonight madame it is a beautiful gown and patrizio will pay dearly for it she laughed with good humor i brought you shoes your annie loaned me one of your boots to match for size i hope they will not be too big she then produced from her voluminous apron pocket a pair of squaretoed slippers covered with the same pale green watered silk as the gown and held them out for rosamund to take rosamund shook her head they are lovely celestina and thanks to you i will be suitably dressed for the fete i shall go and have something to eat with my father celestina said then when you are ready to depart i shall make certain that everything is in order does she think i dont know how to prepare you annie said just a little irritated by the seamstress attitude she is an artist in her own right annie and you will admit that this gown is one of the most beautiful gowns i have ever possessed rosamund said annie nodded her head in agreement even sir thomas would approve of it though the neckline still looks too low to me have a bath prepared rosamund instructed the servingwoman wouldnt it be wonderful if we could fill my tub as easily as we empty it again annie nodded it was necessary to fill the brassbound oak tub with bucket after bucket of water but to empty it was a far simpler operation at the bottom of the tub was a small flexible tube that fit into the side and was unrolled over the terraces edge at the end of its length was a cork which when removed allowed the tub to drain down onto the rocks below while the tub was being filled rosamund ate she was given a dish of fluffy eggs and half of a sweet melon until she arrived in san lorenzo she had never tasted melon now she insisted on having it every day when the tub was filled and annie had scented it with rosamunds favorite white heather fragrance she arose from her table carrying her goblet of sweet wine annie took the caftan from her mistress and naked rosamund walked out onto the terrace handing the goblet to her servant and climbing into her tub annie handed the goblet back when rosamund was settled then pinned her mistress hair up leave me for now annie i will wash eventually but for now i just want to enjoy sitting here in the sunshine and watching the blue sea youll want to siesta afterwards my lady annie said ill move your new gown from the bed and set it safely aside she turned and went back into the apartment rosamund sipped her wine and stared down into the harbor of arcobaleno there was a most magnificent ship sailing majestically into the port it had royalpurpleandgold striped sails and on its bow was a fullbosomed golden mermaid with scarlet tresses rosamund smiled obviously some very important person was aboard such a gorgeous vessel its bringing the artist paolo loredano patrick said as he joined her on the terrace perhaps the ship belongs to the doge himself rosamund remarked or perhaps it belongs to maestro loredano himself the earl suggested he is famed for his portraits as was his first master gentile bellini the duke is anxious to have him do portraits of himself and his family loredano however is very particular about whom he paints he will not take just any commission offered and has offended more than a few what is the duke like rosamund asked older even than i am the earl teased her of medium height a bit corpulent from toogood living his hair was once dark but now it is gray he will appear the good host and will go out of his way to charm you but never forget that he is clever he is ruthless and he is a seducer should i fear him then she wondered nay he said you have treated with kings rosamund just use your own charm and remember he is but a duke patrick said i will remember she told him do you want to share my tub my lord he smiled a slow smile i have been waiting for you to ask my darling he said after stripping his clothing off where he stood patrick climbed into the great tub with her she offered him a sip of her wine which he accepted then setting the goblet aside on the tubs edge she took up the flannel cloth rubbed her soap over it and began to bathe him herself they say in earlier days the lady of the castle and her serving girls always washed important guests rosamund told him they do not say if she got into the tub with her guests however she gently washed his face saying as she did you must have dermid shave you again before tonight i can already see the shadow on your jaw my lord she kissed his mouth quickly he yanked her hard against him and she felt his manhood pressing with some urgency against her thigh his eyes blazed down into hers his mouth fused itself against hers his tongue sliding into her mouth to play with hers her full breasts were flattened against his broad chest he held her face between his two hands while he continued to kiss her his passions rising even as he felt her passions rise i do not believe he said in a hard voice that i have ever fucked you in our tub rosamund but i am about to do it now he growled his hands plunged beneath the warm water and pressing her back against the side of the tub he lifted her up impaling her on his hardness ahh my love he groaned she was tight and hot rosamunds eyes closed with her pleasure as she slid her arms about his neck he filled her with his passion and her head fell onto his shoulder as he loved her until their combined desire burst leaving them both weak but sated i adore you patrick leslie she said softly in his ear i shall never love another as i love you his tongue licked at her face her throat her chest and shoulder as he stood his manhood still hard and deep within her you consume me he groaned softly i cannot get enough of your sweetness rosamund she entwined her legs about him enabling him to press farther and he groaned again i want to soar she whispered in his ear and she licked at the curled flesh their bodies tightly locked together he began to thrust and withdraw until they were both dizzy with the rapture their enthusiasm in each other gave them the intensity of their mutual desire was intoxicating and as their carnality overcame them they both cried out finally satisfied if only briefly her arms still about his neck her legs fell away from his firm body if i let go of you she said i shall drown here for my limbs are as weak as a newborns patrick he laughed softly you are an outrageous woman rosamund i have never known anyone like you nor do i expect i ever will we have to get out of this water she told him but she still clung to him did you enjoy our little water sport he teased her aye she murmured and then to his delight she blushed i never considered making the beast with two backs in water patrick but you liked it his gaze caressed her face i did it was most stimulating i do not believe i have ever been made love to other than in a bed she admitted one day i shall take you in a stable on a pile of sweetsmelling hay he promised her and he laughed or perhaps i shall catch you in a linen cupboard my love i think i am feeling stronger now rosamund answered him it was said that the older men grew the less well they performed in bed but rosamund thought she had had a husband considered an older man and a young lover in king henry but neither of these men had made love to her with such unflagging enthusiasm or suggested such a variety of passion as did patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk she let go of him now and climbed from the tub the water sluiced down her lush form as she reached for the drying cloth he watched her appreciatively until finally satisfied she invited him from their bath and standing naked in the sunshine began to dry him off be careful madame lest you arouse my baser nature again he warned her oh no she scolded him laughing i do not intend to go to the dukes fete tonight meeting the man for the first time with the scent of lust hanging about me patrick you will behave yourself for you shall not have me again until after the fete your head must be clear my lord for it is likely you will meet one or both of your contacts tonight and it does not disturb you that scotland will attempt to undo henry tudors ambitions he asked her as he had on several occasions i have told you patrick that i do not consider trying to stop a war treasonous to england hal might for anything interfering with his plans is anathema to him but no reasonable man or woman would do what you must if you scots come over the border it is my home that will be in danger first not henry tudors rosamund said he laughed ever the practical lady of friarsgate he teased her then he looked about him do you think we can be seen he asked i doubt it rosamund said there is but one villa just above us to the east but no one seems to be inhabiting it she took his hand and led him back into their apartment go to your own bed and rest she instructed i should rather rest in your bed he said with a small grin neither of us would get any rest if we shared my bed my lord and well you know it celestina brought you a beautiful set of clothing for tonight now go make certain dermid laid it out so it will not be creased you are a hard woman he grumbled i will see you later my lord she told him firmly but she smiled when she spoke he left her and rosamund put on a clean chemise and laid down she could hardly believe the incredible turn her life had taken over the last few months she had found true love and she was hundreds of miles from friarsgate yet she was happy she missed her daughters but there was something both thrilling and wonderful about being loved by a man like patrick leslie they would love each other forever even if they would part eventually to return to their own lives this was but a fantasy a beautiful daydream she wished it might be otherwise but she knew it could not neither of them could eschew their responsibilities and neither of them would give up what was theirs but they had today and they would not think about tomorrow until it was done and past annie came and brought her a light supper as the sun was setting rosamund was well rested for she had actually slept for several hours her mind was clear and while she intended being nothing more this evening than lord leslies beautiful mistress she would keep her ears open for whatever tidbits she might gather her french had improved considerably since their arrival a few days ago she had just needed to use it again she remembered how patient owein had been as he had taught her french so she would not appear ignorant when she first came to court it all seemed like a hundred years ago annie helped her dress another chemise one that would fit perfectly beneath the gown was substituted for the one rosamund had been wearing creamcolored silk stockings embraced her legs the neckline of the gown was even lower than it had appeared when the bodice had been lying innocently on the chair rosamunds round breasts swelled dangerously over the lace edging of the gowns pearlstrewn top her shoulders and part of her upper arms were bare the slashed sleeves were almost gauzy annie fitted her mistress with several silk petticoats and then brought the underskirt is there no shakefold rosamund asked looking for the stiffened hooplike garment usually worn beneath her gowns at home celestina says just a couple of petticoats my lady she says it permits the fabric to drape gracefully showing the gown and its wearer to better advantage annie parroted she tied the laces of the undergown tightly then fitted the overgown atop it fastening it neatly then the servant stepped back oh my lady it is so beautiful so elegant and i think a bit naughty but celestina assures me that it is the fashion here rosamund nodded she would not lie she is long past her passion for the earl and her fathers position would be endangered if she did me a disservice she twirled seeing how the gown moved and was pleased let us finish my hair she said celestinas daughter martina has been sent to do it my lady annie said i am to learn from her have her come in then rosamund replied sitting down at a little table martina looked nothing at all like her mother she was tall and lanky but she did have celestinas direct manner ah madame is ready she began she moved quickly behind rosamund first she said i must see what kind of hair madame has she began brushing the thick auburn locks ah excellent the brush worked vigorously you will wear no cap she said i am told that you have a jeweled ribbon to be worn she found the part in the center of rosamunds head now here is a style i particularly like and that will suit madame it is simple it will not detract from her beauty i fold the hair thusly fastening it with pins girl hold up a mirror for your mistress to see i call it a chignon and as rosamund viewed herself in the mirror martina attached a halfmoon of delicate silk flowers in cream gold and pale green across the top of the chignon lastly she fastened the pale green silk ribbon with the oval green peridot set in its center about rosamunds forehead then she held up a second mirror behind her client that rosamund might see the full effect rosamund stared i do not believe i have ever seen such a beautiful hairstyle she said honestly in england we keep our hair beneath caps and hoods mostly thank you martina please teach annie how you do this it is simple madame and your servant does not seem stupid martina answered what did she say annie asked that she will be delighted to teach you how to do this style annie really you must try to learn the language better rosamund scolded gently there was a knock on the door and dermid stuck his head through his lordship wants to know if her ladyship is ready to leave yet the ambassadors carriage is already waiting outside give me my shoes rosamund said then she slipped her feet into the slippers that were placed before her and arose turning as she did to say i thank you both then she hurried from the bedchamber out into the dayroom where the earl of glenkirk awaited her oh my she said as she caught her first glimpse of him his dark green velvet breeches were striped in deep forest green and cloth of gold his fine silken hose were deep green with a tied gold cord garter on one shapely leg his short coat was silk brocade the sleeves padded and puffed it was trimmed in dark brown marten fur the doublet beneath which was embroidered in gold thread with a floral design was also slashed to show the creamcolored silk shirt beneath his matching hat had a soft crown but a hard turnedup brim and a white ostrich plume his shoes were fine brown leather he had a large heavy gold chain about his neck and both his hands were beringed there was a bejeweled dagger at his waist may i return the compliment the earl said admiring rosamund you may she replied then let us go madame lord macduff awaits us below i think it is time you met your host the earl took rosamunds arm and led her from the apartment and downstairs where ian macduff stood along with celestina who nodded her approval at the couple but said nothing the scots ambassadors gray eyes widened as he saw them descend he came immediately forward taking rosamunds hand up and kissing it madame i am pleased to have you as my guest it is an honor to entertain the queens good friend unfortunately the queen does not know i am here rosamund admitted she would be most vexed with me i fear then we shall keep your secret lady rosamund the ambassador said with a smile but the queen is generous of heart and would certainly want her friend happy he finished with another smile shall we go he led them outside where the open carriage awaited them lord macduff obviously did not know meg well rosamund thought amused margaret tudor wanted what she wanted when she wanted it still the man was an ambassador and obviously a good one rosamund allowed a footman to help her into the vehicle she had never seen an open coach for in england and scotland such a thing would be considered ridiculous here with the warm evening and the sun setting as they started off to the palace it was quite perfect they moved down the hill upon which the ambassadors residence was located and along a narrow street into the cathedral square the carriage crossed the square traveling into a broader avenue lined with large and elegant houses it eventually gave way to a thoroughfare lined with tall trees they began to ascend a hill coming finally to the dukes palace at the mounts summit they passed through great gates and traveled along a drive of perfectly raked white gravel as their coach passed servants came out from the shrubbery to rerake the drive that it might be perfect for the next vehicle the palace itself was built of creamcolored marble they stopped before its entry porch which was lined with elegant marble pillars speckled with green there was a large marble fountain before the palace with a bronze statue of a boy on a dolphin which sprayed water into the pool lanterns were hung everywhere in the trees their carriage stopped and they were helped from it by servants in the dukes blue and gold livery the two gentlemen escorted rosamund into the palace where a majordomo greeted them obsequiously my lord ambassador lord leslie lady rosamund he said and he ushered them towards the exquisite hall where the duke was holding his fete now how rosamund wondered to herself did this servant whom she had never before in her life seen know her name they were announced by a second majordomo the first having left them at the entry to the hall to return to his place in the entry foyer his excellency the ambassador from his most noble and catholic majesty king james of scotland lord ian macduff lord patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk lady rosamund bolton the majordomo called out in ringing tones they moved down several marble steps into the lovely hall so different from what she was used to rosamund noted for one thing there were no fireplaces and one wall of the room opened to a terrace that she could see beyond the pale gold marble pillars there was a ducal throne at one end of the hall and they now moved towards it sebastian duke of san lorenzo watched them come and struggled to maintain his surprise when he had learned that his old friend lord leslie traveled with a lovely female companion he had not anticipated she would be so so so young and so deliciously ripe he would not have expected such a thing from a man from the north lord leslie while enjoying san lorenzo during his tenure as ambassador had always been most correct a man his age did not travel with so exquisite and youthful a mistress unless he was very much in love sebastian di san lorenzo had never considered that patrick leslie would be in love at any age he arose from the ducal throne and stepping off the dais offered both his hands in greeting to the earl of glenkirk to any watching it would certainly appear as if they were just meeting patrick his voice boomed for all to hear welcome back to san lorenzo he turned his head slightly and gave a sharp look to his heir rudolpho who immediately stood up and came forward bowing to the earl you will remember my son of course of course patrick said he would never as long as he lived forget rudolpho di san lorenzo had it not been for this man now before him his daughter might not have been lost to him he bowed curtly and this is his wife henrietta maria the duke said drawing his daughterinlaw forward madame the earl said bowing low over the outstretched hand she might have once been pretty he thought but she was worn and wan with all of her childbearing you are most welcome to san lorenzo henrietta maria said in a soft voice her warm brown eyes were sympathetic so she knew the earl thought and then he smiled at her i thank you madame he said quietly macduff the duke greeted the ambassador my lord duke was the equally short reply the dukes gaze now fastened itself on rosamund and who is this he almost purred his black eyes plunging into the valley between her breasts may i present the lady of friarsgate rosamund bolton the ambassador said and rosamund curtsied low allowing the duke an even better view of her ample charms my dear lady the duke said oozing charm so fair a flower is most welcome to my duchy and he took her hand up to kiss but he did not release it i am honored my lord rosamund said quietly in perfect french withdrawing her hand from his in a smooth motion the duke then introduced her to his heir and his heirs wife before they were able to move off into the crowd of other guests what happened to his wife rosamund asked patrick she died about five years after my daughter disappeared he responded and the duke did not remarry he had a grown heir and by then rudi had one son and three daughters i imagine he saw no need besides he has always enjoyed the attentions of many women the duchess mariatheresa was a patient woman with a good heart i suspect he might even have loved her rosamund nodded where is the guest of honor i wonder she said and at that moment the majordomo at the entry to the lovely hall called out my lords and my ladies maestro paolo loredano di venetzia and all eyes turned to the man atop the steps chapter paolo loredano was a tall slender man with bright red hair he was dressed in the most elegant and fashionable garb his silken breeches were striped in silver and rich purple and his hose was cloth of silver with a gold rosette garter on one leg his doublet was lavender and gold satin brocade embroidered in deep purple his short silk coat was of cloth of gold and cloth of silver with large puffed and padded sleeves on his head was a purple velvet cap with an ostrich plume the gold chain that fell from his neck and lay on his chest was studded with sparkling gemstones his roundtoed shoes were purple silk and on each of his fingers he had a ring of some sort he carried a single silver glove in his hand and at his waist was a light dress sword with a cruciform hilt he stood a moment atop the steps leading down into the hall observing then with mincing steps he descended as the duke came forward to greet him my dear maestro i bid you welcome to san lorenzo we are so honored you have decided to make it your winter home the duke said grazia loredano said anywhere is preferable to venice in february my dear duke your little enclave however has everything i like sunny weather the sea and an abundance of good light for painting i have taken a villa overlooking the harbor for my servant and myself he took in the hall again and he continued you seem to have many beautiful women and young men as well i think i shall be quite content here my dear duke the doge sends you his greetings he is well i hope duke sebastian replied considering his age he is indeed well we fully expect him to continue to rule for at least another ten years if not more paolo loredano answered excellent excellent the duke said jovially come now and meet my son and some of our guests and he drew the artist forward by the arm so he might be introduced to his son and his daughterinlaw one by one the other guests came forward to meet the venetian and here is another visitor to my duchy she joins us each winter the duke said may i present to you baroness irina von kreutzenkampe of kreutzenburg baroness the artist said bowing over the beautiful womans plump beringed hand his bright black eyes surveying her bosom you must pose for me he said smiling i shall paint you as a barbarian warrior queen the baroness blue eyes looked directly at the artist and how shall i be costumed she asked her tone while quiet was also teasing you shall have a helmet a spear and a discreet drapery he told her but your bosom must be bared barbarian warrior women were always bare breasted he finished the baroness laughed a low and smoky laugh i shall consider it she said i would gift your husband with the painting the artist murmured i am a widow maestro irina von kreutzenkampe answered him and then she moved away and this is lord macduff the ambassador from king james of scotland the duke continued sorry that the previous conversation had been ended lord macduff bowed nodded and moved on and the earl of glenkirk who was king james first ambassador to me many years ago he has returned this winter with his companion to escape the cold may i present lady rosamund bolton of friarsgate the duke said the earl bowed but the artists eyes went past him to fix themselves on rosamund you are beautiful madonna he said softly grazia maestro rosamund responded she was beginning to learn the italian language now i shall paint you too the artist said enthusiastically you i shall envision as the goddess of love madonna do not say no to me rosamund laughed lightly you flatter me maestro she said but you have not said yes he cried i have not have i she answered him and then taking patricks arm she moved off you flirted with him the earl said sounding slightly aggrieved i did she agreed but i did not say i should allow him to paint me with my breasts bare or otherwise and rosamund laughed if it would help me to gain my ends with venice would you he asked wickedly yes she told him yes i would patrick he wants to seduce me you know but before or after he has had his way with the baroness i am not certain she giggled he laughed you are probably right now the baroness interests me very much my information tells me that she is the daughter of one of emperor maximilians contemporaries she comes to san lorenzo each winter macduff thinks she is the emperors eyes and ears here for the duke is much in favor with the germans who visit his port on a regular basis who would suspect a woman of spying she is very beautiful rosamund noted if you like largebosomed women with gold hair blue eyes and an inviting smile patrick said mischievously well she has had her eye on you this evening rosamund muttered but dont you think she is a bit er large these germanic woman tend to be bigboned he replied they make a right armful i am told are you jealous my love of the baroness no more than you are of the venetian my lord rosamund responded smoothly and she looked up at her lover and smiled before he might reply however the lady in question glided to his side my lord leslie she said i believe there are matters we must discuss soon when may we speak close up rosamund could see the baroness face was lightly pockmarked she did not speak to the earls companion my ambassador will be giving a small feast in a few days you will be invited madame and there we may speak with each other in the privacy of the embassy and not arouse suspicions by doing so the earl of glenkirk told her she held out her plump hand to him that is suitable she said i shall look forward to our next meeting he murmured kissing her hand i did not know lord macduff was giving a feast in a few days time rosamund said neither does macduff the earl replied with a grin i would prefer it if i could speak with venice first that is why you will tell the artist that you are considering his invitation but that you would like to see his studio first i will come with you if he is our man he will use that opportunity to approach me our visit to his studio will not arouse anyones suspicions neither will the baroness visit to the embassy for a feast i think that if you come with me the venetian will not approach you he will have his guard up and consider that you come because you dont trust him to be alone with me he may even think i am king james emissary let me go alone and then you shall call for me when you do you shall ask to see his studio and say you are considering allowing the maestro to paint me i shall feign weariness and retreat to the street for fresh air at that point if he is your contact he will certainly speak with you then and no one shall be the wiser the earl of glenkirk smiled admiringly at rosamund you really do have a taste for intrigue my love he said i think king henry has lost a valuable ally in you hal does not consider women intelligent enough for much more than futtering she answered him dryly i do not understand it for his grandmother the venerable margaret was highly intelligent and his father respected her for it everyone who knew her did everyone but hal i always thought he was a little afraid of her i like your plan my love but we shall execute it together lest the maestro think you otherwise interested in his advances the earl said come and let us tell him they crossed the room together to where paolo loredano was now standing surrounded by a bevy of young women rosamund almost laughed aloud at the look in his eye as he contemplated each lady with the delight of a boy offered an entire plate of his favorite sweets all for himself the artist she decided was vain and had obviously been quite spoiled by the women in his life but their path to him was suddenly blocked by lord howard the english ambassador what he demanded of the earl without any preamble are you doing here my lord i find it odd that james stewart should send his first ambassador back to san lorenzo after so many years patrick looked almost scornfully at the englishman i am no longer a young man my lord highland winters are difficult for me now it is not your affair why i am here but i shall tell you for you english have such an untrusting nature this lady is my mistress we wished to be out of the eye of the court at stirling in order to enjoy each others company without interference san lorenzo has a marvelous climate in the winter and so i chose to bring us here there is nothing more to our visit than that what could have possibly made you think otherwise who would care what you do my lord lord howard said scathingly except for the brief time in which you served your king as ambassador here you are unimportant the lady is a close associate of the queens my lord the earl replied does that satisfy your curiosity now step out of my way please i wish to speak with the artist about painting my ladys portrait lord howard moved aside without another word the woman with lord leslie was vaguely familiar to him but he could not quite place her he would have to think upon it was she one of margaret tudors english ladies but no they had all been returned to england years ago still he knew he had seen the woman with the earl of glenkirk at some time and place before today and he did not believe for one moment that patrick has casually decided to come to san lorenzo to escape the cold of scotlands winter yet that part might actually be true scotlands winters could be vile but no ships from scotland had put into the port of arcobaleno recently how had glenkirk and his companion gotten here a french ship most likely as the scots were so tight with the french he would consider it for his instincts told him that all was not quite as it appeared i believe he has recognized me rosamund said softly when they were well past the english ambassador he does not know who i am but he knows he has seen me before we have not ever been formally introduced so hopefully he cannot make the connection even if he did what would he make of it you are a beautiful woman who has run away with her lover there is nothing more to it glenkirk reassured her they had now reached the venetian and his admirers maestro the earl said jovially i believe i may want you to paint my ladys portrait but she is hesitant may we come and see your studio one day soon but of course paolo loredano said in equally jocund tones i will receive guests between ten oclock in the morning and siesta and again in the evening send to me when you are to come his black eyes caressed rosamunds features ah madonna i shall make you immortal then he took her small hand up in his and kissed it lingeringly releasing it with reluctance you flatter me again maestro loredano rosamund murmured and her lashes brushed against her cheeks but once before she looked up at him again and smiled a brilliant smile i shall look forward to visiting your studio but i am not yet certain if i will allow you to paint me are you a very famous painter in venice he laughed at what he considered her naivety only my friends il giorgione and titian surpass me although it is said my portraits are better than theirs the artist bragged if i paint you madonna your beauty will be everlasting even if you grow old and haggish i suppose you mean to reassure me rosamund pretended to consider but first i must see just what it is an artist does to obtain a portrait come my love the earl said the dancing will soon begin grazia maestro loredano i shall inform you when we are coming he took rosamunds arm and moved them away back into the crush of the dukes guests must you flirt with him he demanded of her yes she answered him if i am to keep him intrigued long enough for you to learn if it is he you are to treat with i must flirt with him he is not i can see a man who would take rejection lightly it would offend his sense of who he is my lord and so i flirt with him and he is flattered enough to want to continue what he thinks is his pursuit of me along the road to eventual seduction it means naught to me he is a popinjay of the sort i cannot really abide i met many like him at my king and your kings court surely you are not jealous patrick you have no need to be you must certainly know that when our eyes first met my love i knew i had not really lived or loved until you i would hardly throw all of our happiness away over that venetian braggart he stopped drawing her into an alcove of the hall his hand cupped her face tenderly i am not a young man rosamund and i fear you will one day realize it i had the same feelings when we first met but sometimes i am afraid i will lose you too soon when the truth is that i do not want to lose you at all i know one day we must part but if we were to part because you loved another man i do not think i could bear it though i would for your happiness is all that matters to me now her eyes shone with bright tears if my girls were older patrick i should leave friarsgate for you which is something i never thought i would say for i love friarsgate with every fiber of my being if i knew for certain that it was safe from my uncle henry and his kin if philippa my eldest were old enough to manage without me then my love there should be no question of our ever parting but none of this is so nor is it likely to be very soon and so we shall eventually partyou to return to your glenkirk and i to go back to friarsgate however until then we shall be together and we shall love each other for a lifetime of being apart she stood on her tiptoes then and kissed him sweetly i am too old to have my heart broken he told her i will not break it my lord she promised him you must remarry one day rosamund he told her why she asked friarsgate has its heiresses and i shall want none after you patrick leslie a woman needs a man to protect her and to love her he replied you love me and will even from the distance that will one day separate us and as for me i am perfectly capable of defending what is mine i always have he shook his head you are an amazing woman he told her so it has been said of me before she teased him and now he laughed again which had been her intent they could hear music now and they stepped from the alcove to watch the dancing for rosamund was not ready yet to join the merriment the dukes musicians played well his guests all seemed to be beautiful and the clothing was colorful and magnificent while her gown was far more daring in design than one she would have worn in england or in scotland rosamund could now understand the difference in style even in the summer the climate at home was not as delicious as was san lorenzo in late february she had never known such warm weather and she was not certain she could live yearround in such a climate but for now it seemed just right to her they finally joined in the dancing and together they entered the figure twirling and intertwining with the other dancers at one point rosamund found herself dancing with the dukes heir rudolpho he still hates me her partner told her you cannot expect him to forgive you rosamund answered it was you who gave janet leslie the blackamoor who betrayed her but i never anticipated such treachery from the creature rudolpho di san lorenzo protested you could not have anticipated it rosamund agreed but it happened nonetheless and it cost lord leslie his beloved daughter you cannot expect him to forgive you for that until this winter he has never ventured from his home had we not met at king james court he would not even be here now why is he here came the question because we did not wish to share our passion with all the gossips at king james court our love like most loves will not last forever but in the meantime is not san lorenzo a wonderful place in which we may share it she smiled as he passed her on to her next partner the english ambassador where have we met before madame for i never forget a face lord howard said we have never before tonight been introduced my lord rosamund answered him honestly and her look was direct but you are english he said i am sure of it i am she agreed then what are you doing with a scots earl he demanded of her rosamund laughed almost derisively come now my lord you have surely evaluated the nature of my relationship with lord leslie must i spell it out for you i am his mistress there is nothing sinister in it but how did you meet he persisted really my lord rosamund protested i find your curiosity most unseemly and quite indelicate and at that moment he was forced to hand her off to another partner the duke himself you are enjoying yourself cara sebastian di san lorenzo murmured his eyes going to her breasts which swelled over the neckline of her gown very much so my lord rosamund agreed and she laughed as he twirled her about in the elegant figure of the dance king james court is most delightful but your little court is not just delightful but also charming perhaps i find it so because of the warm weather i have never known such soft air my lord duke your beauty graces my court even more the duke said you flatter me my lord rosamund responded to the compliment beautiful women are meant to be praised he told her perhaps i should have come to san lorenzo sooner rosamund answered him and she gave him a smile as she was passed along to her next partner the earl of glenkirk i have never known men to chatter so much in the dance she said as the music finally ceased and they moved from the floor to accept goblets of sweet iced wine were you praised for your loveliness he asked her the dukes heir yet feels guilt over what happened to your daughter and he realizes you dislike him for some reason it distresses him the english ambassador is certain he has met me but i was honestly able to tell him we had never been introduced but i am certain now he has seen me before it is only a matter of time before he will recall where the duke however ogled my bosom and told me i was beautiful and should be praised rosamund reported to her lover with a mischievous smile he laughed at her recitation then you are enjoying yourself here he said i am she admitted to him i have been to englands court and to scotlands court but i have never had such a good time as i am having here in san lorenzo why is that patrick is it the weather or the delightful informality that persists it is like a wonderful fete one would give in their own home and not at all stuffy it is because we are in love he told her everything is perfect when two people are in love then he looked into her eyes and was lost for a long moment must we remain she asked him softly nay i think we may sneak out and return to the villa he said leave the carriage for macduff the streets are well lit and the moon is full we can walk back for it is not really that far she suggested agreed he told her the streets of arcobaleno were safe and he knew it they moved discreetly from the dukes hall through the marble foyer and outside they waved the ambassadors driver away well walk the earl called to him and the man nodded smiling hand in hand they traveled back down the perfectly raked driveway and out through the gates of the palace onto the street beyond it was late but here and there a window cast a friendly glow and the street torches lit their way they entered the main square of arcobaleno and patrick stopped a moment staring at the great cathedral that fronted one side of the square memories she asked softly aye he admitted then he shook his head i didnt want her betrothed so young he said i didnt want her married young i feared an unfortunate end for her as i had had with her mother and with my wife but janet would not have it my daughter wanted to be betrothed and wed to sebastians son the betrothal ceremony was in the cathedral i can still see my daughter all garbed in white and gold standing atop the cathedral steps with rudi after all the papers had been signed together they made a most spectacularly beautiful couple and how the people cheered them oh my dearest love rosamund attempted to comfort him i am so sorry coming here has brought it all back to me so strongly he said if only i knew what happened to her that she was all right that she was alive my son continues to seek her out we know she was sold in the great slave market in candia to one of the ottoman sultans representatives sebastian sent one of his own cousins to try to buy her back even as he began entertaining an offer of marriage from toulouse for his son under the circumstances a marriage between my daughter and the dukes son could not possibly have taken place all i wanted was my daughter safely returned but she was lost to us and i could not forgive either the duke or his son for what happened the duke had to consider his familys good name but not once did that spineless offspring of his come to my daughters defense i had not realized how strongly i felt about it all these years later and you would not have rosamund said leading him across the square and into the hilly street that led up to the scots ambassadors villa except that you came back patrick the past is past my love as painful as this is for you you owe your king a duty in this matter do what you must do and we shall leave but when we leave it but brings us closer to parting he groaned come home with me to friarsgate she said your son is capable of looking after glenkirk stay with me patrick you will like friarsgate the hills tumble down into my lake the meadows are filled with my sheep and cattle it is a peaceful place and i would give you some peace my love you lost your own dear daughter but i have three little girls they would love you patrick you do not have to leave your beloved glenkirk forever you can go back and mayhap i will go with you one day but when you have done what you must for scotland come home to friarsgate with me they had reached the top of the hill where the embassy was situated he stopped and she saw he was seriously considering her words i could come with you he said softly but would we wed rosamund nay she told him our love for each other is not dependent upon marriage i suspect it would upset your son and daughterinlaw greatly there is no need to do that it is easier if everyone believes you are just visiting me or i you i should like to come back to friarsgate with you he said slowly and thoughtfully there is no need for me to be at glenkirk all the time i do not feel the time is propitious for us to be parted rosamund told him nor do i he admitted then it is settled between us patrick you will come home to friarsgate with me after you have seen the king and made your report to him it is settled he agreed as they entered the villa for the next few days they played publicly and privately at being lovers and nothing more and then several mornings after the dukes fete they rode their horses to the villa where the venetian artist was now residing rosamund left the earl and entered the artists villa where she was met by a servingman tell the maestro that lady rosamund bolton is here to visit his studio as agreed she said the servant bowed and hurried off he returned a few moments later bowing and saying if the madonna would follow me i shall take her to the maestro he led her into a large lightfilled room where paolo loredano was even now painting a landscape of the scene outside his windows he was wearing dark breeches and hose and when he turned to greet her she saw that his linen shirt was open revealing his chest he was she had to admit to herself very virile in appearance madonna he greeted her effusively throwing down his paintbrush to take her two hands up in his and kiss them you have come at last good morning maestro she replied pulling her hands free so this is an artists studio how can it be so cluttered and you here barely a week rosamund laughed as she looked around i know exactly where everything is he assured her carlo biscotti and vino at once then grasping a single hand he led her to a large highbacked chair sit down madonna i shall begin my sketch now rosamund retrieved her hand a second time but i have not said i should pose for you maestro tell me has the baroness been here yet he laughed are you jealous madonna he taunted her nay maestro for i have no need i was merely curious rosamund said you will break my heart madonna i sense it i am very intuitive he cried dramatically now it was rosamund who laughed i do believe that you are a complete fraud maestro she teased him have you come to torture me madonna he asked her i have come to see your studio and to see if i should enjoy posing for you she told him and what have you decided he queried her ah here is carlo again put the tray down and get out he instructed his servant in their native tongue how can i proceed with my seduction if you are lingering about sм maestro carlo answered his master with a toothy grin and he departed the studio what did you say to him rosamund inquired i am just learning your tongue i told him to leave us so i could make love to you paolo loredano said boldly and drawing rosamund up from her chair he pulled her into his arms and kissed her passionately even while his hand was plunging into her bodice to fondle her breast maestro she shrieked yanking his hand from her gown you are far too bold and if you think to have a commission from the earl of glenkirk you must behave i must have you he groaned lunging at her again rosamund dodged his advance and slapped his face as hard as she could how dare you behave in such a dishonorable manner maestro your lips are like the sweetest honey and your skin is silken to my touch how can you deny me how can you deny yourself i am considered an incomparable lover madonna and your earl is hardly a young man he rubbed his cheek nay he is not a young man but neither is he an old one and as for his skills in bed sport he is vigorous tender and passionate rosamund said now pour us some of that lovely san lorenzan wine maestro i will forgive your breach of good manners and you will promise me it will not happen again i cannot he said handing her a goblet of wine but i will hold my passions in check for now madonna he offered her a biscuit are all artists mad she asked him nibbling at the biscuit and sipping her wine only the great ones he assured her with a grin i like the landscape you are doing of the harbor she said getting up and going over to the large canvas upon which he was working you have caught it exactly and i can almost smell the sea looking at it she eyed him warily as he set down his goblet i have something to show you madonna he told her and he drew forth from a table several sketches and handed them to her she took them and began to peruse them her eyes widening with surprise and shock she stared at him questioningly paolo loredano grinned audaciously at her and taking her by the hand led her out onto his terrace i have he said a most excellent view from here i saw you bathing the afternoon that i arrived in arcobaleno i have sketched you several times since madonna you have a beautiful body which is why i would portray you as the goddess of love your breasts in particular are very fine i thought you found the baroness bosom most excellent rosamund answered him she was shocked by the charcoal sketches of her nudity that he had so accurately captured she felt it a terrible invasion of her privacy the baroness bosom is quite excellent for a woman of her years but yours he kissed his fingertips enthusiastically magnifico he said my lord leslie will not be pleased maestro rosamund responded in reply he handed her another small sheaf of sketches they were of patrick and also of the two of them together rosamund gasped audibly you are much too bold maestro you had no right to trespass upon those moments privy to only us my lord will not be happy by what you have done i fear but he will manage somehow to overcome his aversion to my behavior for he must treat with me as i represent venice i do not understand you maestro rosamund said but she did patrick had been correct this artist spoke for the doge still she put on a face of confusion he reached out and ran a single finger down her cheek to her jaw mayhap you do not i know if i were your lover i should discuss naught with you but the ways in which we might please each other but i do not like seeing you distressed madonna the artist handed her the group of sketches keep them as a memento of your visit to san lorenzo or destroy them if they embarrass you i could not destroy your work maestro it would be a sacrilege for your art is wonderful i shall however keep them well hidden from my impressionable daughters she told him you have bambini he exclaimed aye your body has that lushness yet it has not been spoiled by your birthings how many three rosamund answered him are they lord leslies he questioned her they are the children of my late husband rosamund answered him smiling do you have children maestro at least fifteen that i know of he said casually sometimes the ladies are not certain or they are angry at me and do not want me to know or in some cases they do not want their husbands to know i have ten sons but none of them shows a talent for painting to my sorrow i have one daughter however who could one day be famous were it not for her sex a woman in venice may become a shopkeeper a courtesan a nun or a wife but never an artist how unfortunate particularly if your daughter is talented and you obviously think she is rosamund responded there was a discreet knock upon the door to the studio and it opened to reveal the artists servant carlo maestro he said the lord leslie is here now to see you send him in the artist said you will want to speak with lord leslie alone rosamund said quietly gathering up the sheaf of sketches i will leave you so you do know he said with an amused smile i know nothing maestro you must remember that i am english and patrick leslie is a scot it is better this way she moved gracefully past him smiling as her lover entered the room i will await you outside my lord she told him and was gone patrick closed the door behind him good day to you paolo loredano he said in his deep voice do we have anything to discuss between us sit down my lord and have some wine the artist said pouring a goblet for the earl and then joining him as he sat down in the opposite chair you have already ascertained that i am here on behalf of my cousin the doge we need play no silly games you and i what is it that scotland wants of venice so you are not the fool you pretend to be patrick noted paolo loredano laughed nay i am not but the pose gains me far more than if i did not play the fool my lord the earl of glenkirk nodded his holiness the pope has put my master king james in a difficult position patrick began pope julius has always favored your master loredano said aye he has but now he needs something that my master cannot give him the earl continued scotland and england have ever been the most contentious of neighbors as everyone knows king james married an english princess in order to ensure peace between the two kingdoms peace has helped scotland grow prosperous and prosperity is good for the people who share in it jamie stewart is a good king he is intelligent and he governs well his people truly love him he is devout and loyal to the holy mother church but most of all james stewart is the most honorable and loyal of men while his fatherinlaw ruled england all was good between us now however his brotherinlaw the eighth henry sits on the throne he is young and reckless he is jealous of his brotherinlaw and he wants above all things to be known as the greatest ruler in all of europe he believes that king james so long favored by the pope stands in his way last year pope julius the second sided with france against venice now at king henrys instigation he would stand with venice and others against france and he has demanded that my master do so too he is very clever this english king the artist noted softly he is ruthless the earl of glenkirk said england knows that scotland has an old alliance with france my king cannot break that alliance without just cause and there is no cause at englands insistence the pope demands scotland join his holy league against france we cannot and venice the artist asked my master seeks to weaken the alliance so that the pope has greater concerns than scotland i was sent to speak with the representative of venice and of the holy roman emperor frankly patrick said i see little hope in this plan but king james is desperate to avoid the war that is sure to ensue between scotland and england should we refuse to betray our alliance with france and join the league king henry will use our refusal as an excuse to attack scotland he will declare us traitors to christendom there is no profit in war as i am certain you understand maestro loredano venice is a great commercial empire should you not be looking to the east and the ottoman to protect yourselves if you allow your troops to join with the leagues do you not enfeeble venices power paolo loredano chuckled you present a good case for your king my lord and your argument is a fine one however the doge is determined to keep on pope julius good side in this matter could you not remain neutral the earl asked could you not plead your own citys danger from the ottoman and promise not to interfere on either partys behalf that paolo loredano said would be the best course i agree but the doge will not do it he thinks if the ottomans attack us the league will come to our aid i frankly cannot imagine the english king or spain or the emperor sending troops to deliver us but i am not the doge he is old and sometimes when i see him i think he does not even know who i am i have no real influence on him i am his messenger sent here to listen and to report back to him but i tell you your mission as you well know is a useless one i am sorry my lord patrick nodded king james expected as much but he must try for his own countrys sake will you however send a messenger to venice with what we have spoken on today of course the artist replied i have a fine welltrained coop of pigeons for just that purpose i must remain the winter not an unpleasant task so as not to incur any suspicion will you be staying as well aye i always found the winters here salubrious now do you really want to paint rosamund if you do i shall commission the painting from you loredano sighed she is very fair and most in love with you my lord in other words the earl chuckled you attempted to seduce her and she rebuffed you she did he admitted but strangely i was not offended as i might have been with another woman she slapped me and scolded me but there were no tears or recriminations and then we continued on as if i had not approached her so boldly at all she is a practical country woman the earl said quietly and you do not wish to challenge me to the duel the artist asked if rosamund is no longer offended then neither am i maestro loredano besides you are too young for me to engage in battle he concluded with a smile the artist laughed there are i am beginning to see certain advantages to old age you may speak freely and do as you choose to do and have a lovely young mistress i have always been afraid of growing older my lord now i think i am not patrick rose from his seated position as did his companion he towered over the venetian by at least four inches i shall he said accept your conclusions as a compliment maestro loredano you may come to the ambassadors villa tomorrow to begin your portrait of rosamund bolton he bowed slightly but politely i bid you good day and you also the venetian said bowing a deeper more respectful bow the earl of glenkirk departed the artists villa and joined rosamund outside they mounted their horses and they began their ride back to the scots villa the day was actually growing quite warm and the earl suggested a gleam in his eye that perhaps they should have their tub filled and enjoy the afternoon together rosamund laughed we will not be using our tub until i can have an awning put up patrick our terrace it seems is visible from the artists studio he has sketched us in our tub and out i have the sketches with me but we must see his view is compromised so we may retain our privacy patrick didnt know whether or not to laugh hes a bold fellow this paolo loredano tell me rosamund have you ever been swimming in the sea i have never really been swimming at all she told him i paddled about a stream at friarsgate as a child but i do not really know how to swim then i shall teach you he said this afternoon we shall go to a little hidden beach outside of town the sea here is gentle and warm can we take a picnic she asked him tis a fine idea sweetheart he replied they arrived back at lord macduffs villa to find the servants bustling about for the supper party that the earl had promised the baroness was to be held late the next afternoon there was much preparation to be done before then still the cook in the embassy kitchens was happy to make up a basket for the earl he filled it with fresh bread a soft waxcovered cheese wrapped in cheesecloth half of a cold chicken some thinly sliced ham and a large bunch of green grapes lastly he tucked in a bottle of wine and sent his helper off to bring the basket to the earl rosamund had gone to their apartments to change into something less formal than she had been wearing she slipped into a darkcolored skirt and a shirt annie was nowhere to be found but rosamund was quite capable of dressing herself the earl entered and she spread the charcoal sketches that the artist had given her upon a table for him to see there was one of her in the tub another of her completely naked as she stepped from the tub and several studies of her using the drying cloth there was a sketch of the earl as god had made him and another of him in the tub with her rosamund blushed again as she looked at that particular view for it was obvious that they were coupling in the tub he has a good eye the earl remarked dryly as he studied the sketches it is too sharp for my taste rosamund said then she picked up the last sketch which had been lying facedown and turned it over gods foot she exclaimed patrick chuckled wickedly it is not funny rosamund said angrily i am responsible for the girl the sketch they viewed was of annie and dermid who had been caught in a most compromising pose the earls man had annie against the wall of the villa and he was obviously futtering her for all she was worth annies eyes were closed in utter bliss her arms about her lover her legs about his middle while his hands cupped her bottom he must marry her rosamund declared i agree the earl responded your annie is not foolish and i am certain that dermid has made promises that you and i will see he keeps but for now let us go down to the sea and spend a quiet afternoon they left their apartments and went out to where fresh horses were awaiting them the picnic basket was already attached to the earls saddle the animals moved slowly off out into the road patrick leading and rosamund following they did not ride through the town but rather turned off on a small side path following it as it twisted and turned brought them at last to a small crescent of golden sand they left their horses to graze in the little shady grove of trees at the foot of the hill they had just descended the earl spread a cloth on the sand and set the basket down he began to unlace his clothing what are you doing she asked we cannot swim in our clothes he told her i thought we would swim in our undergarments she answered and then they will be wet when we must dress and ride home he replied very well rosamund said and she undid her skirt letting it fall to the ground she stepped from it and laid it neatly aside setting her slippers next to it the sand is warm she exclaimed as she pulled her blouse off putting it with the skirt lastly came her chemise she was nude now go into the water he said to her pulling the last of his own garments off and he took her hand and ran down to the sea with her oh it is cold rosamund said no it isnt he laughed if you had ever been in the seas off of scotland you would know what cold really is my love duck under a moment and then you will see the air is cooler ill vow i dont want to go any farther she said nervously you are as far out as you should be he said the water is at your waist and now i shall teach you how to swim my love and he did much to rosamunds surprise soon she was paddling about in the shallows with confidence gradually he lured her out into deeper water and she suddenly discovered the water was over her head a look of panic swept her face he quickly took her hand reassuring her as he did the water is calm my love and warm you are just slightly over your head see i am still standing now kick and paddle as i have taught you as your make your way back towards the shore her heartbeat calmed itself and no longer frightened rosamund swam slowly back finally standing to discover the water just up to her knees she turned about grinning proudly now swim back out to me he said bravely she obeyed his command swimming out into the deep water again turning and going back into the shallows the water was wonderful rosamund thought it caressed her skin and she was amazed at how buoyant it made her he stayed near her wherever she swam so she would not be frightened eventually they began to play as rosamunds confidence grew and finally unable to help himself the earl of glenkirk drew the deliciously wet lady of friarsgate into his arms and kissed her passionately i adore you he told her where you are i must be you have breathed life into me again after so many years of sorrow he brushed her face tenderly with his fingertips i shall always love you rosamund always then he picked her up in his arms and returned to the beach with her laying her gently on the sand his big body covering hers as he entered her he moved on her slowly at first and then with increasing urgency as his need sought to be satisfied he felt her fingernails raking sharply down his long back her teeth sunk into the fleshy part of his shoulder yes yes yes she sobbed in his ear clinging to him her breasts were aching as their embrace flattened them her nipples tingled closing her eyes she concentrated on his manhood filling her hungering for her wanting her she allowed the walls of her love sheath to enclose him squeezing him until he groaned with delight he probed her fiercely until she was weeping with her pleasure and then together that pleasure burst to wrap and enfold them in a sweetness that for a brief moment seemed neverending oh patrick was all she could whisper when it all faded away they lay together for a time the sun warming their nakedness then he drew her up and they entered the sea together to cleanse themselves of their heated passions when they came again from the water they sat upon the cloth he had spread upon the sand and opened the picnic basket their appetites were great and in no time at all the basket had been emptied of the chicken the thinly sliced ham the bread and the cheese then they sat together in the afternoon sunlight feeding each other from the great bunch of grapes and drinking the sweet wine of san lorenzo tell me what happened with the artist rosamund said quietly it is as king james suspected venice will not weaken the alliance i suggested they be neutral but the doge wants no difficulties with the pope however i believe i have given the venetians more insight into henry tudor than they had i have warned them that he is a ruthless determined man i think they did not realize that of him for he is so young a king and not yet well known i also reminded them of the ottoman menace that touches them first should the sultan decide to move farther west while venice will give lip service to the pope i think they will be slow to commit their troops but commit them they will we are still no better off than we were you still have the baroness to speak with my love rosamund said it is even more unlikely the emperor will cooperate with scotland without the popes blessing he cannot rule at all his alleged empire is but a group of german states each governed by its own prince or count or baron and very loosely held together by maximilian the first i must try but i hold out even less hope what do you think of the maestro she asked him a twinkle in her eye he is far more intelligent than he would have the world at large know he is more valuable to his family by appearing to be nothing more than an artist i have commissioned him to paint your portrait the earl of glenkirk told her with or without my clothes she inquired sweetly with i think the without i prefer to retain within my minds eye sweetheart patrick replied with a grin the artist comes tomorrow i shall be curious to see what he does with this opportunity i have given him i will expect annie with me while i pose for him she said i will expect annie with you he said and annie and dermid must wed before any unfortunate incident is brought to light by the enthusiasm loredanos sketch exhibited to us i warned dermid that he was unable to help himself and seduced her i have not a doubt and i did warn annie rosamund said aye they must be wed quickly she lay back on the cloth again kiss me again patrick for i am yet starved for your love with pleasure madame he responded and then he complied most willingly chapter the scottish ambassadors villa rang with laughter as the entertainer with the dogs set his animals to dancing the early evening was fair and warm the great terrace where the rectangular oak dining table had been set out was lit by delicate lanterns strung over the area and great footed candelabras set about the red tiled floor the guests had eaten well and now were being diverted by a traveling troupe of players who sang danced and provided other amusements for the ambassadors guests no one paid a great deal of attention when the earl of glenkirk left the table to be followed shortly thereafter by baroness von kreutzenkampe the lady moved discreetly through the terrace doors back into the villa this way madame she heard the earls voice directing her and following the sound she moved across the salon and out into the hall where he awaited her come with me my dear baroness patrick said and taking her hand he led her into the ambassadors private library where he seated her you are a careful man my lord she murmured that was very well done but that the artist was watching us he represents the doge as you represent the emperor patrick replied gott im himmel that popinjay the earl laughed he does give that impression publicly but believe me madame he is a clever fellow the buffoon is a pose then she asked and when he nodded she smiled i would not have thought the old doge so clever yet it is said his mind wanders i thank you for telling me but then you meant to put me on my guard with the venetian my lord what is it that you want of the emperor i come from king james of scotland baroness my master is concerned that this alliance your emperor has formed with the english king may not be to his advantage irina von kreutzenkampe laughed her throaty laugh your master has been pope julius favorite for many years my lord now the pope treats with the english king is king james jealous i know little of him but that he is said to be noble and devout he is extremely honorable baroness and it is this very honor that prevents him from joining your holy league france has ever been scotlands ally king james has no just cause to betray king louis and he will not king henry knows this and he uses his knowledge to incite the pope to another way while driving a wedge between scotland and the holy father henry tudor is an ambitious and dangerous man i think your emperor has little idea of how treacherous an ally he is dealing with baroness what is it you want of the emperor my lord she asked him emperor maximilian is also an honorable gentleman he has committed himself to the popes cause you know he has little choice as he reigns at the popes pleasure i know your master will no more break his word than will mine the earl replied but scotland would warn maximilian that he is dealing with a ruthless man in henry of england my master asks nothing more of yours than that he understand that england does nothing that is not to its full benefit do you really believe that king henry will commit his troops to war here on the continent perhaps and perhaps not what he does he does so that when he decides to go to war with scotland he has the full support of the pope spain venice and your emperor yet what benefit would englands war with scotland have for you and scotland is both prosperous and peaceful they desire to war with no one is not your queen henry tudors sister the baroness inquired she is but it matters not to englands king perhaps you have heard the story of how queen margarets grandmother left her jewelry to be equally divided between her two granddaughters and her grandsons queen yet king henry has refused to part with the share meant for queen margaret our queen finally and most regretfully told her younger brother he might keep it all for king james would give her the cost of her grandmothers jewels twice over it was a gallant thing to say for it was not the worth of the gems that meant anything to queen margaret their value for her was sentimental for the queen loved the grandmother for whom she was named most dearly this is the kind of man henry tudor of england is this is most interesting information my lord and i appreciate your candor in revealing it to me still your master must know that emperor maximilian will not break this alliance he has made with the pope and the popes allies but her look was very thoughtful as she spoke the earl of glenkirk had indeed brought her valuable information she regretted she must disappoint him she smiled sympathetically i am sorry king james would never ask another honorable gentleman to break his trust baroness the earl replied smiling back at her he but hopes the insight he has to offer will cause the emperor to move cautiously when dealing with henry tudor i will see that the emperor knows everything that you have told me my lord the baroness responded then she rose from her seat i think it is best that we now return as discreetly as we may to the terrace lest gossip ensue regarding our relationship i would not want to distress your mistress she is very beautiful but she is not scottish nay she is english he answered the baroness amused she was really quite transparent in her desire for more information rosamund is the queens dear friend ah so you met her at king james court of course aye the earl replied and he took irina von kreutzenkampe by the arm and led her from the library and back to where the other guests were assembled does lord howard know her she tells me they have never met he answered as they walked onto the terrace and you believe her the baroness was curious now about this scots earl with the english mistress who was the queens friend yet did not know the english ambassador if the lady was the queens friend they must have known each other from the english court why would i disbelieve her patrick asked my lord i cannot believe you are that naive irina von kreutzenkampe exclaimed it was then he understood her and patrick laughed rosamund was briefly with the english court as a child it was there she became friends with margaret tudor but she lives in cumbria in the borderland between england and scotland she has no connection at all with king henrys court and no husband obviously irina murmured still probing she is a widow he replied with a small grin with three daughters and a rather large estate full of sheep is that what you need to know madame the baroness had the good grace to flush and the blood rushing to her face made more obvious the pockmarks she bore i beg your pardon my lord my duty is to gain as much information for the emperor as i can i have overstepped the bounds of good manners however and i do apologize it would be impossible for me not to forgive you my dear irina he smiled his eyes skimming over her ample bosom then he took her hand up and kissed it you are very gallant in your manner my lord she told him wondering as she withdrew her hand whether she might seduce him he was not a young man yet he had a young mistress who bore the look of a woman well satisfied her blue eyes studied him i am flattered he said but i am very much in love with the lady again the baroness blushed do you divine minds then my lord it was said angrily for she was angry at herself for being so transparent patrick laughed softly and said do not be angry my dear irina as i have previously said i am flattered then with a courtly bow he left her slipping into his seat next to rosamund he leaned over and kissed her shoulder she is offended rosamund said quietly what did you do i refused her he replied just as softly was that wise rosamund wondered what would you have me seduce her he was surprised nay but you might have given her reason to hope and kept her friendship my lord she told him she asks too many questions the earl replied about me i assume of course she does she is friends with lord howard i have learned or so he believes aye he would believe it but trust me when i tell you rosamund that irina does nothing without considering how it would effect the emperor and her own position it is not in her best interests or those of emperor maximilian to seduce the english ambassador patrick said and he chuckled she would make a right armful however my darling and he laughed aloud when rosamund shot him a furious look well twas you who suggested i seduce her he defended himself i most certainly did not rosamund responded indignantly he grinned macduff says his piper will play for us this evening sweetheart the maestro says my portrait is coming along nicely but he will not let me see it until it is finished she told him changing the subject what are you wearing he asked her lavender draperies she purred sweetly i decided that as long as he has seen me as god fashioned me and since annie is with me i would pose for him as he wanted as the goddess of love he was uncertain whether he was angry or amused are your breasts bare he queried her only the left one she replied innocently not the right his eyes were now dancing with amusement nay only the left she told him i am a modest goddess my lord i am relieved to know it but what am i to do with a portrait of a barebreasted goddess lovey i can hardly hang it at glenkirk then why did you commission a portrait of me my lord she wondered and she reached for her goblet to sip at her wine i wanted you to have it to remind you of our days here in san lorenzo he said softly and he kissed her shoulder again the maestro paints this portrait for himself rosamund said he will never let you have it i have arranged however for him to paint your portrait so i may have a tangible memory of you when we are no longer together i desire no reflection of my image patrick and you could hardly hang a painting of me at glenkirk especially one with a bared breast she chuckled from what you have told me of your daughterinlaw the lady anne she would most definitely not approve he laughed nay poor anne would be quite shocked he agreed so now my lord what are we to do you have spoken with the baroness and she has i expect told you that her emperor will not cooperate with king james rosamund said low aye but if we are to complete the impression of two lovers who have run away for a time from their responsibilities then we must remain here in san lorenzo for another month or so the earl said besides the maestro will need more time to complete his goddess of love he teased her will you mind remaining away from your beloved friarsgate longer i know how much you love your home where you are is my home patrick she told him tears in her eyes we will return eventually and i must go with you to court for i promised the queen i should come back i cannot disappoint her she has been a good friend we will spend the summer at friarsgate and my daughters will come to know you and you will meet my family patrick they will like you and you will come to glenkirk with me in the autumn he said rosamund shook her head i think not my darling for i do not believe that your son would be pleased to know that you have found love i would present a threat in his eyes and i shall not be the cause of a rift between you and adam you cannot know that he said but i do she answered him if i were in your sons position i should feel threatened that my father brought home a beautiful young mistress and mayhap not just a bit jealous given the wife i have chosen not this year patrick but in time when adam has learned to accept i am no threat to him or to glenkirk then i will come i promise for now we will enjoy the san lorenzo sun and the warm days and nights we shall swim together in the sea and we shall have our portraits painted and spend our nights making love my darling he said his glance heated she smiled aye i shall live for the nights patrick she told him have you spoken to your annie he asked her she shook her head i have done something far more clever i do not wish to broach that delicate subject with her i thought it best that they come to us regarding the matter before i came down tonight i left the drawing the maestro made upon the table in our dayroom where annie will be certain to see it i expect she and dermid are even now setting the date we have hardly set an exemplary example for our servants to follow my lord we are their betters he said our privileges are greater under such circumstances because we are their betters it is even more important we set them a pattern for good behavior rosamund responded yet you will not marry me he replied quietly nay i will not for i am not of a mind to marry again but i will also not bring your bastard into this world my lord dermid cannot guarantee annie that can he i should not be surprised if his seed has already taken root in the foolish girls hidden garden but when annie sees that drawing she will know we know of their misdeeds they will certainly come to us for permission to wed and we will give it moreover we will witness the deed patrick you are certainly wickedly clever my love he told her admiringly i have been managing my servants since i was barely out of leading strings she answered him it is better in a case like this not to plunge headon into accusations and recriminations patrick it leads to resentment and bitterness though some will not admit to it those who serve have feelings also i wish annie and her dermid to continue to serve us happily not angrily he nodded i think you are wise as well as clever rosamund he said and the following day he was hard put not to chuckle aloud when dermid serious of demeanor came to solemnly request his masters permission to ask lady rosamund for annies hand in marriage you wish to take a wife he asked aye tis a good thing for a man to have a wife dermid there is no lass at glenkirk who takes your fancy you would have this english girl you may have to remain in england then you understand have you discussed this with the lass annie says shell go wherever i go my lord dermid answered if we stays at this friarsgate she says her lady will give me a place in her service and we will have a cottage of our own my younger brother colm would gladly serve you in my place my lord but if you desire it we will come to glenkirk i know you would see annie had a place in your household the earl nodded i would happily give her a place though she will find my sons wife a harder mistress to serve dermid that is not a decision you need make now however but answer me this dermid what if war should break out between scotland and england again what will you do then wars are fought tis true my lord by men like me but they is begun by men like you i do not think our good king jamie will begin a war but annie and me must take our chances if war comes she says friarsgate is as isolated as is glenkirk if there is war perhaps both places will escape the chaos it is the best we can hope for my lord aye patrick agreed go along then dermid for you have my permission to speak with lady rosamund thank you my lord dermid said and he hurried off well the earl considered dermid and annie had obviously been thinking marriage all along their passions had just gotten the better of them he understood and he knew that rosamund did too which was why she had not approached their servants angrily why he thought why had he not met her sooner why had fate waited until this moment in his life to bring him love such as few men ever know why was it that they both knew deep in their hearts that while their love for each other would never die they would be parted sooner than later he sighed deeply his soul was too celtic for him to rail at the fates he realized that he was fortunate to have been given the gift of rosamund bolton at all that such a young and lovely woman could so eagerly give him not just her body but her heart as well was a miracle he wondered what life had in store for her once they were parted then he shook his head impatiently he should not question he should just accept and be grateful for whatever time they had left he looked out into the ambassadors gardens where dermid was even now engaged in earnest conversation with rosamund he wondered what was being said but he could imagine dermid had found annies lady by the fishpond contemplating the golden fish darting back and forth among the lily pads and water hyacinths he knew that she was aware of his presence and so he waited patiently finally rosamund looked up from the marble bench where she was seated yes dermid what is it he bowed very politely i have come my lady with my masters permission to request your consent to wed with your annie he said in a breathless rush then he flushed beet red and his eyes dropped to his leathershod feet and annie is in agreement rosamund responded seriously she would give me no answer until you gave your permission my lady but i believe she will say yes he said annie has always been a good girl dermid and an obedient servant rosamund noted dryly although i think she has not been so careful of my admonitions of late i will count upon you to see that she is in the future if you decide to remain at friarsgate there is a place for you if you decide to take annie to glenkirk you will go with my blessings you have my permission to ask her to wed if she says yes then the marriage shall be celebrated as quickly as possible the earl and i will stand witness to your vows i shall dower annie as i would any of my personal servants she will come with three changes of clothing a warm winter cloak a pair of leather shoes an iron pot and an iron pan two wooden bowls with pewter spoons two pewter mugs bedding and five silver pennies if you decid to remain at friarsgate i will eventually see you have a cottage but for now you will be given a small room in my house his mouth had dropped open with surprise as annies dower portion was enumerated i had no idea annie was so well propertied a lass he said honestly i do not stint those who serve me faithfully and well rosamund replied now go and find annie i am sure she is anxious you will both return to me when all is settled and we will consider the date together with his lordship yes my lady dermid bowed and almost ran from the garden rosamund smiled watching him go if only all of life were that easy she thought if only she sighed if was the most difficult word in the english language then she heard footsteps on the gravel path and looking up smiled at patrick they will be back shortly and we will help them choose a date she said as he sat down on the marble bench next to her let us make it as soon as the church will allow i would have them enjoy san lorenzo without guilt as we are my lord you have a romantic heart sweetheart he told her taking her hand in his he lifted it to his lips and kissed the back then each finger in turn and finally the palm she smiled at him i surely must for i fell in love with you at first sight patrick and i with you he responded ah rosamund sometimes my heart aches at just the sight of you for i love you so quick tears rose in her amber eyes she blinked them back i still sometimes fear to waken from this most marvelous of dreams to find logan hepburn pounding on my door and demanding that i sire a son for him she halflaughed still i hope he is happy with his jeannie i think his family chose well for him you think of him patrick found he was jealous though he knew he had no reason to be not really she answered quietly her tone bade him to leave the issue for to question her loyalty to him would be unforgivable and before either of them might pursue it further annie and dermid returned to stand before them both had rather foolish smiles upon their faces it is settled then the earl said to them aye my lord dermid replied grinning annie has agreed to be my wife the marriage must be celebrated as soon as the church will allow rosamund told them i shall speak with the bishop today oh thank you my lady annie cried and dermid has told me how generous you are being to me i thank you again she caught up her mistress hand and kissed it fervently we dont deserve it either of us after we was so bad but i swear it was only that one time and we couldnt help it the likeness as caught by the maestro was most remarkable rosamund murmured hes a bad man that one annie said indignantly and speaking of the devil he is awaiting you on the terrace my lady he says you should have been ready in your costume for his time is valuable the nerve of the fellow rosamund laughed at this as did the earl i completely forgot he was coming she admitted annie you and dermid may have the rest of the day off to celebrate your betrothal his lordship will keep us company while the artist works today thank you my lady annie said again ill tell the bold fellow you will be with him shortly then she and dermid hurried off chattering as they went i will enjoy watching the venetian work the earl said amused i doubt he will be pleased to see me rosamund laughed again nay he will not he is always attempting to get annie to leave me on one pretext or another he has obviously not given up his intentions to seduce me i am proving a great challenge to him she arose from the bench come along patrick i should not keep him waiting any longer while i change into my costume you must tell him you have decided to view him at his work today the earl chuckled the fool would never appreciate you rosamund as i do he just wants to crawl between your luscious thighs i know she responded i have to admit i enjoy teasing him about it but today my lord with your presence in mind i shall be a model of decorum they returned to the villa and rosamund hurried to their apartment to change she found that annie had laid out her costume she looked at it critically for the first time she had not considered that patrick might actually see her in the garment it was the artist had told her called a chiton it was of sheer lavendercolored silk and fastened on one shoulder by means of a heartshaped golden broach leaving her left breast exposed to view the garment fell in graceful folds the waist girded by a delicate twisted golden rope still every line of her body was visible rosamund now realized she might as well be posing naked for the maestro which was she suddenly understood just what he had wanted in the first place the entire circumstance had amused her so that until now she hadnt been aware of what a fox paolo loredano truly was but to admit her naivety at this point would be a defeat and she did not intend to suffer defeat at the hands of this wretched artist rosamund stepped out onto the terrace where the earl of glenkirk was even now seated engaging paolo loredano in conversation my dear maestro i do apologize for keeping you waiting she cooed and she saw patricks dark eyebrow quirk with his amusement she realized that her lover knew her well enough to understand that she had become fully aware of the situation there was still an innocence about rosamund that delighted him my darling his voice boomed how charming you look i congratulate you maestro in your choice of costume but should her hair not be loose about her shoulders sм sм paolo loredano exclaimed you have the artists eye my lord i have not yet concentrated upon her hair as i have been busy sketching in the delightful rest of her when we are finished today i shall show you but i shall not allow you madonna to see the painting until it is complete of course maestro rosamund replied she had heard all this before she took her place on a small platform that had been erected on the terrace and placed her right hand upon a faux column turning slightly is my position correct maestro she asked him sweetly i am never certain that i remember you are perfecto madonna he assured her and he began to work for some minutes he painted in silence while the earl and rosamund exchanged passionate glances paola loredano was more than aware of it and he found himself jealous though he had no right to be he wanted this exquisite englishwoman more than he had wanted any woman in a long time he was also painting the voluptuous baroness von kreutzenkampe now and he was bedding her as well she was proving a lusty tumble but he still wanted rosamund bolton he had discovered at an early age that he was a man of vast appetites after some time had passed rosamund protested the sunlight is beginning to burn my skin maestro without another word she stepped from the platform come tomorrow she said but you must come earlier my flesh is delicate then she left him returning to the apartment from which she had come she is magnifico the artist said forgetting the earl was in his company if you touch her with disrespect patrick said i shall be forced to kill you venetian you do understand that do you not you have much passion in your soul for a northman for a man of your years my lord the artist said i also have a skilled sword arm especially for a man of my years the earl answered him your talent is great paolo loredano do not waste it or your life over a woman any woman but most especially my woman you come from honorable folk if you give me your word i shall accept it the artist shook his head regretfully i cannot he said with a sigh alas my lord my cock more often than not overrules my head patrick chuckled i was the same in my youth he admitted but i love this woman as i have never loved another insult her and you insult me i understand my lord and i promise to try to behave but i cannot guarantee it besides the ladies have a tendency indeed a weakness where i am concerned it is often not my fault they seduce me the artist said with an infectious grin but rosamund will not seduce you the earl replied that much i can guarantee you and if you make an attempt on her honor she will probably retaliate in a manner not to your liking the earl rose from his seat now let me see what you have done so far he said walking over to where the easel was set up he looked his eyes widening you are amazing maestro he complimented the artist your skin tones are incredible i can almost feel the softness of her beneath my fingertips what is it that you possess my lord that has drawn this woman to you the artist asked the earl frankly he understood that but for rosamund he and patrick leslie might be friends i am as surprised by my good fortune as you are maestro the earl answered honestly all i can tell you is that our eyes met and we both knew knew what paolo loredano was puzzled knew that we were meant to be together came the intriguing reply yet you do not marry the venetian remarked that is not meant to be our love yes but naught else we have both understood that from the beginning the earl explained the artist nodded slowly finally understanding tragico he said to be loved by a woman like that knowing you must one day be parted how do you both bear it my lord i know that i could not we are grateful for the time we are given maestro surely you understand that nothing in our lives is permanent everything is in a continuous flux around us patrick said quietly but to have no hope the artist cried dramatically the earl of glenkirk laughed but we do have hope maestro we hope that each day of bliss we share together will lead to another all things eventually come to an end most people refuse to accept that truth rosamund and i do we may be together for years we may not when the time comes that we must be separated we will part reluctantly sadly but we will be happy for what we have had together and for the memories we will both always carry with us no matter where our paths in life take us the artist sighed gustily you are a braver and nobler man than i my lord i could not accept the knowledge so sanguinely as you have but that said be warned i shall continue my attempts to seduce the bella rosamund women do not resist loredano for long and he grinned his engaging grin at the scotsman you will undoubtedly come to a bad end maestro killed by an outraged father or husband the earl chuckled i bid you good day then and he ushered the artist from the terrace through the dayroom down the stairs and out into the courtyard when will you begin my portrait he asked tomorrow the artist answered him i shall paint the beautiful lady early and you afterwards then paolo loredano mounted the horse being held for him by a groom and rode off the earl turned to go back into the villa only to be met by rosamund on her way out where are you going he asked her for a moment suspicious and jealous we are going to see the bishop she replied i want annie and dermid wed quickly she turned to the groom fetch our horses giovanni she told the man he felt foolish but he kept his feelings to himself aye it is best we go together he agreed she was so beautiful today she wore a wonderful pale green silk gown embroidered with darker green and gold threads her beautiful hair was covered by a dainty lace veil that had been dyed to match her gown had there ever been a lovelier woman than rosamund bolton the animals were brought and they mounted them riding through the embassy gates and down the hill to the main square of arcobaleno then to the cathedral the bells in the old church began to toll the noon hour and after tethering their horses they entered the stone edifice where the bishop would be celebrating the noon mass known as sext they joined the other congregants kneeling on the velvet cushions provided for the gentry as they prayed a choir of boys sang sweetly their young voices piercing the quiet atmosphere of the cathedral heights the air was fragrant with frankincense and myrrh as the priest assisting the bishop wafted the censer about tall pure white beeswax candles in ornate gold candlesticks decorated the altars the delicate flames flickering in the afternoon light that streamed in through the stainedglass windows making multicolored patterns on the gray stone floors looking up at the windows about the cathedral rosamund remembered the first time she had seen stained glass and her silent vow to one day have such glass at friarsgate when the mass was over they approached the bishop requesting a moment of his time the elderly man was the same cleric who had performed janets betrothal ceremony to the dukes son years ago he was quite frail now and he looked at patrick and said i should admonish you and the lady for your behavior my lord but i shall not what is it i may do for you we would like you to waive the banns of marriage for our two servants my lord bishop it is best they marry soon the earl said is there a child involved the bishop asked not that we are aware of yet my lord bishop but it is best they are married quickly the air of san lorenzo seems to be conducive to romance patrick responded the bishop chuckled i will waive the banns for them bring them to me tomorrow before sext and i will marry them myself would that i might do the same for you and your lady my lord would that you could the earl replied the bishop turned and peered at rosamund have you run away from your husband my child he inquired of her i am widowed my lord bishop she answered him quietly then there are other reasons that cannot be overcome the old man said nodding kneel before me my children they knelt and the elderly bishop blessed them making the sign of the cross over them rosamund began to weep softly and patrick felt tears pricking his own eyes the bishop smiled softly as he stood over them then bid them rise thanking him they left the cathedral riding silently up the hill back to the ambassadors villa i will tell annie rosamund said as they mounted the stairs back to their apartment there are preparations to be made annie should have a fine gown for her wedding day pietro she called and the majordomo was there madame he said send for celestina annie is to wed dermid tomorrow the bishop is performing the ceremony in the cathedral we need a gown for the bride rosamund told him and she smiled at once madame pietro replied and he hurried off to find a servant to send to his daughters shop annie annie where are you rosamund called entering their apartments here my lady the girl said coming into the dayroom tomorrow is your wedding day annie of friarsgate the bishop has waived the banns and will marry you to dermid himself in the cathedral annie was wideeyed in the cathedral rosamund replied smiling ive sent for celestina for you must have a pretty dress oh my lady annie burst into fulsome tears you are too good to me and i was so naughty she lifted her apron to wipe at her eyes i hardly have set you an example to follow annie but follow it you did and you should not have still i know you and dermid love each other or you should not have strayed from the path of virtue dry your eyes lass we have a few things to do before this is finished oh my lady annies eyes were suddenly round with worry what if dermid and i stop loving each other once we wed that is not likely to happen rosamund reassured her servant women must wed annie if they do not enter the church dermid is a good man he was warned by his master to treat you with respect but his heart became involved i fear and you are a very pretty girl he will not stop loving you lass and you must be a good wife to him but you will be i know you know all about love my lady dont you annie said aye rosamund replied with a smile i do know all about love celestina arrived in a flurry of excitement her daughter maria behind her weighed down by several gowns a wedding she exclaimed smiling maria put the gowns on the chair she glared at rosamund i could wish it were for you signora and not your serving girl she is with bambino gods foot i hope not rosamund exclaimed making an attempt to save annies reputation tis a miracle then celestina said dryly arcobaleno is a small place little can be kept secret the lusty wench has been seen with her lover strolling in the square at night they kiss and they kiss we both know what much kissing can lead to eh signora and she laughed her hearty laugh her several chins waggling up and down as she did then she became serious come girl let us see what you will have oh my lady you choose annie said suddenly overwhelmed by it all let us see what celestina has brought you rosamund replied she looked at the three gowns spread upon the table and chairs in the dayroom the pink is too deep and bold a color she said what is it the spanish say it takes a brave woman to wear yellow i think we are not that brave and besides this lovely blue suits your coloring best annie do you like it i aint never had anything this fine my lady annie said softly she stared at the gown of pale blue brocade the garment had soft linen pleating about its low square neckline a tightly fitted bodice low tight sleeves with an embroidered cuff and a matching embroidered hanging girdle lets try it on then rosamund said celestina and maria helped the young servingwoman from her garments and into the blue gown to their surprise the fit was a perfect one annie fingered the silky skirt a dreamy smile upon her face it needs nothing celestina remarked sounding not just a little pleased her hair should be unbound despite her naughty behavior for proprietys sake if nothing else but a wreath of flowers in her hair would not be wrong signora she nodded she is a pretty bride eh and with the long sleeves she can wear the gown back home in your icy england do you like it annie will it suit rosamund gently pressed her servant like it oh my lady in all my born days i did not think to have such a wonderful gown i only hope i do not wake from this dream she was smiling get out of the gown girl celestina said impatiently you will ruin it before your wedding i can see you are preparing to weep tearstains are difficult to remove she and maria hurried to remove the garment from annies slender frame you may send the bill to the earl rosamund said tis his man annie is marrying tomorrow celestina chortled aye he should pay for it since his servant could not behave himself and i hope hell see the bride and groom have a bit of wine drunk to their long life and many bambini signora rosamund nodded grazia signora celestina she said we are in your debt again for your kindness hang the gown in a cupboard girl celestina instructed annie you dont want to have wrinkles come the morrow she nodded at rosamund ciao signora your command of the italian tongue grows quite good san lorenzo seems to agree with you eh then signaling to maria who had packed up the other two gowns she departed with a wave of her plump hand you did not ask the price of the gown my lady annie said softly it is a simple garment annie and celestina will be fair rosamund responded to haggle the cost would have been insulting besides i know his lordship would want you to look your best for dermid now do not tell him about your gown for it would be bad fortune and you will sleep with me tonight annie abstinence and anticipation will make for a far more exciting wedding night rosamund told her servant annie nodded yes my lady she replied meekly go and find pietro for me now rosamund instructed the girl who hurried off to do her mistress bidding the old majordomo came and bowing asked how may i serve you my lady neither of the servants chambers can contain a bed suitable for a husband and his wife pietro is there perhaps a small room that annie and dermid might have for themselves she smiled i indulge them i know but they are so in love by chance pietro responded his eyes twinkling there is a single bedchamber next to your apartment my lady it is unoccupied the ambassador rarely has a houseful of guests and we are expecting no one that i am aware of at the moment the bed is quite commodious and suitable to a newly wed couple but your servants will also be easily available to you will that suit it will more than suit pietro and i am grateful for your courtesy towards annie and dermid rosamund answered him i shall have the housekeeper air out the chamber and prepare it for the bride and groom after that however they must keep it clean and neat themselves pietro said annie is a good housekeeper rosamund promised the majordomo bowed and departed the apartment what is this patrick demanded as he reentered the dayroom annie says she is to sleep with you tonight i think it best rosamund said we must at least preserve the appearance of propriety my lord and pietro is opening up the bedchamber next to our apartment so annie and dermid may have their privacy when they are not needed and where am i to rest my head this night the earl demanded why in your own chamber my lord rosamund replied with a mischievous smile i have told annie that anticipation but stimulates desire we shall see just how much my lord eh and she laughed softly his green eyes narrowed madame you try my patience with your indulgence of our servants they are a lusty naughty pair who do not deserve your kindness but i who adore you do deserve it am i to be denied my rights because of our servants when rosamund teased him did the time of day ever matter to you patrick leslie you are a far lustier devil than your servingman but perhaps i am beginning to tire you out her amber eyes were bright with anticipation i think madame he said slowly that your behavior is in need of some correction he made a move towards her rosamund edged away from him putting the table between them is it she taunted and are you man enough to deliver me that correction my lord his eyes narrowed again at her challenge i am madame i think that your round little bottom must be spanked until you admit your fault to me he leapt forward turning the table aside as he did so with a little shriek of surprise rosamund fled him now putting a chair between them you are slow my lord and you madame too confident he strode towards her backing her and the chair into a corner of the room and when he had put her there he smiled wickedly and said now what madame you have no route of escape from your punishment now wideeyed she could but watch as he yanked the chair away she attempted to dart beneath his arm and escape but he caught her and sitting down on that same chair he pulled her down over his knees now madame he said in menacing tones as he deliberately and carefully lifted her skirts up to bare her round little bottom you will be spanked his hand came down on her buttocks with a satisfying smack ohhh rosamund cried a second blow descended and she asked him is that the best you can do my lord her ridicule she quickly discovered was a mistake and her flesh was soon tingling and distinctly warm with his punishment say you are sorry for mocking me he growled what will you give me if i do she asked from her rather ignominious position across his broad lap he laughed and a hand slipped beneath her to forage between her nether lips she was very wet and he smiled your punishment rosamund has been every bit as effective for me as it has been for you his hand descended thrice more on her hapless bottom are you sorry yet he inquired softly yes she exclaimed she was hungry to have him within her and amazed that the spanking he had given her had resulted in such whitehot lust he set her on his feet fumbling with his clothing and seeing his lovers lance free at last rosamund sat upon it her back to him he unlaced her bodice then pushed aside the swath of her auburn hair from her neck his hands cupped her breasts and he pinched the nipples even as he fondled the twin globes of her bosom his lips brushed her nape and then his teeth sank into her graceful neck and he groaned as she rode him with an expertise that always astounded him witch he whispered in her ear his tongue licking at the curl of perfumed flesh devil she hissed back her body arching as she strove to force him deeper into the heat of her eager body she ground her buttocks still hot with her punishment into his body he filled her full and her head began to spin while she once again wondered why it was this man who could love her so completely and none before him she felt no disloyalty to owein they had loved each other and been loyal to each other but no man until patrick had ever given her the supreme pleasure she was now experiencing oh sweet mother mary she gasped oh patrick dont stop please dont stop she shuddered with the pleasure coursing like boiling honey through her veins ahhh ahhh she shuddered again feeling his passionate tribute flooding her body ahhh patrick and she collapsed against him rosamund rosamund he groaned in her ear his breath hot and moist there has never been a woman like you ill vow if i died in the next minute i should be content my darling he pressed a kiss against her nape his warm lips lingering as he breathed in the familiar scent of her i love you i shall always love you rosamund sighed but she was not yet ready to open her eyes she relaxed against his broad chest his manhood still within her i shall never love another as i love you patrick she told him his hand tenderly fondled her breast for a few moments and then he said we cannot be found like this my darling can you arise from me now rosamund stood on shaky legs and breathed in several deep breaths she drew her skirts down brushing away the wrinkles you must rearrange yourself my lord if we are not to shock our two lusty servants she smiled when she said it noting that his manhood had not lessened greatly in size you are very randy today and did you enjoy being spanked sweetheart the green eyes twinkled i did she admitted it seemed to add a fillip of excitement to our passion then she blushed with the admission he chuckled i could not resist he said softly your taunts were most exciting my darling i should not like you to spank me often she told him your hand is hard i fear my poor bottom is still tingling lovers sometimes play games rosamund but it is not necessary to play them all the time he explained mayhap one day you will spank me again she said with a sly smile one day when the occasion calls for it he agreed i promise to be very good for now my lord she said sweetly i am glad for it he replied grinning although i will admit you have the most fetchingly rounded little bottom my darling it compares well with other bottoms you have spanked she asked innocently rosamund and then he laughed extremely well he admitted i wish we never had to go home she suddenly burst out patrick took her into his arms but we do not for a while but eventually my darling i know you want to be at friarsgate again and i promise i will take you there myself and remain with you for as long as i can now be happy my love for we are together now and no matter what happens we shall always love each other rosamund always chapter annie and dermid were married on a warm and sunny march day it was a tale they both agreed that they would one day tell their children of how they were wed by a bishop in a great stone cathedral with stainedglass windows before the ladys altar it was an auspicious occasion for such a humble pair and afterwards the earl of glenkirk and rosamund escorted them to a small inn where they shared wine with the newly wed couple and when the toast had been made and the sweet vintage drunk the earl told them that he had asked the innkeeper for his finest room dermid and annie would remain the night the innkeeper was paid for the room and for a good supper to be served in a private salon then patrick and rosamund left their two servants to enjoy their first day of married life togetheralone when they returned to the villa lord macduff was waiting for them i have a message from his majesty just arrived within the hour he said you are instructed to leave san lorenzo on the first of april but you are to travel overland again to paris where you will have an audience with king louis and reassure him in the strongest terms that scotland will not break the auld alliance he handed patrick a sealed packet for you he told the earl thank you patrick said opening the message so your servants are successfully wed macduff said to rosamund by the bishop himself she replied with a smile and not a moment too soon i suspect they are both very young and filled with the juices of their youth you are a very kind mistress macduff said many a woman would have beaten her servant for such behavior and sent her away annie and dermid are both good servants my lord rosamund responded they simply needed to be guided into the proper path will you go back to court the ambassador asked her candidly i promised the queen i would rosamund said i do not break my word once given my lord while i miss friarsgate and my daughters i owe margaret tudor that small allegiance she was a good friend to me when i was at her fathers court as a young girl she was responsible for my happy marriage she is so desperate to give her husband a healthy son and while i expect the child will be born by the time we return i would congratulate her and encourage her in her motherhood the kings lang eey saw that she would indeed have a healthy son but until that wee laddie rests safely in his mothers arms and she is certain of his health she will fret queens have few friends my lord but i am queen margarets true friend ian macduff nodded aye he agreed friendship is a rare commodity for those who rule lassie i admire your ethics as well as your good sense they are not qualities a man usually admires in a woman he grinned at her i also admire your beauty however and knowing you these past few weeks i think i am now envious of my old friend patrick leslie my lord are you flirting with me rosamund gently teased him it has been a long time lassie but i believe i am he admitted well cease you old dog the earl said slipping an arm about rosamunds waist the lady is mine and i will cede her to no one what does the king say to you or should you not share it ian macduff asked tis little more than what you have told me patrick replied he wants me to tell king louis of my attempts here in san lorenzo is the messenger still here i would send a communiquй with him he is one of our people aye hes a scot he purports to be a factotum for an edinburgh guild of merchants but of course he is not tis just a pose he affects to divert attention from his travels hes come here before ian macduff said hell remain the night as he usually does then well send him back mounted on a fresh horse the earl nodded send him to my apartment and i will give him his instructions patrick wrote to james stewart in detail of what had transpired between him venice and the holy roman empire he had previously sent pigeons with the simple words venice nay max nay now he filled in the details of his conversations with paolo loredano the doges representative and baroness von kreutzenkampe who was emperor maximilians emissary the earls memory was a flawless one and always had been he recalled his conversations with both the artist and the baroness the king would see it all as if he had been there himself the earl apologized for his inability to change what was happening but at least he wrote the king he had put a strong suspicion of henry tudor in both venice and the holy roman empires consciousness they would now be suspicious of england and act accordingly you are to go directly to the king wherever he may be when you arrive in scotland patrick instructed the messenger and you are to deliver this message only into his hands no secretary or page the kings hands do you understand yes my lord the messenger said and you will tell his majesty that we will follow his instructions regarding our return we should reach him by early june yes my lord patrick handed the messenger a second packet along with a small bag of jingling coins and when you have seen the king i would have you ride to glenkirk for me and give my son adam leslie this tell him i am well yes my lord thank you glenkirk is in the northeast is it not it is you will find it patrick told the man and i thank you for your service what did you write to adam rosamund asked her lover when the messenger had departed that glenkirk was to remain in his care for a while longer for i choose to visit a friend in england before i return home the earl said san lorenzo has been like a marvelous dream and now to know i am to see paris rosamund replied then she laughed i have never before enjoyed travel or being away from friarsgate but when i am with you my darling i do not care he smiled down at her and bent his lips to brush hers the artist will be waiting for me sweetheart he said your portrait is almost finished but mine is not and i would have it done before we leave so i may make arrangements to ship the paintings back to scotland the maestro will not give you my painting rosamund said he paints it for himself i have told you before that he does we will see the earl said with a smile and then he left her he told the artist what rosamund had said and paolo loredano smiled she is correct and she is not he told the earl of glenkirk wait my lord and you will see you will not be disappointed and you will pay me well i guarantee it then he laughed you are an excellent subject my lord where will this painting hang when it is yours he peered around the large canvas over a fireplace in the great hall of glenkirk castle opposite a painting done of my daughter rosamund has commissioned this portrait but she has given it to me sм she told me that was what she wanted i have done for her however a miniature of your head my lord she requested it he had not known that and he was touched a shadow passed over his face how long he wondered how long until the fates would part them again do not look so serious my lord the artist said you have lost your happy expression think of the bella rosamund and be glad patrick laughed his bleak mood dispelled ah that is better paolo loredano cried san lorenzo was abloom with spring now flowering vines climbed house walls and the fields along the road were ablaze with color the air was growing warmer each day the sea was as warm as their bathwater they rode out passing vineyards now green with new growth they swam and made love whenever and wherever the mood took them march was coming to a close and their april departure loomed annie and dermid in a euphoria of newly wedded bliss had to be prodded to complete their daily tasks rosamund finally threatened to separate them at night if they did not do their duty they would not travel incognito on their return it was unnecessary there would be horses for them to ride and a traveling coach when they did not choose to ride their route was set and the duke sent a rider ahead of them to book accommodations at the best inns along their route they would travel to paris under the dukes protection and from there to the coast to take passage home to scotland on a vessel that would be awaiting them finally their trunks were packed and they went to the palace for a farewell dinner with duke sebastian and after the meal was over paolo loredano and his servant brought three canvases into the hall and now madonna he said looking directly at rosamund your portrait slowly he drew the covering from the first canvas there was a delighted cry from the audience there rosamund stood garbed as the goddess of love in her lavender draperies her auburn hair blowing in the soft breeze a single breast bared she was surrounded by hills and beyond her lay the blue sea it is beautiful the paintings subject cried you have surely made me more than i am maestro and while i know you have painted this for yourself i regret i cannot have it i remember once telling queen margaret that country folk did not have their portraits painted as did the noble folk i never thought to see myself portrayed in a painting then paolo loredano said with a delighted grin you will be happy with what else i have done and your lover will pay well for it he whipped the covering from the second canvas rosamund gasped with surprise the artist had done two paintings of her in this one however he portrayed her wearing her favorite green velvet gown she stood proudly holding a sword pointed downward a stone edifice and a blazing sunset behind her it was a truly magnificent portrait and rosamund was absolutely stunned it is how i will always think of you madonna the artist told her the mistress of your friarsgate defending your beloved home i have heard your england is green and you have said your land is surrounded by hills it is how i have represented it i hope it pleases you rosamund rose from her place at the dukes table and walked over to paolo loredano to kiss him full upon his lips i have no words to thank you maestro she told him i could have never dreamed such a portrait of me grazia mille grazia then she returned to her seat the venetian put his fingers to his lips you have paid me more than my work is worth madonna he told her gallantly then he moved to the third canvas and disclosed its subject patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk standing tall and handsome as he stared from the painting and lastly san lorenzos first ambassador from scotland i hope it pleases you my lord he bowed in the earls direction it more than pleases me the earl said you have certainly earned yourself an excellent commission maestro and i gladly pay it you will see the paintings are made safe for shipping i will my lord yours shall be sent to glenkirk and i shall have the ladys sent to england he came back now to his place at the dukes table saying to rosamund as he did the miniature has been packed by your servant and is with your possessions madonna when the evening had finally concluded and most of the guests departed the duke said to the artist you have not forgotten you promised me the portrait of the goddess of love paolo have you i have not forgotten signore the venetian replied and you have not forgotten the price agreed upon have you the duke reached into his embroidered satin doublet and drew out a bag of coins which he handed to the artist count it if you will but it is all there he said there is no need signore for i accept your word the painting will remain with you but i should not hang it until i am certain your friend the earl of glenkirk is gone were you able to seduce her the duke wondered i am ashamed to admit i was not the artist said she is an unusual woman then he bowed to the duke good night my lord he said he left the hall and returned to the villa he was renting a great grin suffused his features as he stood looking at the third portrait he had painted of rosamund it was somewhat similar to the one he had sold to the duke but not quite the beautiful goddess of love in this particular painting was entirely nude paolo loredano chuckled to himself the sheer draping he had chosen for her to wear had in the proper lighting provided him with an excellent view of her delicious body he had sketched her first in charcoal and once he returned to his studio he had copied the sketch onto the large canvas completing this painting at his leisure in the evenings some nights he had slept as little as two hours but it had been worth it this goddess stood upon delicate goldedged clouds surrounded by small winged cupids the deep blue sea below her the paler blue sky above and around her her luxuriant auburn hair blew delicately about her lush body her head was topped by a wreath of spring flowers he had perfectly captured her exquisite round breasts and the plump mound of her mons he sighed regretting his inability to possess rosamund bolton her love for patrick leslie had rendered her impervious to paolo loredano and that in itself made his loss all the worse for he had never before failed to woo a woman he fixed his sights upon into his bed fortunately they were far from venice and his reputation would be safe particularly when he returned with this magnificent rendition of love it would be assumed that he had made this beauty his mistress during his winter sojourn in san lorenzo and when it was suggested he would neither confirm nor deny it but this was a painting he would retain in his own possession for some time to come he almost wished he might show her and her alone this secret rendition just to see her delightful outrage but no it was over and rosamund bolton was now gone from his life paolo loredano sighed a final time before snuffing out the lamps in his studio and climbing the stairs to his empty bed he slept well past the dawn and when he finally awoke patrick leslie and his beautiful mistress were many miles from arcobaleno on the road to paris lord howard the english ambassador had not been invited to the previous evenings farewell he arrived at the dukes palace the following morning to discuss his master king henrys dissatisfaction with the current trade agreement between england and san lorenzo ushered into the great hall where the duke was overseeing the hanging of his new portrait of the goddess of love lord howard stared hard at the other two paintings that awaited the artists supervision for their transport he looked at the young woman in the green gown with her sword and her almost defiant look and he suddenly knew where he had seen her before it had been at his masters court several years ago she was a friend of queen katherines now what was a friend of the queens doing with a scottish nobleman he was not certain the answer was of any import but he would mention it in his next dispatch to his master the king he gazed again at the painting she was very lovely he wondered that his master had not been enchanted by her but then it was soon after that disgraceful episode with two of his female cousins who had been in the queens service the king would have been discreet in his wanderings at that point and would have looked farther afield for his amusement the duke turned to greet his visitor now ah howard what do you think of my painting does the lady rosamund not make a wonderful goddess of love he chuckled of course lord leslie believed the artist was keeping this painting for himself i made a little arrangement with loredano for i found the lady quite lovely what a pity she is so in love with her earl i would have enjoyed having her in my own bed and so would have the venetian i have not a doubt he chuckled again that is why there are two paintings lord howard thought he understood was not lord leslie aware that his mistress was being painted with her breast bared he knew but they both found it amusing for her to do so she commissioned the portrait of him as a gift for her lover magnificent isnt it the duke admired both paintings he is a great artist paolo loredano every bit as worthy as titian titian lord howard looked confused another venetian artist the duke said now let us get down to business my lord the day is warm and there is a pretty flower seller in the market square i wish to visit this afternoon she shows much promise and he chortled wickedly winking broadly at the english ambassador i remember patrick leslie in his younger days he would have vied openly with me for such a lovely prize then perhaps it is better he is now gone lord howard replied dryly and as he said it he wondered just where the earl of glenkirk and his mistress had gone to france to venice or rome back to scotland he could not ask the duke without seeming overly interested besides did it really matter patrick leslie was not important he was a man in the twilight of his years having a final fling with a beautiful young woman he had no power or influence he had obviously come to san lorenzo for no other reason than to escape the scots winter and impress his mistress with a minor accomplishment that he had held in his younger days still lord howard considered it would not harm him to err on the side of caution and put this in his next report to king henry everything even the most seemingly minor detail was important to the king the two subjects of lord howards interest now cantered along the coast road towards toulouse they stopped the first night in a town called villerose in another little duchy beaumont de jaspre the weather was fair and warm and as they gradually began to travel in a more northerly direction towards paris the sunny skies remained with them they followed a road along the rhфne river as far as lyon turning west then to ride crosscountry to roanne on the loire the vineyards in the loire valley were green with new growth but several weeks behind those of san lorenzo their road led to nevers and from there to chateauneuf where they picked up the main road to paris there was more traffic as they moved towards the capital they saw more soldiers than they had previously seen it was obvious that france was on a war footing and already fighting with the popes league they finally reached paris in late april rosamund was exhausted and glad for this respite from their travels annie was obviously already with child and equally relieved to stop the duke had arranged for them to break their long journey at a small house he owned just outside the city the concierge had been alerted to their coming the house was freshly cleaned and aired two servants a maid and a stableman had been brought in for their visit the morning after their arrival patrick left to seek out an audience with king louis if indeed the king was in paris he was and after waiting almost the entire day he was finally admitted to king louis xiis august presence he bowed low and said quietly so that only the king might hear i come from james stewart but i must speak with you privately monseigneur the kings eyes flickered curious he was a tall handsome man with a warm smile leave us he said to his attendants and they immediately vacated the chamber sit down my lord he invited the earl and tell me why you have come merci the earl replied and he seated himself opposite the king i was called by my king several months ago to come from my northern home to stirling where he was holding his christmas court i had not been in his presence for eighteen years long ago i was king james first ambassador to the duchy of san lorenzo the king wished me to return there traveling secretly although once i arrived it was no longer a secret he smiled at king louis though my king held out little hope of his plan succeeding he still believed it necessary to try i was to treat with representatives from the emperor maximilian and the doge in an effort to weaken the alliance they had made with pope julius spain and henry of england as you know the english king has been pressing my king to join with them but james stewart will not betray his alliance with france my lord i am here to reassure you he will keep his faith with you i had no doubt he would the french king responded your mission of course failed it did however i was able to plant within the minds of both emissaries a suspicion of king henry patrick said and how did you do that king louis asked smiling i told them the truth of his personality and his ambitions the earl of glenkirk replied with an answering smile you know of course the story of the venerable margarets jewels i do king louis said twas shocking and most meanly done i do not believe i should like this henry tudor if indeed i ever met him i doubt i shall but my soninlaw francois will have to deal with him one day i think perhaps they might get along for they have similar characters francois like henry tudor is a large man with a large appetite and a great lust for all that life has to offer still he is a good husband to my daughter claude then king louis arose from his chair signaling that the interview was over tell james stewart that i thank him for his efforts on frances behalf and i particularly thank him for his honorable stance i know it will not be easy his brotherinlaws reputation already grows the earl of glenkirk bowed politely i shall take your good wishes to my king my lord and i thank you for seeing me then patrick backed from the french kings presence he returned to the little house outside of paris on the seine rosamund was awaiting him i began to fear for you when it grew dark she told him you will not have eaten i expect come dermid brought us a good supper from the nearby inn he looked tired she thought leading him to the table and seating him annie is not feeling particularly well and so i insisted she rest it is often this way with a first bairn she lifted the cover from a tureen and ladled a goodsmelling stew onto his plate these french know how to cook she told him setting the plate before him and tearing a hunk of bread off the loaf for him eat patrick and then tell me what transpired this day she poured a dark red wine into his goblet and then waited while he ate he was obviously hungry she noted as he quickly cleared his plate of food mopping every bit of the gravy up with his bread more she asked and he nodded you did not eat all day did you my lord that is not good for a man of your years patrick swallowed down a portion of his wine i had to wait for king louis to see me he said or at least for one of his pompous secretaries to make an appointment for me i was so persistent they let me in at the last moment he spooned the stew on his plate into his mouth eating vigorously until he finally seemed satisfied his wine cup was refilled twice now the earl of glenkirk sat back and took rosamunds hand up to kiss it thank you for taking such good care of me sweetheart we cannot always be roiling with passion patrick she smiled back at him now tell me what king louis said he said he expected no less of jamie stewart than he had gotten in the past that he knew scotland would adhere to our auld alliance he sends king james his good wishes twas a courtesy the king sought of me and king louis knows it there is little need now for us to remain here but i have never been to paris rosamund said and when shall this country girl have the opportunity to come again my lord can we not spend just a few days here i should very much like to see the cathedral and besides annie really could use a respite before we begin the last of our journey a sea voyage is apt to play havoc with her belly two days he said and we depart on the third will that satisfy you madame it is more than generous my lord she assured him ill send one of the dukes men to calais to see if our ship is awaiting us hell not have time to return to paris but he can meet us on the road the english will be on the lookout for vessels sailing beneath the french or scots flags the following day patrick and rosamund visited the great cathedral of notre dame on the ile de la citй paris itself was a bustling and noisy city and to rosamunds surprise it was quite different from london despite the similarity of having a river running through it the french were colorful and vibrant they saw gypsy performers in the streets the taverns overflowed with revelers no matter the war paris was always vibrant and alive it is exhausting rosamund laughed as they returned home the evening before they were to finally depart i do not think i could live here did you see the fabrics in some of the shops they are marvelous but they do not have a wool as fine as we raise at friarsgate the wools i saw were heavy and coarse they were scots or irish or mayhap even english some of them but they were not of the quality of friarsgate wool i must speak with my agent in carlisle and see what can be done about that the french appreciate quality and i can offer them that i have never before seen this side of you he marveled you are suddenly a woman of commerce i have not the advantage of your birth my lord friarsgate folk have always been simple people but we are industrious i see profit here and to overlook it would be foolish rosamund told him you are growing restless with this life you have been leading arent you he said reaching out to tip her face up to him aye she admitted i am you have been busy patrick on your mission of diplomacy for your king i have been an ornament for your pleasure and mine she amended with a small smile but i am not used to being so idle i will have you home by midsummer he promised her and he smiled back she almost broke his heart with her loveliness he thought to himself they departed paris the following morning just before dawn it was rosamunds twentythird birthday and quite forgotten even by her they met the dukes man along their path a ship was awaiting them it was a scots vessel but it would fly the flag of a flemish merchant prince at calais they boarded their transport in a falling rain but the seas were relatively calm two days out as they made their way up the north sea towards leith the weather cleared giving them a brisk and unusual southeast wind they saw other sails on the sea but no one challenged them even as they neared the border between england and scotland they sailed closer to land now and the captain pointed out the opening to the river tyne were almost home my lord the captain said well be entering the fifth of forth shortly we dock at leith in the early morning it was early may and the mists partially obscured the land as they reached their destination their luggage was offloaded and taken to the inn from where they had departed almost six months before they were settled in a comfortable apartment with several fireplaces all now blazing warmth and taking the chill off the early morning i will have to arrange for transport to edinburgh or wherever the king is now patrick told rosamund inquire if the queen has been safely delivered rosamund said and he nodded aye the innkeeper replied to the question asked by the earl of glenkirk the wee queen did give birth to a fine healthy bairn on the tenth day of april they say the king does wrap the laddie in a blanket and ride through edinburgh town wi him so the people may see this next jamie stewart and the queen is well the earl inquired och aye she is my lord the innkeeper answered with a smile she but needed a bit of seasoning to do it well the king is in edinburgh yet the earl queried aye he be in the town the innkeeper said ill ride in today the earl said ill go with you rosamund responded i must see meg and i did promise to return the sooner i see her the sooner i can confess my deception and then perhaps she will let me go home it has been nearly five months since ive seen my lasses patrick ill send a message to glenkirk he said adam will not be unhappy to remain master there for a while longer i am anxious to see your friarsgate lovey annie and dermid can follow tomorrow she decided we can do without our servants for a night and heaven only knows if there will even be room for us court life is not the most gracious for ordinary folk they rode the few miles between the port of leith and the capital city of edinburgh once at the castle the earl of glenkirk sought out the king to give him his final report rosamund however went immediately to the queens apartments margaret tudor spied her friend immediately and shrieked a greeting rosamund oh come and see my beautiful boy rosamund i am so glad that you are back how are your girls come come rosamund laughed and crossed the room to peer into the ornate cradle by the queens side the monthold boy stared up at her he was plump and alert waving his little fists at her he made small noises and rosamund laughed again oh meg he is a fine laddie the king must be so pleased she curtsied and blushed slightly realizing that she had slipped back into a familiarity she should not but the queen waved her hand dismissing the breach come and sit with me and tell me all about friarsgate the queen said we must speak privily about that rosamund said quietly immediately the queens curiosity was piqued get out all of you i would speak confidentially with the lady of friarsgate you also she said to the cradle rocker my son will survive without being in constant motion and when the queens chamber had been emptied she turned again to her childhood friend and said tell me i have not been at friarsgate meg i have been with the earl of glenkirk in the duchy of san lorenzo then she went on to explain the mission the king had sent patrick on and of how he would not go without her and of how she loved him so desperately that she had lied to margaret tudor and gone will you forgive me she asked the queen as she concluded her tale of course i forgive you the queen said sincerely so you love him but does he love you and if he does why does he not offer marriage he does love me but i choose not to marry again meg at least not now i have a duty to friarsgate and patrick has his duty to glenkirk although his son is able to carry on in his absence with your permission i am now going to go home to friarsgate and patrick will come with me for a time you must bide with me for a brief while the queen pleaded prettily agreed rosamund said laughing once more though you really do not need me you have all your women to keep you company they are not my friends the queen replied you know that queens have few friends rosamund then a sly smile touched her lips and she asked is he a very good lover my jamie certainly is despite the years that separate us but the earl of glenkirk is really old can he still make love or is this the kind of love you bore for your second husband hugh cabot he is a magnificent lover and frequently exhausts me meg rosamund replied candidly i love him you know and my passion for him is not in the least as it was for hugh who was more father to me than any how strange that this love should come to you at this time and in this place the queen noted i love the king you know and he is very good to me although i suspect he believes i am not the cleverest of women he often treats me as he would a favored animal so he sent your earl to try to weaken this alliance the pope has now formed he knew it would not work of course the queens foot was absently rocking her sons cradle as she spoke and the baby was now falling asleep king james is an honorable man he will not betray this old alliance that scotland has with france there is no need for him to do so rosamund said i think we both know that your brother king henry seeks an excuse to make war on scotland he cannot be pleased that you have given your husband a son when poor kate cannot give him one it must frustrate him that scotland holds the balance of power here england cannot invade france with frances ally on his northern border so he seeks to isolate scotland from the rest of europe your husband meg is a man of peace he sees what peace has brought scotland this country is prosperous and content no matter your easily insulted earls and lairds she smiled now scotland has an heir there is even more at stake yet jamie builds a navy the queen noted to protect scotland meg he seeks to defend his sea borders his navy is a bulwark against foreigners rosamund explained it had always been difficult for meg to see the large picture henry is jealous of jamies ships he is now building a navy too kate writes me the queen responded kate is well it had been a long time since anyone had spoken to her of katherine of aragon now englands queen but that she cannot seem to give my brother a living heir meg said henry will be patient just so long and then who knows what he will do the fault lies with kate i fear for my brother has his share of bastards and he has impregnated her several times but her children die i wonder if it is not gods judgment perhaps my father should have sent her back to spain perhaps she should not have wed arthurs younger brother but then what is done is done have they found you a place to rest your head we arrived early this morning and after settling at an inn in leith we came directly here annie and dermid will follow tomorrow they are wed and annie is already expecting a bairn rosamund replied it is always inconvenient when ones tiring woman finds herself with child at least they are wed they might not have been but for paolo loredano and rosamund went on to tell the story of how the artist had sketched annie with dermid in a most compromising position the queen laughed ill wager the naughty girl was surprised when you faced her with your knowledge i said nothing i just left the sketch for them to see they came then and asked our permission to wed rosamund chuckled oh i have gossip about your old suitor logan hepburn the queen said his little wife is big with child it will be born sometime in october they say he mounted her again and again until she proved fecund since then he has not been near her although he treats her with kindness they say he has a mistress somewhere in the borders you are well rid of the fellow logan is not a bad man meg i was simply not ready to marry again and he needed a legitimate heir i am relieved his family prevailed besides friarsgate is my home and i could live nowhere else rosamund told the queen so your earl will go with you over the border aye for a while rosamund answered the castle is full i fear the queen announced you may sleep in my apartments rosamund and lord leslie in the hall he has done it before i am certain the distance between here and leith is little we can remain at the inn the idea of being separated from patrick for even a few nights made her unhappy nay you will remain with me the queen murmured sweetly we shall send for your cousin lord cambridge to come back to scotland he must be bored to death at friarsgate by now he will not come unless he has a place to lay his head in privacy rosamund said i understand he leased a house in the highgate in anticipation of your return when he arrives i shall give you permission to live there the queen said i do not know how to thank you meg rosamund told scotlands queen sharply the queen giggled you will find a way to be with your earl rosamund sometimes the king and i have made love in the oddest places just for the fun and excitement of it you could not expect to lie to me and disappear for several months and i would not punish you even if you were helping lord leslie complete his mission for my husband nay this will be your chastisement when the earl of glenkirk learned of the queens decree he said i will speak with jamie do not lest you endanger my friendship with the queen patrick rosamund warned him meg cannot remonstrate with her husband for the deception i played on her and so she punishes me i will accept it with good grace we are both exhausted with our travels and a few nights apart cannot harm us she is sending to friarsgate for my cousin and tells me he has leased a house here in the town believe me that tom will return with the messenger for he will not wait a moment to rejoin this court given the opportunity and i am anxious for news of home he will invite us to join him and we will be together once more tis you who should be the diplomat sweetheart he told her with a smile rosamund was correct when she said that her cousin once summoned would come posthaste from friarsgate he did and no sooner had he arrived than he sought her out knowing he would find her in the queens apartments he had gained a bit of weight enough to show and she teased him i see maybel has taken good care of you cousin she greeted him and patted the small silkcovered belly he attempted to hide beneath his ornate doublet my dear rosamund he murmured kissing both of her cheeks you are looking lean yet strangely content cousin he glanced about the queens antechamber am i permitted to see the princely heir my lady here is my cousin lord cambridge who you will remember he has returned at your invitation and is anxious to see the prince you will go back to england this summer my lord the queen greeted tom and you will tell my brother henry what a fine laddie i have birthed the king of scotland she smiled and held out her hand to be kissed lord cambridge took the plump little hand and saluted it then he said madame it would be worth my life and you surely must know i am not a brave man for me to bring your kingly brother such a bold message if i should see king henry i will say that you are looking well and that your son appears healthy for the moment the queen laughed my husband says this wee laddie of ours will reign as king one day for his lang eey tells him that you are welcome back to our court my lord i could not refuse so gracious an invitation madame but i regret that i cannot remain long my cousin must return home and i must go south to see to my own holding i have been gone far too long aye and rosamund does long for her friarsgate after her adventures abroad the queen said mischievously go along now and tell your cousin of what has transpired while she has been gone i know she is anxious to speak with you the two boltons bowed themselves from queen margarets presence and found a secluded place in the castles great hall where they might sit and speak my lassies are well was her first question they thrive and philippa grows more like you every day he told her bessie and banon are charming little wenches the wee one in particular she has a way about her and all who meet her love her maybel wants me to tell you that you are to cease your foolishness and return home immediately his eyes twinkled as he said it patrick is coming with us rosamund said quietly will you wed him lord cambridge inquired she shook her head nothing has changed tom i still owe friarsgate my loyalty first and patrick his to glenkirk we need no vows between us to prove our love for each other he will come with me and remain until he feels it is time for him to go his son is grown and capable of managing in his fathers absence then you will be safe while i am gone i go south only to sell my estate rosamund i am purchasing otterly from your uncle henry it is practically in ruins at this point mavis his wife has run off and tis unlikely hell ever see her again her sons including your uncles lad have taken to robbery on the high road theyll all be hung eventually one already has been the two daughters mavis birthed are whoring in carlisle i am told henry bolton is a broken man i have promised him a cottage on the estate and a servant to look after his needs i intend that otterly be restored and made magnificent it is for banon one day and i will see that bessie is so well dowered that she will be considered quite the heiress philippa of course has friarsgate after you unless of course you give the earl a son patrick can no longer sire bairns tom an illness rendered his seed dead there is no chance of my having another child leaning over she kissed her cousin on the cheek you are so good to my girls tom are you sure this is what you want to do aye i do rosamund i am but a few generations out of cumbria and the land seems to catch at your heart i never cared much for my house at cambridge ill keep the london and greenwich houses however he said you never know when we might want to trot south to court although quite frankly queen katherines court is a bit too formal dull and staid for me i far prefer this delightful court of king james here you are sweetheart patrick had come upon them i understood you were back my lord he held out his hand to tom stay seated my lord i am going to join you he looked at rosamund you have asked him i hope asked me what tom wanted to know there has been no time i have been getting the news of home she replied you must ask him the earl said a desperate tone in his voice ask me what lord cambridge repeated may we please stay at the house you have leased here in edinburgh tom the queen has had me sleeping in her antechamber and poor patrick has been in the hall we so long for a comfortable bed to lay our heads in dear cousin tom laughed the tudors have a rather wicked sense of humor my dear rosamund i told the queen when i leased the edinburgh house that when you returned she was to give you the key to it this great hulking old castle is scarcely a place a guest of little importance such as you and the earl want to stay she must have truly missed you cousin that she played this jest on you of course you may stay with me the house is not large but it is comfortable and clean and it is an easy walk up the castle hill you know how i dislike being late for social functions i thought when i arrived yesterday that you had not returned yet as you were not in residence and the housekeeper said no one had come i assumed the queen had been sent word of your impending return which was why she sent for me what a wicked tease she is and he laughed heartily neither the earl of glenkirk nor rosamund joined in his laughter they were not amused can we go now the earl asked i need a bath and a soft bed i will excuse myself from the queens presence rosamund said do not go without me my lords you will have to share your bath patrick as we did in san lorenzo he replied softly and he smiled into her eyes aye she said slowly her amber eyes never leaving his lord cambridge shook his head wonderingly nothing had changed he thought they were as deeply in love now as they had been at christmas yet rosamund would not marry the earl of glenkirk and had said quite frankly that one day they would be parted as the fates meant them to be he worried for his cousin he had loved her as the sister he lost ever since they had met but this love she bore for patrick burned whitehot and what would happen when they were separated he feared to learn the queen was gracious in her small victory over her friend she released rosamund from her company go home and be with your lasses margaret tudor said your earl has done us good service and you should be together i will ask you to come to me again one day godspeed dear rosamund rosamund kissed the queens hand and after curtsying immediately left her together she and patrick took their leave of the king james stewarts warm amber eyes surveyed the pair twice you have come to my aid patrick if i call you again will you come the earl of glenkirk nodded you are my king jamie stewart and though i lost my beloved daughter janet in your service i will answer your call i think that you royal stewarts are not fortunate for the leslies of glenkirk but i will come should you need me had you not come this time patrick you should not have met rosamund bolton the king reminded the earl aye that is to your credit the earl agreed affably are you bound for glenkirk then the king asked nay i have sent a messenger to my son asking him to maintain his position as sole keeper of our lands for a time longer i am of a mind to see england i shall go with rosamund to friarsgate clavens carn is on your route the king said mischievously we will not be stopping rosamund replied tartly the two gentlemen laughed then the king and the earl of glenkirk embraced james kissed rosamunds hand and she curtsied prettily go with god the king told them as they left him lord cambridge was waiting for them and together they walked down the castle hill to the house in the highgate that he had leased i have come all the way to edinburgh and am not to go to court he grumbled it does not seem fair you are welcome to remain rosamund told him sweetly without you after all these months i think not cousin lord cambridge said firmly ah here we are drawing a key from his pocket he unlocked the door of the gray stone house and led them inside mistress macgregor he shouted we are here a small thin woman came from the dark recesses of the long hall i am nae deef yer lordship she said and seeing the earl and rosamund she curtsied my cousin wants a bath lord cambridge announced to the housekeeper youll have to take it in the kitchen mlady mistress macgregor said the tub is there wi the hot water there is nae one to lug it all upstairs i shall be happy to bathe before a hot fire in your kitchen rosamund said my servants will be here shortly dermid will do any heavy work you require and annie while expecting a child is quite strong the housekeeper smiled broadly ill be pleased for a wee bit of help mlady she said annie is expecting a child tom looked at her askance she and dermid wed in march rosamund quickly explained after patrick and i have washed are in warm clean clothing and are fed i shall tell you all of our adventures in san lorenzo tom oh i wish you had been there you would have simply adored it the weather was warm there were flowers everywhere in february it was really a little bit of heaven on earth i am so pleased to learn that he replied dryly annie and dermid arrived with a cart carrying the luggage they had been directed from the castle where they had first gone having just come this day from leith rosamund with annies help bathed in a sturdy oak tub before the kitchen fire afterwards the earl with dermids aid bathed in the same water before it grew cold wrapped in chamber robes they sat before the fire in the room that served as a hall their feet turned to the fire taking the chill from the june night mrs macgregor served them a fine dinner of broiled salmon duck with plum sauce fresh green peas bread and cheese there was good brown ale to drink finally sated and relaxed they shared with tom their adventures of the past few months he laughed to learn of the nudes the artist loredano had done of them unawares he was interested to learn that a howard was an ambassador from king henry i remember that particular howard a sly fellow with ambition not suited to his few talents he recognized you aye but as i was never formally introduced to him i claimed i knew him not rosamund said he looked like the sort of fellow who sees plots where there are none tom nodded then he said i cannot wait to see the portrait he did of you my dear girl is it marvelous is it too wonderful it is magnificent the earl of glenkirk enthused he pictured her among her hills a flaming sunset behind her defending friarsgate there are really no words to describe how wonderful this painting is tom you will have to judge for yourself and afterwards as patrick and rosamund lay together in the first bed they had shared in weeks he held her close stroking her long auburn hair they had made long and sweet love earlier now they were both allowing the exhaustion of the past few weeks to claim them are you asleep yet he asked her almost she murmured let us leave for your friarsgate soon rosamund i am weary of travel he told her aye in a day or two after i have caught up with my sleep it will give tom a few days to play at court before we go she said and she yawned i am so tired patrick a few days to sleep aye my love he agreed and then he began to snore softly and curling up next to him rosamund joined him in his slumber chapter three days later they departed edinburgh for fri arsgate lord cambridge promised to follow them in a few days time for the queen had asked him to remain at court for a short time i have told her i have absolutely no news of her brothers court but she insists i stay for a few weeks i may go directly south to save time i want this business with your uncle henry settled as quickly as possible you will make a far more congenial neighbor than he rosamund said pity him cousin came the reply his fall is quite sad and he is a broken man his wife destroyed him he can be certain only that young henry is his get yet all mavis bastards bear the name of bolton though her adultery was an open secret your uncle was too proud to publicly expose her stilland this was said cheerfullyas i have previously said those lads will all end their days on the hangmans rope you find gossip where there should be none rosamund laughed write to me and let me know when you intend to return to us you will have to stay at friarsgate while otterly is made fit for human habitation again i intend to tear the place down and build a new house tom said and will its interior match your houses in london and greenwich cousin rosamund asked him knowing as she spoke what he would say of course lord cambridge answered her predictably you know dear girl how i despise change and this way the servants can come north with me as they come to greenwich and not be idle i have been keeping them in london all these months while they do naught shocking tom i adore you rosamund said and she kissed him on both cheeks i am relieved to know i have not been replaced entirely in your heart dear girl he said returning her kiss travel safely and i will indeed write to you i want to know all your adventures she said laughing my adventures pale in comparison to yours dear girl and to think when i first met you you were such a quiet little country mouse he replied then with a wave of his hand he left her he loves you very much the earl noted i love him back rosamund said he is like a big brother and he has been wonderful to me from the moment we met edinburgh behind them they moved south and west through the borders traveling only in the daylight hours for even in the best of times the borderland between england and scotland could be a rough place they forded the yarrow river at yarrow and the teviot at hawick below jedburgh they followed the path along liddel water through the cheviots rosamund was anxious to get past clavens carn but as luck would have it the summer twilight found them right where she did not want to be id rather camp in a field with the cattle she said to glenkirk i would not he told her hes a married man now you will see patrick and i would not harm that sweet wife of his for the world but you will see he will glower at me and make cruel remarks she is not stupid and she will wonder what it is all about and his roughneck brothers and their wives will tell her i am flirting with him to take the onus off of him is there anywhere else we might stop he asked her no she admitted glumly then we have no choice but to stop at clavens carn i shall say i am weary and must go to my bed immediately rosamund decided aye glenkirk agreed that would be best slump in your saddle and feign great exhaustion sweetheart i will speak for our party and we have annie and her belly too he chuckled tis a sad group we are the earl had hired a group of menatarms in edinburgh to accompany them to friarsgate now rosamund annie and the others behind him he hailed the closed gates at clavens carn ho the castle he shouted who goes there a voice from the heights demanded patrick leslie earl of glenkirk the lady of friarsgate two servants and twenty menatarms we request shelter for the night the lady and the servant girl who is with child are wearied and can travel no farther we ask the hospitality of logan hepburn and his wife remain there while i seek my master the voice from the darkened heights said they waited and they waited the minutes passed while the wind began to come up and there was the smell of rain in the air he would refuse rosamund said but his wife prevails upon him to remember that courtesy must be rendered to a traveler who asks it you seem to know him well glenkirk said dryly he is not a complex man rosamund replied sharply then she laughed softly he will have to give in to jeannies pleas or seem quite meanspirited if he had not this young wife he would refuse us as it is he will make us wait outside his gates like beggars wondering he knows we would not ask shelter of him had we any other choice tomorrow you shall be home glenkirk soothed her a light rain began to fall yet they still waited finally they heard the creak of the portcullis as it was slowly raised and the double wooden entrance doors began to slowly open but just enough to allow them entry one by one into the courtyard there they found the master of the house awaiting them with his pretty wife who was very great with child patrick dismounted and then lifted rosamund down from her horse she slumped against him as if she were barely able to stand i appreciate your hospitality logan hepburn and yours also my lady jean the earl said in gracious tones is there somewhere my lady might lay her head for she is spent with all our travels we were too eager i fear to reach friarsgate today and the darkness caught us he smiled oh the poor lady jeannie said sympathetically her blue eyes went past rosamund to annie come lass you and your mistress she said i will see you are bedded down have you eaten she bustled about them clucking i fear i must carry the lady the earl said as rosamund began to crumble to the ground by his side he caught her up murmuring as he did so vixen if there are stairs you will have to carry me rosamund swallowed back her laughter pushing her face into his big shoulder to muffle the sound of it but her amusement was cut short when logan spoke give her to me my lord for there are stairs and the lady has not a childs weight he took rosamund from the earl and strode purposefully into his house with annie and the others following in his wake he is so thoughtful jeannie said taking the earls arm to bring him inside he will put her in the guest chamber follow after him lassie she told annie logan took the stairs to the second floor of his house two at a time he stamped down a dim hallway kicked open a door and entered a chamber dumping her on the bed he snarled did you have to come here lady did you have to torture me once more with your perfidy i would have sooner bedded in hell this night rosamund snapped back at him so he said you are not as weary as you pretended to be is there no end to your duplicitous nature do not speak to me that way my lord she told him i simply wished to avoid the scene now ensuing between us you have a good wife and i actually like the lass i would not have her learn of your deceitful nature especially as you seem to have gotten her so quickly with child when is the bairn due it should be our child rosamund he said softly i love you and i always have they forced me into this marriage because you fell so publicly into bed with lord leslie this child should be ours villain she cried get out get out oh i pray the holy mother that your wife never learns how cruel you really are i am never unkind to jeannie he quickly responded she is as much a victim as i am though she knows it not she is like a small helpless kitten you cannot be cruel to such a creature you love it and you protect it then why do you speak to me so rosamund demanded of him because i love you he said you wanted an heir and any woman would do my lord she replied aye i want an heir tis every mans right but that was not why i wanted to wed you rosamund bolton i love you why can you not believe it get out of my chamber logan hepburn rosamund said they will be wondering in the hall where you are ah here is annie come in lass and let us prepare for bed now good night my lord do you really love him the laird of clavens carn asked aye i do rosamund answered him as i have never loved any other or will he turned and departed without another word lady jeanne says she will send us supper annie said wideeyed how much did you hear rosamund inquired of her servant all of it my lady i was outside the door but i feared to come in annie responded you will forget all that you heard rosamund told her aye i will annie agreed his lordship says to tell you he will sleep in the hall with dermid rosamund nodded lady jean is very kind annie noted she was most solicitous about my condition her being in the same way but a few months farther along her bairn will come in september she says she is a sweet girl rosamund agreed we must pray she gives him a son else he not be satisfied i hopes its a lad i carry annie said a maidservant came to light a fire to take the chill off the evening another servant girl brought a tray with two bowls of lamb stew bread cheese and ale a third carried in a basin of warm water for bathing and set it on the edge of the coals in the fireplace to keep warm the lady of the keep knew how to see her guests were made comfortable rosamund and annie ate their supper with a good appetite they washed their faces and their hands then stripped off their gowns and climbed into bed the bed was fresh and smelled of lavender they slept soundly until the dawn hearing the early birdsong outside the chambers window rosamund awoke she slid from her bed and pulled the chamber pot from beneath it peeing then emptying the pot out the window afterwards the day was warm with a south wind and there was something in that air that called to her home she thought a few hours more and i am home again at friarsgate patrick is with me and i will have my family about me she sighed i am happy she thought she pulled her clothes back on and drew her boots onto her feet a bath tonight she would have a real bath for the first time in weeks annie she gently shook her servant by her shoulder wake up annie we will be leaving soon and we will be home by afternoon annie groaned but she dutifully arose im going downstairs into the hall annie do not be far behind me lass her mistress instructed and rosamund hurried from the chamber in the hall she found patrick up already and she ran to him and kissed him i missed you last night she said softly he did not come down right away the earl said softly he would quarrel with me did i not warn you rosamund replied he got drunk before his brothers put him to bed but his lady wife appeared not to be disturbed by any of it she was too busy chattering with me she is lonely here i think her sistersinlaw are both flighty lasses with little on their minds but ribbons laces and bed sport let us go as quickly as possible rosamund said it is but a few more hours to friarsgate i do not wish to have to face logan hepburn again you will tell me later patrick said i think we must at least wait for the lady of the house before we go come sweetheart and eat some porridge there is a freshly baked cottage loaf too he led her to the high board and a servant at once placed a large trencher loaf filled with oat stirabout before them there was honey and heavy golden cream which rosamund added liberally to the hot cereal they ate and their goblets were filled with wine a small round cottage loaf had been set before them and rosamund tore pieces from it dipping the bits in honey and feeding them to her lover he returned the favor and soon they were laughing as they licked the drizzles of honey from each others mouths then patrick suddenly grew serious it is not just that i want you rosamund i find to my surprise that i need you she smiled into his green eyes i feel the same way my love she told him the mistress of the keep entered the hall oh you are both already up she said have you been fed did you sleep well she hurried up to the high board smiling we have been treated very well my lady jean the earl told her you have been a gracious hostess rosamund added i am so grateful for the lovely supper you sent me last night i was so tired we only arrived home recently it seems but for our lovely sojourn we have been traveling for weeks i am so glad you broke your journey here jean said i did so want to see you again you are welcome at friarsgate anytime rosamund told her oh once my bairn comes i shall be going nowhere jean said and i am certainly in no condition to travel now one day i shall come and visit you however when my bairns for logans brothers say i must have a houseful are grown and not before she smiled you have daughters do you not three and a son lost rosamund responded softly everyone says it is a lad im carrying for i am so big jean said you cannot know until the bairn is born rosamund warned her lassies can appear large too jean shook her head nay this is a lad for logan wants a lad i cannot disappoint him i am sure there is nothing you could do that would disappoint him rosamund replied she turned to her lover my lord are we ready to depart where are annie and dermid he queried were ready my lord dermid said annie looking slightly sleepy was by his side horses are in the courtyard and everyones been fed my thanks lady he bowed neatly to jean and then turned to depart the hall with his wife please let us know when you are safely delivered rosamund told her hostess i will have father mata pray for you jean hepburn tell logan i am sorry we did not see him before we left he seemed unwell last night i hope whatever was bothering him has now left him say i asked after him she smiled and slipped a hand into the earls big one i will jean smiled travel in safety lady rosamund when they were out again in the courtyard of clavens carn and mounted patrick leaned over speaking so only rosamund might hear him you have sharp claws madame he said i take it his offense last night was suitably unforgivable that you would torture him so cruelly he once again declared his love for me rosamund muttered angrily the earl of glenkirk nodded that was indeed unforgivable he agreed and particularly so as that trusting little wife of his is big with his heir they rode from clavens carn down the hill and onto the track that led over the hills into england it bothers me that jean hepburn should ever be harmed by believing that her husband is not true to her she is striving so hard to be a good wife to him do you think she loves him the earl wondered i know not rosamund answered shaking her head but he owes her his loyalty and to tell me within the walls of his own house with his wife in the hall below that he still loves mei wish i had slapped him i was astounded by his words patrick he is what i always believed him to be a rude and crude borderer i feel sorry for him the earl said surprising her why on earth would you feel sorry for him rosamund demanded her tone aggrieved i feel sorry for him because he truly does love you rosamund the earl said quietly i know you always believed he courted you because he needed and wanted an heir that may be true in part but the man is also deeply in love with you the sight of us together last night tortured him when he returned to the hall he said practically nothing but he drank himself into a stupor his brothers had to carry him to bed i am sorry for that rosamund replied but patrick i never said i would wed him i said no i always said no i feel sorry for him too but i will not be put in the same position with sweet jean hepburn as i was with my own queen i am not comfortable with guilt my lord particularly when those who are responsible for these situations feel no guilt at all logan feels sorry for himself he does not think of his wife but i do henry tudor felt deprived when i returned to friarsgate he did not consider the hurt he would do the queen if she had learned a trusted friend had been in her husbands bed but i did it is unlikely that you will see him again for some time if ever the earl responded the very sight of you is painful i believe he respects his wife even if he does not love her and there is his pride to consider as well aye logan is a proud man rosamund noted they rode for several hours and suddenly the landscape about them began to grow familiar she knew the hills about them rosamund leaned forward eagerly you sense friarsgate he said to her she nodded excitedly i do she said just one more hill patrick and we will see my lake and my fields oh god i cannot believe i stayed away so long yet i should not have been anywhere else but with you my darling you love your glenkirk every bit as much as i love friarsgate i look forward to seeing it one day and you will he promised her they followed the faint track of the road down the hill and then began to climb up the next at its crest it was as she had said and she stopped to take it all in below them lay friarsgate its meadows green in the late spring sun there were sheep and cattle grazing placidly the fields were golden with grain and the orchards as they rode down the hill and past them were full of blossoms the lake beyond the stone house sparkled in the afternoon light the bell in the church began to peal and the people came from their work and cottages running to greet their returning mistress and her party they reached the house and maybel came out smiling broadly with rosamunds daughters in tow the lady of friarsgate jumped down from her horse and kneeling gathered her children into her arms oh my darling girls she cried covering them with kisses bessie the baby now four squirmed protesting but banon and philippa were openly glad to see their mother again i did not expect you to be gone from us so long mama philippa age eight said uncle thomas is a fine companion but we missed you her gaze turned to the earl of glenkirk and she quirked an auburn eyebrow rosamund stood philippa may i present you and your sisters to patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk she looked sharply at her daughters and they curtsied politely the earl will be visiting with us for a time rosamund said do you have a castle my lord philippa asked boldly i do he answered her smiling down on this smaller version of his love one day i hope your mother will come and bring you to see it well and tis past time you got home maybel said sternly although from the look of this fine gentleman i can see why you remained in edinburgh so long come into the house now then she stared hard at annie whats this whats this do you return home with shame in your belly i be a respectably married woman annie said and she pulled dermid forward yon scot is my man maybel mistress has promised us a cot eventually youll have to earn it girl maybel said sharply and just where was you wed my lass annie looked to her mistress and when rosamund nodded she said in a great cathedral and by a bishop hisself maybel there isnt a lass at friarsgate who ever had a finer wedding ill vow maybel looked astounded but rosamund spoke up saying we have a wonderful tale to tell you but not here we have been riding most of the day and we need food and wine and most of all a hot bath it has been weeks since either of us has had a decent bath edmund she greeted the gentleman who had just come from the house patrick this is my uncle edmund bolton uncle patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk she led them all into the house now the hall was pleasantly cool and looking about it rosamund sighed with pleasure she had enjoyed her adventures in san lorenzo and edinburgh but by gods blessed body it was good to be home at last she settled herself immediately in her favorite chair by the hearth she saw a fire already laid for the evening and smiled she could hear the servants bringing in the luggage and annie full of selfimportance directing them as to where it would go a little maidservant with whom she was not familiar brought a tray with wine and sugar wafers who are you child rosamund asked i be lucy mlady annies sister the girl chirped with a small smile thank you lucy rosamund said and then she turned to the earl shall i begin our tale he nodded it is over and done with now and i doubt it will travel from cumbria to the ears of king henry he answered her with a smile bending down he lifted bessie who was hanging on his leg up into his lap the little girl snuggled down in his arms contentedly for a moment the earl of glenkirks face grew sad but then he sighed and smiled at the child you are thinking of your daughter rosamund said softly aye he admitted she was just about this age and size when her brother was born and she came to glenkirk castle to live but tell your tale rosamund rosamund looked about her maybel and edmund were leaning forward philippa and banon had expectant looks upon their faces rosamund began she explained how she had met the earl almost as soon as she had arrived in edinburgh and how they had fallen in love at first sight she told them briefly of patricks previous sojourn in san lorenzo of how his beloved daughter was taken by slavers and sold into bondage never to be seen again she then went on to tell them that king james had called the earl from glenkirk and asked him to act secretly for him in a certain matter that would require him to go to san lorenzo after an absence of eighteen years at this point the friarsgate priest father mata entered the hall and silently took a seat it is good to see you father rosamund said i am telling the hall of my adventures what have i missed the priest asked and rosamund quickly recapped her tale for him before continuing on king james is a man of peace she told her listeners explaining how their own king was attempting to force his brotherinlaw into a dishonorable act by betraying old allies or becoming pope julius enemy he was willful even as lad maybel said shaking her head but go on lass king james hoped to weaken the alliance england and the pope were building up against france by doing that his refusal to join them would become a moot point that is why patrick was sent back secretly to san lorenzo to treat with venices and the emperor maximilians representatives king james believed this mission was doomed to failure but he felt he must at least make an attempt to prevent the war that will surely ensue between our countries if king henrys mischief is allowed to prevail patrick agreed to go as long as i could go with him you went across the sea mama philippa asked i did my daughter i have seen france and san lorenzo rosamund told them san lorenzo is so beautiful and while it was snowy winter here the winter in san lorenzo was sunny and warm there were flowers in bloom and i swam in the sea god have mercy maybel exclaimed rosamund laughed we lived in a house called a villa that overlooked the sea she continued on i met the duke who rules that fair duchy and even danced with him i had my portrait painted by a great artist who had come from venice to winter in san lorenzo when the painting arrives we will hang it here in the hall i remember once telling margaret tudor that country folk didnt have such luxuries as their portraits painted rosamund smiled and what of mistress meg who is now a queen maybel inquired she was far gone with child at christmastide and she delivered a fair son this april hes a lovely strong bonnie lad maybel and the queen of the scots is at last a happy woman she loves the king and she has done her duty by scotland rosamund said i had to lie to her when i went off with patrick to san lorenzo but she has forgiven me the untruth that is why i sent tom back to watch over friarsgate in my absence did he tell you that he is purchasing otterly from uncle henry her uncle edmund now spoke up aye even i am reduced to feeling sorry for my halfbrother that second wife of his was a wicked bitch i never thought to see henry bolton brought so low but he has been tom will see him well fed well cared for and well housed as long as he lives the monies he is paying for otterly have been put with a goldsmith in carlisle they cannot be touched when my halfbrother is rested once again in his mind and body he will make a will you would not recognize him rosamund he is as thin as a rail now uncle henry he who was always so plump and dyspeptic i am indeed surprised rosamund replied that fat face he once had is now as narrow as a hermit monks maybel chimed in but the eyes staring out at you would give you a fright they are both hopeless and empty of emotion at the same time i think him no less dangerous for all his bad luck wife have mercy edmund said fat or thin hes a bad one maybel responded firmly ill not be unhappy to see lord tom back and in charge of otterly he says it is for banon i know rosamund said lord leslies mission then did fail father mata said quietly aye patrick answered him we remained in san lorenzo the rest of the winter for we were thought to be lovers briefly escaping from the obligations of our lives finally on april first we began our return home stopping first in paris to reassure king louis of king james fidelity it is unfortunate you were not successful for peace is better than what will now come the priest said are you aware maybel asked that logan hepburn has a wife i am rosamund replied i was at his wedding to mistress jean and we stopped last night at clavens carn i wonder that you would not have him edmund said slowly and then seeing the look in his nieces eye he stopped where is glenkirk father mata inquired politely of the earl in the northeast highlands i am long a widower with a grown son and grandchildren patrick answered him offering the information he knew all of those who loved rosamund sought from him patrick will remain with us as my guest for a time rosamund told them theyre lovers maybel said afterwards to her husband edmund i never thought that my lass would be such a woman leave her be maybel edmund said quietly she is really in love for the first time in her life and she is content can you not see it does she not deserve some happiness we have been with her since her birth we know what she has suffered and what she has endured rosamund has always done her duty by friarsgate she is entitled to some personal happiness she is no longer a child she should marry again maybel said stubbornly mayhap she will one day her spouse replied and mayhap not you thought logan hepburn would be a suitable mate for her maybel persisted i did but rosamund did not came the answer but he loved her maybel said but he made the mistake of not telling her that the depth of his passion was for her and her alone he could not keep silent about his need for a son rosamund did not like the idea she was being pursued because she was proved fecund maybel i like this earl of glenkirk she has brought home he could be her father maybel said outraged i doubt the depth of his feelings are particularly parental where my niece is concerned edmund chuckled his wife swatted irritably at him hell not wed her he has no need for a wife and rosamund has no need for a husband edmund reminded his mate but to flaunt her lover before her daughters maybel fussed i am certain they will be discreet edmund assured her banon and bessie are not apt to see or understand it but philippa is eight now and she has a sharp eye maybel said remind her of that edmund suggested gently i most certainly will maybel replied indignantly she has had him put in the chamber next to hers and there is a connecting door what would the children think if they entered her room and found that earl in her bed edmund chuckled but maybel looked outraged you will not be content old woman until you have had your say so go and have it now throwing him an angry look maybel hurried off to find rosamund her step was determined as she climbed the stairs reaching her mistress chamber she opened the door without knocking surprised rosamund who was alone turned ah maybel it is so good to be back she said smiling and then seeing the look on the older womans face she asked what is it what is troubling you that man should not be here maybel answered bluntly to display your lover to your innocent daughters to expose them to your lechery is unforgivable what are you thinking child have you considered your lasses at all rosamund drew in a long breath and then exhaled sit down she invited maybel motioning her to the bed she however remained standing do you recall my age now she asked the older woman who shook her head i am twentythree maybel i have outlived three husbands and i have three daughters for twenty years i have done what was best for friarsgate and its people i will continue to do so what i will not do however is be criticized for taking a bit of happiness for myself i love you dearly for you are the mother who raised me after my own perished but that does not allow you the right to censure me no one is more aware of my daughters than i am neither patrick nor i will expose them to what you term our lechery we are lovers yes we have been since the first night we met and our eyes found each other across the great hall at stirling castle i cannot explain it and neither can he it is simply the way it is but to put your mind at ease he would wed me if i would have him he knows i prefer not to remarry and so he does not press me there can be no bairns of our coupling for his seed was rendered lifeless years ago by an illness now that should satisfy your curiosity and i will not discuss it further why wont you wed him maybel demanded satisfied but still inquisitive because i will not leave friarsgate and his allegiance is to glenkirk rosamund explained he will return to scotland this autumn perhaps he will come back to friarsgate again and perhaps i shall never see him again neither of us knows what will happen but we know we are not meant by the fates to be together always now maybel that is an end to it i shall say no more and you will be your dear self to patrick a woman who doesnt want to be a wife maybel opined i do not understand it at all rosamund laughed i know she said it will ever be a puzzle to you dear maybel i do apologize for flummoxing you so maybel stood up well at least it is settled between us child your earl seems a nice enough fellow i can see you love him as you have never loved another ill go back to the hall now and see that the supper is ready where is that lazy annie i have seen she and her husband have a comfortable room i want her to rest for a few days she has traveled all the way from san lorenzo with a bairn in her belly she is very tired you spoil the wench maybel grumbled after dinner ill have your bathwater brought so you may bathe then she departed rosamunds chamber closing the door firmly behind her she loves you very much patrick said stepping through the door connecting their two chambers you heard it all reaching up she stroked his handsome face with her fingers i was about to come through when she burst in he replied she is right you know we must not set a bad example before your daughters they are charming by the way i am particularly enamored of your youngest when we retire to our chambers we will lock both doors to the hallway rosamund said there will be no interruptions my lord and you will share my bath tonight i have a delightfully commodious tub for two owein always liked bathing with me she told him with a mischievous smile he was obviously a man of good taste and discernment the earl said come and lie with me rosamund begged it is almost the supper hour and it would not do if we did not appear or worse appeared flushed and rumpled he advised we will just lie together and talk she promised him they stretched out upon her bed together your lands are fair he told her and very different from mine glenkirk stands amid the hills though i have a loch too we can grow only what we need to sustain ourselves your fields however are bounteous enough to feed your vast flocks as well as your people i look forward to riding out with you tomorrow we are indeed blessed rosamund agreed why must you leave me patrick can your son not manage your lands are you really needed at glenkirk until king james made me the earl of glenkirk rosamund i was the laird of glenkirk i still am to my folk i am their lord and the source of all that is good for them i will be as long as i live patrick said quietly my son will not be accepted until i am dead he will be respected as my authority in my absence but he will not be accepted as their master rosamund i know why you do not leave friarsgate it is for the same reason and your girls are too young to manage on their own i was managing at their age but it was difficult and i very much resented my uncle henry who coveted friarsgate for himself i will not put my daughters in that position maybel edmund and my uncle richard who is the prior of st cuthberts protected me from harm but it was hard on them and they are older now so we are at the same impasse as we have ever been he said softly tears rolled down her cheeks i know she admitted and i hate it he kissed the tears from her face we must be grateful for what we have he told her quietly she nodded but beneath her acquiescence anger was beginning to burn she loved this man and she always would she didnt want to be separated from him ever at the evening meal the earl of glenkirk was seated on the lady of friarsgates right hand and on his right hand was philippa meredith the heiress to friarsgate banon and bessie had been fed earlier and were abed now but at eight philippa came to table with the adults you are very handsome for an old man philippa observed and you i think look like your mother he replied restraining his laughter maybel says i am my mother too philippa responded are you going to live here forever my lord nay he told the child i have come to visit as your mama and i became friends at king james court i shall depart for glenkirk in the autumn will you ever come back philippa asked i think my mother would be very sad if you did not come back i will try to come back philippa the earl of glenkirk said i know i will want to come back but sometimes what you want and what must be are not the same i thought grownups always got what they wanted was the reply patrick laughed softly would that it were so my pretty maid but it is not grownups must do their duty and more often than not that duty conflicts with what they want still a duty should always come first you must remember that for one day you will be the lady of friarsgate the child nodded i think you have given me good advice my lord i will remember it she was a serious little girl he thought his own lost daughter janet was so different at that age janet the halfwild highland child who rode her pony at breakneck speed and protected her little brother from any who would tease him or otherwise seek to do him mischief his janet was as proud of her heritage as was this solemn little girl who was already gaining a sense of duty to friarsgate he had hated losing her to the heir of san lorenzo but better rudolpho di san lorenzo than the fate that had claimed her adam said that one day he would find his big sister but patrick doubted it the earl of glenkirk found that friarsgate possessed the same isolation that his own highland home did the only news was brought by travelers mostly peddlers coming over the border from scotland they learned that king james shipbuilding was progressing apace and that the heir to scotlands throne remained healthy and strong both the english and the scots were strengthening their border garrisons king james had signed a renewal of the alliance with france in europe war raged spain marched into navarre and henry tudor into bayonne awaiting their aid to win his french crown back disappointed his fleet pounded the breton coast as they made their way home to england once again the spring melded into a summer that seemed to move slowly one day and quickly the next now that rosamund could swim she insisted that patrick teach her girls as he had taught her together they splashed about in her lake as philippa banon and bessie giggled and sloshed each other with water in their efforts to learn the water is certainly a lot colder than the sea in san lorenzo rosamund remarked the first time they swam tis not as cold as glenkirks loch he swore do you break the ice before you enter it then she teased him back only in may he assured her youll see one day aye ill come to glenkirk if you do not come back to me she threatened with a grin not this year but next i shall take my girls and we will winter in your highlands as long as you will come back to friarsgate with us the rest of the year tis fair and a good idea sweetheart he agreed that way neither of us shirks our responsibilities to our holdings he said they sat upon the lakeshore watching the children oh patrick rosamund said and her voice was filled with hope could we it would be a perfect solution to the problem that besets us aye he agreed slowly and then perhaps you would agree to marry me rosamund and we shall never be parted again let us see how your son likes me first darling she advised i will drive no wedge between you two return to me in the springtime patrick and if we are both of the same mind then i shall come back with you to glenkirk next winter with my girls and we can be wed then he told her she nodded but we must say naught to any right now my lord it will be our secret there can be no marriage between us unless your son approves let adam know me before you speak with him please very well my darling it shall be as you desire for i cannot refuse you anything it would seem in early september a carter arrived requesting payment for the great crate that he had transported from the port of newcastleontyne to friarsgate going into her strongbox rosamund counted out the coins but she said open the crate for me first that i may make certain your cargo is not damaged be careful she warned as the carter and his helper began to pull the crate apart shortly the painting as done by maestro loredano was revealed the two carters lifted it from its packaging and held it up for all to see there were great oohs from those gathered in the hall tis beautiful lass edmund said i have never seen the like before it would have traveled easier had he just sent the canvas rosamund noted dryly but i suspect that the maestro would trust no one but himself to see to the framing her eyes met the earls i wonder what happened to the other painting patrick laughed i suspect we shall never know madonna then he explained to edmund and maybel about the two paintings he dont sound very respectable to me this painter fellow maybel said he was not respectable as we would have it the earl answered her but you will agree that the fellow is talented his rendition of rosamund is masterful aye edmund agreed he has her so lifelike that i would expect her to step from the painting my lord the harvest was now gathered in and friarsgate began to prepare for the winter to come the anniversary of sir owein merediths death was celebrated in the little estate church it was now three years since he had fallen from a tree in the orchard and broken his neck the days were growing noticeably shorter and the nights were now cold both rosamund and patrick were avoiding the inevitable i can remain no longer or i shall have to spend the winter here he told her one evening as they lay abed do not leave me she begged him i am so fearful that if we break the spell that has surrounded us these past months i shall never see you again then come with me he said and he caressed her beautiful auburn hair she shook her head you know i cannot patrick i am amazed at all i have done in this past year and the places i have been in that time thanks to you promise me that you will return in the spring when the snows have left your highlands oh i wish you could at least remain until your birthday december is too late a time for me to travel it is already october and i should have gone two weeks ago he said rosamund i am leaving tomorrow she cried out as if he had struck her but then turning a brave face to him she said then you must love me tonight patrick as if you will not love me ever again she pulled his head to hers and their lips met in a fierce kiss each of them drawing from the other she ran her tongue over his mouth tasting him hungrily his hands cupped her bottom drawing her closer i love you she sobbed and i love you as i have never loved another rosamund bolton he declared he caressed her meaning it to be tender but instead his touch aroused her passions his mouth closed over a nipple and he drew upon it even as he fondled the round soft flesh of her breasts his fingers played between her thighs and then she surprised him by turning herself about so she might take his manhood between her hands and suckle upon it her facile little tongue ran up and down the length of him it encircled the ruby knob and he moaned with pleasure as he experienced a delight he had not imagined her capable of giving but before she unmanned him he forced her away and onto her back once more he mounted her and pushed into her welcoming heat taking her face between his two big hands as he did watching the subtle play of passion upon her lovely face as he thrust slowly back and forth until she was halfsobbing with her own pleasure he bent his body now and gave her a long slow kiss how is it that you make me young again my sweet border lover in what time and what place have we been before i have never understood rosamund but i do not care any longer as long as i have your love for now and always his movements on her became more demanding the taste of him had been the most stimulating aphrodisiac she had ever known she had not wanted to release him from between her lips but she had also been developing a terrible need for him between her thighs which he had quickly filled rosamund reveled in the feel of his manhood thick and hard inside her he taunted and teased her with his prowess as he moved back and forth back and forth for a long moment she believed that nothing would give her release and then the delicious tingling began and she was dizzy with the pleasure patrick offered i love you she cried and his lips met hers as her body began to experience spasms of passionate fulfillment as he released his love juices within her rosamund wept afterwards i cannot bear it that we will be parted these next months she sobbed he said nothing for there was nothing left for him to say instead he held her within the shelter of his arms and stroked her auburn head tenderly eventually rosamund fell asleep but patrick remained awake for some time was this the last time they would be together nay he did not feel that at all he would return in the springtime and they would love again his instincts had proven correct so far he had no reason to doubt them now and he would not still he regretted that he must go the winter would seem very long without his rosamund in the morning he bid them all farewell bessie who had become the earls special pet cried to see him go dermid would accompany his master but he would return in time for the birth of his first child in december edmund and maybel were genuinely sorry to see patrick depart rosamund put on a brave face but annie howled and cried until maybel threatened to smack her hell be back you foolish lass she told the girl were you not wed by a bishop in a cathedral and is it not his child you carry be brave lass dermid said i have to go home and tell my ma now dont i the two men mounted their horses and rosamund standing by the earls stirrup looked up with a tearstained face and whispered remember i love you patrick he leaned down lifted her up enough to kiss her lips and replied and remember that i love you rosamund bolton then he set her down again the others dispersed returning to their duties but rosamund remained watching until nothing of patrick leslie earl of glenkirk was visible but a faint cloud of golden dust returning to her bedchamber she flung herself on the bed they had shared and wept wildly the scent of him was yet on the pillows i cannot bear it she thought desperately i cannot live without him for six months oh god why did i not have mata marry us now why did i not at least go with him but she knew the answers to her questions even as she silently voiced them the earls son must approve a match between his longwidowed father and the lady of friarsgate nor could she leave her girls again since their fathers tragic death she had spent too much time away from them rosamund wished her cousin tom were here now to comfort her then she sighed and rising from her bed she washed the tears from her face she had duties to complete and if she did not return to the hall soon her daughters would be frightened taking a deep breath the lady of friarsgate walked from her bedchamber and down the staircase to where they all awaited her anxiously chapter apeddler making his way back into england stopped at friarsgate in late october he had spent the previous night at clavens carn the lady of the house he informed those assembled in rosamunds hall had a fine new son born earlier in the month the lord was very pleased and was eager to show his heir to all who entered clavens carn he got her with child quick enough rosamund said dryly she must have conceived on her wedding night or shortly thereafter it might have been your laddie maybel murmured softly rosamund shot her a hard look i had no desire to wed with the lord of clavens carn and well you know it patrick and i will marry next year if his son does not disapprove it is what i want it is what he wants and if his son should not be content to see his father remarried what then maybel demanded ever protective of rosamund then we will continue on as we have came the answer adam leslie may want to meet me before he gives his father a blessing on this match if he does i should certainly understand maybel sighed another old husband i do not know why you would prefer lord leslie to logan hepburn rosamund laughed i cannot explain it to you dearest i simply did not love logan but from the moment our eyes met i knew patrick leslie was my destiny a bitter destiny im thinking maybel muttered but it is mine to choose rosamund replied quietly no longer will i be told what i must do and whom i must wed those days are over i never thought to hear you speak like this maybel responded that you would throw away your responsibilities astounds me i am not eschewing my obligations maybel i will always fulfill my duties where friarsgate and my family are concerned but why must i be unhappy by doing so maybel sighed i do want you happy but i dont understand why you could not be happy with the lord of clavens carn well i couldnt rosamund said her patience wearing thin and he is wed now to a good lass who has given him the desired son and heir maybel opened her mouth to speak again but her husband leaned from his chair and put a warning hand on her shoulder with a sigh of frustration maybel grew silent at last will uncle patrick return to us soon philippa asked her mother rosamund shook her head we shall not see him until next spring she said i want him to come home bessie wailed large tears rolling down her rosy little cheeks so do i baby rosamund replied but we must winter alone before we see the earl of glenkirk again i want uncle tom back banon spoke up when will he return mama now your uncle thomas may well be back in time for the feast of christs mass rosamund told her daughters with a smile i am certain he will bring you all lovely presents he will soon be our neighbor and wont that be fun the three little girls all agreed it would indeed be grand to have uncle thomas as their neighbor what will happen to your uncle henry when uncle tom comes to live in his house philippa queried her mother it will no longer be henry boltons house rosamund answered her daughter surprised that she even knew of the man she had not seen him in several years and while philippa might have seen him once she would have been very young how had she remembered this relation who has spoken to you of my uncle henry she asked i have edmund replied she is the heiress to friarsgate and it is important that she know her familys history niece it is better that it comes from me i am more objective in the matter and i do not understand why rosamund answered him henry bolton was never kind to you but even given that i was born on the wrong side of the blanket edmund responded henry could not take away the plain fact that i was the eldest and that our father loved me every bit as much as he loved richard guy and henry because he was the youngest of us he always felt it necessary to try harder that trait developed into a foolish superiority as he grew older and comprehended that richard and i were not legitimate while he and guy were yet our father showed no preference among us it has been quite frustrating for him rosamund he has lived his entire life being haughty and arrogant because he was legitimate and what has it gained him his dismissive and overbearing attitude did not bring him happiness or love it brought him two legitimate sons one who died young and the other who is a thief it brought him a second wife who whored with any and all spawning a passel of bairns your uncle dared not deny for fear of being made a fool and yet everyone knew it gained him naught but your scorn and now he is brought low only the kindness of thomas bolton will allow him to live out his days in comfort he doesnt deserve it rosamund said bitterly nay he does not edmund agreed yet your cousin tom will keep his word he is a truly good christian rosamund whatever else he may be and you have found your own happiness at last so be generous of heart niece and forgive henry bolton i have and richard did long ago rosamund was thoughtful for a long moment and then she said if tom returns for christs mass and the feast days following it perhaps i shall invite my uncle henry to be with us more you the fool maybel said low he is a toothless dog wife edmund answered her even a toothless dog may be dangerous if he is rabid she snapped sharply if it would make you uncomfortable then i shall not ask him rosamund said soothingly to her old nursemaid nay maybel replied ill not be responsible for preventing you from making your peace with the old devil if you will make it hell be dead soon enough in early december a letter came to friarsgate from glenkirk brought by one of the leslie clansmen he was given shelter for the night and a hot meal dermid returned with him just in time for his sons birth rosamund sat down to read what her lover had written she would give the messenger a letter to return to glenkirk patrick wrote that his trip home had been uneventful his son had taken fine care of glenkirk in his absence he had already spoken to adam in confidence regarding their marriage his daughterinlaw anne was not told adam was agreeable to this match between his father particularly understanding that there would be no offspring due to his fathers condition he would however come with his father to edinburgh in the spring to meet rosamund the earl wrote to rosamund that because the winter was setting in he did not know if he might communicate with her again they would meet at an inn in edinburgh called the unicorn and crown on the first day of april they would visit the king at court and ask his permission to be wed in his own chapel by the young archbishop of st andrews alexander stewart they would then return to friarsgate while adam leslie rode north with the news of his fathers marriage in the autumn patrick and rosamund would travel to glenkirk for the winter months the earl spoke of his love for her and of how he missed rosamund his nights he wrote were long cold and dreary without her his days gray and gloomy he missed the sound of her voice her laughter he wished nothing more than to have her within his arms once again i will never love anyone as i love you sweetheart he concluded rosamund read the missive smiling with her happiness she turned to the clansman who had brought it have you been in the castles great hall lad aye mlady he replied and has the painting of the earl been delivered and hung it came in the summer when the earl be away lady anne were very surprised to see it it was nae hung until the master returned it be a fine painting so lifelike mlady all who see it say so rosamund nodded the painting of me in this hall was painted by the same artist she said aye the clansman said i can see tis similar i will be sending you home with a message for the earl rosamund told him thank ye mlady the messenger said and he went off with a servant to be given a sleeping space i must be in edinburgh on april first rosamund said oh mama must you go away again philippa protested would you like to come with me her mother inquired me philippa squealed excitedly go with you to edinburgh oh mama aye i should very much like to go with you i have never been anywhere in all of my life i did not go to king henrys court until i was thirteen her mother replied will i meet king james mama and queen margaret will we go to the scots court philippa demanded yes her mother said smiling we may even celebrate your ninth birthday there would you like that philippa philippas face shone with her approval you spoil her maybel said you must not spoil her children should be spoiled lord knows you did your best to spoil me though you forget it now rosamund teased the older woman gently i tried only to make up for henry bolton when you were a wee thing maybel defended herself i had no opportunity to spoil you once you were in hugh cabots charge for he enjoyed spoiling you himself god assoil his good soul aye god bless both hugh cabot and owein meredith rosamund responded the leslie clansman departed the following morning with a letter to his master from the lady of friarsgate her correspondence to him was much as his to her had been she had written of her loneliness without him a loneliness such as she had never known in all her life until now she had written of her daughters and of her estate of their preparations for winter and how they were waiting eagerly for toms return she told him that clavens carn had an heir at last and she closed by sending him her undying love and telling him how eager she was for their reunion on the first of april that she would bring philippa to edinburgh so both his only son and her eldest daughter could witness their marriage vows she put a drop of her white heather scent upon the parchment smiling as she did so on the twentyfirst of december st thomas day tom appeared back at friarsgate bringing with him her uncle henry the children swarmed about this favorite relation hardly noticing their greatuncle rosamund however was shocked henry bolton had indeed changed for the worse he was gaunt and his face wore a deathshead you are welcome at friarsgate uncle rosamund greeted him his almost colorless eyes fastened upon her am i he asked with just a touch of his old spirit he leaned heavily upon a carved cane lord cambridge would insist i come niece he has purchased otterly from me tom was right to bring you uncle rosamund replied i am told you are alone now and these festive december days should not be spent alone without family i was waiting only for tom to send to otterly for you henry smiled cynically the facial expression almost a grimace he nodded i thank you for your welcome niece come uncle and sit by the fire rosamund said lucy fetch master bolton a goblet of spiced hot cider she led him to his place seating him in a highback chair with a tapestry cushion your ride was cold and the dampness threatens snow i fear she took the goblet her serving girl brought and put it in his gnarled hand i thank you he said and he sipped gratefully at the hot cider slightly revived his glance swept the hall your daughters are healthy he noted they are she agreed the tallest one is your heiress he asked philippa aye she will be nine in april rosamund responded he nodded once more then fell silent the gnarled hand reaching out to stroke one of the hall dogs a greyhound which had come to his side rosamund moved away from her uncle she had thought that maybel exaggerated henry boltons state but the older woman had not her uncle was pitiful though she still sensed he could be dangerous if permitted they would see he did not have any opportunity to cause difficulty tom now hugged his cousin my dear dear girl he exclaimed it is so good to see you once again and to return to friarsgate my business in the south is concluded my cambridge estate is sold to a newly knighted gentleman who paid quite a premium to gain it otterly is now mine i did stop at court to pay my respects to his majesty the queen strives for another child now that scotlands queen is delivered of a fine laddie king henry is not pleased by his sisters successful accomplishment he speaks of her as if she had betrayed him personally and worse as treasonous to england when queen katherine gives him a son he will consider differently rosamund said remember hal never enjoyed being beaten at nursery games tom chuckled too true cousin but he would have spain to marry when many advised against it they have been wed several years now and no living heir or heiress to show for it a stillborn daughter and wee henry of cornwall born and died in the same year there has been no sign of a child in two years and there is his brotherinlaw scotland with six healthy bastards and a legitimate fair son for his heir nay our king henry is not a happy fellow how fortunate then that we do not have to have anything to do with his court rosamund said tom nodded now dear girl what of your handsome scots earl he asked patrick has returned to glenkirk but we are to meet in edinburgh on the first day of april tom we have decided that we will wed we will spend part of the spring the summer and the autumn here at friarsgate and the winters at glenkirk that way neither of us deserts our responsibilities rosamund explained patrick was most pleased with the way his son adam managed glenkirk in his absence i can hardly wait until the spring cousin and i shall bring philippa with me with us dear girl i do not intend you wed again without me in attendance he told her with a smile and what news from clavens carn has lady jean done what was expected of her and tom grinned wickedly at his cousin she birthed a healthy son in early october rosamund answered him a peddler returning to england brought word some weeks ago but logan hepburn has not communicated with you tom noted i would not expect logan to do so rosamund replied we did not part on the best of terms tom the night patrick and i were forced to seek shelter at clavens carn he fought with me and then drank himself into a stupor we did not see him the following morning before we left for which i was most grateful uncle tom uncle tom rosamunds three daughters were surrounding him what have you brought us their small faces were eager with anticipation tom swept banon up into his arms and kissed her rosy cheek she giggled happily glad to know she was still a favorite now my little lasses he said i have one gift for each of the twelve days of christmas for each of you but uncle philippa responded christs mass is not for another four days i know he replied eyes twinkling and so my little poppets you will have to possess your wee souls of great patience until then tis not fair banon who was six protested shame on you all rosamund scolded her daughters i cannot believe you are so greedy run along now and have your suppers philippa you will remain tom put banon down but not before giving her another kiss then he watched fondly as the two younger girls made their way from the hall they have grown even in the few months i was away he said rosamund nodded i know she said in the months i was away the same thing happened i dont ever want to leave my lasses again he took her hand and they sat together on a settle by the fire opposite them henry bolton dozed the greyhound now lying across his feet your uncle has found a friend tom observed god help the man for he has no others rosamund sighed i must forgive him his treatment of me as a child she said he is to be pitied i have not feared him since i was six and hugh took my care upon himself poor uncle henry arranging my marriage to hugh cabot was his downfall more your salvation tom chuckled and rosamund smiled aye she agreed so you are to be the countess of glenkirk dear girl he loves you deeply but you know that for you love him every bit as much tom said it seems so strange rosamund replied to have found such love as i have found with patrick how i wish he were here now tom gods blood i miss him more with each passing day i do not know if i can wait until april to see him again to marry him and be his wife his title i care naught for but i know i have never loved anyone as much as i love him tom shook his head i will admit that i have never seen such passion as i saw between you two i am glad you changed your mind cousin and decided to wed him you would never again be happy otherwise he will not live forever rosamund noted i will one day have to be without him but i care not i can think only of the months we have had together and the years we will have together we met just a year ago on the eve of christs mass tom even as poor logan hepburn was contemplating a marriage to you her cousin said why must everyone speak of logan hepburn rosamund asked him i do not love him i did not give him my promise to wed him i wanted no other husband in my life a year ago logan sought only a broodmare and the swift results of his eager couplings with mistress jean prove my point indeed they do her cousin agreed calmly i suppose we all speak of him because we expected that you would wed him eventually we thought you desired a bit of courting rosamund nothing more that when he had softened your heart you would agree to marry him did you feel nothing at all for the man at first he fascinated me she admitted but then his constant nattering about an heir began to seriously irritate me he never wanted me for myself tom i think mayhap he did her cousin said softly but he is a rough borderer and knew not how to express himself properly to you tis water beneath the bridge now rosamund said he has his son and i have my love we should both be content and happy tom i know i am henry bolton listened to their conversation eyes closed his breathing shallow so that damned hepburn from over the border had been so bold as to seek rosamunds hand at long last perhaps he had made a fatal error years back when the then lord of clavens carn had asked for the wench for his eldest son they would have taken her away from friarsgate and he would have been left with it he might even have offered the old lord a gold dowry in exchange for the estate he could have borrowed on the land to raise it but as his niece said twas water beneath the bridge and she bold creature had somehow attracted the attentions of a scots earl she would be a countess and her small daughter would be left at friarsgate when her mother went north if only he could find a way to contact his son henry if he could kidnap this new heiress and wed her to his son all should not be lost if he did not woo his son away from the wicked life he was now leading the lad would eventually end up at the end of the hangmans rope he must think on this henry bolton considered as he sat in his nieces hall eavesdropping rosamund kept a good christmas yule logs burned in the halls fireplaces the chamber was decorated with pine boxwood ivy and holly fine beeswax candles burned about the room for the entire twelve days and there were feasts each afternoon mummers from her estate came into the hall to entertain them there were roasted apples and gingerbread men to eat mulled cider and wine to drink there was a side of beef that had been packed in rock salt and roasted the friarsgate folk were invited into the hall each day and on the feast of st stephen rosamund gave every one of her people gifts of fabric small coins sugar creatures and in certain cases fishing and hunting rights to help them survive the winter months no one was overlooked in the celebrations especially annie and dermid their son had been born on the fourth day of december and rosamunds gift to them was the promised cottage tom was as good as his word he gave rosamunds small daughters gifts on each of the twelve days of christmas and so none of the trio be jealous of the others each days gifts were almost identical there were new leather boots one morning and new blue velvet gowns another there were fine leather gloves sewn with seed pearls gold chains one day jeweled ear bobs another pearl necklaces were tendered on the sixth day a packet of silk ribbons on the seventh there were small woolen cloaks trimmed with rabbits fur on the eighth day carved wooden balls and painted hoops on the ninth the tenth day brought little red leather saddles the eleventh day red leather and brass bridles and on the twelfth day of christmas each of rosamunds daughters was gifted with an animal for riding bessie and banon had white ponies banons beastie had a single black hoof and bessies had a black star on its forehead philippa was given a pure white mare just fourteen and a half hands high you are so very very generous to them rosamund said truly touched by his great kindness nonsense he protested what is my wealth for if not to purchase small fripperies to give pleasure to my girls you can hardly call your gifts fripperies rosamund laughed when you wed with your earl tom told her it is not likely we shall have another christmas together again particularly if you winter in scotland you will come to glenkirk at christmas she said quickly what he exclaimed looking quite horrified i think not dear girl you may enjoy a winter in your lovers highland eyrie but i should not he shuddered the very thought of it is most distressing that is just an excuse to avoid coming she teased him i will wager you will ride over the border most eagerly to stirling and king james christmas revels tom the scots king keeps a most merry holiday he admitted with a grin then his look sobered gods blood cousin i have forgotten to tell you when i stopped to see king henry in the autumn i met a fellow named richard howard he asked if i knew you i told him of course that you were my most beloved cousin rosamund paled he was the english ambassador to san lorenzo she replied i saw him at court after owein died but we were never introduced he thought he knew me when we met at the dukes palace in san lorenzo while i most assuredly knew who he was i was able to tell him honestly that we had never before met did he ask you any questions tom please think back i beg you he asked if you had been to court and i admitted you had indeed and that in fact you were a friend of the queens having been with her in your girlhoods and later after your husband died but he was too inquisitive and so i answered no more of his questions why are you concerned i did not want him to mention it to the king hal would consider it a fault that i visited san lorenzo in the company of a scots earl i fear i hoped he would not learn of it especially now that i am to marry patrick leslie i need no interference from our lusty king rosamund answered him nothing happened in san lorenzo that would have been of real interest to any king let alone henry tudor i think however lord howard felt the need to report something lest he be considered useless to his master the king said nothing to me tom responded if the purpose of lord leslies mission was not public then i believe you have no cause to fear i hope not rosamund replied you know how jealous hal can be tom changed the subject smiling at his cousin and saying i have a proposal to make to you dear girl while i have inherited great wealth there is still my grandfathers enterprise which supplies me with more funds each year you have said since your return that you would like to market your fine woolen cloth in france i believe we should go even farther than france i have not the wool for a larger market tom she answered him that is true but we can increase your flocks over the next few years while building a demand for the wool and particularly the friarsgate blue cloth he told her i cannot sit idle once otterly is rebuilt dear girl i need an amusement i think we should own a ship in which to transport the cloth abroad what do you think we could have a new vessel built in the shipyards in leith while we prepare it will take at least two years for us to make ready on all fronts my dear rosamund build our own ship she was thoughtful i have not the means for it tom of course you dont but i do he said calmly we shall be partners in this venture cousin i shall supply the vessel and any funding necessary you shall supply the wool and the labor it would appear that you are putting up more than i am rosamund answered him and we will need more sheep you must be the senior partner in such an undertaking tom we shall be equal partners he told her think on it rosamund while the initial outlay is mine afterwards most of the responsibility will fall on your shoulders besides you and your daughters are my heirs why should you have to wait until i am dead and gone to benefit from my largesse especially when we can build something together it is such a generous offer rosamund said it is my twelfth night gift to you dear girl he told her with a broad smile until you came along cousin i was but marking time my life was dull and seemingly endless after my sister died i had no one but then you entered my life i began to enjoy myself again i found new meaning i have a family once more we shall build this little enterprise of ours together rosamund now say thank you tom and agree with me rosamund burst out laughing thank you tom she responded i do agree with you friarsgate wool is finer than much of what i saw in france i do believe there is a market for it we shall make a market for it and by keeping the supply low at first we may keep the price high he chuckled gods blood there speaks the merchant in me the king and his court would be most horrified to hear lord cambridge speaking thusly he was wearing a most satisfied grin but then i never really was of noble blood he chuckled again i am amazed at you coming to settle back in cumbria rosamund said once i remember you telling me that it was beautiful but you wondered how i bore the lack of civilized company yet now you are willing to do so that was before my family reappeared he defended himself and i did keep the houses in london and greenwich we will go sometimes and the girls must one day visit the court we cannot have them growing up thinking friarsgate is the world even if it is the best part of it when are you beginning your reconstruction of otterly she asked him the house is being torn down now he said and the site will be cleared but we cannot begin building until the spring i shall start after your wedding to the earl what are we to do with uncle henry in the meantime she said i had a small but comfortable house constructed for him this autumn past he has been living there with mistress dodger the housekeeper i hired to look after him twelfth night is almost over cousin tomorrow we shall send uncle henry back to his own little nest it is time he is beginning to look too comfortable here at friarsgate and i find he asks too many questions i suspect for all his tale of woe he is yet in contact with his son henry the younger he has said to me that he wishes he might save this lad from a bad life and a worse end rosamund nodded i dont want him getting the idea that he might marry his son to one of my girls she said i would put friarsgate to the torch before i allowed that we will see his dreams have no basis in reality tom replied and yet i cannot help but feel sorry for him she answered still i am not quite able yet to forgive him my youth i do not really recall my parents but from the time they died and henry bolton came into my life i was miserable only when hugh came was i safe i want to be generous of nature to him tom but i just cannot be then do not he advised her edmund and richard have been almost saintly in their forgiveness but they did not suffer the brunt of henry bolton you did perhaps one day you will be able to forgive him but now is not the time rosamund took her cousins hand in her own and kissed it tenderly you are so wise tom if you are grateful for me i am doubly grateful for you the following day henry was transported in a comfortable covered cart back to his own home before he left he looked about the hall a final time seeing philippa he remarked your eldest is nine niece in april rosamund said why my henry is fifteen now a good age for marriage my cousin has become a thief hardly a match for an heiress rosamund said tartly she led him from the hall and a servant helped him into the cart tis only that he has no home any longer and his mams behavior broke his heart niece with a bit of good fortune he could become an upstanding man once again henry reasoned i wish him good luck then rosamund replied then she added but put from your mind any thought of a marriage between your son and my child my girls will marry with men of higher station their wealth will bring them that you would put friarsgate into the hands of strangers he demanded his color suddenly high this has always been bolton land as long as there were bolton sons it was bolton land rosamund reasoned with him but there are no more bolton sons uncle there is my son he told her in a hard voice and he will never wed with my daughter rosamund told him firmly she patted her uncles hand i am glad you came for the twelve days of christmas uncle i believe your visit has done you good you seem stronger than when you arrived farewell now and god go with you she turned and hurried back into the house she could feel her anger rising damn henry bolton and his spawn would the man never give up his quest for friarsgate no she thought not as long as he lived the winter set in about them the hills were white with the snows the lake froze for a short time rosamund tom and the girls bundled in their warmest capes and furs amused themselves sliding upon the icy surface of the water they celebrated candlemas on the second of february and at midmonth the ewes began lambing the shepherds watched over their flocks carefully there had been a rumor of a wolf in the district and the new lambs were an easy target put them in the barns at night rosamund ordered i will lose not a one we will purchase some of those shropshires youve wanted come spring tom said she nodded with her agreement aye i should like a flock of them tom the shortest month was quickly over and the hills began to show signs of life again greening slowly as the month progressed she had heard nothing more from patrick but then he had warned her it would be nigh impossible to get another message through to her it would take two days to reach edinburgh from friarsgate annie of course would not be able to come with her mistress her younger sister lucy had been being trained all winter to temporarily take her place and in future act as annies helper annie was disappointed but every time she looked at her infant son she realized she was more content to have her wee harry than to go with her mistress they had all been sewing thoughout the winter so that philippa might have two new gowns to take with her when she accompanied her mother the young girl had her mothers coloring one of philippas gowns was a medium blue velvet and the other was a rich brown philippa was so excited she could hardly remain still at the fittings she was also to have new chemises and caps the friarsgate cobbler made the young girl a pair of squaretoed shoes with round enamel buckles decorated with colorful paste jewels i have never had shoes like this she exclaimed excitedly when she was presented with them they are for edinburgh rosamund said youll be wearing your boots until we get there these shoes must last you a good long while unless of course your feet grow too quickly try not to let your feet grow philippa her mother cautioned spring now took hold at friarsgate with the ice gone from the lake and the white sheep dotting the green hillsides midmorning of the twentyeighth rosamund and her little party departed for edinburgh she had resigned herself to spending the night at clavens carn there was simply no way they could bypass it and reach decent shelter she sent a messenger ahead with her request for shelter and in late afternoon they reached their destination do try and behave dear girl tom teased her wickedly rosamund shot her cousin a fierce look i will if he will she replied and tom cackled with laughter they passed through into clavens carns courtyard to be met by a hepburn clansman who helped them from their horses and escorted them into the great hall jeannie came forward smiling to greet them rosamund bolton it is good to see you once again lord cambridge and who is this lovely lassie your daughter from the look of her she took rosamunds two hands in hers and kissed her on both cheeks then she gave her hand to tom who kissed it gallantly my dear lady he said you positively bloom i am pleased to see come sit by the fire and warm yourself jeannie invited them the spring is trying to gain hold here in the borders but it was still i will wager a cold ride she signaled to a servant and he brought a tray of mulled wine forth for her guests this is my daughter philippa meredith rosamund introduced her child to the lady of clavens carn philippa curtsied beautifully madame she said your eldest was the polite query aye rosamund answered her and your bairn jeannie nodded to a cradle by her side he sleeps she said he is such a fine laddie he shall have a brother come the autumn and her hand went to her belly proudly or a sister logan said coming into his hall lord cambridge madame he came to stand behind his wife nay logan tis another wee laddie i carry jeannie insisted this is my daughter philippa rosamund introduced her eldest you have grown somewhat since the last time i saw you mistress philippa logan said quietly there was nowhere else where we could break our journey my lord rosamund quickly said you are welcome he replied to where do you travel edinburgh rosamund said briefly mama is being married to the earl of glenkirk and i am to be her witness philippa said excitedly i have two new gowns and a pair of shoes with buckles how marvelous jeannie said what color are your gowns mistress philippa and shoes with buckles too one gown is blue and the other is a fine golden brown madame philippa replied what a lucky girl you are the lady of clavens carn responded smiling then she turned to rosamund the earl is the gentleman who traveled with you last summer aye rosamund answered her hes a finelooking man youll be a countess wont you jeannie smiled again but her husbands look was dark aye i will be but i do not wed him for his title rosamund said so you will desert friarsgate logan growled nay i will not nor will patrick desert his glenkirk we will spend part of the year in england and part of the year in scotland it is no different than others even the king with many estates and my daughters will be with me i have bought otterly from henry bolton tom quickly interjected before the conversation took a dangerous turn i tore the old house down and am just now beginning to build a new one which will be identical to his houses in london and greenwich rosamund said and she laughed my cousin dislikes change or discommoding his servants the same people serve him wherever he goes they however have spent the winter in the south without their master they have been quite busy tom defended himself doing what jeannie asked i have a passion for beautiful things tom explained consequently i have too many possessions for two houses i sent a list of what i wanted transported north to otterly and my servants have spent these last months collecting the items cleaning them and preparing them for their journey ah i see the lady of clavens carn replied then a servant came to her side and murmured in her ear the meal is ready now their hostess said let us to the high board lady rosamund please sit on my husbands right lord cambridge you will sit on my right and mistress philippa will be on my left she led them from their places before the fireplace to the great oaken table where the food was now being brought the meal was a simple but wellprepared one there was trout sautйed in butter and served with watercress a fat capon stuffed with bread apples and sage half a ham and a lovely game pie with a flaky crust the bread was fresh and warm there was cheese and butter to drink they were served an excellent brown ale and when the meal had been consumed a tartlet of winter pears in a wine sauce was brought forth you keep a fine table lady rosamund praised jeannie the young woman smiled i was well taught logan does enjoy a good meal as do his brothers i notice them missing rosamund said softly they are often late to table these nights the laird of clavens carn said their wives are jealous that i have such a fine son and even though they have bairns of their own now that i am again with child they seek to birth more bairns themselves jeannie giggled they are also not pleased that i have taken over the management of my household they were most lazy they flout my authority when they can but it is unforgivable they are not here to greet our guests logan the authority is yours and they will eventually bow to it rosamund said you have simply to hold your ground lady my wife does not need advice from you the laird growled logan his wife cried blushing for him the lady of friarsgate but meant to support me with her advice which is good advice i might add i tell you little of the rudeness and disrespect your brothers wives give me but be assured that if it were possible for them to have their own homes i should not be unhappy i did not realize jeannie he quickly excused himself i will correct the situation as soon as i may nay you did not know for i do not complain now ask the lady of friarsgates pardon my lord his wife instructed him nay nay rosamund quickly spoke up i realized the laird meant no harm he is but protective of his wife i understand my patrick would be the same way your pardon madame he said nonetheless and their eyes met rosamund nodded then she leaned forward to say to the lady of the keep we must leave you early in the morning madame might we be shown to our sleeping places now jeannie jumped up of course lady please follow me i think i shall remain in the hall a while longer tom called after them so logan said after the women were out of earshot she is going to marry her earl aye tom responded do you like him the laird asked aye i do came the answer he loves her deeply i have never before seen such passion between two people logan hepburn it is the right thing for both of them if you say it my lord the laird replied gloomily i shall always love her tom nodded i know that he said but fate has given you a good wife and god knows she is doing her duty by you two bairns in two years you can ask no more of the lass she is a gracious hostess and she is devoted to you i have never seen your hall look so fine be content none of us ever gets all that we want in this life havent you came the query tom laughed nay not until recently he admitted you mean to live at otterly i do indeed i sold my home in cambridge finding my family here has made a new man of me logan hepburn the laird nodded glumly family is important he agreed when is the wedding we will meet the earl and his son on the first of april at the unicorn and crown rosamund and patrick are hoping that the king will allow their marriage to be performed in his chapel by the bishop of st andrews the ceremony should be celebrated sometime in april when is your new bairn due in early autumn came the reply yon laddie is a fine boy tom noted for the first time logans face grew cheerful aye he is he replied enthusiastically he is very strong my lord why when he grips my finger i fear he will bend it and he smiles all the time he has obviously gotten his mothers sweet nature you are fortunate tom said quietly then he arose where am i to lay my head logan hepburn the laird arose tis a small chamber but one wall is against the chimney youll not be cold this night my lord and when he had settled his guest logan returned to the hall to sit before the fire his son was gone from his cradle a servant had obviously carried the lad to his mother for nursing he sighed deeply what the hell was the matter with him there was peace his lands prospered he had a sweet wife who was as fertile as a rabbit and already one son to follow him why could he not be content with his life but he knew the answer to his unspoken question he loved rosamund bolton he had always loved her and always would nothing else mattered to him it was a secret he must take to his grave for he would not hurt jeannie with his perfidy she was a good lass she was not the problem he was he asked himself again why it was he had not understood rosamund enough to know she needed to hear the words i really love you pressed by his family he had babbled about heirs instead of telling her that the very sight of her set his pulses racing that he could not sleep for the yearning he had for her and now she would wed once again yet she had told him once that she would never wed again what had changed her mind there could be only one answer and he knew it she really did love patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk loved him enough to leave friarsgate for part of each year the knowledge felt like a great weight on his heart why was it that she had loved patrick leslie at first sight but she would not love logan hepburn he had no answers to that question in the morning rosamund and her party departed clavens carn after breaking their fast and thanking their hostess let us know when you are returning and break your journey with us jeannie said graciously i shall look forward to seeing that handsome earl of yours again lady we will rosamund promised she could do nothing else she smiled and waved as they rode down the hill back onto the edinburgh road i do like the lady of clavens carn philippa said she was so nice to me she said when we come back i may hold the baby rosamund smiled at her daughter everything was so new and exciting for philippa i like the lady of clavens carn too she told her child the laird is very solemn isnt he philippa remarked i dont remember him very well mama was he always so grave i would not know philippa her mother said i do not know logan hepburn that well i cant wait to see uncle patrick mama i am so glad he is going to be our new father banon and bessie are too you know philippa confided you have discussed it amongst yourselves rosamund was surprised we are young mama but who you wed affects us as well philippa said wisely her mothers daughter tom murmured with a chuckle when will we get to edinburgh mama will we get there today philippa shifted in her saddle nay tomorrow tonight we will shelter at lord greys home he lives near the city but not quite near enough rosamund told her daughter scotland doesnt look much different from england philippa noted looking about them as they rode im glad we are not fighting them mama but what will happen if king henry does fight king james we will pray that that does not happen my child rosamund said but a shiver ran down her back she shook it off come on philippa ill race you to the top of the next hill and kicking her mount rosamund raced off her daughter in hot pursuit chapter they reached edinburgh on a chilly spring day philippa was wideeyed with this sight of her first city as was lucy who had traveled with them philippas mouth fell open as a boy with a tray of buns on his head raced past them there were women selling the first of the spring flowers and herbs there were women selling milk cream and eggs as well as freshly churned butter which was cut into chunks as their patrons desired there was a man offering cups of water for sale a poulterer with his crates of chickens a fishmonger pushing his barrow as he shouted his wares philippa meredith had never seen their like and she didnt know where to look next rosamund watched her daughter smiling at the childs amazement oh mistress look there lucy pointed at a group of gypsies who were performing acrobatics on the street for whatever coins they might garner or steal they rode past the gypsies turning into barley lane where the unicorn and crown inn was located in the courtyard stablemen ran forth to take their horses and tom paid the armed escort that had escorted them from friarsgate counting out the coins each man was to have and then buying them all a round of ale the menatarms thanked him then clattered out of the inns stone courtyard there were less expensive inns where they might spend their earnings rosamunds heart was racing was he here gods boots she was like a virgin with her first lovelorn swain but the truth was she longed for the sight of his handsome face they entered the unicorn and crown to be greeted by the innkeeper a tall thin man with a dignified stance welcome my lord and my ladies he greeted them bowing as he spoke has the earl of glenkirks party arrived yet lord cambridge asked they are waiting for you my lord allow me to escort you the innkeeper said his face impassive he led them down a narrow hallway opening the door at the end of it and ushering them inside i will fetch lord leslie at once he told them there is wine on the sideboard would the ladies desire anything special now please escort my daughter and my servant to our apartment master innkeeper rosamund said quietly she knelt a moment putting her arms about philippa i would greet patrick alone sweeting she told the child you understand yes mama philippa said dutifully following lucy and the innkeeper from the chamber i need some wine tom said it becomes chilly as the afternoon wanes he walked to the sideboard and poured himself a goblet from the pewter pitcher sipping it he noted why tis not halfbad dear girl will you have some and greet patrick with wine on my breath she said i think not cousin she arose and seated herself by the fireplace where a good fire was burning i shall warm myself this way for some minutes they waited in silence and then the door to the room opened and a gentleman stepped inside he went immediately to rosamund taking her two hands in his and kissing them i am adam leslie he said and you are my fathers rosamund he was tall and big as his father was his hair was a dark russet brown where patricks was a deep auburn but he had not his fathers deep green eyes adam leslie was blueeyed you are every bit as lovely as he claimed madame then he turned to greet tom you will be lord cambridge he said bowing tom bowed back his facile mind already asking the question he saw forming on rosamunds lips where is your father adam leslie why is he not here to greet me she asked he is here madame came the reply and you must be brave now for his sake what has happened her voice was shaking as she spoke adam sat down heavily in the chair opposite rosamund we arrived late yesterday he began i have never seen my father so eager to get to edinburgh he was like a lad we might have stayed the night several miles from the city yet nothing would do but my father reach the unicorn and crown so if you arrived early today you would not think he had not come the landlord served us an excellent dinner and then we retired for the night this morning my father awakened complaining of a sharp pain in his head he arose from his bed gave a loud cry and collapsed the physician is with him now rosamund jumped from her chair where is he i must go to him take me at once adam leslie she was pale and trembling with fear adam did not argue with her he stood and took her by the arm saying to lord cambridge will you come with us too my lord tom nodded following as adam leslie led them from the chamber where they had been seated down the corridor and up a flight of stairs opening the door to one of the inns guest apartments he ushered them inside almost immediately a very tall darkskinned gentleman in long white robes came forth from another room ah my lord you have returned he looked curiously at rosamund and tom this is the lady he queried aye this is my fathers betrothed wife master achmet adam replied this physician was sent by the king he explained to rosamund and tom how is the earl rosamund asked anxiously she was still very pale and could not contain the trembling that continued to afflict her seeing it the physician took her by the arm and seated her near the fire sitting next to her he took her hand in his his fingers wrapped lightly about her wrist his gaze thoughtful calm yourself madame he said in a quiet voice what has happened has happened your heart is racing too quickly and that is not good for you my lord would you pour the lady some of that wine when you have drunk a bit of it madame we will speak on the earls condition adam quickly filled a goblet and handed it to rosamund who drank deeply and then as she felt calmer turned her amber gaze to master achmet the earl the physician said has suffered a seizure of the brain he is yet unconscious he may awaken with no ill affects at all there seems to be no harm done to his limbs for they are quite supple he may awaken the ability to speak gone from him i have seen that in many cases he may awaken with his memory impaired or he may not awaken at all this is my prognosis madame have you bled him yet she asked bleeding would not be advisable in this particular case madame the physician said the earl will need all his strength to recover rosamund nodded when do you think he will awaken she asked i do not know madame was the honest answer i will nurse him myself rosamund said that would be best for his lordship the quality of women who purport to do nursing in this city is not at all good the physician agreed tom send a message to friarsgate maybel must come rosamund decided and we cannot remain here at the inn you have a house in edinburgh dont you i sent ahead to have it opened and aired lord cambridge replied i thought to let you and patrick have a few days to yourselves there after your marriage while i took young philippa to court and showed her the sights of the city when can the earl be moved rosamund asked master achmet i think it best he regain consciousness first the physician responded adamrosamund turned to patricks sonforgive me for giving orders without consulting you i am not yet your fathers wife will these arrangements suit you adam came and knelt down next to rosamund i know how much he loves you madame and i am content in the knowledge that you will take the best of care of him he took her small cold hand and kissed it gently thank you rosamund said simply she turned back to the physician what am i to do she asked him you must keep him comfortable and quiet moisten his lips regularly with water or wine if he is able to swallow give him wine to drink i will come twice daily to check on my patient madame if there is an emergency i can be reached either at the castle or at my house in the high street master achmet arose from his place by her side i will leave you now he said bowing before he departed rosamund was still wearing her cloak she stood and unfastened it laying it aside i want to see him now she said and walked past them into the earls bedchamber patrick lay upon the bed his eyes were closed his breathing shallow his skin pale yet he looked no different than when they had parted last october oh my love rosamund whispered softly as she sat upon the edge of the bed and took his hand into hers his hand was clammy and the limp fingers did not squeeze hers back patrick can you hear me she begged him oh god this cannot be do not take him from me from his son from glenkirk the man on the bed lay still and silent rosamund did not hear her cousin until he spoke to her what am i to do about philippa will you tell her or shall i he asked rosamund looked up at him her face stricken with her grief you must tell her tom if you will for i cannot i will not leave him now shall i send her home with lucy he wondered nay poor lass she was so looking forward to this trip we are here now you heard what the physician said patrick could awaken and be absolutely fine if i send her back she could miss the wedding and would not be able to visit the court you must take her to court tom and how did the king know of patricks illness to send a physician i would ask adam that he has already explained that to me tom said the earl had corresponded with king james in order that your marriage be celebrated in the chapel royal as soon as they got here last night patrick sent a message to the castle this morning when his father fell ill adam sent to the king for aid he is a good son rosamund remarked he is like his father tom responded it is too late to dispatch a messenger today rosamund said i will write to maybel myself but you must see my correspondence sent in the morning by the fastest means possible tom and we will move patrick as soon as the physician says we may he was an odd fellow wasnt he he is not a scot hes a moor tom told her another bit of information i gleaned from adam leslie his family was driven out of spain by king ferdinand and queen isabella they resettled themselves across the strait of gibraltar the physician has been visiting king james court he is a skilled doctor and a surgeon as well you know the king has begun a college for medicine here in edinburgh he feels a physician should be educated and that surgeons should not be barbers as well master achmet is skilled in diagnosing disorders of the brain he is famous for his knowledge king james hopes to convince him to lecture to the scots students it was fortunate he was here how do you obtain all this knowledge in so short a time she demanded of him tom grinned i have my own skills cousin he told her then he said come out into the dayroom now with adam your earl is comfortable for the moment you need not sit by his side constantly his lips are dry rosamund replied let me moisten them i will join you shortly she went across the bedchamber and dipped a clean cloth she found into the pitcher of fresh water sitting on the table beneath the window that looked out over the inns back garden the garden below was showing signs of green in many places after returning to patricks side rosamund wiped the cloth gently over his mouth several times he made no movement or sound at all rosamund felt tears beginning to fill her eyes she blinked and they ran down her cheeks impatiently she brushed them away as she bent and kissed his cold lips then she replaced the cloth by the pitcher and went out into the next room he is so still she said to adam his lips were beginning to dry i have moistened them looking about she saw her cousin was no longer there he went to seek out your little daughter adam said poor philippa rosamund responded she will be very distressed to learn her beloved uncle patrick is ill my girls love him very much he was always wonderful with my sister although she tried his patience greatly adam said you never found her rosamund answered him i am sorry i havent given up hope madame he told her i will seek her until i find her one day i shall then i shall bring her home she is fortunate having you for a brother adam leslie rosamund said my brother died when i was three i do not remember him or my parents my father has told me your history and of how you met he replied does your wife know about me yet rosamund inquired a small smile touched adams lips my father has told you of anne rosamund nodded but said nothing for she did not think it would be polite to say she had heard adam leslies wife was a shrew he laughed a short laugh she is difficult he admitted but it is just because she wants everything right i have a fair mistress who keeps me happy but anne keeps glenkirk in perfect order and she has given me three children i will ask no more of her nay she does not know of you madame for my father was not of a mind to spend a winter locked up with her carping at him about his age and the foolishness of a man of his years thinking he was in love like some green youth and of how a young woman would be interested only in his small wealth and title and how if he managed to give her a child another child would but lessen her childrens inheritance my father is as you know madame a wise man better my wife learn of you after the marriage is celebrated rosamund could not help but giggle at his recitation aye patrick is a wise man adam and i am certain he would want you to call me by my christian name will you please do so i will rosamund and gladly he told her tom had told philippa of lord leslies tragedy and nothing would do but that philippa come to her mother the little girl could not refrain from weeping but rosamund calmed her daughter will you remain in edinburgh with me child she asked her daughter your company will be a great comfort to me oh yes mama philippa cried i shall not leave your side rosamund smiled softly nay i will nurse the earl alone philippa but uncle tom would take you to court to meet the king and the queen it is important that you make that connection for one day queen margaret could aid you she is my oldest friend friarsgate needs friends on both sides of the border given its location you are my heiress it is your duty to make the most of this first visit to edinburgh i will be content by lord leslies bedside helping him regain his health when he is able child we will move to your uncle toms house here in town philippa nodded mayhap we will be there for my birthday she said i think we will rosamund agreed we are sending to friarsgate for maybel she will not be happy to have to travel mama philippa remarked rosamund laughed nay she will not be but she will come because i call her i hope uncle patrick gets well soon mama philippa said so do i my angel her mother concurred but patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk lay in a stupor for three days the crisis would come sooner than later the physician told rosamund in his unconscious state he was unable to swallow and his body was drying out for lack of liquid halfway through the fourth day the earl began to stir restlessly rosamund held a cup of water to his lips and while his eyes did not open and he did not give any other sign of consciousness he drank greedily until he fell back upon his pillows he will live master achmet pronounced upon learning of this new development but he is not awake rosamund said he is attempting to wake himself madame it may take another few days keep him comfortable and feed him watered wine rosamund followed the physicians instructions with adams help she kept the earls large body bathed and clean she saw that he was put in a freshly laundered linen shirt each morning and again each evening she changed his bedding daily patiently she held the pewter cup to his lips and coaxed him to drink a dozen times a day she slept by his side at night in case he should awaken or otherwise need her her devotion was commendable adam began to see what kind of woman his father had fallen in love with and desired to wed he found himself admiring rosamund at first adam had been concerned when his father had confided to him that he had fallen in love patrick had arrived home to celebrate his fiftysecond birthday adam was more concerned when he learned that rosamund was only twentythree it was true that marriages between many people of their class had a disparity of age between the bride and the groom but his father had been widowed for twentynine years while he certainly had a healthy appetite for female flesh he had never evinced the slightest desire to marry again but now his fathers face lit up each time he spoke to his son of rosamund each day during the winter adams father had written to his beloved these letters were now in a leather pouch that the earl had brought with them he wanted to share his winters loneliness with this woman he adored adam was finally convinced that his father was not in his dotage and that spending the remainder of his life with rosamund bolton was the right thing for the earl of glenkirk to do now he gave her the packet of letters but rosamund concerned with patricks health put them aside to read another time when adam met rosamund he knew instantly that his instincts had been sound she loved his father every bit as much as he loved her her concern for the earl and her tender care of him were real not once did she complain not once did she whine that now her wedding was to be delayed her sole reason for being it seemed to adam was his fathers wellbeing and eventual recovery and then master achmet said they might move the earl to lord cambridges house while he was not fully conscious yet he did appear stronger and able to make the short journey tom had purchased a house off the high street with a large garden in the rear that was now beginning to come into bloom the earl was carried in a litter from the bedchamber in which he had been residing into a covered cart rosamund was by his side and rode in the cart with him at lord cambridges house servingmen hurried forth to carry the litter inside and upstairs to the bedchamber where the earl would now rest he seemed none the worse for the transfer between the inn and the house rosamund was beginning to show her exhaustion but they could not convince her to leave patricks side and then maybel arrived from friarsgate as if my poor child hasnt had enough difficulty in life she announced as she entered the house where is she tom chuckled and even adam was forced to smile at the older womans words his sisters grandmother mary mackay had been much like maybel what maybel no greeting for me lord cambridge teased her good day to you thomas bolton maybel said and this fine fellow from the look of him is the earls son she curtsied my lord now where is rosamund she is upstairs and we are both glad you are here maybel tom said come before you see her and let us tell you what has transpired will you have a bit of ale i might if its good ale maybel considered as he led her into the houses small hall and settled her ah at last a seat that does not rock back and forth i am not a good traveler my lords she told them now tell me all adam leslie explained what had happened though rosamund had given maybel some idea in her message to friarsgate maybel listened and nodded as the tale unfolded has there been any improvement she asked when adam had finished he hasnt opened his eyes yet adam said but he is awakening you can tell it and he is able to drink rosamund has been feeding him like an infant she makes him a drink with wine eggs a bit of cream sugar and a bit of grated cinnamon stick or vanilla bean he seems to enjoy it for he drinks it all each time she gives it to him she also makes him egg custard and she gives him milk toast he is growing stronger maybel said every day came the hopeful reply maybel nodded is the physician bleeding him nay he said it is not necessary and would but weaken my father adam responded i never heard of not bleeding a patient maybel remarked is this a good physician have you consulted others he is the kings physician tom said and so you are not taken unawares he is a moor what is that maybel demanded suspiciously some foreigner ill vow aye he comes from spain and the king brought him to lecture at his college adam explained a jew maybel queried a mussulman tom answered her grinning an infidel maybel god have mercy on us all the old woman said crossing herself are you absolutely certain he is not out to murder the earl to maybels consternation both men laughed nay they told her with one voice he is the kings most trusted man maybel i swear it tom said well maybel allowed draining the mug of ale a servant had brought her while they talked if you says so my lord i must believe it she stood up now take me to my child they both escorted her upstairs to the earls bedchamber where rosamund sat she jumped up when maybel entered the room wordlessly hugging her old nursemaid thank god you have come she cried thank god and his blessed mother mary indeed maybel agreed i have never seen you so pale so worn you are to go to bed at once rosamund bolton and ill hear no nonsense about it i am here now and i will watch over lord leslie myself you will be no use to the man when he awakens if you continue on as you have where is lucy with philippa adam said have you a servant girl who can help me my lord maybel asked tom not one of those flighty lasses with little more wit than a post but a lass who can follow orders she looked at rosamund are you still here my lady i sleep by his side at night in case he should waken rosamund said well for now you will sleep in another chamber maybel said firmly next door tom quickly said to his cousin before she might protest and i will find a lass among the servants to help you maybel come rosamund he coaxed her taking her by the arm and leading her from the bedchamber well my lordmaybel looked straight at adamwhat think you of this adam shook his head i do not know he admitted i had hoped he would regain his full faculties by now the physician says however that it is not unusual and that he is making a little progress each day he believes he will open his eyes shortly and what think you of my lady adam leslie maybel asked directly i think she loves him desperately maybel i pray my father recovers so that they may marry and live their lives together adam answered honestly maybel nodded you are i can see like him at first i was not certain it was right i have been with rosamund since her birth her sweet mother was not strong i have protected her as best i could from those who would harm her she has been fortunate in her men both hugh and owein adored her and she them but her feelings for them were nothing like those for your father i have never seen the like of such a love i doubt few have to see them together was to see magic she concluded i know only that i have never known my father to be so happy in all of my life adam told her my mother died birthing me but it was said he had a fondness for her he has never remarried yet when he speaks of your mistress maybel his whole face is alight and shines with his love for her his happiness is palpable maybel smiled at adam aye you are like him she repeated now get you gone and i will watch over your father while my mistress gets a welldeserved rest he smiled back at her and after bowing he left her alone with his father well maybel thought to herself and isnt this a pretty mess patrick leslie appeared to be sleeping his breathing even and quiet maybel shook her head the earl had been in an unconscious state for more than a full week was it indeed possible he would recover she had full intentions of questioning the doctor thoroughly when he came in the evening maybel sat down by the earls bed poor man she thought rosamund lay down in her gown fully expecting to wake in a few hours time instead she did not open her eyes for almost twentyfour hours when she did lucy was in her bedchamber preparing a bath the tub had been set before the fireplace and tendrils of steam arose from the scented water what time is it rosamund asked her sleepily why tis just shortly past the noon hour my lady lucy replied politely how long have i been sleeping rosamund demanded practically a full day i believe my lady maybel said to prepare you a bath and wake you now lucy curtsied where is philippa lord tom has taken her to the castle my lady he said it was past time the lass met the queen lucy was most chatty rosamund arose quickly crossing the floor to open the door between her chamber and the sick chamber maybel was sitting by the earls bed knitting why did you allow me to sleep so long rosamund said halfangrily as she moved into the room she went to patricks bed and felt his forehead it was perfectly cool to the touch ill sit with him now she told maybel nay youll bathe yourself rosamund bolton for never have i known you to stink and you do wash your hair too when you are clean put on fresh garments and then you will eat something after that you may come and sit by your beloved but not until then my lass for a moment rosamund considered arguing with maybel but then she saw the futility in it there was no emergency patrick was comfortable he had no fever nor was he restless he had already survived a day without her an hour more would not matter yes maybel she said meekly maybel barked a sharp laugh well i am glad to see you still know how to bow to the proper authority she teased rosamund returned through the door connecting the chambers with lucys aid she divested herself of the clothing she had been wearing for almost ten days she had never in her life she realized taken so little care of herself and her person she was surprised that tom had said nothing for he was the most fastidious person she had ever known in all her life she climbed into the oak tub and the sweet water surrounded her easing aches she hadnt even realized she had she sighed warm the drying sheets by the fire lucy she instructed the girl and then she began washing her long auburn hair with the perfumed soap lucy rinsed her mistress tresses after each washing and then wrung the water from the hair and pinned it up for her mistress rosamund now began a serious cleansing of her person she was shocked to see how much dirt she had collected but then she realized that from the moment she had arrived there had been no time to remove the dust of her travels she climbed from the tub at last lucy wrapping her in a drying sheet then sitting by the fire she let the girl wipe the water from her arms her legs and her shoulders give me my hairbrush lucy its here my lady lucy answered her handing the brush to her mistress rosamund unpinned her hair and began to brush her long locks free of the remaining water her head turned to the fire to aid in the drying process and when her hair was dry again with lucys help she dressed in clean garments almost embarrassed at how she had let herself go what if patrick had awakened and seen her looking no better than some dirty slut from the streets her fingers smoothed the orange tawny velvet of her gown she braided her hair up and tucked it beneath a matching cap with a pretty gold trim then adjusted her tapestried girdle about her waist mistress maybel says you are to eat now my lady lucy said ive already instructed the kitchen for you i have but to pull this bell cord and the meal will be delivered she yanked on the cord tis a marvelous invention my lady aint it indeed it is lucy rosamund agreed perhaps we should see if we can install such a device at friarsgate then perhaps you wouldnt linger in the kitchens so long oh my lady lucy blushed a servingman knocked upon the chamber door and entered with a tray after handing it to lucy he moved the tub away from before the fire drawing forth a small table from its place against the wall setting it before the chair he took the tray back from lucy and put it down upon the table then with a short bow he exited the room rosamund sat at the table and began to eat she was not surprised by her good appetite for she had scarcely eaten since they had arrived in edinburgh the cook had sent her up a dish of four fat prawns that had been steamed in white wine she devoured them before they cooled on her plate was a thick slice of beef a slice of rabbit pie with a wonderfully flaky crust a breast of roasted capon a slice of ham an artichoke and some new peas rosamund ate it all mopping the gravy and juices on her plate with pieces of freshly baked bread that she tore from the small loaf on the tray she finished the bread smearing it with butter as she did lucy watched wideeyed and when her mistress had eaten everything on the tray she removed it to the sideboard and refilled her ladys cup with more wine rosamund sat silently for several minutes and then she arose i am going to the earl now she said and she crossed her chamber to enter his room maybel looked up ah she said with a smile you do look rested and clean now he has been restless today but he seems well otherwise she arose i will now take a bit of ease for myself i am not as young as i once was my child rosamund put her arms about maybel and embraced her thank you she said for what maybel demanded you are my lady my child you needed me and i came i will always come rosamund but i know how you dislike travel even as i once did rosamund responded maybel chuckled tis true lass but this trip was not as bad as going down to london and ive always wanted to see this city then she patted the younger woman rosamund moved to the earls bedside and leaned over to feel his forehead he had no fever she caressed his dark hair lovingly and as she did his nose began to twitch he sniffed quite distinctly several times he had never before done that then suddenly his eyes opened they were not at first focused but they were open his hand reached up to fasten about her wrist rosamund gave a little cry of surprise then she said maybel get adam leslie the earl is awakening maybel rushed from the bedchamber calling to adam as she went my lord my lord your father is awakening come quickly adam had been in the hall below he took the stairs two at a time almost knocking over the older woman as he dashed into the bedchamber to join rosamund at his fathers side the earl of glenkirks eyes were beginning to focus and seeing his son he said adam what has happened you have been ill father the young man answered him i think now you will get well thanks to rosamund she has barely left your side these ten days rosamund the earl looked confused yes patrick my love it is i rosamund said almost weeping with her joy the confusion on patricks face deepened finally he said do i know you madame it was as if an icy hand had plunged into her chest and gripped her heart unable to help herself she let the tears roll down her cheeks she pulled free moving away from the bed for she could not bear the sight of the confusion on his handsome face he does not know me she whispered softly to no one in particular maybel grasped her hand the moor said his memory would come back slowly when he regained his senses my baby he has just woken up lord adam is his son he would remember his son first be brave i cannot bear it if he doesnt remember me rosamund cried you will bear what you must maybel replied you cannot run from this my child and you have never been a coward now the earl had just opened his eyes give him a chance to assemble his memories surely the ones he made with you are so precious that he will not have forgotten them rosamund drew a long deep breath then she said we must send for master achmet i agree adam said coming to her side hes tired and yet confused let him rest a bit now that his consciousness is restored to him it will be all right rosamund he took her in his arms to comfort her the feel of those strong arms about her broke her control rosamund began to weep as if she would never stop i shall die if he does not remember me she sobbed adam said nothing there was nothing he could say that would possibly comfort rosamund he recalled what master achmet had said that first day that his father might regain all of his memory part of it or none of it if he did not die he was himself anxious to know how much his father recalled but at least his father had remembered him adam knew he would himself have been devastated had his father not remembered him he could feel rosamunds anguish in not being recognized his arms tightened about her certainly his father would eventually remember this woman he loved for a brief moment it was she thought like being in patricks arms again she sighed softly thinking if she but raised her head it would be he and he would smile down into her eyes and kiss her patrick she murmured you must cease this caterwauling at once maybels strong voice said rosamund was immediately yanked back to reality she was not in patrick leslies arms she was in adams he was doing his best to comfort her she was to be his stepmother she sniffled several times and was able at last to bring about an end to her weeping she straightened herself moving gently from his embrace i am sorry she said quietly i did not mean to cause such a fuss adam reaching up she patted his cheek thank you for your kindness then pivoting she went back through the connecting door into her chamber she turned before closing the door will you let me know when the physician arrives wordlessly he nodded he found himself a bit shocked by the reaction he had experienced when holding her in his arms had maybel not been in the chamber he realized he would have been tempted to raise her lovely tearstained face and kiss it it is a natural reaction my lord maybel said how can a man not want to comfort a beautiful woman when she cries so piteously i wanted to kiss her he said quietly well of course you did maybel answered him twas the most natural thing in the world a pretty woman in distress what man wouldnt want to kiss away her sorrow maybel patted his arm she is to marry my father he groaned all the more reason to want to comfort her maybel reasoned now adam leslie send for the physician and put this innocent lapse from your mind she pushed him from the room and went back to sit by the earl of glenkirks bedside he lay sleeping a most natural sleep now pray god he remembered rosamund when he next awoke had the lass not had enough misery in her life the physician came and the earl was awakened he is still weak master achmet said but he is most assuredly past the worst of it the king will be well pleased when i tell him and his memory adam asked he does not seem to recall everything it may come or not the moor said inscrutably he does not remember me rosamund said desperation in her voice master achmets dark eyes were sympathetic as he spoke with her i cannot imagine forgetting a lady such as yourself madame but it is possible he will not remember still he has just now awakened give him a little time then he turned to adam i believe my lord that i can confine my visits to this house now to once daily he bowed himself from the room as he said it when tom returned from his visit to court with philippa the young girl was filled with excitement for what she had seen and whom she had met the queen says i look like you when she first knew you mama philippa said rosamund smiled wanly indeed my daughter she replied spiritlessly run along now poppet and tell lucy of your adventures tom said he had seen at once his cousins malaise when philippa had skipped off he said what has happened dear girl you look positively halfdead patrick has awakened she told him that is wonderful news he exclaimed he does not remember me rosamund said that is not wonderful news lord cambridge said what am i to do tom i cannot marry a man who does not know me rosamund was positively distraught i saw the physician departing as we returned lord cambridge said what has he to say about the matter he says that patrick may or may not regain all of his memories tom god in heaven i cannot bear it if he has forgotten me i will die i will die without him tom sighed he remembered that both rosamund and patrick had said when they had first met that while their love would endure they would eventually be separated he had thought at the time that rosamund was being rather dramatic but now he considered that they both might have had a premonition still their passion for each other had led them to believe they might remain together and now this it was eerie and there was nothing he might do to comfort her the queen wants to see you he said i cannot see her now rosamund cried you cannot leave edinburgh without paying your respects she has been patient with you because of patricks illness but the physician will tell the king that the earl is now awake the queen will therefore decide you must come to her soon and you must cousin philippa charmed them both she sat on the floor of the queens privy chamber and played with the little prince who has begun to toddle today was his first birthday your daughter when she was told it immediately took off the little gold chain she was wearing and placed it about prince james neck it was a gracious gesture and much appreciated by both their majesties philippa has all the right instincts to please the high and the mighty i think we may have to take her to henry tudors court in another few years i do believe dear girl we may snag a noble husband for her rosamund looked at him bleakly he does not know me she said again be patient tom counseled her gently he could almost feel the pain she was experiencing be brave you have always been i know rosamund answered him but i love him tom i have never before really loved anyone like this i do not expect to love again if ever like this if he does not remember me remember us what am i to do we will cross that water when we come to it cousin he replied it is all we can do in this situation she nodded slowly at first rosamund was unable to go back to nursing the earl but then tom and adam convinced her that if patricks memory was to be jogged she must be with him as much as she could it was difficult however for he treated her like a complete stranger he was polite but distant you had us all quite frightened she told him one afternoon in late april i wonder what made you finally open your eyes my lord we had almost given up hope i smelled white heather he told her and rosamund remembered that she had bathed and washed her hair that day with her scented oils and soaps which were all perfumed with white heather did you you wear it he noted aye i do she said remembering how he had always loved the scent even bathing in it when they were in san lorenzo but that afternoon it was particularly strong he replied i had just bathed she responded my son tells me we are to marry he told her we were she said you do not wish to marry me now madame his look was curious how can i marry a man who does not remember who i am rosamund asked him if your memory does not revive itself my lord there will be no marriage you do not wish to be a countess he asked rosamund laughed almost bitterly i was not marrying you to become a countess my lord and before you ask it i was not marrying you for wealth i have wealth of my own nor were you wedding me for my wealth then why were we marrying i have a grown heir and two grandsons i need no other bairns he said you cannot have any more bairns my lord a fever burned your seed lifeless many years ago so there were other things he did not recall of his past we were wedding because we loved each other she told him i had fallen in love at my age he laughed but then he saw the stricken look upon her lovely face and he said forgive me madame it seems so odd to me that a man of my years should fall in love with so beautiful a young woman and you returned my love i did we spent last winter together and you came back with me to friarsgate in early summer it was there we decided to wed we would spend the spring and summer and early autumn there in late autumn and winter we would live at glenkirk she explained you believed that adam had done so fine a job managing your lands in your absence that you might trust him completely now though you say it is so and i believe you i can recall none of it he said to her and you do not remember going to san lorenzo last winter for the king she said nay i do not he replied i would never have gone back to san lorenzo twas there that my darling daughter janet was taken from me nay i would not go to san lorenzo and yet you did because the king needed your help and you are his loyal servant rosamund said we spent a wonderful winter and early spring there our servants dermid and annie wed there with our blessing dermid more is married he was genuinely surprised then he asked her what did jamie stewart want of me that he sent me back to san lorenzo my king was harassing your king into joining what is called the holy league rosamund began since the purpose of this alliance is against the french your king would not join he sent you to san lorenzo in hopes you might weaken the alliance once you had spoken with the representatives of venice and the holy roman empire did i succeed the earl asked nay but while king james suspected you would not he felt he had to try we stopped in paris on our way home to reassure king louis of scotlands fidelity rosamund finished you recall none of this he shook his head nothing madame i cannot believe i went back there you were reluctant she told him but we did go and we were happy together in san lorenzo there was a long awkward silence and then he said i am sorry madame that my memory seems to have fled me what is the last thing you recall my lord she questioned him again he shook his head i was i think at glenkirk he told her then he asked what year is this madame it is april in the year of our lord fifteen hundred and thirteen my lord rosamund told him and we are in edinburgh he looked genuinely surprised fifteen hundred and thirteen he repeated i thought it was the year fifteen hundred and eleven madame i seem to have lost two years of my life but i believe i remember most of the rest of it i am glad for that my lord rosamund said softly she blinked back the tears she felt pricking at her eyelids weeping would change nothing when he asked her do you think i shall be well enough to return to glenkirk i believe we must ask master achmet rosamund responded i do not like these darkskinned moors he noted a darkskinned slave betrayed my daughter he is highly thought of by the king rosamund answered him the king sent him to you when you fell ill my lord his care of you and advice have been excellent she arose from her seat by his bedside i think my lord you had best take your rest now i shall leave you i am being treated like an old man he grumbled i think you are well rid of me madame when shall i be able to leave this bed of mine we shall ask master achmet that too when he comes today rosamund repeated as she slipped from the room outside in the hallway she sighed his memory of the last two years was not returning and her hopes for their reunion were slowly fading she felt hollow and more alone than she had ever felt in her entire life and the casual words he had spoken saying she was well rid of him had been like a blow to her heart philippa meredith turned nine years old on the twentyninth of april the earl of glenkirk was allowed into the hall for her birthday dinner he had been walking about his bedchamber for several days now and his physical strength seemed to be returning the little girl was shy of the earl now for he considered her a stranger it was difficult for her to understand but her manners were impeccable in the stress of the situation everyone forgot rosamunds twentyfourth birthday on the thirtieth of the month plans were now being made for the leslies to return to glenkirk and for rosamund and her family to go home to friarsgate lord cambridge escorted his cousin to see the queen margaret tudor had been advised of the state of affairs she held out her two hands to rosamund as her old friend entered her privy chamber there was nothing even she could say she knew that could help the situation the two women embraced i pray you never know such sorrow and pain as i do now rosamund told her he remembers not at all the queen said almost everything up until two years ago master achmet says it may all come back eventually it is the best i can hope for meg they were alone i will pray for it and for you dear rosamund the queen said prince james was brought and displayed for the lady of friarsgate he was a healthy and ruddylooking little boy but rosamund saw little of the tudors in him finally her visit at an end rosamund took her leave of the queen there will be war soon meg said keep safe dear rosamund do you really think so rosamund replied the queen nodded my brother will not listen to reason he is as ever stubborn he is forcing scotland to the wall over this damned holy league she sighed you should be safe but keep watch she pulled a ring from her finger if scots invade your lands show them this ring and say the queen of scotland gave it to you and says you are to be free of harassment rosamund felt tears fill her eyes thank you your highness she said addressing margaret tudor queen of scotland formally damn she cried so easily these days the two women embraced a final time and then rosamund backed from the queens privy chamber and departed the royal residence chapter rosamund returned to her cousins house it was the second day of may and preparations were now well under way for their departure on the morrow both parties would be leaving in the morning the leslies would be going northeast to glenkirk the boltons would travel southwest to friarsgate adam knew how devastated rosamund was and how she strove to hide it from them all especially her little daughter he sat together with her in the hall after everyone else had gone to bed if he remembers i will send to you adam promised her my instincts tell me he will not remember rosamund replied when your father and i met it was as if lightning had struck us from that first moment our gazes joined we knew that whatever had been between us in another time and place must once again be between us but we also had a knowing a foreboding if you will that we would not be allowed to remain together in this life as our love for each other grew even greater however we pushed that shared premonition into the back of our minds we pretended that it was simply we did not know how to do our duty to both glenkirk and friarsgate if we wed and then we resolved this difficulty which allowed us to plan our marriage but fate will not be denied adam leslie patrick and i were not meant to be forever more and fate has once again taken a hand in the matter she sighed your father will live out the rest of his life without ever remembering those glorious months we had together or how passionately we loved each other i on the other hand will never forget that is my punishment for attempting to defy fate rosamund concluded sorrowfully he could remember adam insisted she smiled sadly how like your father you are she told him then she rose from her place and left him alone in the hall the morning came once again they gathered in the hall to break their fast and afterwards both parties found themselves ready to depart it was an awkward moment finally rosamund walked over to the leslies she held out her hand to adam who kissed it the earl gave rosamund a brief smile i thank you for your care of me madame he said as he too kissed her gloved hand reaching up she touched patricks handsome face farewell my love she whispered her eyes scanning his face a final time for something anything there was nothing rosamunds hand fell to her side and she turned and walked through the front door to where her horse was waiting mounting it without assistance she heard tom and philippa behind her offering their goodbyes they joined her finally and their party moved off down the lane and into the high street adam leslie watched them go watched as they turned into the high street you remember nothing father nothing nothing patrick leslie earl of glenkirk said i wish i did for she is lovely but i do not i should have been cheating her had i pretended otherwise then he walked from the house and mounted his horse let us go home adam it seems i have been away from glenkirk forever tom had hired two dozen menatarms to escort them home once on the road rosamund became more visibly anxious to reach friarsgate the first day she forced the pace refusing to stop until the sun had set and the land was enshrouded in twilight she had passed the comfortable inn tom had meant them to stay in and now they bedded down in a farmers barn with no supper you cannot treat the men this way he told her halfangrily i must get home she insisted i will die now if i do not get home philippa should not be sleeping in a hayloft rosamund he said and we have had nothing to eat dammit give the farmers wife something and she will feed you rosamund replied tom swore a long string of rather colorful oaths beneath his breath rosamund laughed why cousin she said i did not think you knew such wicked language the laugh had been hard in the morning tom paid the farmers wife more coin than she had ever seen to feed them all she willingly complied though the fare was simple rosamund barely ate at all and she demanded that they all hurry we have a long days ride ahead of us she said and she mounted her animal and rode off ahead of them without being told two of the menatarms leapt upon their own mounts and hurried after her while the rest of them finished their meal before departing what the hell is the matter with her tom asked maybel as they rode friarsgate is where she gains her strength maybel answered her strength is almost gone with her anguish she will ride her horse into the ground to reach home before her will dies on her neither philippa nor lucy nor you can keep such a pace he said i will do what i have to philippa and lucy are young we will all survive just knowing that friarsgate is awaiting us maybel told him they rode on at the noon hour he insisted that they stop at a comfortable inn to rest the horses he told her then he ordered a large meal for them all including the menatarms for he knew she would ride until they could no longer see the track ahead of them he also knew that they were approaching the border we can stay the night at clavens carn he told rosamund she looked coldly at him no she said i will not stop at clavens carn then break our journey here today you almost rode us into the ground yesterday tom pleaded no she said again we can get past clavens carn and then by noon tomorrow we will reach friarsgate tom there is no place between friarsgate and clavens carn where we may stay he shouted at her we can bed down in a field she replied you would ask maybel lucy and philippa to sleep in a pasture his face was flushed with his anger if you hadnt made us stop to indulge everyone with food and drink we might have gotten even closer to home today rosamund said ignoring his outburst you have gone mad he accused her i want to go home tom what the hell is the matter with that nothing as long as you dont kill us all getting there rosamund we will stay at clavens carn tonight and that is final you may stay at clavens carn i will not she told him implacably the day which had begun fair now clouded up with typical springlike contrariness by sunset a light rain was falling and clavens carn loomed ahead its two towers piercing the graying twilit sky ahead is where we will overnight tom told the captain of his menatarms send a man ahead to beg shelter for the lady of friarsgate before they close the gates yes my lord the captain said signaling to one of his men to go the laird will not refuse us hospitality tom murmured to maybel nay nor will his wife maybel said but i warn you now that your cousin will fight you in this matter i have known rosamund all her life and when she sets her mind to something nothing will prevent her from enacting her will still i have never seen her quite like this before i think if there were a border moon she would travel on this night the horses will not stand the pace he said then try and reason with her maybel told him tom spurred his mount ahead in order to ride apace with his cousin rosamund be reasonable i beg of you he began she stared straight ahead if you will not have mercy on those who travel with you consider the horses they cannot be ridden without rest we can rest when we are past clavens carn and over the border she said stonily it is not dark yet tom we can make several more miles before the darkness sets in and obscures the track he grit his teeth struggling to maintain an even tone with her i should not disagree if the weather would cooperate but with every moment the rain grows heavier it will be one of those allnight spring rains cousin you cannot ask maybel lucy and your daughter to ride through the night in the pouring rain and again i beg you to consider the animals how will we see the road when the darkness falls there is no moon on a rainy night if we do not shelter at clavens carn we will be forced to spend the night out in this weather if any of us catches an ague it could kill us we will have men with torches light the path for us she said implacably i know you mourn rosamund he began but she waved him away stop at clavens carn if you must tom but i have to go on she told him what does it matter if we stop he demanded his voice now showing his anger and impatience with her we will still not reach friarsgate until tomorrow i will reach it earlier if i travel farther today you have truly gone mad he said and after turning his horse about he rode back to where maybel plodded along in the line she says we may stop but she will go on he reported his face was red with his frustration maybel could not help but laugh do not trouble yourself over it my lord let her believe she is going on tonight we will ask the lord of the keep to ride after her and convince her to return and seek shelter he will do it he has never stopped loving her despite his good wife she hates logan hepburn tom exclaimed if he said come she would go if he said turn right she would turn left true true maybel agreed but i suspect that because he loves her he will not allow her to remain in the storm even if she insists she will he will bring her to shelter never fear and maybel chuckled again you are a most devious old woman tom said admiringly and i never until now realized it i know my child maybel told him they had reached the path that turned off up the hill to the border keep of clavens carn rosamund brought their party to a halt as the manatarms they had sent ahead came riding down the hill the laird and his wife bid you welcome he told them rosamund turned to the captain of the menatarms all but two may go with my cousin daughter and the women she told him i will want torches to light the path for me as i must go on as long as i can tonight the captain shook his head lady he told her we were hired to escort you home and that we will do but i will not expose my horses to certain death if you ride them through the night without proper shelter food and rest i will give you new horses rosamund told him you will kill my men he replied the answer is nay look about you the hills are already shrouded in mist that will turn to fog before long you will not be able to make enough headway to matter before you cannot even see the path before you with a light take shelter here i will not stop now rosamund said give me a torch and i will travel on by myself tom thought his head was going to explode but remembering what maybel had advised he said to the captain let her have a damned torch my lord the man protested but then he grew silent at lord cambridges look yes my lord he said and then he handed rosamund his own torch lady he pleaded take shelter i beg you ignoring him rosamund moved slowly forward passing them and disappearing into the mist until only a pinpoint of light from her torch could be seen tom led them up the hillside to the keep in the courtyard logan was there to greet them despite the rain he quickly scanned the group and the disappointment in his eyes was evident when he did not see rosamund lord cambridge saw it and dismounting heavily from his horse he said we must speak now quickly and privily logan hepburn the laird did not argue instead beckoning his guest into the keep with the rest of their party inside logans wife was waiting to greet the guests and she led them into her hall while logan moved off with tom in a small room the laird called his library they spoke without sitting what has happened i will try and make this tale as brief as i may tom began when we reached edinburgh we discovered that the earl of glenkirk had suffered a seizure of the brain he was lying near death at the inn the king sent a skilled moorish physician of his own and between this doctor and rosamund the earl was saved but alas his memory was impaired he could not remember the last two years of his life at all do you understand logan hepburn what i am saying he did not remember rosamund the laird said his voice a mixture of both regret and joy she nursed him faithfully for a month until he was strong enough to return home but under the circumstances there could be no marriage tom concluded she is filled with sorrow and anger and tonight as we seek shelter here at your home she rides on alone for friarsgate in the storm jesu mary the strong oath exploded from his mouth tom restrained the smile threatening him maybel had been right are you telling me she is out there in the rain alone are you mad to allow her to do such a thing the laird of clavens carn roared we could not stop her i fear tom said mildly she is a determined woman and friarsgate is her strength she needs to get home but she does not need an ague it could kill her he exclaimed perhaps you might reason with her logan hepburn tom said i would sooner reason with a she wolf he growled but she cannot be allowed to endanger her life even in her grief i will fetch her you will go into the hall and explain all of this to my lady wife that she may be prepared for your cousins arrival which will not be a peaceful one i fear thank you logan hepburn lord cambridge said quietly logan laughed a short laugh you knew i would go after her maybel knew he replied they returned to the hall where their party was already warming themselves by the fireplaces logan went to his wife murmured something in her ear and then departed the company leaving tom behind to explain he called to a servant to bring his cloak and outside in the courtyard his horse was brought after mounting it he took up a torch and cantered through his gates out into the stormy night at the bottom of the hill he turned onto the track leading over the border and into england the fog was beginning to thicken now and he was forced to move slowly it was growing dark as well she had the advantage of a quarter of an hour on him but he would catch up with her and return her to clavens carn his horse moved cautiously but steadily forward and where the fog and mist lifted in certain places the animal moved a bit more quickly finally logan saw the faint glow of her torch ahead of him for a time he seemed to gain no momentum as he moved towards it but then the fog lifted briefly where he rode and he hurried his horse along the distance between them grew smaller he had been following after her close to an hour now he could almost see her horse now he kept moving until once again he was given the advantage of a clear track rosamund was directly ahead of him in the rain but she did not hear him for the thunder now beginning to rumble he rode up abreast of her but she was concentrating so hard on the road beneath her mounts feet that she didnt see him at first so madame you are as stubborn as ever logan said even as he reached out to halflift halfpull her from her horse placing her before him on his his arm tightened about her waist like a vise as she immediately began to struggle rosamund had shrieked with surprise not just a little frightened at the sound of a male voice and then her removal from her horse to her captors she quickly realized in whose company she was let me go you damned villain she yelled you have led me a merry chase madame but you will return with me to clavens carn i will not she punched at him in an effort to release his hold on her person logan hepburn sighed i know what happened you virago i am sorry if you had married me in the first place none of it would have happened i didnt want to marry you she told him furiously why could you not understand that i wasnt ready to remarry all you could do was babble on like some damned brook about needing an heir you made me sound like breeding stock i didnt mean it that way i thought you understood i loved you still love you i assumed because you had children you would welcome the opportunity to give me an heir as you gave owein meredith heirs for friarsgate he yelled back at her he turned his mount and was relieved to see hers turn and follow him you assumed no you damned borderer you presumed you did not ask you told me what you would do what you wanted you never said you loved me and hoped that i would be the mother of your children nay you told me that you would come and wed me on st stephens day and that i would give you heirs you never asked me what i wanted logan hepburn now put me down and let me be on my way nay madame you will return to clavens carn with me if it takes us all night to get there you will eat a hot meal and you will sleep in a dry bed and your horse will get his rest dammit he told her bah you have learned nothing have you there you go once again telling me what i will do she shouted well i wont you arent my lord and master rosamund shut up he roared and then unable to help himself he kissed her mouth hard his head spun as the familiar white heather fragrance she wore rose up to envelop him with its subtle but powerful scent rosamund yanked her head away from his slapping him with her free hand as she did but she was finally stunned into silence she had not been kissed since patrick leslie had kissed her why was it that men she didnt want were always kissing her they rode slowly on it seemed forever and then the horses turned from the road onto the path leading up to the clavens carn keep in the courtyard he put her down from the horse and slid from his saddle rosamund turned about and hit him a blow with her fist it was a hard blow and it actually staggered him unable to help himself he burst out laughing as she turned away and stamped into his house rubbing his jaw he followed her in the hall jeannie came forward clucking sympathetically as she saw rosamund enter oh you poor dear she cried come to the fire and warm yourself i can only imagine how desperately you desire to get home but you must not wear yourself out rosamund you need your rest oh i hope you have not caught a chill or an ague these spring rains can be so treacherous she took her guests soaking cloak from her and gently pressed her into a chair tam wine for the lady she called to a servant logan take her boots off and warm her poor feet the way you do mine when they are cold jeannie instructed her husband madame please rosamund said i am not used to being fussed over in such a manner i will be fine wellmeaning though the hepburns may be i was quite capable of getting home by morning by myself you were no more than a mile or two from here the laird said as he knelt and pulled her boots off jeannie took the footwear and set it by the fire to dry her feet logan she repeated smiling at rosamund logan will have your poor little feet warm in no time at all you must be ravenous i will fetch you a plate myself she bustled off her belly was even more evident now than it had been at the end of march rosamund thought glumly then she started as she felt his big hands enclosing one of her feet what are you doing she demanded attempting to free her foot from his grasp warming your feet as my lady wife has instructed me madame he said in bland tones but the eyes looking up at her were filled with mischief he wanted her to argue with him rosamund realized it would be useless she knew and so instead she said very well but be quick about it logan hepburn i am indeed frozen where is my family i assume they have eaten and gone to their beds madame it is late one big hand cupped her small foot while the other rubbed it gently he couldnt help but stare down at that foot as it nestled in his palm it was a dainty foot the skin soft and smooth he had the most incredible longing to kiss it which he forced back i think you are actually beginning to succeed she remarked logan is the best foot warmer jeannie said enthusiastically as she returned with a plate of food for her guest rosamund took the plate and began to eat but her appetite was not what it had once been in fact since she had arrived in edinburgh to find patrick so ill she had hardly eaten at all food had the tendency now to repel her rather than appeal to her still for jeannies sake she made the attempt finally jeannie reached over and took the plate from her i understand she said softly at least you got something down rosamund looked into the young womans face seeing genuine sympathy and kindness she felt the everpresent tears beginning to well in her eyes she nodded at her hostess but said nothing are her feet nicely warmed now jeannie asked her husband aye he said standing up again then fetch rosamund some wine logan she commanded and when he had gone off she said i could see you wanted to cry but would not before a man i cannot even begin to imagine the sorrow you are suffering rosamund i am truly sorry for it again rosamund nodded wordless then she turned away gazing into the fire when logan returned a few moments later with the requested goblet of wine his wife stopped him with a hand putting a finger to her lips she has fallen asleep jeannie said ill carry her to her bed he replied nay jeannie said you will wake her if you do and then she will not sleep at all logan leave her by the fire her cloak is dry now cover her with it she will sleep the night i think let us to bed husband he nodded you go ahead lass he told her i must be certain all is locked and barred of course jeannie answered him and she left the hall logan moved through his keep as he did every night before he retired he checked the outer doors to make certain they were barred he saw that the lamps were doused the fires banked finally returning to the hall he sat down opposite rosamund her face was so familiar to him for it was the face that haunted his dreams he remembered the child he had first seen at that cattle fair in drumfie those long years back he had fallen in love with her then and there why was it that fate had conspired to keep them apart he shook his head then realizing his wife would wonder where he was he arose and left her sleeping in his hall rosamund was awake when he reentered the hall early the next morning awake and arguing with her hired captainatarms we still have another days ride he heard her say as he came upon them yer a madwoman lady and ill not go another step in yer company the captain said implacably you have almost killed my men and my horses with yer pace these past two days pay us what you owe us and we will be on our way tis but another days travel rosamund said you cannot expect three women and a single gentleman to travel these last miles without the company of menatarms today is the most dangerous part of our journey for we are prey to both the scots and the english as we go you were hired to take us to friarsgate not another mile in yer company lady the captain said pay us now pay him logan said you can trust him no longer madame if you force the issue he will wait until he is out of sight of clavens carn take his monies forcibly and leave you stranded my clansmen and i will escort you the rest of the way for once rosamund did not argue with logan she might have been griefstricken but she was no fool his words made perfect sense to her reaching into her gown she drew forth a leather bag of coins opening it she emptied a third of the coins into her hand stuffing them into a pocket then drawing the bag shut she tossed it to the captain you were hired to take me to friarsgate not clavens carn i have paid you for the distance you traveled with me now take your men and get out of my sight with a curt nod to the laird the captain walked quickly from the hall i do not like being indebted to you logan hepburn rosamund said you are not he replied you are my nearest neighbor for all you are english i would be a bad neighbor if i did not escort you to friarsgate under the circumstances i would not waste the day here she said sharply as soon as your party is ready lady we will go he told her how is your son she asked politely his craggy face lit up hes a braw wee laddie he is they say he is my image and it may be true but he has his mothers disposition rosamund couldnt help but smile at his words then you are indeed fortunate logan hepburn she told him now he laughed meaning he teased her i think we need not go into it my lord she answered him he nodded aye he said for you and i will never agree on anything will we rosamund i cannot predict the future logan hepburn she told him wearily once i thought i could but it has been proved otherwise this spring tom came into the hall followed by maybel philippa and lucy ah you are up already he greeted her jovially do not speak to me you traitor she told him then she said our menatarms have taken their monies and decamped the captain would not take us farther the laird has kindly offered to escort us home today gracious everyone is already up jeannie said coming into the hall i am a poor hostess i fear she bustled about speaking with her servants seeing that the morning meal was quickly served the lady of friarsgates escort has run off logan told his wife my men and i will be their protection on the final leg of their journey home today we should be back by dark lass he kissed the top of jeannies head of course you must accompany rosamund and her party jeannie said it is the most dangerous part of their trek take enough men so that the robbers lurking in the hills will be deterred from attacking she turned and smiled at rosamund borderers i have discovered be they scots or english can be difficult and rash in their actions rosamund found herself smiling back briefly aye they can she agreed the meal was served and they sat themselves at the halls high board lucy had gone to the kitchens to be fed but maybel was considered an honored guest by virtue of her long service and her marriage to a bolton there was hot oat stirabout served with pitchers of heavy golden cream and equally golden sweet honey loaves of fresh bread were placed upon the table along with two bowls of hardboiled eggs a crock of newly churned sweet butter and strawberry conserves both watered wine and ale were offered philippa her mother cautioned as the young girl signaled a servant to pour some ale into her goblet you will drink watered wine or plain water mama philippa protested i am nine now you will not have ale at breakfast until you are twelve her mother said your mam certainly never did maybel enforced rosamunds ruling oh pooh philippa complained but then she nodded at the servant with the wine pitcher to serve her i remember being her age jeannie said with a small smile nine is neither fish nor fowl it is a hard age for a girl when the meal was finished logan announced that he would assemble his men and they would depart shortly he hurried from the hall they attended to their needs and then rosamund thanked their hostess for her kind hospitality no mention was made of the lady of friarsgates reluctance to shelter at clavens carn the previous evening the two women embraced and then jeannie said rosamund i have a favor to ask of you will you be this new babys godmother surely you have someone else who would suit better rosamund protested nay i do not logans sistersinlaw do not like me since i made logan give his brothers their own cottages they attempted to undermine my authority in my own hall because they thought i was young and to be taken advantage of but i was not so innocent that i did not see so when logan asked me what i would have as a reward for giving him a son i told him i would think on it after their rudeness to you earlier this spring i told my husband i wanted his brothers and their families in their own homes he did not protest my request but in return his brothers and their wives became my sons godparents his brothers were satisfied but their wives were not but surely your own family rosamund began but jeannie stopped her with a wave of her hand my family comes from the far north i am but a memory to them please rosamund say you will be my new babys godmother you are the only friend i have the girls words touched her and with a small smile rosamund said if your husband the laird will agree then i should be honored to be your babys godmother jeannie hepburn jesu would she never be free of the hepburns she kissed jeannies cheek then turned and left the hall in the courtyard the laird his men and her party were already mounted waiting on her rosamund climbed into her saddle moved her animal up next to logans and nodded they moved off through the courtyard and down the path to the road below the day was a sunny one although the blue sky was filled with clouds of all hues scudding back and forth in the wind about them the hills were a may green and here and there were grazing sheep they saw parties of men twice on distant hillsides but their party being larger the two bands turned away seeing the second group rosamund said to the laird i thank you logan hepburn for your escort this day he turned and grinned i suspect you would have been a match for any borderer intent on robbing you lass but better cautious than sorry he moved his horse ahead tom rode up next to her well cousin you seem calmer this day than you have been since we departed edinburgh i am relieved to see it you were right she told him about last night i know he answered her calmly she swatted at him affectionately then she grew serious once more i do not ever remember being so miserable tom rosamund told him i shall never get over what has happened i cannot believe it is over and patrick is gone from my life he may in time regain his memories of you cousin tom began but she waved an impatient hand at him nay he will not do not ask me how i know but i do it is the same way i knew when we first met that we should not be together forever rosamund responded then what will you do cousin he asked her i will not marry again she said friarsgate is my responsibility i have my daughters philippa is halfgrown and i must begin considering families to approach with an eye to making her a match and you and i have a new enterprise to consider i shall fill my days but not my nights or my heart she thought silently they had departed just as the sun was creeping over the horizon by late morning rosamund began recognizing landmarks and knew they were almost home finally they topped a hill rise and there below lay the lake her meadows were heavily dotted with sheep and lambs her pastures were well tenanted by her cattle the fields were green with the new growth of grain they could see the friarsgate folk going about their workday coming down the hill rosamund called out greetings to those she saw a boy ran ahead of them announcing the mistress return rosamund briefly wondered if they had been told of her unfortunate adventure but she knew edmund would not have left her people in the dark lest they ask questions she smiled at some children waving in the orchards now in bloom it had been a day like this when she had come home to friarsgate with patrick a year ago her uncle came to greet them as they arrived at the house father mata was with him and he greeted the hepburn of clavens carn as well he was logans kinsman and they were friends rosamund slid down from her horse as edmund helped maybel dismount philippa and lucy were already heading inside i am sorry niece for your misfortune edmund said thank you she said will you see that the laird and his men are fed edmund they intend to travel back to clavens carn today i am tired and would retire to my own rooms she turned to logan thank you my lord she said to him and then she was gone well tom said with some humor at least she didnt hit you this time you have just the slightest bruise on your chin dear boy they walked together into the house what is this edmund asked his wife as they followed the two men dont ask me old man maybel said i was abed long before they dragged her in from the rain and her own folly tom will know every detail and you will obtain it from him ah i thank our lord jesu and his blessed mother that i am once again safe at home annie watched over you all annie did a fine job edmund assured maybel they entered the house you look troubled husband maybel said what is it a message came from the king while rosamund was away it arrived on the very day of your departure because it had the royal seal i opened it inside was the terse message the lady of friarsgate is commanded to attend on his majesty king henry at greenwich because she had gone off to wed and i knew she would not be back quickly i sent a reply back to the king saying rosamund was not at friarsgate but the message would be given to her upon her return i sent it with the royal messenger who brought the kings missive i have heard naught since you must tell her at once maybel said tomorrow edmund decided i can tell she is weary and heartsore let her have a peaceful night before we burden her again wife aye you are right old man maybel agreed the hepburn of clavens carn and his men stayed long enough to eat a good meal while their horses were rested and fed they departed in early afternoon tom seeing them off rosamund watched from an upper window she saw logan turn once as they rode from her courtyard but she knew he had not seen her for she was shrouded in shadow why had he turned back she wondered to herself then shrugging she put herself to bed and slept until first light the following morning when she woke she did not at first realize she was home then a small ripple of contentment slipped over her and she knew exactly where she was rosamund arose and dressed herself leaving her chambers she walked slowly down the stairs even the servants were only just beginning to stir unbarring the front door of the house she walked outside into the dawn about her the air was sweet and fresh with the new grass in her meadows she could hear the faint lowing of the cattle and the baaing of the sheep the birds sang brightly as they did only in the fullness of spring above her the sky was clear and bright blue she looked east and watched as the stain of gold on the horizon deepened and the bright crimson ball of the sun began to creep upwards the horizon exploded with color gold lavender scarlet and orange it was so unbelievably beautiful that she began to weep she was home at friarsgate safe at friarsgate but patrick leslie the earl of glenkirk was lost to her forever i do not know if i can go on without him rosamund thought to herself wiping the tears from her face he should be with me now seeing the sunrise smelling the sweetness knowing my love but it would not be that way between them ever again how can i bear it she whispered aloud how can i live my life without you patrick but she would she would live her life without the earl of glenkirk because she had no other choice she had responsibilities she had friarsgate she had philippa banon and bessie to consider she might grieve in the privacy of her own chambers but she must live her life for friarsgate and for her daughters now turning away from the sunrise rosamund walked back into her house where she found edmund awaiting her in the hall it will be a good day she told him have you eaten yet nay he answered her then let us break our fast together she said do you not wish to go to mass first he asked not today she replied sit uncle he accepted her offer saying a message came for you while you were gone i answered it for you he handed her the packet rosamund opened it scanning the contents then she said i have no time to attend the king right now i do not think niece that it was an invitation it seems more a command to me i will go in a few months rosamund responded if another royal messenger arrives i shall say i am too ill to travel you cannot ignore the kings command he counseled her i know rosamund replied i will go after the harvest and return before the wintertime i have no desire to be away from friarsgate again edmund i wonder what king henry wants of a simple countrywoman edmund said i wonder too she said he did not want her out of lust she knew there were more than enough women at court willing nay eager to satisfy his desires why had he sent for her and then she knew lord howard had probably put two and two together especially after tom said she was his cousin and had been at court as a girl well henry tudor would have to wait until she was ready and strong enough to travel rosamund did not think she was able to do battle with her king at this moment in time a month passed and it was june word filtered up from the south that king henry had departed for france with a great army sixteen thousand strong with them went horses and much ordnance for the battles to come the king was boyishly eager for the encounter his advisers were nervous henry tudor had no heir what if he were killed would england be plunged once again into civil war at friarsgate the summer passed peacefully tom spent much of his time at otterly overseeing the construction of his new house he came from time to time with amusing reports of its progress new otterly would be ready for habitation by late autumn and his servants were up from london and already in residence in the halfbuilt house they brought with them several cartloads of furnishings lord cambridge arrived bursting with all sorts of information on the kings orders the goldsmiths of london had fashioned a magnificent harness and trappings for king henrys warhorse the monies expended would have purchased at least twenty brass field ordnances another thousand pounds was given over to the purchase of solid gold buttons aglets branches and elegant chains so that when his armor and crusaders tunic was laid aside the royal doublet would glitter like a sunburst emperor maximilian had sent his fellow monarch a solid silver crossbow in a silver gild case the royal arms and weapons were equally magnificent i am devastated i was not there to see it tom lamented hal was always one for his appearance he will surely spend his fathers treasury rosamund noted there is more dear girl brew houses were constructed in portsmith so that beer could be made for the armies and the navies they brewed a hundred tons of beer a day i do not know how many brewers millers and coopers were there making their barrels as fast as they could the beer was put in its barrels in deep trenches covered with boards and atop the boards turf but despite this royal generosity the soldiers complained the portsmouth beer was too sour and demanded the barley malt beer of london but it too proved sour i suspect the damp of the coast is responsible at any rate the fleet sailed the ships holes filled with men horses and sour beer and all arrived safely in france then hal has his amusement and will not notice that i did not answer his summons rosamund said you will have to go eventually tom told her i will travel with you dear girl i dare not trust you to the kings care now do i he chuckled dryly word began drifting into the north the king had arrived safely at his possession of calais he had been warmly welcomed by the cheering citizenry but suddenly england found itself practically the sole supporter of the holy league henry tudors fatherinlaw claimed he believed himself near death and was reluctant to leave spain he was he said too old and too crazy to endure war but ferdinand had the truth been known was a skinflint who did not choose to expend monies in a war someone else could fight for him venice sent no troops and in that city it was said the pope himself had become neutral for the papal offensive that had been planned to come through provence or dauphine never materialized the holy roman emperor sent few troops but those sent were paid by the english his daughter margaret of savoy however continued to defy france loudly daring the french to do their worst for she she claimed would be protected beneath english arrows in late july the english departed calais and moved into the french territories a successful skirmish near st omer left them eager for more on august first the english arrived before the walls of therouanne after ten days of siege a herald arrived bringing a message from henry tudors brotherinlaw frances old ally king james of scotland the english were to leave therouanne they were to depart the territories of france they were in fact to return home james stewart was warning the young english king that war would shortly break out between them if he did not cease his hostilities in france henrys reply was a strong and clear one it becometh ill a scot to summon a king of england tell him there shall never scot cause me to return my face henry continued by pretending outrage that james had threatened his ally by marriage he grew more publicly indignant as his audience grew recommend me to your master he told the herald as he sent him off and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground i shall make him as weary of his part as ever was a man that began any such business the tudor king knew his wife acting as his regent and his captains at home would handle any situation with scotland should it arise the king of england was free to pursue his war on the continent on the sixteenth of august near the town of guinegate the english and the french in almost equal numbers met surprising the french who were not expecting them so soon the english charged the charge sent one group of french soldiery careening into another panic ensued the french turned and galloped off in a retreat leaving behind their standards and weapons and most oddly many of their spurs the english followed gaining a great victory that became known as the battle of the spurs afterwards the english took therouanne and henry with his army in tow went on to lille where he paid a social call on margaret of savoy he was royally feted and charmed everyone playing any instrument offered him proving his prowess with his silver crossbow and dancing in his stockinged feet until dawn lit the skies about lille well rested the english king moved on to capture the great walled city of tournai with its doublethick walls and ninetynine towers and after that he captured five more walled towns seven in total by autumn when englands king left for home he was no longer considered an untried boy king by his contemporaries he had become great harry and the news of his victories spread back to england and as far to the east as the sultans capital of istanbul henry viii was now considered a man to be reckoned with by the world about him at friarsgate before all of this was known rosamund received a message from her old friend the queen of scotland margaret saw what was coming she knew her husbands plans and how her arrogant clever brother had driven him into a corner from which he had but one way of emerging by means of war there could be no escape from what was happening around them gather your harvest in and keep close to friarsgate she wrote i do not believe either of the armies will come your way but beware of those on both sides of the border especially the deserters god keep you dear friend and those you love safe from this storm that is upon us i am again with child when it is possible i will write to you again the letter was signed simply meg not margaret r but meg rosamund shared her knowledge with her family and all the friarsgate folk we must keep watch on the hills for invaders or other troublemakers she said she turned to her uncle make it so edmund there must be a watch kept round the clock do you wish to send her highness a reply the young messenger asked rosamund nodded remain the night lad i will write the queen you will depart at first light and on your return stop at clavens carn tell the laird logan hepburn that war is coming between scotland and england are you softening your stance towards the hepburn tom asked her i send him warning for his good wifes sake she is near her time tom whatever these kings do logan hepburn is my neighbor we borderers are a different breed from those others of our nationality he nodded i will remain here with you dear girl if the queen is right and war is upon us it is likely the invasion will come from the southeast we shall probably see nothing here but you have the queens ring which should protect us from the scots if they come over the border in this region aye i would feel easier if you remained tom i pray that meg is wrong the scots do not fare well when they go to war with england and we both know hal if his brotherinlaw is fortunate enough to overcome him england will not rest until the insult has been avenged we will be at war forever and friarsgate cannot escape if that is so damn why could not hal have been a man like his father oh tom do you think that patrick will answer king james call i think that adam will see his father newly recovered from his seizure not be allowed to join the kings ranks though he may do so himself lord cambridge said and he shook his head and what is it really all about rosamund he sighed i do not know tom she answered him i think most wars are begun from nothing chapter logan hepburn stared down at the new grave in his familys burial ground he could almost hear jeannies voice pleading with him not to leave her but he wasnt leaving her not really he was simply answering his countrys call the queens own messenger bound for edinburgh from friarsgate had stopped some weeks before to pass on rosamunds warning of the strife to come and then the head of his entire family patrick hepburn the earl of bothwell had sent word of the kings call to arms a man didnt ignore such a message if he were loyal especially if he were kin to one of the kings best friends and longtime supporters he had gathered twentyfive men not including his two brothers colin and ian but when jeannie learned he was planning to depart she grew hysterical and nothing he did could calm her as she was near her time he decided to give her a few days to grow used to the idea that he was leaving but he sent his brothers ahead with twenty of his troop delegating colin the elder captain in his absence it was almost a week before he could calm his wife and make her understand that this is what a man did when his king required it your own father and brothers will have answered the royal summons he told her i have no choice but to go else i be branded a traitor and shame our earl they did not teach me this in the convent she wept we have been fortunate in having had peace between our two countries for many years logan explained but in our countrys history jeannie when the king has called his subjects have answered england is our most ancient and bitter enemy but they have not attacked us she cried why must the king attack them what do we want with english soil logan explain it to me make me understand why you must leave us now i do not believe the king means to take any of england for his own wife he began i think this is a means of forcing henry tudor to come home and cease his war against king louis if his own realm is in danger certainly he will leave france and hurry home to defend it king james will probably withdraw at that point they will argue over reparations and peace will come again there is little danger i promise you no war can be fought without casualties logan jeannie said even if there is no english army in the north of that land its citizens will fight the scots and men will die i fear for you for our children growing up without their father i have to go he said finally he could waste no more time cosseting her i know she told him resigned but still i do not want you to leave me my brothers and our men are already a week ahead of me jeannie he said i am ashamed that i am not with them is this the lesson you wish me to teach johnnie that a man should be a laggard in war in his duty no no she cried of course not logan then i must leave you lass lest i bring shame upon the family it is difficult to erase such shame it lingers for years logan told her go but go before i grow frightened again logan she told him go now maggie and katie will be coming with their bairns i promised my brothers he said to her aye she replied they should be here for safetys sake he hurried from his hall he hadnt even kissed her in farewell he had just gone relieved to escape anxious to catch up with colin and ian and eager to join in the fun of an invasion after gathering up his five remaining men they set out unaware of what lay ahead of them james stewart had sold off much of his personal wealth in order to purchase the seven great guns he planned to use to chastise the english and make them fully aware of his strength they were called the seven sisters his brotherinlaw henry of england would continue to fight alone for the pope had received word that the ottoman ruler was even now planning a large campaign into western europe he sent to james asking him to mediate between the holy see and king louis of france james stewart chortled with satisfaction but the english refused to allow his ambassadors through their territory they would gladly receive his ambassador in london but he could go no farther thus rendering him useless henry tudor considered his war against france a holy war even if the pope no longer saw it that way henry tudor knew what was right and besides the pope had written to him saying that he had changed his mind about scotland acting as an intermediary between him and france having been offered no proof of this james stewart and his advisers did not believe it no more was heard from the pope and the scots knew that this was due to the english cardinal who now had his ear the english were all but at war with the scots upon the high seas james stewart after many years of devoted service to christendom was shunted aside by the pope in favor of a younger man with a great deal of gold which henry tudor was using to buy as much influence as he might the venetians were now busy preparing to defend themselves from the turks should it prove necessary king ferdinand that wily and dishonest ruler did nothing but mouth platitudes france was busy fighting england and scotland was alone to fend for itself the earl of hume went forth to clear the northumbrian border forts he did so but he lost a third of his men to english arrows due to his own neglect in clearing the gorse and bracken from the field where they fought the english had hidden in this thick undergrowth rising to ambush the tooconfident scots yet despite this just about every man in scotland between sixteen and sixty had rallied to the kings banner clansmen from the isles clansmen who normally would have fought each other artisans merchants felons who volunteered to serve the king the sons of the poor and the sons of the welltodo all marched side by side with their beloved king the king had been visited before he marched down into england by an old crone who demanded to see him and would not be satisfied until she did like the king she had the lang eey dinna go down into england jamie she warned him dinna go for ye shall nae come hame again her glance pierced him her finger waggled at him but james stewart knew it his own second sight had told him this long ago the old woman continued with her warning she grasped his sword hand so tightly he thought she had crushed it at first his bones she said would not return home and then she made reference to his heirs who would be desperate to live in a green land not scotland and how two gold rings would make one that he did not understand but he thanked her and gave her his royal blessing at that she stared but a moment into his eyes and then shaking her head darted off leaving the king to ponder what he had not comprehended two rings making one but when the morning came james iv of scotland began his final march into history it was his destiny and he knew it logan hepburn was aware of none of this as he rode from his holding in the southwest of scotland to meet with the kings forces the journey was an odd one for the land seemed to be deserted here and there he met up with other men both young and old and they joined his little band for their destination was the same so they traveled through the early autumn rains moving west and south they crossed the tweed river moving into england now the evidence of the army ahead of them plain to see they found ford castle and its lands about it untouched the lady of the castle alone had been cooperative and james stewart had spared her holding though he had burned her house down as he departed he remained a few days before moving on to flodden and it was there logan and the men with him found the scots forces on the ninth day of september the mist the smoke and the heat of battle rose from the field below the hill known as flodden edge on the west side of the hill they found the trees had been cut down and a fort constructed and it was before that fortress that logan stood watching in horror as the battle was coming to its dreadful end he could see the kings banner in the mud which meant the king was dead for while he lived that banner would remain flying no matter what his gaze moved over the field but he saw no hepburn flag aloft either the ground was muddy and many of the men had fought in their stocking feet because leather boots would have slipped easily on the treacherous ground the scots had lost the battle now coming to its close that was painfully clear to logan and his companions the stench of death was everywhere the laird of clavens carn put his horn to his lips and blew it the distinctive note the horn sounded would tell any of his own people still alive to follow the sound and come to him he waited and then blew his horn twice more finally three of his clansmen struggled from flodden field and up the hill to where he waited any more he asked curtly the smell of death surrounded them they shook their heads my brothers slain my lord with the earl of bothwell one of the men reported adding the english forces are also to the west my lord well go north and east then logan said grimly quickly now lads before the english start looking about for living prisoners take whatever horses and boots you can find for yourselves he waited briefly while the trio found mounts and footwear then with a wave of his hand they cantered off leaving the battlefield behind they rode straight for the border it was imperative they not be caught in england their timely exit gave them more chance at survival than those left alive behind them had had they rode until there was no more light left to see the ground beneath their horses feet that first night they made camp beneath the overhanging rocks in a narrow ravine they lit a small fire beneath the rocks where it was unlikely to be seen the formation where they sheltered was almost a cave they had eighteen oatcakes among them broken in two one cake could serve as a days rations thirtysix pieces divided among the nine men would last them four days they would be well into scotland by then and might beg a meal from a local clansman they would be welcome into any hall with the news they brought that night those with whiskey left in their flasks shared it with their companions they would refill those flasks with water come the morrow around their little fire that first night the three hepburn clansmen told their laird the story of the battle their spokesman was clavens carns blacksmith his name was alan hepburn and he stood six feet six inches in his stocking feet his brow furrowed as he remembered the king were a brave laddie he began he led us all himself although the earl of hume did give a lot of orders at one point our own earl said loudly that he saw no crown on humes head and he should shut his mouth and let the king command us for he did it better than any the men listening laughed quietly those who had not been there picturing it for they knew their earl very well the battle was fierce alan hepburn continued the english were led by the earl of surrey i was told the king did not mean to fight in the field he meant the english to have to come to us on the height but their wily old commander sent troops around us to the west the king feared they might get over the border and none left to defend the farms but old men women and very young laddies ah he were a good man our jamie was alan hepburn said and he wiped the tears forming in his gray eyes twas he who told us to remove our boots for the ground was slick with mud and we would be in less danger of sliding and falling in our stocking feet what happened the laird asked his blacksmith we were well matched and we should have won the day something had to have happened did any of the earls withdraw their men the blacksmith shook his head nay half the men were down the hill and then the phalanx was broken my lord they began to slip and slide one grouping fell or tumbled into the other the mud was treacherous and many could not arise the english swooped in on them and it was slaughter your brothers however were already with our earl in the midst of the field with the young archbishop of st andrews who was fighting with his father the king much of the clergy avoided direct combat instead firing the canons for then they could be said not to have been fighting you saw my brothers go down colm finn and i were battling nearby the earl of bothwell was surrounded and your brothers rushed to his defense they were slaughtered alan said hume the young archbishop and the king were then slain the word began to spread that the king had been killed it took the heart out of the men my lord and then we heard your horn at first we were not certain it was you but the call came twice again and so we fought our way from the battlefield to find you alan finished i am ashamed i was not with you logan said thank god you were not my lord for this day we have lost our good king and the flower of scottish nobility alan told him clavens carn needs you especially as your lad is so young the new king is not much older logan replied god help scotland now what of the earl of angus was he also killed nay my lord alan said excitedly the king left old bellthecat douglas behind for the queen begged it she and bishop elpinstone do not get along it is said logan nodded it had been a wise thing to do they had ridden for the next few days making their way back to clavens carn when their oatcakes had run out they stopped at a farm begging a nights shelter in the warm dry barn both the men and the horses were grateful can you feed us logan asked the farmer we have eaten the last of our oatcakes last night and have had naught this day i can give you news of the king the farmer nodded weve not much but well share he said when my men are cared for i will come in and tell you everything i know the laird of clavens carn said the farmers wife delegated alan who was the largest of the lairds men to carry a cauldron of rabbit stew into the barn she followed her apron filled with several loaves of bread the men called their thanks to her as she returned to her cottage and then set about tearing chunks of bread off the loaves and dipping them into the stew to eat their knives speared what tender pieces of meat they could find inside the farmers dwelling the laird of clavens carn told of the disaster at flodden while he ate a bowl of the stew thinking it was the best he had ever tasted the farmer placed a small mug of beer before him and he nodded his thanks so our jamie is dead the farmer said god assoil his good soul he crossed himself as did his wife the battle was terrible then i could not go my bairns are not old enough to help and my wife is again with child he hung his head twas better you remained than became canon fodder the laird replied my wife is also with child and grew frightened when she knew i must go i sent my brothers now slain and twenty men with the king when i had calmed jeannie i followed only to reach flodden at the end i saw no fighting three of my clansmen survived the battle the others were with me i am ashamed for i knew the king the earl of bothwell the hepburn of hailes was my kinsman i was married in the royal chapel at stirling what was meant to be has come to pass the farmers wife said softly if it was meant that you die at flodden you would have it was not you have the lang eey mistress logan asked her sometimes i see things the farmers wife said quietly he nodded the king had the lang eey i know she answered him and then she said i will feed you and your men again in the morning my lord of clavens carn and i will give you what oatcakes i can spare the harvest was good despite the rains and i can make more for the winter logan thanked the woman and left the cottage joining his men in the warm barn most were already sleeping soundly in the sweetsmelling hay dry for the first time in days he joined them two days later they arrived at clavens carn where logan learned that his wife jeannie had died in childbirth his second son with her they had already been buried in the family grave site on the hillside his sistersinlaw sat gossiping in his hall oblivious and uninterested in flodden do you not wish to know of your husbands he asked them had they survived katie his brother ians wife said they would be with you will you not at least weep for them then he inquired of the pair would it bring them back colins wife maggie said astounded by their hard hearts the laird sought out his old nursemaid who lived in his keep and knew everything that happened within he found her in her chamber at her loom weaving and humming as she worked what happened flora he asked her as he sat down on a stool by her side how did my wife die and the lad with her flora turned her face to him her hazel eyes sorrowful the bairn was just a wee bit early according to my calculations but bairns will come when they will logan laddie the young mistress was frightened with your going she wept all the time after you left us she was certain you would be killed and voiced her fears to any and all who would listen you would die and she would be left a widow with two children to manage clavens carn for your son john she would be the prey of wicked men and robbers who would know she was alone and helpless jesu he swore softly i did not realize she was that frightened you had to go logan laddie flora said the lass was convent bred and afraid of her own shadow though she hid it well from you she did not wish to shame you the wee bairn came feet first but in his struggle to escape his mothers womb he became entangled in the cord and strangled i could not turn him though i might have been able to if either of your sistersinlaw had helped me i needed them to aid me but they would not they said you would blame them if anything happened and they could not afford your ill will for they had their own bairns to consider the women servants were all in their own cottages as their men were gone i had no one the lad was stillborn and i am sorry he was a big bairn for all he came early as for your poor wife she bled to death there was nothing i could do logan laddie you know i would have saved her if i could i am so sorry flora concluded he nodded slowly who buried her several of the old men dug the grave i bathed her and sewed her into her shroud flora told him there were tears in her eyes as she spoke and maggie and katie he asked they are bad wenches both of them flora said in a hard voice they would not even accompany your wife to her last resting place it was raining that day and they said they did not want to get wet but all those others left here did follow the bier your lady was well liked for all she came from the north flora finished logan stood up then bending slightly he kissed the old ladys soft cheek thank you flora was all he said and he departed her little chamber in the hall again he went to where his sistersinlaw sat together get up pack your belongings you will leave here with your children first thing in the morning he told them i do not want to ever see either of you again you have been talking to the old woman maggie said she hates us when i sent you to your own cottages you told me jeannie hated you he said scathingly my brothers are dead in the defense of our land yet you shed not a single tear you wantonly let my young wife perish for you would not help flora who might have at least saved jeannie if she could not save my son it was maggies idea katie cried to him she said we would have our own back on jeannie for sending us to those poky cottages logan i wanted to help i think you lie he returned if you had wanted to help her you would have helped no matter what maggie said to you now hear me both of you the cottages in which you reside are yours i shall see you and your bairns fed and clothed i will train the three lads you have between you in the use of arms i will dower your two lassies one day and i shall make matches for them but i do not ever want to see your faces in my hall again what i do i do for my brothers sakes they were good brothers and their children will not suffer because their mothers are hardhearted trulls you will not be permitted to remarry for if you do i will send you from clavens carn without a moments hesitation katie began to weep but maggie said boldly i cannot believe you mean to do this to us logan we were good wives to colin and ian which is why i do not take your bairns from you and put you out upon the high road he told her in a hard voice now get out of my sight both of you you never loved her maggie said and she knew it logan nay i did not love her he admitted freely but i liked her well and i respected her position as my wife and the chatelaine of this household aye she knew i did not love her but i might have given time maggie laughed bitterly how could you love anyone when it is rosamund bolton who has always filled your heart logan then turning the sniveling katie behind her maggie departed the hall he poured himself a large goblet of wine draining the goblet where he stood then turning he went outside and up the hill to where his wife and son lay buried he stared down at the fresh earth mound just beginning to green over jeannie he said i am sorry but i thank you for wee johnnie and whatever happens he will know you were his mam and that you loved him he will know you were a good wife to me and that i respected you but still i am sorry that i didnt love you he remained where he was for many minutes while the sun set and the stars began to come out above him finally he swung about and returned to his hall where the servants so well trained by his wife had his supper waiting and after he had eaten he went to the nursery where his son and heir lay sleeping his thumb in his mouth poor bairn logan thought without a mother and the little king without a father what was going to happen to scotland with an infant king whose powerful uncle namely henry tudor was now just beginning to flex his muscles james v was crowned at stirling on the twentyfirst of october in the year by james beaton the archbishop of glasgow he was seventeen months old and surrounded by what remained of the scottish nobility who wept loudly as the great crown of office was held over his little red head it was a cheerless coronation the countrys main concern was england a peace must be made and henry tudor could not have anything to do with his nephews upbringing although he should surely desire it and would attempt to influence his sister the english queen had been hurrying northward with her own army when surrey had defeated and killed james iv at flodden she was again with child but in imitation of her late mother isabella of spain she had been quite prepared to go into battle she sent henry the good news of scotlands defeat even going so far as to enclose the bloodstained plaid tunic that james stewart had been wearing when he was killed with the influence of both england and spain james had been excommunicated by pope julius his body was therefore denied a christian burial and disappeared gone to hell the english said not so the scots defended their beloved deceased monarch james iv like king arthur had disappeared but he would returnrex quondam rexque futurusthe once and future kingwhen scotland needed him the most it was small comfort henry tudor returned in october from his french adventures katherine made certain he was greeted like the hero he believed himself to be henry was no longer the second son of that upstart tudor family that had usurped a throne he was great harry the english king was flushed with his own victories even though they were now overshadowed by the victory at flodden it is your victory as well my lord his queen told him and the earl of surrey the actual victor nodded in agreement scotland is crushed she carefully omitted the fact that while james iv was now dead scotland still had a kingher husbands nephew james v but henrys pride in his military accomplishments was shortlived for in december of that year his wife was delivered of a stillborn son an eye for an eye margaret queen of scotland said grimly upon hearing the news she was not of a mind to be charitable now full with her second child she was also filled with sorrow at james death and angry to have been left with all the responsibility of scotland its infant king and the child soon to be born her husbands will had named her tutrix or guardian of the young king margaret tudor was in effect the ruler of scotland her regency was approved by the kings council but as the sister of englands king she would not be trusted entirely by the scottish nobility it mattered not that as james stewarts wife and queen her loyalties had always been to scotland she was a woman she was english scotlands nobles looked to france to john stuart the duke of albany the duke was james iiis nephew and the kings nearest legitimate male kinsman in an age of political intrigue dishonesty and backbiting john stuart was known as an honest man his ethics were above reproach the queens council consisted of archbishop beaton as her chancellor and the earls of angus huntley and home who were appointed to aid the queen but it was noted that the queen would be served by a rota of nobles who would function on her council in turn advising her in the daily affairs of her government it was agreed that the queen would make no decision without first consulting six gentlemen three of whom would be temporal and three who would belong to the clergy margaret was not quite the featherhead her husband had believed that was a role she had played because that was the kind of woman james desired in his queen she was her council quickly discovered hardheaded and shrewd when she put her mind to a problem stirling castle was chosen as the kings chief residence lord borthwick would be the castles commander with the title of captain the arms that had been sent to james iv by king louis were now brought to stirling which made it impregnable the queen held the treasury making her even more powerful she sent out a call for parliament to meet come spring the government secure peace would be the next item on the agenda england suggested the peace first and queen katherine sent one of her favorite priests to queen margaret to comfort her but in the borders lord dacre on the kings instructions was still raiding the scots burning and looting scotland was now a land of widows and motherless children proclamations were issued in the new kings name forbidding their abuse or the abuse of their children still rape robbery and other violence was being done to those widows and their offspring and there were not enough men left to keep the peace so many suffered though the queen and her council did their best to prevent it but many of the young men now come into their lordships were eager to continue a war against england eager for revenge they saw no use in a peace with their ancient enemy they wanted a strong military leader to confront lord dacre they appealed to king louis to send them the duke of albany but the french king could not be cajoled into any actions that would threaten margarets regency he corresponded with the young widowed queen assuring her that he would not send the duke of albany to her until she requested it he would not make peace with england without her permission for france was ever scotlands oldest and most faithful ally he asked if he might send to her le chevalier blanc one monsieur la bastie his most trusted diplomat to help her and too the scottish ships that james iv had lent him were still in france would she like him to return them along with the kings cousin the earl of arran and lord fleming the full scottish council met in perth in november it was agreed that the queens regency of the young king would not be interfered with in any manner the auld alliance with france was confirmed once more and the duke of albany was requested of king louis for the defense of scotland bellthecat douglas the earl of angus who favored an english alliance was absent grieving the loss of his two sons he had gone home to die in england king henry was furious and worried by turns as the young kings uncle he saw himself as the boys natural guardian he wrote to his sister telling her she must stop albany from coming he feared the strong duke might supplant margaret by virtue of his sex and possibly spirit the little king to where he might be eliminated then he wrote to louis asking him to delay albanys departure for scotland until england had made its peace with its northern neighbor margaret did not like her loyalties being torn or compromised by any her sole duty she said was to her bairns both friarsgate and clavens carn by virtue of their locations had been spared any border raids adam leslie wrote to say the leslies of glenkirk had ignored the summons to war and had undoubtedly been overlooked in the resulting confusion that followed king james death at flodden patricks health remained strong but his memory of the past two years had not returned rosamund read the letter stonefaced she had buried her grief deep in her heart now allowing it to surface only in the darkest of night when she was alone in her bed there had been no word from clavens carn regarding jeannies new child rosamund assumed that logan had put his foot down firmly when his wife asked if his neighbor might be the childs godmother she was not disappointed it would have been a very awkward situation but then sweet jeannie did not know the relationship that her husband had attempted to forge between himself and the lady of friarsgate the harvest had long been gathered in and the st martins goose eaten december was upon them a messenger arrived from margaret tudor early in the month even as it had two years previously this was not an invitation however meg wrote to tell her old friend of the great battle at flodden in september at which her husband had been slain little jamie was now scotlands king she was enceinte with her late lords child to be born in the spring and she was regent of scotland according to her husbands last will and testament i am weary with all i must do she wrote but those lords not slain at flodden with my husband have been most sympathetic and helpful to me we will survive my brother henry the cause of my unhappiness is of course blustering and blowing that he should be the guardian of my bairns i should never allow such a thing but if i even considered it the ghosts of all the stewart kings before my son would rise up to haunt me and rightly so aye i imagine hal would enjoy having scotland in his custody tom said when he learned the news then he chuckled he cannot get his own son so he would have james stewarts lad to father rosamund could not help but laugh herself living in the north has caused you to become careless in your speech cousin she said you should not dare say such a thing in london you never did answer the kings summons did you he said edmund answered it for me she replied besides henry tudor has more important things to consider than a widow in cumbria whom he once knew he is a player now upon the worlds stage tom whatever he imagines i was doing with the earl of glenkirk has now been overlooked because of the great and terrible victory at flodden what news from clavens carn did the sweet jeannie deliver her lord a second son or a daughter tom asked her rosamund shook her head i have no idea i have heard naught but then given the times i am not in the least surprised besides i can hardly believe that logan hepburn would have wanted me for that childs godmother do you perhaps i shall take a few of my men and ride over the border tom said i am curious and whatever you may say cousin so are you go then she told him the weather will hold for another few days but beware of getting caught at clavens carn for the winter tom i do not believe that you would like it at all jeannie has certainly done her best but it is still an uncivilized place he laughed i remember you once said you should never get to wear your fine gowns if you inhabited such a place and it is still so rosamund noted dryly the next morning being dry and mild for december lord cambridge departed his cousins house with the halfdozen menatarms he now traveled with when he left otterly they reached clavens carn in late afternoon riding through its gate easily as they were recognized by the clansmen guarding the little castles entry tom dismounted and upon entering the house went directly to its hall it was empty but for a servant girl rocking the cradle by the fire lord cambridge walked over and looked into it surprised to find not a new infant but the lairds fourteenmonthold heir where is your mistress he asked the servant the girls eyes grew large with her fright nervously she arose from her place the mistress be dead good sir and the bairn she carried he inquired surprised and not just a little saddened by the news with its mam sir the girl said go and fetch your master lass your charge is sleeping and does not need you the girl ran off leaving tom to ponder the knowledge he had just obtained so little jeannie had died and her child with her it was a tragedy yet logan still had one son to follow him widowed would he now seek out rosamund again and would she have him in her grief over patrick the winter to come might be dull he thought but certainly not the spring and summer to follow a small smile touched his lips already this little journey had provided him with enough information to give him several months amusement teasing his cousin tom logan entered his hall what brings you to clavens carn we are supposed to be enemies again england and scotland but he smiled i rarely pay heed to the politics of kings and queens dear boy tom answered and particularly when the church is involved i have only just learned from your sons little nursemaid of your great tragedy what happened a shadow passed over logans handsome face you have if i remember a fondness for my whiskey sit down tom bolton and i will tell you what happened to my poor little wife he poured them two pewter dram cups of an amber liquid from a carafe on the sideboard bringing them to his guest he offered him one and they sat before the fire the cradle holding johnnie hepburn between them i got the call to arms she did not want me to go i had to send my brothers and most of my men on ahead while i calmed her when i caught up with them the battle was almost over its outcome obvious and the king dead when i reached clavens carn again i learned she had died in childbed with the bairn another son she was already buried of course poor lass twas just as well i later learned her father and brothers had all perished in the battle her mother has entered the convent where jeannie was educated to live out her life in prayer and mourning i sent to her regarding her daughter tom nodded sympathetically twas a great tragedy for scotland but then the history between our countries has never been peaceful for long a long silence ensued and then logan said how is rosamund lord cambridges face was impassive as he answered but he thought immediately ah he still wants her she yet mourns her own tragedy logan did the leslies go to flodden he wondered i do not know but i do know that adam would not let his father answer the call i suspect he never even told him of the summons and he wisely remained put at glenkirk himself he may have sent a troop but i know not he wrote to rosamund that it was not likely they were missed he is right i think the first earl like you was but the laird of his people before he became james ivs ambassador years ago did you like him logan asked aye i did he was a good man and he loved rosamund deeply the misfortune that befell him last spring was indeed tragic yet he knows it not as his memories of the last two years have vanished for good it would appear is her heart broken logan queried lord cambridge aye it is but hearts can be mended or so i am told was the reply i have been given another chance with her logan said softly perhaps tom answered him but go slowly logan hepburn do not attempt to overwhelm my cousin this time by being forceful with her she needs a strong man but that man must also respect that she is a strong woman you need not break her spirit to bend her to your will the laird of clavens carn nodded understanding you will tell her of my wifes demise i will but do not come courting until midsummer she liked jeannie and would not approve of any disrespect shown towards her and in the name of all that is holy logan hepburn do not mention the bairns you desire of her if you can coax her to the altar the bairns will come as a natural result of your passions for each other now tell me what is for dinner dear boy for i am absolutely ravenous the laird laughed aloud he had forgotten how amusing tom bolton could be laughing felt good it had been a long time since he had laughed hearing a small noise coming from the cradle he saw his son was awake lifting the lad from his bed he displayed him to his guest is this not a fine lad tom bolton do i not have a fine son indeed logan hepburn you do lord cambridge agreed the boy squirmed in his fathers arms anxious to get down the laird set him upon the floor and the little fellow toddled over to one of the great wolfhounds in the hall climbing upon its back and crowing with delight the two men laughed as the dog turned its massive head and licked the childs face lovingly ill have him on his first pony come the spring the laird boasted hes a braw little laddie tom bolton aye tom agreed i can see that he is and i can see you are a good and doting father which will not harm you in my cousins eyes youll stay the night the laird said i will lord cambridge responded will your brothers be joining us they were lost at flodden logan replied ah your sorrow is great my lord a winter of mourning will ease your heart i am sure came the reply in the morning tom returned to friarsgate eager to impart all that he knew to rosamund she wept learning of jeannie and her child and the wee laddie she bore last year motherless ah cousin these are hard times for us all they are he agreed afterwards when she had gone from the hall edmund asked tom will he come courting do you think perhaps but i have advised him not to appear until at least midsummer tom replied she liked jeannie aye she did edmund agreed you must tell maybel to hold her peace tom said aye edmund agreed i will remind my wellmeaning spouse that if she natters on at rosamund about logan hepburn being a bachelor once more it could drive the lass away of course logan may do that himself if he goes on about bairns edmund chuckled ive warned him about that too tom responded chuckling himself they celebrated the festive holidays which concluded with twelfth night in early january tom was once again generous with rosamunds daughters she was amazed that he had managed to find gifts for them all under the circumstances perhaps in the spring he told her i may travel into scotland and see about that ship we want to built it has been a year now since i first suggested it dear girl we have lost no time she assured him the new flocks we bought last summer are doing very well well have quite a birthing of lambs next month i have never understood why sheep insist on having their offspring in february he said the weather is foul and the wolves are hunting vigorously no one has ever understood sheep rosamund told him laughing it is their own way and they will have it i fear at least i have the flocks all gathered in now that the snows are covering the grazing on the hillsides the winter had now set in about them tom returned to otterly to husband his own estate and attend to his business affairs the days were beginning to grow visibly longer again by candlemas on february second father mata was teaching rosamunds daughters six mornings a week the three girls sat at the high board and studied diligently for both their mother and their uncles had said it was important no matter what others might say all of them could read and write now the young priest taught them latin not simply the church latin needed for the mass but the latin that was spoken within the civilized nations rosamund taught them french even as their father had taught her when they first met they already knew their numbers and simple arithmetic rosamund and edmund schooled philippa in how to keep friarsgates accounts as the responsibility would one day be hers great lords have others to do this for them rosamund said but a wise woman knows how to manage her monies herself lest those others attempt to cheat her because she is a woman or make mistakes it is not easy to manage friarsgate but if you would keep it safe you must learn philippa do you understand me my child philippa nodded aye mama i do but when i marry one day will my husband not take on this task for me friarsgate will belong to you philippa not your husband you are the heiress to friarsgate my daughter it will be yours until you pass it on to your eldestborn son or daughter rosamund explained it will never be your husbands property i am the last bolton of friarsgate you will be the meredith of friarsgate but your heir and i do hope it is a son will be the next lord or lady of this manor my unfortunate uncle henry could never live with this knowledge for him friarsgate is the boltons but our sons are now all gone what about uncle henrys son mama philippa asked innocently he could never be the heir unless your sisters and i were gone from this earth she said i have not seen him since he was a child he was an obnoxious little boy strutting and making pronouncements they say he is a robber chief now philippa said so i am told rosamund replied who told you that maybel did she said uncle henrys son is even worse than his strumpet mother philippa repeated i suspect maybel is right rosamund answered her daughter but she should not have said it to you philippa put my wicked uncle and his offspring from your mind they will have nothing to do with your life yes mama the little girl said dutifully rosamund sought out her old nursemaid do not speak to the girls about my uncles son you will frighten them maybel very little frightens that trio maybel answered pithily that is because they are young and sheltered they have not lived as i did as a child i dont want them to be afraid of the boltons you keep them too close rosamund maybel said philippa has been to queen margarets court i think you should take her to her own kings court to meet our good queen she was once your friend perhaps she will favor philippa if she knows her philippa will be ten in april it is time you begin seeking out a worthy husband for her not yet rosamund said perhaps when she is twelve all the good matches will be taken if you wait too long maybel replied outraged by rosamunds attitude why you had two husbands by the time you were her age and a third two years after you were twelve which is precisely why i shall wait until philippa is older i dont want her marrying some graybeard i want her to fall in love and marry a man closer to her in age who will hopefully be her one and only husband rosamund said romantic twaddle maybel huffed but she is my child rosamund said and i will plan her life as it is my right to do i mean to plan wisely for philippa and her sisters they may have their own plans maybel said sharply the hillside now began to grow green with the coming of spring the ewes proudly shepherded their new offspring into the meadows beneath the warm spring sun the fields were plowed and the grain sown in those being used this year the orchards came into full bloom rosamunds second daughter banon celebrated her eighth birthday on the fifteenth day of march philippa turned ten at the end of april and bessie was six by the end of may tom came from otterly as he had for the two previous birthday celebrations he brought bessie a small terrier pup as a present she squealed with delight upon opening the basket in which he had placed it and then she hugged him the squirming puppy jumped from its basket and scampered across the garden with bessie in hot pursuit causing them all to laugh it was at that moment uninvited guests arrived ushered into the gardens by a house servant such gaiety henry bolton said he was accompanied by a tall young man whom rosamund immediately recognized as her cousin henry the younger she arose uncle this is a surprise but you are of course welcome she deliberately ignored her cousin i have brought my son with me today he has been living with me henry said i had heard he has taken to robbery uncle rosamund replied nay nay niece he is a reformed man arent you my son henry said yes father the young man responded his gaze had fastened upon philippa is that the heiress to friarsgate he asked his sire you have never been noted for your subtlety cousin rosamund told him but if you think to wed my daughter put it from your mind i told your father this in december she glared at her relations the little wench has to marry someone cousin the young man replied there are two criteria for her husband she must love the man she marries and he must be of a high social station you fit neither of those standards cousin if that is the purpose of your visit then you have wasted your time is this the kind of hospitality you offer me henry demanded outraged you come into our midst unannounced uncle bringing my cousin who has spent his last years in robbery and mayhem your purpose is to make a match between my innocent child and this ruffian something i previously told you was not possible and you wonder i do not welcome you with open arms you have dedicated your life uncle to stealing friarsgate from me you have failed now you hope you may yet gain it through my daughter it will not happen i tell you now get out take your wicked spawn with you and know that you shall never darken my door again rosamund stood as tall as she could her index finger pointing out of the garden about her her family was very very quiet her daughters had never seen her this angry you were always a difficult girl henry said his face was red with his outrage this is bolton land you stupid bitch it must remain bolton land i will kill you before i allow friarsgate to be given to a stranger he lunged at her furiously but rosamund was quicker and stepped back get out she told him again in a hard voice henrys face now turned from red to deep red to purple why could you have not died with your brother and your parents you have ever been a thorn in my side you damned bitch this should all be mine he was foaming about his lips and then with a loud cry he collapsed at her feet and was very still i think you have finally killed the old devil off henry the younger said as edmund knelt seeking a pulse from his halfbrother edmund looked up he is dead rosamund good she replied vehemently father mata stepped forward have mercy lady he counseled her gently he had none on me rosamund said softly henry bolton was dead she could scarce believe it but it was true then she said i will give him in death what i would not give him in life mata he may be buried here at friarsgate the priest nodded approvingly his cottage henry the younger said is it now mine nay tom quickly said i built it for your father to live out his life in but it is part of otterly and otterly is mine i know your father had a will young henry and you are his sole heir meet me at otterly in a weeks time and we will see what it is you have inherited the young man nodded then he turned to rosamund and bowed i will not say it has been pleasurable seeing you again cousin he told her wryly and i should far rather wed and bed you than the little wench who is your heiress i am old enough now by far and it is said that i am skilled in passion get out rosamund said once more the sight of you sickens me and your lack of grief is shameful i do not grieve for him her cousin said he was wretched to my mother i hated him for it had i gotten my hands on friarsgate i should have exiled him from it even as you did and i would not have allowed his bones to be interred in its soil he bowed to her once more perhaps i shall return cousin do not rosamund said in a hard cold voice chapter the morning after bessies natal day they laid henry bolton to rest in the family burial site next to his mother rosamunds parents and brother were interred next to her grandfather his son had not returned for his burial rosamund was very concerned that henry the younger was in the vicinity and that he had seen philippa did you know she asked tom that my cousin was with his father this winter past tom shook his head if i had i should have called the sheriff he said gods blood dear girl i could have been murdered in my bed and none the wiser he looked distinctly pale at the thought i wonder that mistress dodger did not tell me but then i saw little of her during the winter i shall certainly speak with her when i return to otterly in a few days time if they cozened her or threatened her you can no longer trust her rosamund noted especially as my cousin is about god what am i to do tom if only patrick and i had been wed do you still think of him lord cambridge wondered he is never far from my thoughts rosamund said softly sadly you will never forget him cousin tom said but you must get on with your life for he will never be with you again and you know that she nodded i do and yet i cannot help but grieve but that grief i will keep to myself tom my problem remains if henry the younger still lurks about what am i to do to protect philippa i cannot have her constantly dogged by menatarms and i would not frighten her rosamunds answer to her problem came several days later when a messenger arrived from queen katherine commanding her to court she was astounded for she could not imagine that someone as unimportant as she indeed was had been remembered certainly the queen had more important matters to consider henry tudors adventures in france the year before and englands great victory at flodden had placed england clearly in the worlds spotlight even here in the north it was known that representatives from all the countries of europe were arriving in london to present their ambassadorial credentials to the king how had she been recalled in light of all of that does it matter dear girl tom asked this is the solution you sought we shall go to court and take philippa with us she has met queen margaret and her late lamented spouse now let her greet her own king and queen who knows what may come of it rosamund i shall send word to have both the london and greenwich houses opened and made ready for us the trip will serve another purpose for i would have you meet with my goldsmiths and we must choose a factor to serve us in london our ship will be ready to be launched by next year and by withholding our cloth this year we will build up our stock and increase the demand for it i will set the men to work building a stone storage house for us while we are gone rosamund said then you will go he asked of course i will go i was not here last year when the summons came and then the war came making it unsafe for travel i cannot afford to offend the queen or her husband aye i will go and taking philippa with us is the best way to keep her safe from henry the younger but will banon and bessie be safe from him philippa is your heiress and it is she he wants tom assured her if she is not here then there is nothing here for him still i would make certain friarsgate is well guarded in your absence i hesitate to suggest it but i shall nonetheless why not send to the laird your neighbor and ask if you may hire some of his clansmen for the purpose of guarding friarsgate and your younger daughters you may not like logan hepburn but he is honest and brave i do not dislike the laird rosamund said slowly and what you have proposed makes strange sense to me tom but i would have you send to him i think it would be preferable if edmund made the overture as he is your bailiff tom said aye youre right rosamund agreed i should not like logan hepburn to get the wrong idea tom hid his smile nodding solemnly edmund sent to the laird of clavens carn asking that he come to discuss a matter of business to both of their best interests to edmund and toms amusement the laird returned with the friarsgate messenger they kept their humor from rosamund who had decided to allow her uncle to manage the negotiation the three men sat in the hall of the house while the servants brought them ale bread and cheese what is it i can do for you edmund bolton the laird asked the older man his eyes quickly scanned the room old henry bolton came with his ruffian son on our bessies natal day he interrupted the celebration he wanted to make a match between henry the younger and philippa something rosamund had already told him was impossible she told him again and the old man fell into a terrible temper tantrum which to our surprise killed him on the spot we buried him several days ago henry the younger however remains a danger to philippa having been commanded to court rosamund will leave shortly with tom taking philippa with her in order to protect her heiress she means her daughter for better things and being introduced into court is the first step logan nodded aye she is wise where the lassie is concerned friarsgate is no small inheritance i see you have added shropshires to your flocks we have edmund replied what do you seek of me then the laird of clavens carn asked his companions we wish to hire some of your clansmen who might otherwise be idle to serve us as menatarms in the event that henry bolton the younger and his friends decide to take matters into their own hands while rosamund is in the south edmund explained logan nodded aye tis a wise precaution edmund bolton now allow me to make another suggestion if rosamunds younger daughters are not at friarsgate while she is away they will be safer i would gladly keep those two lassies secure from harm at clavens carn henry the younger will never know or even consider the girls are so near just over the border with me and i will also lend you two dozen of my own people to serve you as menatarms that should certainly deter the ladys cousin from his mischief tis a brilliant suggestion my dear boy tom enthused speaking for the first time in the matter of course we would send a lass or two with the girls to attend them you understand of course the laird replied but jeannie god assoil her sweet soul trained me a fine housekeeper who keeps the servants in good order mistress elton has granddaughters of her own my house is well fortified it has never fallen in a siege because our well is within our courtyard as is our granary i think the ladys lasses would enjoy my wee son johnnie and he them we must of course speak with rosamund logan hepburn edmund said i have not seen her since i arrived the laird responded attempting to sound casual but his tone gave him away i have news of the queen for her go gently lad tom warned him softly i am certain rosamund will join us at table this evening edmund answered we will discuss the matter further then logan hepburn it is a generous offer and a clever one too it is unlikely henry the younger would think to look to clavens carn i do not know if i can sit at the high board with him rosamund said when her uncle told her that the laird was with them you must edmund responded he has agreed to hire out his clansmen to us at a most reasonable rate but it is his offer to shelter banon and bessie that pleases me greatly they will be far safer from my nephew henry at clavens carn than here at friarsgate they could be kidnapped as they walked to the church or played in a meadow or by the lake if they are constantly guarded by menatarms it will frighten them niece now tell me why you will not face logan hepburn he took her hand and looked into her lovely face rosamund blushed now he is a widower i fear he will begin again to importune me to marry him she said if i offend him he could withdraw his offer of support edmund smiled would it be so dreadful niece if a handsome man sought to pay you court forgive me but patrick leslie is as dead to you now as owein meredith you are fortunate in your memories but you are yet young philippa is ten and in a few years too few i might add she will be ready for marriage you were willing to spend part of your year at glenkirk as the earls wife would it be any different should you wed logan hepburn one day rosamund at least he has an heir and you know he has no designs on friarsgate edmund concluded she was silent for a long moment and then she said i will come to the high board uncle more than that however i will not promise you try not to fight with him niece edmund said with some humor rosamund laughed she could not help herself very well uncle she promised him logan tried not to stare when she came into the hall she wore a gown that matched her amber eyes it was a simple dress that fell in graceful folds its neckline was low and square but made modest by its soft linen pleating the tight sleeves had little fur cuffs the bodice was closefitting as well an embroidered girdle hung from her waist her auburn head was bare and she wore her hair in two simple plaits good evening logan hepburn she greeted him thank you for coming to our aid once again henry the younger is ever a trial to friarsgate isnt he the laird teased her she smiled i can but hope i do not have to spend my life quarreling with him as i did his father rosamund said please sit down here on my right hand she invited he obliged her seating her first before taking his own place i am sorry about your wife rosamund told him and to lose a bairn as well if i had but known she was alone i should have gone to her aid logan i liked jeannie muchly how is your little johnnie he thrives the laird answered she was a good wife rosamund and i respected her greatly then after a pause he said i am sorry for your loss as well lass a spasm passed over her visage but then she said thank you nothing more i bring you happy news logan told her queen margaret was delivered of a fine son alexander duke of ross on the thirtieth day of april how wonderful for her and yet how sad rosamund said that is your birthday isnt it lady he inquired aye she said softly wondering how he had known it the meal was served of rosamunds three daughters only philippa sat at table i am to go to court to meet the queen philippa said i am now ten a perfect age to meet a queen he said with a small smile she was a charming miniature of rosamund he thought i was nine when i met queen margaret and king james he who was slain at flodden philippa replied my mother says he was a good king gods blood tom swore and then he said to philippa you must not say that when we visit the english court dear child speak of the kings sister the regent of scotland if you must but say naught about jamie stewart why not philippa demanded to know because her mother said these two kings were enemies it is illadvised to praise a mans enemy before him philippa do you understand why were they enemies philippa answered her mother with another question england and scotland have been enemies since time immemorial rosamund responded why philippa persisted i am not really certain rosamund said honestly but you visited king james court and i know you did not think him your enemy and if the scots are our enemies why is the lord of clavens carn at our table this night mama and why is he protecting banon and bessie when we are away if he is our enemy tom chuckled your daughter is no fool madame the laird of clavens carn noted sometimes i think philippa too wise for her own good rosamund said quietly then she turned back to her child the english and the scots in the borders sometimes have a different relationship than others of our race philippa i cannot really give you a good explanation for it queen margaret was my friend at her fathers court when i was growing up but you know that my friend asked me to visit her and as there was no war between our countries then i went i should go again if she asked me as for the hepburns of clavens carn they have been our neighbors forever i do not believe we have ever fought each other uncle tom will be with us at court edmund is too old to mount a strong defense of friarsgate although i know he would try if asked but i will not ask it of him the laird has kindly offered to protect your sisters and i am grateful for his offer i will accept it gladly the only thing separating england and scotland in this particular matter is an invisible border philippa but if it is invisible then we cannot see it and so it is not there the hepburns are our neighbors they are good neighbors thank you madame logan said she nodded in reply and for a moment she grew breathless she had forgotten that his eyes were so blueblue am i to understand that your lasses will come to me he said carefully not wanting to press her in any manner tom had warned him to go gently did i not make myself clear in the matter my lord she asked him a trifle irritated i would not presume madame which is why i query you he told her and his eyes were dancing rosamund felt her cheeks growing warm with a memory once she had indeed accused him of presuming when he had said he but assumed she looked directly at him and to her surprise her heart began to hammer again what the hell was the matter with her yes she said i should like you to keep banon and bessie at clavens carn while i am away my lord and i thank you for your kindness in offering my daughters your protection still seated he bowed from the waist i am glad to be of some service to you madame he told her his face impassive his tone mild i think it might be best if i took them back with me tomorrow it is not likely your unpleasant cousin has gotten his thoughts or his men together yet i realize it is short notice but your daughters safety must be our first consideration and in addition to the menatarms i shall loan you i shall also send my men to escort you south with henry the younger skulking about you cannot be certain any menatarms you hire will not be subverted by false promises they will not wear their plaids and to an untrained ear a scots borderer and an english borderer sound much alike they will claim to be your own friarsgate folk that is very generous of you logan hepburn rosamund exclaimed it is brilliant thomas enthused indeed it is edmund agreed with your permission madame i can make it so he said rosamund looked closely at logan there was absolutely no mockery in his tone or his attitude she nodded aye i would be glad to have your men protecting me i will pay them the usual rate for hired menatarms of course of course he replied they will all be grateful for the coin madame for it is not often they can come by a bit of silver the meal over rosamund arose from the table i must go and see that banon and bessies belongings are packed for the morrow she hurried from the hall when she had gone philippa said you like my mother dont you logan hepburn he turned his blue eyes to meet her gaze aye i have always liked your mother lass philippa was very curious when did you first meet her i first saw your mother when she was bessies age he answered her she was married to hugh cabot then was she not not the summer i first saw her but soon afterwards he told the girl looking to edmund and tom for guidance but they said nothing nor gave any indication that he should cease his tale then when your mother was widowed i came courting but she had gone to court and when she returned she was betrothed and about to wed with your good sire owein meredith and sadly she was widowed again why didnt you come courting then my lord philippa pressed him i did but i did not approach your mother properly she turned me away and went up to edinburgh he explained and she fell in love with uncle patrick but he has forgotten her now she is always very sad my lord do you wish to court her again logan heard his two male companions chuckle softly he swallowed hard not quite certain what he should say but philippa was not going to be denied an answer she stared directly at him her head cocked to one side questioningly aye he told the little girl i should very much like to court your mother and marry her lass but she is a prickly creature and i must move carefully this time for i do not want to lose her again you must not tell her this philippa do you understand why philippa nodded i will try to see she contracts no involvements while we are visiting king henry my lord my sisters and i are in agreement that mama is happier with a good husband than without one we think that you should do very well as our stepfather if of course you are in agreement astounded he nodded slowly aye he said then it is settled philippa told him and she arose from the high board mama will need my help i shall leave you gentlemen now and she glided from the hall with far more elegance than most girls her age had tom and edmund burst out laughing and the two men laughed until their eyes watered and their sides ached she has far more presence at ten than my own poor jeannie did at eighteen the laird of clavens carn said when his companions finally ceased their laughter gods blood i hope she will not tell rosamund of our conversation she wont edmund assured him she is much like her greatgrandmother my fathers wife was a woman of much good sense who liked to have her life and the lives of those about her well ordered philippa is the same she may look like her mother but she is nothing like her in character she will keep this conversation that you have had to herself until she feels the time is right to reveal it if indeed she ever does she is an unusual little lass logan said edmund arose from the table come with me logan hepburn and i will show you where you are to sleep this night good night tom lord cambridge stood up good night edmund logan he said and he strolled off to find his own bed in her rooms rosamund had gathered her two younger daughters to her and explained that they would be going to clavens carn for a visit the poor laird is very lonely without his wife and you will have his little lad to play with my darlings they nodded not objecting but they knew the truth for philippa had told it to them earlier she had also told them not to say anything to their mother for it would but distress her to learn that they knew she thinks we are still babies philippa had said when she had tucked her daughters into their beds rosamund went to help with the packing maybel was already gathering what banon and bessie would need i am frankly surprised at your good sense in allowing logan hepburn to watch over the lasses she said bluntly to rosamund i had to put aside my own feelings and think of what is best for my daughters rosamund answered her so maybel pounced you have feelings for the laird he still irritates me if that is what you mean rosamund said shortly but not so much tonight perhaps he was thoughtful and careful in his speech with me i could not fault him at all mayhap he has changed maybel suggested men rarely change after a certain age rosamund said dryly but that young wife of his god assoil her soul maybel said crossing herself may have taught him better he did not love her but it is said he liked her well enough you are getting as bad as tom with all your gossip rosamund laughed teasing her old companion i cannot believe that you are going away again maybel replied you never relished all this traveling about before now suddenly you are home but a short time and then you are off again i like it not i should have been perfectly content to spend the rest of my life at friarsgate maybel i have had more than enough of adventuring but i cannot ignore a royal summons can i but why has queen katherine summoned you the friendship between you is nowhere near that of your friendship with queen margaret maybel noted queen katherine does not need you as she once did when you were girls the summons may have the queens signature but it comes from the king i am most certain rosamund said the english ambassador in san lorenzo thought he recognized me we had never met but he had indeed seen me at court when i last visited tom tells me he has returned to england he probably remembered who i was and told the king henry tudor would have certainly been curious as to what i was doing in san lorenzo last winter with a scottish lord his curiosity is such that he will not be satisfied until he knows the answer to that question but he is a mighty king maybel said all of europe is at his feet right now he has won great victories in france and broken scotlands spirit at flodden why should he care about the answer to such a question rosamund because we were once friends maybel he will want to assure himself that i have not betrayed him in any way everything like that matters to him the smallest detail or fact consumes him it is his way will you tell him of the earl of glenkirk she asked i have no choice for lord howard will have certainly told him rosamund answered her could you not send him a message explaining maybel queried rosamund laughed i wish i could she said but the king will want to look into my face into my eyes as i relate my tale it is the only way he can be certain that i am still loyal to him henry tudor is a jealous man maybel it seems to me maybel muttered that he has changed little from that boy who attempted to seduce you beneath his own grandmothers nose oh he has indeed changed maybel power and wealth have brought about that change he wields both mightily even if beneath the surface he is still that bad boy rosamund said quietly maybel sighed i dont like your going she said nor do i but to disobey a royal summons would bring dire consequences upon friarsgate and i have spent my entire life watching over my lands i do not want to be forced into another arranged marriage with one of the kings men nor do i want philippa endangered i will go besides tom will be with me and you know how much he can amuse the king and queen i will be all right in the morning the laird of clavens carn prepared to take rosamunds daughters with him over the border into scotland they met unexpectedly in the great hall before the others had assembled she had just come from the mass i am glad we are alone he said i wanted to assure you that i will guard the lasses as if they were my own rosamund i know you will she said her insides were melting at the sight of those blueblue eyes as he looked at her when will you return he asked softly i do not know she responded honestly i do not really enjoy king henrys court but i cannot refuse my own queens call i suspect the king has learned of my sojourn in san lorenzo and wants an explanation henry tudor is a suspicious man always seeing demons where there are none to be found logan nodded understanding then he said rosamund i do not always speak with delicacy but might i humbly request that you contract no alliances while you are away i should like nay i should enjoy the opportunity to become your friend when you return my friend she looked at him askance he flushed realizing what he had said might easily be misconstrued your friend he repeated and perhaps a friendship between us could lead to a he hesitated afraid to say the word lest he frighten her off for good you wish to court me with an eye towards marriage she asked frankly aye and his look was one of such relief that she laughed then i will contract no unions while i am away logan but other than that i make you no promises do you understand me i am still not certain that i will marry again the smile she gave him was tremulous and brief he wanted to say that she had shown no hesitation with lord leslie but he did not he remembered seeing them together at stirling he had never in his life beheld such raw and unbounded love as they had exhibited for each other he had never imagined love like that existed but even if she never loved him like that he knew he wanted her as he had always wanted her he would accept what she had to give if indeed there was anything left in her heart i understand he told her i ask nothing and you render me no promise we shall begin anew and perhaps something good may come of it rosamund the hall began to be peopled now with servants and the children came eager and excited running to logan and bidding him a good morning rosamund was touched by the sight of it her daughters obviously liked the scotsman and that was to the good my lord my lord bessie was tugging at his sleeve she was the daughter most like owein meredith with her soft blond hair and grayblue eyes yes bessie he asked her what is it lass may i take my puppy with me my lord the terrier that uncle tom gave me for my natal day celebration she was holding a small black and tan pup in her arms logan leaned down saying as he did he doesnt look very big bessie i suspect he wont take up a great deal of room and he would be very lonely without you aye we must take him does he have a name yet his big hand stroked the pups head and the puppys tongue licked at his fingers he is tam for my uncle tom bessie answered well put him in a small basket lass and you will carry him yourself on your pony the laird told her with a smile he is a very kind man mama philippa murmured coming to her mothers side i do believe banon and bessie will have a fine time with him yes her mother said nothing more she was suddenly seeing logan in a new light perhaps jeannie god assoil her soul had indeed civilized him after the morning meal they prepared for the lairds departure in the courtyard the girls already mounted upon their ponies logan said to rosamund i will return tomorrow with the men i intend to watch over friarsgate as well as those i choose to escort you south i would leave tomorrow but i will travel only as far as my uncles monastery tis a good plan young mistress philippa should not be tired her first day on the road he answered she nodded in agreement and looking about said i see no one upon the hills spying on us yet nay i sent my men early to see what was happening and as we suspected your cousin hasnt gotten himself together yet i think we may both make our getaways before he is aware you and your daughters are gone logan said i thank you for your hospitality rosamund bolton then he mounted his stallion and moved to the front of his men and they moved off rosamunds daughters in their midst the cart with the childrens belongings and two servant girls following rosamund waved to banon and bessie but after a cursory salute the two little girls were more intent on what they perceived as the adventure ahead than their mother behind rosamund felt tears coming oh dear she said brushing them impatiently away they are only going to clavens carn mama philippa said you are not losing them forever you know rosamund laughed a watery laugh philippa you have such common sense i do not know where you got it from but i am glad edmund says i am like my greatgrandmother philippa told her mother they spent the day completing the arrangements for their journey several of rosamunds gowns had been altered and remade at toms direction so she would not appear unfashionable at court philippas gowns from the previous year at the scots court were also remade and a third gown was added to her wardrobe the proper accoutrements and jewelry were chosen and packed i wish i could go with you this time my lady annie said wistfully she was again with child and her son was not yet weaned lucy suits me rosamund told her tiring woman you have trained her well and you can be proud of your little sister but she gets to go to court annie bemoaned her fate i should like to go again rosamund laughed there is no pleasure in all that traveling as you well know annie or have you forgotten so quickly her mistress teased her aye ive forgotten the trial of travel but i remember san lorenzo in the winter sunlight my lady annie said wistfully you have had the best of it annie san lorenzo and king henrys court and king james court god assoil his good soul rosamund told her annie nodded i have she agreed still i should like to see great harry in all his glory will you remain long no longer than i must rosamund said annie closed the trunk holding her mistress gowns which she had packed very carefully they say the lord of clavens carn would court you if you would allow it rosamund shook her head why was it the servants always knew what you did not want them to know i am on my way to london annie i have scarce time for a lovelorn scot now do i annie grinned at her mistress you was always one for keeping secrets she said no one can keep anything secret at friarsgate rosamund replied with a laugh logan returned the following morning bringing with him thirty men the younglings will remain at friarsgate to keep it safe the more experienced men i am sending with you he said how are banon and bessie she asked him anxiously tired after their ride yesterday but gods blood rosamund you have bonnie daughters theyve charmed my housekeeper already and johnnie is enchanted with them hes never had playmates before is he like you she asked him its like your bessie he looks like me but he is his mothers son with jeannies sweet manner about him he may change as he grows older but having never raised a lad myself i dont know if the girls become too much send for maybel she will keep them in order i thought it better she remain here as her absence would be more quickly noted than my younger daughters rosamund told him then she said i thank you again logan hepburn for the hire of your men and your care of my girls i will anxiously await your return he said i think i may miss your arrogance just a little rosamund said to him you are so polite with me it is if you are walking on eggs logan hepburn i am he replied i am attempting to prove to you that i am not a rough borderer a scots scoundrel as you once called me rosamund that i am indeed worthy of your hand if i allowed myself to revert to my former self i should seriously consider preventing your going i should sweep you into my arms and kiss you until you were weak then i should carry you to the church and have mata marry us he smiled just a trifle wolfishly but you prefer a more civilized lover so if i am to have any chance of winning you i must be the man you desire when we are at last wedif you will have me he amended then i shall become the man you need rosamund bolton he bowed then bent cupping his hands together to boost her into her saddle rosamund settled herself but her heart was hammering nervously yet when she looked down at him her amber eyes were grave yes she considered i do miss the arrogance and she smiled wickedly at him gathering her reins in her gloved hand golden brown velvet suits you he murmured taking her other hand and kissing it give my regards to your uncle richard madame be assured i will she responded and then she kicked her mount moving away they traveled as far as st cuthberts monastery where rosamunds other uncle richard bolton was prior they were welcomed into st cuthberts and settled into the guesthouse for the night prior richard invited them to dine with him in his private dining chamber she had not seen this uncle edmunds younger brother in well over a year so niece while my brother has kept me well informed i am surprised to see you once again journeying down to court i did not consider you particularly interested in that sort of life the prior said i am not but the queen has summoned me and i thought it an opportunity for philippa to be introduced to her and presented to the king in too few years uncle i must find a good match for my daughter the prior nodded yes he agreed philippa is indeed growing up he turned to the little girl you have no desire to serve holy mother church my child only in the capacity of a wife and mother my lord prior philippa answered him politely richard chuckled you have done well with her he said edmund says she reminds him of her greatgrandmother rosamund answered him with a smile yes the prior replied thoughtfully our fathers wife was a woman of good sense and good heart she treated all her husbands sons equally though it surely must have been difficult as edmund and i were bastards still she loved us the same and she chastised us the same now why has queen katherine called an unimportant northern landowner to court rosamund explained to her uncle why she believed she had been summoned you must be very careful the prior advised her then he smiled at philippa my child go with brother robert he will show you about my little realm before it is too dark you will not have time in the morning if you wished to speak with my mother privily philippa said you had but to ask my lord prior i am asking he responded not in the least ruffled by her boldness when the young girl had gone the prior spoke seriously to his niece you were the kings lover he is bound to be jealous of your relationship with the earl of glenkirk you must deal with him most skillfully if you are to escape his wrath rosamund uncle the king does not care about me he simply wished to accomplish what he had earlier set out to do but nonetheless i know he will be curious as to why i was with patrick he will not be satisfied until he knows the entire story you had some feelings for the king i am certain the prior persisted you have not the nature of a trollop or a courtesan and he would have had feelings for you for this king never does anything he cannot justify therefore he will have convinced himself that he was in love with you even if it was for only a brief time the fact that you did not remain in love with him when you parted will be your greatest sin in his eyes niece you must be careful how you present your relationship with your earl to him edmund said to see you with patrick leslie was something magical he said he had never seen such love between two people i am sorry for what has happened and there is no sign of his memories returning the moorish physician said if after a year or more nothing had changed it was very unlikely it would at least patrick remembered everything prior to his return to court he did not lose everything rosamund told her uncle richard leaned back in his chair but you did he said it broke my heart rosamund admitted but life must go on uncle mustnt it she smiled a small smile at him the laird is after her again lord cambridge volunteered cheerfully tom she was blushing richard laughed i am happy to hear it now niece all you must do is convince henry tudor that you are his most loyal subject and escape his clutches so you may come back to friarsgate i shall pray for you your prayers uncle will be my shield against the king she told him in the morning they began their journey in earnest traveling south deep into england it was even more exciting a journey than her travels into scotland philippa thought as they went there were neat little villages and charming towns the likes of which she had certainly never seen as she rode through england philippa began to realize just what being heiress to friarsgate entailed she suddenly understood the talk of a proper marriage she was not some simple village maiden she was the daughter of a knight who had been the loyalist of the kings men her parents had been wed at a kings command and now she was going to court to be presented to their majesties to be shown off by her mother and to attract a family with an eligible son she might be only ten years old but she was the heiress to friarsgate and in a few more years she would be ready to marry philippa sat her white mare proudly after many long days of travel they arrived in london and went directly to lord cambridges house on the river built of weathered brick it was covered in green ivy and stood four stories high from its entrance to its gray slate roof watching them pass through the iron gates the gatekeeper doffed his cap at them they rode up the raked gravel driveway through the green park the first week of june had already passed and the air was warm the front door to the house opened as they approached it servingmen hurried out to unload the luggage cart as the majordomo bowing greeted them and ushered them into the house my lord we are relieved you have finally arrived he said you received my messenger yesterday tom said did you send to the queen to say the lady of friarsgate would arrive sometime today i did my lord the royal messenger came with a message not an hour ago i have it here my lord he handed lord cambridge a parchment the menatarms are ours and must be housed and fed please see to it and show lucy where her mistress and her mistress daughter are to reside the child is next to her mother yes my lord the majordomo said everything is as you would wish it he bowed neatly come dear girl and let us show philippa the hall tom said if it is the same as otterlys hall uncle i know where it is philippa said excitedly running ahead of them you may know where it is my adorable one but the view the london view is magnificent tell me if you do not agree he said with a chuckle as they entered the room the chamber ran the length of the house it was paneled and at one end there was a large fireplace with iron mastiffs for firedogs the leadpaned windows running across one wall of the hall overlooked the thames river the ceiling was coffered and multicolored carpets covered the wide floorboards enthralled philippa ran to the windows staring openmouthed at the river with its busy traffic below rosamund found a chair and sat down looking to her cousin who was even now opening the message from the palace what does it say she asked him he scanned the parchment rapidly then looking up said her majesty welcomes you back to london you are called to court tomorrow before the noonday meal it is not particularly informative dear girl at least it doesnt tell me to report to the tower tom she teased him he laughed a bath that is what i need a bath an excellent meal prepared by my own chef and blessedly my own bed tonight mama there are two boats at a dockage at the waters edge philippa said they are barges my daughter the one with the blue velvet trappings is mine they are made fast at a quay which is pronounced key londons streets are narrow and the traffic can sometimes be difficult we find traveling by river to the palace far easier quicker and much more preferable oh mama there is so much i dont know philippa said nervously do you really think i am ready to go to court you are rosamund assured her child but perhaps not tomorrow tomorrow mama must go and see what it is the queen wants of her after i have done my duty philippa then i shall bring you to see what court life is all about and once i have had a day there myself tom chimed in i shall have all the latest gossip for you my little one rosamund shook her head grinning then she said very well cousin let us get down to business will you bathe before or after the meal the poor servingmen will be run ragged bringing us both hot water before he said i do not want the stink of the road interfering with my palate dear girl you on the other hand eat like the countrywoman you are i do not consider food a holy experience cousin rosamund told him they separated rosamund taking philippa upstairs to her apartment lucy was awaiting them and her enthusiasm at their quarters reminded rosamund of annies very reaction when she had come to court after oweins death the majordomo said this little room is for me lucy told them where am i to lay my head philippa asked why mistress philippa you have your very own room come and ill show you its right next to your mamas she led them into rosamunds bedchamber and after going to a paneled wall pressed a hidden lock allowing a door to spring open see its your very own bedchamber and you can see the river from the windows and she continued looking at rosamund there is no other entrance into this room but through your mothers chamber you will be as snug as a birdling in its nest rosamund realized she had not seen this door before or even known it was there there had been a tapestry covering the door she wondered if there was such a room at the greenwich house or at otterly still it was the perfect chamber for her young daughter to sleep in and its decor matched the rose velvet of her bedchamber several hours later as the twilight deepened they sat down to dinner in lord cambridges hall overlooking the river the cook had outdone himself there were large prawns in a mustard sauce and pickled eel there was a capon stuffed with apples raisins bread and sage a leg of lamb a game pie made with venison and another filled with pieces of duck in a red wine gravy there was a small country ham and a platter of asparagus in white wine along with bowls of peas and small whole beets there was fresh bread sweet butter in a stone crock and several cheeses and when the remains of the meal had been cleared from the table a basket of fresh strawberries and a large bowl of thick devonshire clotted cream was placed upon the board philippa was permitted just a small goblet of wine not watered she nursed it carefully sated tom pushed himself back from his table an excellent meal he told his majordomo tell cook i said so indeed my lord i will the majordomo looked to rosamund your bath will be ready in half an hour my lady he told her thank the men rosamund answered him i know the work involved in bringing the water upstairs and i appreciate their effort yes my lady the majordomo said from the beginning the lady of friarsgate had always been thoughtful of her cousins servants she was a most unusual woman i am so tired mama philippa said yawning then you shall bathe first my poppet her mother replied but bathe you will for you have not had a bath since we departed friarsgate while many in the court do not bathe regularly you will find the king has a most sensitive nose and is most put out when a courtier stinks what shall i do tomorrow when you go to see the queen philippa asked you shall stay in your bed resting from our journey and then you may walk in your uncles gardens the river is a most fascinating sight and you will enjoy it especially as it is summertime rosamund told her daughter finally the majordomo came to tell the lady of friarsgate and her daughter that the tub was now filled and awaiting them good night dear tom rosamund said to her cousin as she excused herself good night he called as they departed the hall sleep well cousin for tomorrow you must be at your best upstairs lucy had scented the bath with her mistress white heather and the room was perfumed with the smell help philippa first rosamund instructed her young tiring woman then she went into her bedchamber and sat in the window seat looking out over her cousins gardens and the river night had fallen and she could but see the lanterns in the boat traffic on the water she remembered the rather suggestive statues in the garden and smiled to herself it was unlikely that philippa would understand the nature of them and she would be able to observe well the male anatomy which would serve her in good stead one day tomorrow she thought would she see the king tomorrow they had parted on good terms she must assume that while he would be curious and perhaps even angry about her involvement with the earl of glenkirk he would forgive her if she asked him nicely nicely would it involve surrendering herself to him again to prove not just her loyalty to him but her devotion it was disquieting to even consider such a thing but she must look at her situation from all sides in order to be prepared for whatever was to come finally lucy came to her saying mistress philippa is tucked snugly into her bed my lady will you bathe now rosamund arose from her place by the windows aye but first let me bid my daughter sweet dreams she said she had not heard lucy and philippa come into her bedchamber to enter the childs room now she clicked the small latch and went into the little bedchamber herself the lock was most silent good night my darling she said to philippa dream only of good things and may the angels guard you i will mama this is the most wonderful bed uncle tom always has the nicest things about him aye he does rosamund agreed she bent and kissed her daughter mama the king will be kind to you wont he he wont put you in the tower philippas little face looked anxious no poppet rosamund assured her the king has always been most kind to your mama im sure he will be again then blowing out the candle on the little nightstand by her daughters bed she exited the room leaving the door ajar in case philippa would need her in the night lucy helped her to disrobe gathering her mistress traveling garments up carefully some will need washing others a good brushing my lady what will you wear tomorrow i cannot think rosamund said just hang my gowns in the garderobe you pick for me lucy and have the gown ready when i awake yes my lady the young tiring woman said then she helped her mistress into her tub well have to do your hair tonight my lady its full of dust and wont show to its best advantage unless it is clean youll want to make a good impression when you return to court tis said the king likes a pretty woman it is the truth lucy rosamund told the girl but remember that such thoughts are not voiced for fear of offending the queen queen katherine is a most genteel lady who expects decorum from the women around her long ago the king became involved with one of her ladies but which of a pair of sisters no one was certain both were wed and their husbands were important men with family connections both ladies were exiled from the court in disgrace and the queen was most distressed but worse their husbands were embarrassed before their king pretty women must be most circumspect around his majesty then rosamund settled back to let lucy wash her long auburn hair and when it was done and pinned atop her head rosamund washed herself quickly for the water was beginning to cool finished she stepped from her tub and lucy wrapped a warmed bathing sheet about her and then dried her with another towel still wrapped in the sheet rosamund sat down by the fire unpinned her hair and brushed it until it was dry then after slipping on a clean lacetrimmed chemise she left her dayroom where the tub had been set up and climbed into her own bed will that be all tonight my lady lucy inquired politely aye find your own bed lucy you are no less tired than the rest of us good night rosamund said and then she closed her eyes she was in london again something she had never considered tomorrow she would go to court and face the king tomorrow what would tomorrow bring and why was rosamund bolton of such interest to henry tudor well perhaps tomorrow would bring her the answers she needed despite her exhaustion she was restless for some time before she finally fell asleep chapter rosamund awoke to hear the birds singing in toms garden a warm breeze blew through the windows she yawned and stretched her limbs turning her head she looked through the halfopen door in the paneled wall philippa was still sleeping poor child rosamund thought it had been a long and hard trip for her but she had never once complained the return home was always easier rosamund considered she threw back the coverlet on her bed and arose then pulled the chamber pot from beneath her bed used it leaving it for lucy to empty then she went to the windows and leaned out sniffing the air which smelled so different from country air there was more traffic on the river than she had remembered the two barges made fast to the quay bobbed in the morning sunlight she turned back into her bedchamber went to the door of her daughters room and closed it softly good morning my lady lucy said coming in with a tray for her mistress she set the tray down on the table near the fireplace good morning rosamund responded philippa is still sleeping let her be until she awakens naturally yes my lady lucy responded now come and eat it is past eight oclock and you have not much time if you are to be at westminster on time rosamund sat down at the table nay she agreed it would not do for me to be late is lord cambridge up yet oh yes my lady and he is already driving his man to distraction with all his fussing about what he will wear today he wished to know what you will wear what did you choose lucy rosamund asked her tiring woman well my lady considering your position right now i thought it best to err on the side of flattery when you go to reacquaint yourself with the queen i chose a gown of tudor green for you lucy said it is a simple garment modest in its design for you do not wish to appear ostentatious i was not aware i had a gown of tudor green rosamund said slowly it is one that was made for you in san lorenzo i remade it with a more suitable neckline and sleeves lucy informed her mistress let me show you the tiring woman hurried from the bedchamber to return a moment later with the gown she spread it out for her mistress to view rosamund would not have recognized it for one of the dresses that celestina had made her but for the paneled underskirt with its delicate windflower and butterfly embroidery in silver matte threads gone was the bodice with the deeply scooped neckline and billowy sheer silk sleeves in its place was a bodice with a squarecut neckline the sleeves now tight at the wrist with silver embroidery and covered by wide new sleeves of the same silk brocade as the gown with large turnedback cuffs it was a gown made to suit the height of fashion you did this rosamund was very surprised yes my lady lucy said blushing with pride you are extraordinarily skilled with your needle lucy her mistress said thank you for you have rendered a gown otherwise unsuitable for england most suitable go and tell lord cambridges man that i shall be wearing tudor green lucy colored pleased by her mistress compliments ill be but a moment my lady and then we must get you dressed she said rosamund sat down at her breakfast table the cook had sent her a dish of eggs poached in a cream sauce flavored with nutmeg fresh bread butter jam and a mug of cold sharp ale finding she was hungry rosamund ate it all and drained her mug lucy was already back moving about her bedchamber and laying out petticoats and stockings shoes and jewelry she brought her mistress a bowl of warm water and a small cloth rosamund washed her face and hands then she scrubbed her teeth with the cloth and a mixture of pumice and ground mint she was proud of her teeth for unlike many others she had them all and they were white and even she donned her stockings petticoats and chemise next came her bodice with its beautiful sleeves now rosamund sat down so lucy might dress her hair properly the tiring woman brushed her mistress long auburn hair free of tangles it shone with rich color lucy thought it a shame that rosamunds hair must be hidden beneath a cap and a veil but that was the custom of the court she parted the hair in the middle gave it a final brush and then set a green silk french hood trimmed with pearls on rosamunds head back just enough so that some of her beautiful hair would show a sheer white silk veil was attached to the french hood i dont like these caps and veils lucy said you have such beautiful hair my lady tis the fashion and we must follow it rosamund replied lucy set a shakefold on the floor for her mistress to step into and then drew the hooplike contraption up she then carefully lowered rosamunds brocade skirts over her head careful not to jostle the french hood they settled over the hooplike shakefold giving the garment a graceful look the tiring woman quickly fastened the skirts there she said you look most proper my lady let me get your jewelry case rosamund chose a heavy gold chain of square links from which hung a gold and pearl crucifix she also slipped a long rope of pearls about her slender neck and several rings upon the fingers of both hands thanks to her cousin she had a fine collection of jewelry now she was no longer the little girl who had first come to court she was the lady of friarsgate a woman of property and some small wealth youll need no cape my lady lucy informed her the day promises to be warm and fair mama philippa stood in the doorway to her little chamber are you going to court now oh how beautiful you look i have never seen you in so fine a gown i was going to wake you before i left rosamund told the little girl you slept most soundly aye i was tired i did not know london was so very far from friarsgate edinburgh is not as far philippa said rosamund laughed i remember making the trip the first time when i was thirteen i thought we would never get here your father had been sent to escort me and he was very entertaining so i did not get discouraged or bored especially as it was the first time i had ever been away from my home overnight papa was always a great deal of fun philippa agreed i do miss him rosamund nodded thinking how much more simple her life would have been if owein had not died but then she should never have known her cousin tom or patrick leslie everything she was beginning to realize happened for a reason although the queen has sent word that i am welcome and she wishes to see me philippa her day is always a busy one i may not be recognized until late in the day and so i might not be home until long after dark lucy will be with you and you know your uncles servants as they have come from otterly rosamund explained to her daughter i want you to rest and enjoy the garden yes mama philippa said dutifully rosamund bent and kissed her daughters brow tomorrow i hope to bring you to court to meet the queen and mayhap even the king then she turned and hurried from the room and downstairs where she found her cousin awaiting her come dear girl or we shall be late he admonished her shall we each take our own barge she asked him of course he agreed we are back at court and who knows when either of us shall be willing to come home then he chuckled mischievously as he escorted her from the house and down to where the two little vessels waited bobbing in the morning sun wait for me if you get there first she implored him i would go in on your arm cousin of course dear girl he assured her helping her down into her own watercraft rosamund settled herself bidding her two rowers a good morning they returned her greeting and then loosing the little vessel from the quay they maneuvered out into the broad channel of the river and began their trip downstream to westminster palace both barges moved in tandem so that they arrived at the kings current residence together lord cambridge was on the royal quay in time to help his cousin from her transport together they entered the palace and as both had been there before there was no need to ask for directions to the queens apartments upon reaching it lord cambridge said to one of the guardsmen at the door lady rosamund bolton is expected by the queen then kissing his cousin on the cheek he told her im off to find some of my former playmates dear girl you can seek me if you truly desire to find me then with a wink he was gone the guardsman opened one of the tall double doors for rosamund and she stepped through into the queens apartments it was as usual filled with chattering women at first rosamund saw no one with whom she was familiar then a woman servant of the queens a mistress drum hurried over to her lady rosamund of friarsgate is it she said yes rosamund replied how nice to see you once again mistress drum will you tell the queen i have come yes my lady you may wait here among the magpies mistress drum bustled off across the chamber rosamund chuckled it was an apt description for all the women gathered in the queens antechamber she waited for some minutes and then mistress drum returned her highness cannot see you now my lady but she says you are to remain here awaiting her pleasure mistress drum reported here in the palace rosamund queried politely nay here in her antechamber mistress drum said apologetically she glanced about the room ah she said i see a comfortable chair there for you my lady and she led rosamund over to it then with a sympathetic smile she hurried off rosamund sat down she had no other choice and then she waited and she waited the hour for the main meal of the day came and the queen and her ladies glided through the antechamber on their way to the great hall rosamund stood up as the queen came into the room but passing her by katherine of aragon gave no indication that she even saw her old friend waiting she exited her apartments rosamund sat back down she had not been invited to the meal and therefore could not go the antechamber was empty now even of maidservants and it remained empty for the next few hours while rosamund continued to wait once she got up and went to the necessary returning quickly lest she be found gone she could see the progress of the day into early evening through the windows of the queens antechamber the long twilight deepened into night and rosamund remained seated finally the door to the room opened and mistress drum came back in the look on her face a surprised one for she had not expected to see rosamund still there you are still here my lady i think perhaps the queen has forgotten me rosamund replied quietly i shall find her at once and tell her you are still here the servant said obviously distressed that rosamund had waited all day she departed the chamber and when she returned she wore an even more distressed look upon her face i am sorry my lady the queen says you are to go home and return tomorrow thank you mistress drum please tell her highness that i shall return and wait upon her pleasure tomorrow rosamund said rising shaking her skirts and leaving the antechamber of the queens apartments she could feel her anger rising and she needed to leave the palace as quickly as possible what was the matter with kate that she had been treated in such an unkind fashion she had been sitting all day alone most of the time no one had spoken to her she had been offered no refreshment and then she had been summarily dismissed well tomorrow she would find out what it was all about but when rosamund returned the next day and the next she was treated in the same fashion she was made to wait the day alone without so much as a cup of water then she was sent home without any apology on the fourth morning when she arrived at westminster mistress drum greeted her with an encouraging smile she has said she will see you today my lady the servant informed rosamund then she lowered her voice ive been with her for years and ive never seen her be so unkind to an old friend its all right mistress drum rosamund replied softly it isnt always easy being a queen mistress drum nodded her head in agreement tis the lack of a child that troubles her muchly and her so devout and faithful too god will work his miracles in his own time rosamund said amen the servant crossed herself then she said youll have to wait again but it will be sometime today i promise so rosamund sat down in her chair to wonder again why the queen was being so rude it was not like kate as loyal as she was to her queen rosamund considered that she could be home now doing many other things it was a long and arduous journey from friarsgate and then too there was logan whom she had promised to allow to court her did she really want him do so why was everyone so determined she remarry how could she give herself to any man after patrick leslie she let her mind wander back to their sojourn in san lorenzo it had been the most perfect time in her life and she doubted anything could ever be as wonderful as those months she had had with him there and at friarsgate it had been a perfect dream the morning passed the queen and her ladies departed for the main meal of the day rosamund continued to wait and then in late afternoon the door to the queens antechamber opened and katherine of aragon entered the room she looked directly at rosamund and said come rosamund jumped up and followed her old friend into her privy chamber the queen whirled about and said in a cold voice how dare you ignore my summons of a year ago rosamund bolton i did not your highness rosamund protested i was not at friarsgate when your invitation came i was in edinburgh where i had gone to be married and did you marry the queen asked her dark eyes were unreadable nay rosamund said softly why not the question was snapped like a whip crack when i arrived lord leslie had suffered a seizure of the brain i spent over a month nursing him but his memory only partly returned he recalled nothing of the past two years he did not remember me we could hardly wed under the circumstances perhaps he had just changed his mind and the illness was his excuse to avoid marriage with you the queen said cruelly it seemed she wanted to hurt rosamund tears unbidden slid down rosamunds pale cheeks if you had seen him kate if you knew him you would understand why such a thing was not possible i have not given you permission to use my christian name the queen said i beg your highness pardon rosamund responded was this the same man with whom you whored in san lorenzo the queen queried yes rosamund said without hesitation there could be no convincing the queen of their love katherine was too devout a woman to comprehend that kind of passion you have no shame do you the queen said i should have never thought that you had the soul of a born whore when we knew each other as girls rosamund bolton rosamund did not answer even though they were alone it would do no good she quietly accepted the insult the queen would not remain angry forever did you enjoy whoring with my husband the queen suddenly demanded what rosamund was staggered by the queens accusation but no matter what happened she would never admit to katherine of aragon of her brief affair with the king it had been a private matter and few knew of it do you deny that you were my husbands whore when you last came to court the queen said furiously yes rosamund cried i most certainly do deny it how could you even think such a thing of me kyour highness i have it on the best authority the queen replied stonily whoever has told you this lied rosamund declared indignantly but she knew who had told the queen and the bitch would regret it why would a friend to me since my childhood a countrywoman lie to me rosamund bolton katherine said there was nothing for it rosamund thought she must take the bull by its horns now and reassure the queen regain her friendship for philippas sake i think i know who has told you this terrible untruth your highness i know she believed what she thought she saw and though i swore on the blessed virgin it was not so she said she would tell you i begged her not to for your sake your highness inez would not lie to me the queen responded now sounding a bit unsure inez was an old friend but then rosamund had helped her in her darkest hour why would she lie to me because inez thought it was the king with me that night it wasnt it was charles brandon we had had a harmless little flirtation and i was departing the next day we met to kiss and cuddle that was all there was nothing more serious than that your highness in the darkness of the hallway inez mistook charles brandon for the king i could not convince her otherwise though i certainly tried you know yourself that they are often mistaken for each other at a distance i begged inez not to distress you with her groundless suspicions she was insulting to me and now attempts to embarrass me publicly with her evil and slanderous tongue rosamund sounded properly indignant i want to believe you katherine said slowly madame i would have you believe me but whether you do or not my conscience is clear rosamund swore thinking as she did i am surely damned now i thought you ignored my summons last year because you were ashamed to face me the queen told her i returned from edinburgh brokenhearted your highness i threw myself back into friarsgate and its care i nurtured my daughters and oversaw their education i prayed for lord leslie i could not face the world and then the scots marched into england and we were at war i dared not leave friarsgate then i had to remain to defend my home from the ravages of the intruders but we were thank the blessed mother kept safe she crossed herself the queen sighed inez can be impetuous and she is very stubborn when she takes a position katherine reasoned i remember rosamund said and she smiled a small smile i am of a mind to believe you rosamund bolton the queen told her i would be most grateful if you did your highness if you remain angry at me you will not receive my eldest daughter philippa i have brought her with me to meet you she is ten years old and in another two years i must seek a good husband for her i thought it was time she gained a bit of polish oh the queen exclaimed excitedly i remember when your daughter was born is it really that long ago it must be if you say it is what is she like rosamund she looks like me rosamund answered the queen but i am told she is very much like her greatgrandmother a practical woman of strong common sense she is very excited about meeting you and perhaps even meeting his majesty katherine of aragon held out her hand to rosamund kiss my ring rosamund bolton i will forgive you she said and when rosamund obeyed the queen kissed her on both cheeks we are friends again the queen said bring your daughter with you tomorrow i will tell inez that she was indeed mistaken i have treated you harshly rosamund and i now regret it your highness is a busy woman i was content to wait for your notice rosamund murmured curtsying she was amazed that she had not been struck down in the good queens presence by her great lie still she had lied to protect the queens heart as much as to protect her own reputation perhaps it was not so terrible a lie and for some reason the memory of the kings grandmother the venerable margaret as she had been known popped into her head rosamund knew that that good lady would not have approved her affair but she would have thoroughly approved the lie to protect katherine the queen in order to produce an heir the queen must be happy with her spouse and she must be content with her life and those around her you may join your cousin in the great hall now the queen said we shall be here at westminster for only another couple of days the weather grows too warm for london and plague does tend to arise here in the summer months we are decamping for windsor the king does enjoy windsor in the summertime you will remain with us of course i am honored to be asked rosamund said but dear highness remember that i am necessary to friarsgate my bailiff uncle grows old and all my daughters need me i would hope when you prepare to move on from windsor i may be permitted to return home again should we choose a husband for you rosamund bolton while you are with us the queen wondered aloud you should have a husband i do not disagree madame but remember that the venerable margaret said a woman must wed first for her family and then was permitted to marry for herself a nearby neighbor has expressed an interest in courting me we have been known to each other since i was six years old when i was widowed before he sought my hand but i had already been promised to owein meredith rosamund explained smoothly the one thing she did not need or want was another husband chosen for her and there was no need for the queen to know her neighbor was a scot oh how exciting trilled the queen smiling is he handsome i suppose some would say it but his best feature is very very blue eyes rosamund answered returning the smile the queen nodded a man with blue eyes is difficult to resist she agreed the king has blue eyes yes i recall rosamund murmured not wanting to get any further into a conversation regarding henry tudor she curtsied again saying as she did with your highness permission i will go and seek out my cousin now of course katherine replied graciously you may give him my regards i have seen him in the great hall these past nights but have had no opportunity to speak with him a most amusing gentleman did i hear he had sold his estates in the south and moved north to cumbria to be near your family indeed madame he did rosamund replied it is comforting to have him nearby family is so important the queen nodded in agreement and taking this as her cue rosamund curtsied once again backing out through the door between the queens privy chamber and the anteroom that room was once again filled with chattering women and as she crossed it her eye caught that of inez de salinas rosamund smiled sweetly at her nodding in a friendly fashion restraining the laughter that threatened to burst forth from her at the look of surprise on the spanish womans face then she hurried to the great hall where she found tom dicing with some gentlemen seeing her he murmured something to his companions gathered his winnings and joined her together they sought a secluded spot where they might talk without being overheard she has seen you it was a statement not a question what excuse did she give for keeping you waiting for four days after demanding you come down from friarsgate he asked inez was all rosamund said what for a moment he looked puzzled but then as she explained it all became clear to lord cambridge again remember the night we left the summer progress several years ago to return home to cumbria remember what she saw and how i denied it naming another gentleman she did not believe me but i did think i had prevailed upon her to be silent she was not she ran rumormongering to the queen rosamund said and what did you do he asked her i denied it of course i will always deny it tom i was vulnerable he was allpowerful i could not refuse it was a supreme moment of weakness and i not only regret it but i am ashamed it ever happened though at the time it was exciting even if it was forbidden i will always deny it for i should never deliberately harm kate she is too important to england and he will certainly never admit to it even to his confessor i suspect he believes too strongly in his divine right rosamund smiled mischievously and she believed you he was anxious for her she wants to believe me rosamund replied but she will always be suspicious for that is her nature and inez has played on it but i have been no less duplicitous for i have played on her desire to retain our longstanding friendship she can never forget what owein and i did for her when she was in such dire straits we must help her believe you over inez lord cambridge said we must leave the issue alone rosamund said she has agreed to receive philippa tomorrow nay it will but take one small thing to make your lie more palatable to accept than inez de salinas truth he told her trust me in this matter cousin i am told the court is moving to windsor shortly rosamund said attempting to turn the subject did you know do you perchance have a house in windsor cousin she teased him he laughed nay but i knew and so i have reserved an entire floor of one of the towns finer inns for us we shall not be sleeping in a hayrick my dear girl the day moved into the summer twilight and the great hall began to fill with courtiers the women rosamund had known casually during her last stay at court now approached her and greeted her as if it were her first day back with them rosamund was gracious but amused it was obvious that her censure had now been officially lifted inez de salinas was not among these women and then suddenly charles brandon approached her smiling toothily my dear rosamund he purred like a large tomcat anticipating a meal of finch how delightful to see you returned to court he lifted her hand his gaze meeting her own startled one and kissed it retaining it afterwards and tucking it through his arm come my lovely and let us speak of old times and he led her off murmuring as he did try not to look so surprised my pet after all am i not an old lover rosamund looked up into the handsome face and her laugh tinkled loudly enough for the ladies left behind to hear it but then she said my lord please explain yourself your little prevarication must be made real to those who would gossip unkindly should it not rosamund bolton his dark eyes scanned her face aye you are very lovely what a pity you insist on sequestering yourself in the north i still do not understand my lord she told him i knew years ago just after you had gone he said the kings walter told me what had happened and requested that if ever asked i confirm your lie but no one ever asked until tonight when walter once again approached me he said this little charade would be necessary to convince a certain lady but she was nowhere near us rosamund replied trust me dear lady he told her the little incident is already being reported to her as we speak together you were surrounded by her minions were you not i owe you a debt of gratitude then charles brandon rosamund said quietly nay madame twas i who owed you but now my debt is paid in full i believe he said to her how is it you owe me a debt rosamund asked when you were a girl first at court in the venerable margarets care god assoil her good soulhe crossed himselfthere was a plot devised that prince henry seduce you perhaps you will remember it though i did advise against it i held the wagers i remember rosamund told him and i agree that we are now even my lord she chuckled softly i remember that my husband insisted you turn over the wagers to the kings mother for charitable purposes richard neville was very angry did you tell his father as you had threatened brandon asked her nay but i refused to sell him warhorses after that she said with a grin the horses owein raised and trained were most prized he laughed you may be a country lass madame but you were always a very clever one i believe we have now satisfied whatever curiosity there was about the gossip bruited about by senora de salinas he raised rosamunds hand to his lips once more good evening madame he said and with a bow he permitted her to move away from him first before he turned to find and rejoin his own friends in an instant lord cambridge was at her side my dear girl what was that all about you spoke to the kings man walter did you not tom rosamund queried him i am very much in your debt cousin for it i thought it the best way to stem any gossip and defeat inez de salinas wicked tongue he told her i know you like fighting your own battles rosamund but this was one engagement i felt must be won immediately for philippas sake rosamund leaned over and kissed her cousin on the cheek aye tom you were right rosamund agreed then she sighed may we go home now i want to tell philippa that she is to meet the queen tomorrow first you must pay your respects to his majesty tom advised her now that you have the queens forgiveness and friendship again he will know it and expect you to come to him rosamund sighed again very well but come with me tom i cannot face hal by myself especially after what has transpired in the last few hours i watched brandon he told her i thought he played his part quite nicely my dear girl a former lover hopeful of rekindling an old friendship and you were perfect surprised he would approach you but charming even as you rejected his advances it was well played out cousin i have taken part in enough court masques to know how to act my part tom she told him with a wicked smile come along now and let us greet the king they made their way through the great hall arm in arm reaching the foot of the dais upon which the kings throne was set rosamund curtsied deeply and her cousin bowed with his usual elegant flourish henry tudor viewed them through his small blue eyes she was lovelier than ever he thought he considered another liaison with her but then recalled that they had barely escaped exposure the last time only her quick wit had saved them but inez de salinas had attempted to make difficulties with rosamunds return she was foiled again by the lady of friarsgate and he had seen charles brandon play his part in the charade the queen was now fully convinced inez had been mistaken but inez was too stubborn or proud to admit to her error the woman would have to go back to spain shortly with her merchant husband he could not have katherine distressed you are welcome back to our court lady rosamund he said i thank you your majesty she replied then rosamund curtsied again and backed away from the foot of the throne with her cousin the king turned to speak with the queen as the lady of friarsgate and her cousin disappeared into the crowd my dear wife he said quietly i think marias sister must leave us soon the queen nodded as much as i regret losing another old friend my dear husband i believe you are correct inez has grown troublesome as she has grown older you will see to it then kate he asked i will henry she promised then she said rosamund has brought her heiress to court the little girl is ten now and rosamund would have her presented to us i have invited them for tomorrow henry will you receive the child too of course kate he told her with a smile having paid their respects to the king and the queen rosamund and tom departed westminster in their separate barges to return home to bolton house the night had already fallen but the moon silvered the thames river as they went philippa was already abed when they arrived and rosamund let her daughter sleep she knew the girl would not be able to go back to sleep on learning she was to go to court the following day to meet great harry and spanish kate the morning would be time enough philippa was more than ready and so was her wardrobe rosamund prepared for bed then after dismissing lucy she sat down in the window seat in her bedchamber that overlooked the gardens and the river below contemplating her day she realized again that the court was a dangerous place i should far rather face a pack of rampaging borderers she thought than have to spend my life dealing with those people life at friarsgate was far simpler everything was as it seemed poor inez de salinas would suffer the deceptions that had been played upon her this night because they all sought to protect katherine of aragon from heartbreak inez had once been her friend but in a moments time that all changed inez would be disgraced rosamund knew that wasnt fair but if she had admitted to her indiscretion with the king several years back rosamund would have suffered far greater difficulties inez in her great desire to protect her mistress would be penalized only for allowing her imagination to get away from her and persisting in it it was no great crime but it was an annoyance neither the king nor the queen wanted to be bothered by any longer inez had outlived her usefulness had it been known however that henry tudor and rosamund bolton had indulged their passionate natures in a brief affair rosamund would have not only lost the queens friendship and patronage but the kings as well henry did not want to flaunt his mistresses discretion was the key to success with englands king and rosamund had not fought so long and so hard to protect friarsgate impeded by her very sex to lose it and the kings friendship which was in the end more valuable than the queens no she thought to herself i do not like court nor do i like the person i become when i visit the court everything i do is controlled of necessity by others i have always hated other people running my life we will go home as soon as we can perhaps we will not even wait for the summer to end once philippa has met the king and the queen is there any reason for us to stay there was and she knew it rosamund had made her peace with queen katherine but she had yet to make it with the king he had not cajoled his wife into asking rosamund to court simply for social reasons lord howard had obviously said something to the king she thought she had seen him briefly tonight in the great hall but she was not certain of it and if it was he he had not noticed her the river outside lay quiet in the time between the two tides the water looked like a sheet of beaten silver there was no traffic to mar its surface now for it was very late there was the scent of roses and honeysuckle from toms garden it wafted into her bedchamber on the faintest of breezes it was a night for lovers rosamund thought to herself patrick she closed her eyes for a brief moment but the tears still pushed from beneath her lashes and slipped down her cheeks she sighed resigned and brushed the tears away with her hand the last time she remembered a night like this he had been with her he would never be with her again she knew it but still her heart had great difficulty accepting the knowledge but i have to accept it when i return home logan hepburn will come courting and this time i must either accept him or send him away forever i am not certain i want to lose logans friendship but i am also not certain i want another husband rosamund arose from her place by the window and found her bed she knew she would be awake all night if she didnt quiet her mind in the morning philippa came from her little bedchamber and climbed into her mothers bed good morrow mama she greeted her parent rosamund opened her eyes and drawing her daughter near kissed her cheek you are going to court today mistress philippa she said laughing aloud at the look of delight that suddenly appeared on her daughters face today philippa squealed excitedly you spoke with the queen yesterday oh mama why did you not wake me last night when you came home because my darling you would have never gone back to sleep her mother said what am i to wear philippa asked what time are we due will i meet the king too mama we will arrive before the main meal of the day so you may eat in the great hall rosamund said with a smile you will wear what you choose from among your gowns my child although i do think the lavender silk is very flattering with your hair and your skin philippa jumped from the bed i must have a bath she exclaimed you have said the kings nose is a sensitive one mama lucy she called lucy gracious mistress philippa the tiring woman said entering rosamunds bedchamber what is the matter i am going to court today lucy i shall wear the lavender silk and i want a bath philippa cried my lady lucy asked politely i think the violet brocade gown lucy it will blend nicely with my daughters wardrobe she finished with a smile yes my lady lucy chirped ill see to the bath right away philippa scampered back into her bedchamber and began riffling through her little trunk jewelry mama i have no jewelry how can i meet the king and the queen without jewelry but you do have jewelry my poppet her mother replied when you were born the kings grandmother sent you a broach of emeralds and pearls i brought it with me for you to wear and you will have a rope of pearls from my own jewels it shall be yours to keep philippa you will always remember that i gave it to you on the day you met king henry and queen katherine oh thank you mama philippa cried the bath was drawn and the young girl bathed washing her hair again and drying it in the open air as she sat in the window seat of her mothers chamber brushing her long auburn tresses rosamund used the bathwater after her daughter and while she bathed her cousin came to speak with her philippa will need adornment he said she has the broach the venerable margaret sent at her birth and i am giving her a rope of my pearls but she could use some pretty rings tom do you have something that would suit her he nodded ill give them to her before we leave what are you both wearing i would match my clothes to yours dear girl we should not clash on such a momentous occasion philippa will wear her lavender silk gown and i my violet brocade rosamund said do you still possess that burgundy short coat with the pleated back tom it would be quite marvelous you know my dear girl i have indeed taught you good taste over the years havent i it is the perfect suggestion i shall go and have my man prepare it now blowing a kiss at her with his fingers he left her to complete her ablutions when she finished bathing rosamund dried herself for lucy was busy helping philippa then she managed to don her own undergarments but lucy was necessary for getting into her gown a beautiful creation of violet silk brocade with a silverembroidered and quilted underskirt of a lilaccolored velvet the low square neckline of the dress was also embroidered in silver thread false undersleeves with slashings and frilled linen cuffs showed from beneath her wide violet brocade cuffs rosamund wore a violet silk french hood edged in pearls with a pale lilaccolored silk veil flowing behind allowing the fine color of her hair to show her squaretoed shoes were covered in purple silk little philippa was now brought forth in her lavender silk gown with its plain quilted underskirt of satin the long tight sleeves of the gown had small cuffs embroidered with tiny pearls the square neckline of her bodice was also embroidered in pearls about her waist was a twisted gold rope with a long tassel and her shoes matched her gown her hair was left long bound only by a lavender ribbon rosamund put a rope of pearls over her daughters head letting it fall on the girls flat bodice where she pinned the emerald and pearl broach in the center there she said you are quite elegant my child then she reached into her jewelry box and drew out the gold chain with its goldandpearl crucifix and a second rope of pearls and put them on on her fingers she affixed several rings satisfied they were both ready she said lucy put on a clean cap today you will come to court with us the young tiring womans mouth fell open in surprise i must change my gown she gasped is there time rosamund nodded and lucy ran off a lady should generally travel with her maidservant she explained to her daughter i have left lucy behind these last few days to watch over you as we have traveled simply from friarsgate without a large retinue today however she comes with us lucy quickly returned wearing a gown rosamund had not known her servant possessed annie gave it to me my lady she thought i might need something better than my everyday the dress was a silk one rosamund had given annie once it was dark blue with a plain bodice and single skirt the neckline was square as was the fashion it was edged in pleated linen lucy also wore a laceedged lawn apron and a matching cap she looked every inch an upper servant the three women descended into the hallway below where lord cambridge was now impatiently awaiting them he nodded with approval then said cousin you must take my barge with philippa and lucy it is larger and will accommodate you better i will follow in your little vessel come we will be late if we do not hurry philippa was almost sick with her excitement as they entered the spacious barge and began their journey downriver to westminster palace the river traffic had been interesting from the gardens of her uncle toms house but out upon the water it was even more exciting and fascinating she didnt know where to look next and she was joined in her enthusiasm by lucy rosamund pointed out interesting sights as they traveled but the tide was with them this morning and they were quickly at the westminster quay a manservant helped the women from their vessel onto the stone dock lord cambridge was right behind them philippa he said there was something i meant to give you back at the house he opened his hand to reveal several small rings there is a pearl an emerald a fine green agate and an amethyst to match your gown put them on my child all the fashionable court ladies wear a multitude of rings with a delighted smile philippa took the rings offered and put them on her hands holding them out to admire thank you so much uncle she said to him kissing his cheek do you think i should wear two on each hand i think three on your right handthe pearl the emerald and the agateand on your left hand wear the amethyst to display it to its best advantage put the pearl between the two green stones my child he advised her they entered the palace going to the great hall where the court would now be assembled to watch the king and the queen break their fast after the first mass of the day as they walked they were greeted bowed to and nodded to by many of the courtiers the lady of friarsgate was back in favor with the queen and the child with her was her heiress fathers with second sons eyed philippa and nodded the girl looked strong of limb and with all her wits she would it was rumored not only inherit from her mother but from her uncle as well the boltons were not a particularly noble family but they were landed gentry with a goodly estate and the queen favored them why do they all stare at me mama philippa asked noticing the interest in her small person you are my heiress her mother said softly you are already being appraised as a marriage possibility i know i must marry well one day philippa noted but i would hope to love my husband as you and my father loved each other i know i shall not find the kind of love you found with lord leslie but i remember my father well he had a great care and respect of you mama aye he did rosamund said remembering owein meredith her third husband and the father of her three daughters and deceased son he had been a good man and he had loved her as much as he was capable of it until they had been matched owein had spent all of his life but six years in the service of the tudors i shall not give you to just anyone philippa i will have to be satisfied that the man you wed does indeed care for you do not fear my daughter you and your sisters will go to good husbands i promise they were now in the great hall about them the courtiers milled waiting rosamund moved through the crowd until they were before the high board there she stopped waiting for the king and queen to enter the hall the trumpets sounded a flourish the people in the hall drew back opening an aisle down which great harry and his queen traveled smiling and nodding to those in the hall their attendants following them seeing rosamund and her daughter the queen stopped this is philippa isnt it she said with a warm smile welcome to our court my dear child philippa curtsied deeply replying a bit breathlessly thank you your highness henry here is the lady of friarsgate and she has brought her child to greet us the queen said softly to her husband henry tudor took rosamunds hand in his and kissed it we are happy to greet you again madame and your child then he turned his attention to philippa and he was all charm smiling down from his great height at the little girl why poppet you quite resemble your mama i see nothing of owein meredith in you but for your gentle manner you are most welcome to our court philippa meredith your sire was a fine man and a good servant to the house of tudor i believe he would be proud to have such a beautiful little daughter i know i would be we all pray for your majestys wish to be fulfilled philippa said tactfully the king lifted the little girl up so they were facetoface and then he kissed her cheek thank you my child he said as he set her down and then he moved on philippa almost swooned with her excitement he kissed me mama she trilled the king kissed my cheek the king can be kind philippa and he likes children you said the right thing to him and he will remember it you have his favor and that is important wait until i tell banon and bessie that the king kissed me philippa said they will be so jealous they were jealous when you decided to take me to court mama of course they were lord cambridge chuckled all little girls want to come to court it is every girls dream philippa but you must not boast and brag when we return to friarsgate but i can tell them that the king kissed me cant i uncle tom of course my child he told her then he turned to rosamund my friend lord cranston has a young son from a second marriage who is two years older than philippa i see him across the hall and i would like to introduce philippa to him she is too young for a match tom rosamund said of course she is he agreed but cranstons family is very well off and it cannot hurt for philippa to meet them when she is older and ready to wed can she not love a rich mans son as well as a poor mans son he teased her rosamund laughed but then she grew serious i hope to obtain a title for her she said there must be some poor earl whose heir could be matched with philippa provided they were suited to each other ah cousin you are more ambitious than i thought i am not unpleased but let me introduce philippa to lord cranston anyway he may be of help to us one way or another lord cambridge said and i do know an earl with a son who might do my lady a young page stood at her side yes rosamund replied the boy wore the kings livery his majesty would see you immediately i will escort you the page responded and i will take philippa off to be introduced about tom said keep your temper in check dear girl philippa my angel walk with your uncle i shall be the envy of every man here today philippa giggled and moved off with her uncle as rosamund turned and followed the boy in the tudor livery from the great hall chapter the little page led her from the great hall down one long corridor and into a narrower dimmer one finally he stopped before a paneled door and opening it ushered her inside i will wait outside to escort you back he said politely closing the door behind him rosamund looked about her it was a small chamber with a corner fireplace in which a fire was now burning warming the damp room the walls were of linenfold paneling the wellworn floor of wide boards was darkened with age there was a single leadpaned casement window looking out on an empty courtyard above which she could see the blue sky of the late june day the small courtyard itself was seasonless had she been a prisoner in this room she would have had absolutely no idea of the day the month or the time of year there were but three pieces of furniture a small square oak table and two chairs with high carved backs each containing a single tired tapestry cushion of an indeterminate color and design rosamund sat down and waited by now she was well used to waiting for tudor monarchs she thought to herself with a wry smile finally a door she had not even noticed for it was so well constructed and concealed opened in one of the walls and henry tudor stepped into the room had he gotten bigger she wondered until she realized that the design of his costume was meant to convey that very impression still a man who stood well over six feet needed little else to make an impression he looked straight at her with his small blue eyes as she came to her feet and made a deep curtsy well madame and what have you to say for yourself he opened the conversation forcefully what would your majesty have me say rosamund replied do not attempt to fence with me madame he thundered you have not the skill for it i am also not gifted with the long eye sire and so you must be more specific in your queries of me rosamund told him she was not afraid she should have been but she was not what was happening to her what would happen if the kings anger could not be stemmed henry tudor drew a deep breath and seated himself in one of the chairs stand before me rosamund he said she moved to face him now kneel he commanded her rosamund swallowed back her outrage and knelt before him now madame why did you go to scotland he said because your majestys sister invited me and as your majesty well knows queen margaret and i are friends from our youth rosamund responded and why did you go to san lorenzo madame it was my understanding that you disliked travel the king replied i went because the earl of glenkirk asked me to go rosamund said he was your lover it was not a question aye he was my lover rosamund told the king quietly i would not have expected such behavior from you henry tudor said primly i was to confine my whoring then only to your majesty rosamund snapped at him the floor beneath her knees was hard and she was becoming angry for all he was her king he was still a spoiled lad henry tudor jumped to his feet towering over her as his big hand gripped her arm yanking her up do not try my patience madame you well know how dangerous i can become when provoked the blue eyes met her amber ones rosamund pulled away from him then hal let us both sit down i will freely answer any question you have of me but this charade you attempt to play with me is both childish and hardly worthy of great harry her gaze did not waver beneath his he motioned her impatiently to one of the chairs seating himself in the other do not forget i am your king he growled i have never forgotten it hal he had not reprimanded her use of his name and so she continued it richard howard my ambassador saw you in san lorenzo the king told her i know rosamund answered san lorenzo is a tiny place my lord and there are no secrets there that can be kept for long lord howard recognized my face and was told my name he knew he had seen me before he said you lied to him when he asked if you knew him the king noted nay hal i did not lie he had seen me at court long ago and i had seen him but we had never been introduced so we could hardly know each other now could we the king emitted a short burst of laugher then grew serious once again what was lord leslie doing in san lorenzo he had been my brotherinlaws first ambassador there years ago why did he go back madame when the earl and i first met at stirling hal something odd happened to us we fell in love if indeed you believe in love but whatever happened between us happened we could not bear to be parted the scots court however was hardly the place for us to carry on our liaison any more than your court would have been the right place it was cold and snowy that winter the earl conceived the idea of taking me to san lorenzo where we might enjoy the warmth of the south and pursue our passion for each other you lived in the ambassadors residence the king said suspiciously still not convinced that her tale was completely innocent of deception aye we did it had been patricks home once and lord macduff insisted that we make it our home i saw no harm in it our apartments looked out over the town a charming place whose buildings are all the many colors of the rainbow hal we could view the blue sea from our terrace we had a large bath set out upon the tiled terrace and we bathed daily in the fresh air beneath the warm sun there were flowers in bloom in february it was a paradise rosamunds face was alight with the memory you were introduced to the duke the king said he was an old friend of patricks his court is very informal hal we visited several times meeting a famed artist from venice a german countess your own lord howard and many others our servants fell in love there and were wed in a chapel within the cathedral by san lorenzos bishop himself lord howard says this artist a relation of the venetian doge painted you without garments the king accused looking shocked the portrait that hangs in my hall hal is fully clothed the maestro painted me as the lady defender of friarsgate he made my home a castle which of course it is not i am surrounded by a sunset it is quite colorful rosamund said but then because she realized the king was very well informed added but he also painted me as a goddess i wore a greek chiton that left a shoulder and my arms bare he vowed he wished to keep that painting for himself which is why he also painted the other that portrait now hangs in the great hall of the duke of san lorenzo madame lord howard informs me that your naked limbs can be easily seen through the diaphanous draperies you have called a costume and that one of your breasts was quite bare henry tudor sounded outraged what the surprise on rosamunds face convinced the king that her own tale was true as far as she knew the maestro sold the goddess painting to the duke then she burst out laughing the duke hal is a man of vast appetites where women are concerned he would have enjoyed seducing me but that i would not have it and the artist as well these men from the south are quite different from us i fear it took all my wits about me to prevent a disaster she concluded then she said my cousin tells me that lord howard is back in england he is not a good ambassador hal he is much too abrasive and rude he quite irritated the duke when you returned in late spring you went back to my sister did you not he ignored her remark about richard howard it was not necessary rosamund know that duke sebastian had sent him home to england for the very qualities rosamund mentioned it had been most embarrassing especially as the duke had sent a message with lord howard saying he wanted no further english ambassador in san lorenzo aye i had promised meg i would she had been delivered then of her son rosamund answered him let him ask what he would she would volunteer nothing unless asked the boy he is truly healthy the king inquired rosamund nodded he is strong of limb and heart and mind hal your nephew is what the scots would call a braw laddie and after you had paid your compliments to my sister you returned home alone i returned home with lord leslie rosamund said we decided that we would wed even though both of us had estates that must be husbanded we thought we could spend part of each year at friarsgate and part of the year at glenkirk do the high and the mighty not travel between their lands yet he left you the king said in the autumn to return to glenkirk he wanted his son and heir adam leslie to know what it was he intended doing he wanted adams approval for he had been widowed since his sons birth if he was a capable bed partner and i must assume he was madame then i am certain his son would not have been pleased by the thought of having to share his inheritance with another child of his fathers making the king remarked patricks seed was no longer potent due to an illness years before rosamund explained there was no danger of another child to supplant his grown son and yet he was a passionate lover for i know none but could satisfy you rosamund the king noted rosamund flushed continuing with her story we were to meet in edinburgh in the spring i arrived to discover he had suffered a seizure of the brain though i nursed him until he was able to travel not all of his memory returned he had completely forgotten the last two years of his life he did not know me at all there was no possibility under such circumstances of our wedding her amber eyes glistened with tears as she spoke now his son keeps me informed as to his health however you are yet in touch with my sister the king asked she sent to me warning of the war to come rosamund said you should not have encouraged king james to war hal i henry tudor sounded outraged with her accusation james stewart was a good king hal he was a good husband to your sister and she loved him dearly you forced his hand because you were jealous of him do you seek to visit the tower madame the king said coldly i say to you the things that no others dare she agreed but you need to hear them hal james stewart marched into england hoping to lure you home from france but instead you sent suffolk to engage him in battle but for an accident of fate scotland would have beaten you what accident no one had told him this they had only trumpeted victory the scots phalanx broke on a slippery muddy hill she said knowing he would understand the rest it was obviously gods will that we prevail against the scots the king said piously and he crossed himself god is on my side rosamund he always will be if your majesty says so she murmured her head bowing but now madame what am i to do with you he wondered i came to court for two reasons hal she said because i was summoned and because i wished to introduce my heiress to your majesties i would return home now nay not quite yet he told her i am not satisfied that your conduct in the matter of this scot was not treasonous madame gods wounds rosamund swore you know very well it was nothing more than i have told you hal when have i ever been duplicitous with you with your queen aye but only to protect her but never with you i think you should accompany the court to windsor he said smiling suddenly no her look was angry you do not believe that we may have certain unfinished business between us madame he demanded of her nay i do not her color was high now reaching out the king pulled her from her chair and onto his lap his big hand caressed her heartshaped face and then he kissed her a passionate kiss his mouth demanded far more than she would ever again give him rosamund jumped from his embrace like a creature afire hal are you mad i have but only convinced the queen i was not your mistress but rather charles brandons lover and you would attempt seduction do you know how fortunate we were in our brief encounter that we were not found out given the example of the ladies fitzwalter and hastings if inez de salinas had not seen us parting that night we might have escaped detection altogether but we did not and i have had to weave a tapestry of lies to protect kate who is my friend do not do this to me i will not have it i am your king madame he thundered at her and i am your majestys most loyal servant rosamund said curtsying but i will not again be your majestys whore imprison me if you will for it but i will not yield what is left of my virtue and my dignity how can you even ask it of me hal especially when i strove so hard to protect your reputation with your good queen she saw the look blooming upon his face he would want to put his bad behavior on her for in his own eyes henry tudor did no wrong madame he began but she stopped him making it easy if i have misled your majesty in any way i humbly apologize for it it was not my intention at all to be provocative or lewd rosamund said stepping back from him and curtsying once more i beg your majestys pardon he was silent for a long moment and she knew he was considering the situation from all possible angles how could he keep his sweets and yet eat them all up it obviously proved too much of a conundrum even for him you are forgiven madame nonetheless i would have you come to windsor for kates sake of course inez de salinas has been sent away at last your return gave me the opportunity to rid us of her and for that we thank you i know you will want to return home to friarsgate from windsor and you have our permission but bide a few weeks with us who knows when you will come to court again perhaps never hal but my philippa will certainly come rosamund said he nodded your daughters will always be welcome at our court he told her thank you your majesty she replied you may return to the great hall now madame he said rosamund curtsied again and began to back from the room you should really have another husband the king suddenly remarked do not attempt to shackle me to anyone hal any bridegroom foisted upon me will not live to see the morning after the wedding she warned him i am your king madame i have the right to choose for you if i would i have wed thrice for the pleasure of others hal rosamund replied it was your own grandmother god assoil her good soul who said that after a woman had done her duty she had the right to marry for love will you find love again rosamund he asked perhaps hal i will be fortunate she said and then she opened the door and slipped into the hallway where the little page awaited her rubbing the sleep from his eyes for he had been dozing on his feet she smiled and patted his blond head take me back to the hall lad she told him and she followed in his wake as he went she had scarcely arrived back at her destination than tom was at her side philippa was not with him where is philippa she asked i have introduced her to several young ladies all close to her in age he said a young girl should not be shackled at court to an older relation now tell me at once dear girl what has happened he led her to an alcove where there was a bench and together they sat there is little to tell rosamund began he demanded to know why i had gone to scotland and san lorenzo lord howard had indeed reported my presence there with patrick i explained all but i will admit to keeping it as simple as possible then he thought perhaps we might take up where we had left off no lord cambridge actually looked shocked though he should not have been surprised i have dissuaded him of course tom but he would have us come to windsor he says we may return home from there but we must bide a while rosamund explained actually her cousin replied if you departed now it could cause gossip to arise especially as inez de salinas has been sent publicly from court they say she and her husband will leave for spain soon ostensibly to visit her elderly parents and a few weeks of the courts amusements will not harm philippa she can make some valuable connections rosamund just recall your own stay as a girl there are few who can claim a friendship with two queens but i have no friends at the court rosamund said it is time then that you made some he said i dont intend returning if i can possibly help it she told him but philippa will return and it is probably from those who people the court that we will choose philippas husband rosamund it cannot hurt you to make friends he explained patiently his cousin had always preferred her own company and that of a few relations over strangers but that needed to change i suppose you mean to introduce me to some people she grumbled at him tom grinned at her my habits dear girl may not conform to most but i assure you i know many people of the right sort i am considered witty and amusing you know he said mischievously now that you have concluded this business with both of our dear monarchs and you have been commanded to windsor it is time for you to meet others of your own kind cousin how do you expect to find the right husband for our philippa if you do not mingle among the nobility she laughed that is the difficulty tom i think philippa too young for a proposed marriage of course she is he agreed but it will take us two or three years to find the right connections and then another year for philippa to decide which among her suitors will please her these things must be done delicately and with finesse my dear girl one does not purchase a pig in a poke rosamund you make it sound so calculated tom she told him it is he agreed but i want philippa to fall in love and be in love forever rosamund said if only life were that simple my dear girl with luck she will indeed love the man she marries before they wedif they have the time to know each other but more than likely that love will come afterwards your marriage to your cousin was arranged to keep friarsgate in the family your marriage to hugh cabot was for the same reason you were too young to know of love then but when you were wed to owein meredith you did not love him did you rosamund shook her head but you came to love him because he was a good man and he respected your position as the lady of friarsgate with careful planning dear girl we shall gain the same good fortune for philippa but unless we begin our search now what chance have we and do not i pray you bring up the love that you and lord leslie shared cousin it was unique and rare few in this world have such love i know she whispered to him feeling the tears coming again dear cousin tom said and he brushed the tears from her cheek be grateful that you knew such love but also be sensible where your child is concerned rosamund nodded i will meet these people you seek to introduce me to she said with a small smile but can i meet them another day i have had all i can bear today cousin i want to go home and sit out in your garden to watch the river and think mayhap of your brazen scot he teased her aye she said surprising him take your own barge dear girl i will return later with lucy and philippa he told her rosamund leaned over and kissed her cousin on his smooth cheek what dear tom she said should i ever do without you if the truth be known dear girl he responded i shudder to even contemplate it and he grinned rosamund arose do not remain too late she said it is philippas first day and we will be leaving shortly for windsor he nodded then watched as she departed the great hall rosamunds little vessel was brought to her and after entering it she sat down on the blue velvet bench and closed her eyes take me home she told her rowers the air was warm as they rowed but some of the smells in the air were distinctly unpleasant as the barge moved along her servants rowed in midriver as the tide was low now and the mudflats along the bank were visible to the eye and discernible to the nose rosamund sighed to herself the worst was certainly over now she thought and having thought it found herself longing for friarsgate but tom was right if she was to one day see her daughters matched with men of eminent families she must socialize and make contacts now a smile touched her lips as she considered that just a few short years back she had been considered a girl now she was a woman of twentyfive widowed thrice and looking for husbands not for herself but for her three daughters yet the need for love had not deserted her surely not rosamund knew she was lonely but did she want to marry again did she want logan hepburn it seemed she had been running away from him her whole life or he had been running after her she hadnt of course nor had she even known of the hepburn of clavens carn until gods wounds was it that long ago that he had sat his horse atop a hill overlooking friarsgate and told her he wanted her for his wife eleven years nay it could not be eleven years ago it had been just before she married owein and philippa was now ten years of age the realization dawned upon her it was indeed eleven years ago that she had sparred indignantly with him and forbade him to come to her wedding but he had of course with his brothers in tow they had brought whiskey and salmon and they had played their pipes for the bride and groom eleven years yet she did not know him not really she knew he was determined and that he was stubborn she knew he had been willing to let his lands go to his brothers sons rather than marry another for her for rosamund bolton never before had she considered logan hepburn in any other way but an annoyance she had called him a crude borderer a scots scoundrel and she had meant it she had dismissed his offer of marriage because rather than saying he loved her he had talked about sons when she had upbraided him for it he had claimed that he had always loved her that he had thought she knew it but he had not said it and until this moment she had not understood that a man who was willing to give up his birthright for a woman did indeed love her i have been a fool rosamund thought silently but it still did not answer the question of whether she was willing to remarry and all of her newfound knowledge would not answer that question she needed to get to know this man she had been so busy scorning out of pride that she could not comprehend the depth of his devotion to her he would be awaiting her return she knew and suddenly she was more anxious than ever to return home but if he won her would he be satisfied with his victory or would that victory merely cause him to lose interest rosamund felt her little vessel bump the stone quay of her cousins house she opened her eyes blinking once or twice to clear her vision as the sunlight filled her sight she took the servants offered hand and stepped up from the craft then hurried into the house the summer gardens held no interest for her today she needed to think if she was going to allow logan hepburn into her life they were going to have to get a few things straight before anything progressed beyond friendship she remembered how kind he had been with her daughters and how they all liked him well that was one point in his favor she considered but he was still a scot and there was certain to always be difficulties between england and scotland yet would that matter in their tiny corner of the world she wondered lord cambridge and philippa arrived home as the long summer twilight was beginning to deepen into darkness rosamunds daughter could hardly stop talking of the sights she had seen and the people she had met we are going to windsor mama arent we cecily will be at windsor her family always goes on progress philippa said and who is cecily rosamund inquired smoothing her daughters disheveled hair is she someone uncle tom has introduced you to my daughter she is cecily fitzhugh mama her father is the earl of renfrew she has two brothers henry who is the heir and giles and two sisters mary and susanna they are younger than cecily who is the oldest girl we have become best friends gracious rosamund laughed all in a single afternoon poppet philippa ignored her mothers teasing saying it is her first time at court too mama she has been left at home with her little sisters in the past her brother henry is one of the kings gentlemen and her other brother is a page we both like to ride well rosamund said it would appear that you have had a fine day philippa but it is your bedtime now run along with lucy i will come and kiss you good night without protest philippa obeyed her mother and what have you been doing alone and by yourself lord cambridge asked his cousin i have been thinking of logan hepburn tom and whether i do indeed want to remarry and if so whether it is he i want to wed rosamund said frankly and what have you decided he asked i do not know she answered i need to really get to know him tom i will not remarry simply for the sake of having a husband do you understand that he nodded i do still i think you wise to reconsider your former position on the matter cousin what you mean she teased him is that you think i am becoming too long in the tooth for another husband i am after all twentyfive now he laughed you will never be too old for another husband rosamund you are too fair and too clever by far why if i were a man to take a wife i should seriously consider you above all women he told her why tom that is a lovely thing for you to say to me she exclaimed alas i am not a man for a wife he told her with a smile it would be so simple if you were she considered it most certainly would not dear girl your laird once threatened to kill me if i admitted to being your lover lord cambridge said with a shiver of remembrance he was very fierce and i quite believed him now it was rosamund who laughed then she said tell me about the fitzhugh family to whom you have introduced my daughter tom they sat companionably in the great hall of the house ensconced in the window seats overlooking the river as they spoke edward fitzhugh is like your owein of welsh descent his holding is not large it is in the marches between england and wales his wife anne comes from a good family of english landed gentry in hereford her dower was more than generous for her family was delighted to have made a match with the son of an earl ned was the third son he was never expected to inherit but both of his brothers predeceased him the eldest from plague one summer the second son returning from spain where he had made a match the ship upon which he traveled went down in the bay of biscay in a storm the old earl died shortly thereafter they say of a broken heart and his third son inherited ned had been educated for a time with the king for it was thought he might take holy orders one day when he became the earl of renfrew he used that ancient connection to bring his family to court his lamented second brother had been betrothed to a distant cousin of queen katherines the family is also devout so the queen favors them it is said that little cecily will eventually be offered a place in the queens household as a maid of honor she is too young now of course but if she and philippa remain friends your daughter might also serve as one of the queens maids of honor one day thomas bolton you are amazing rosamund said admiringly how on earth do you know all of this i do believe you have surpassed yourself this time with your intimate knowledge of others nonsense dear girl he said delighted with her words the countess of renfrews father knew my grandfather in london eons ago they had some dealings that turned out well for both of them but especially for the countess papa the connection has been kept i was even invited to the earls wedding to his wife years ago when he was simply a third son i was generous in my gifts after all dear girl one never knows you are thinking of the second son for philippa arent you rosamund said lord cambridge nodded giles fitzhugh is fourteen now he is still involved in his studies and he is serving the queen he will soon be too big for her household ned tells me and will not return to court in the autumn he will be sent to france and then to italy to study his brother is sixteen and has served the king since he was six he will be married in august to a welsh heiress giles for all his halfnoble bloodlines has a bent towards business philippa will need a husband who understands such things what if his brother dies rosamund asked is that likely to happen again tom said besides the heirs bride is already with child both fathers wanted it that way rosamund was somewhat shocked i should certainly not allow my daughters she began but he waved away her indignation this was a unique case dear girl ned wanted to be certain that his eldest sons heir followed them the brides father wanted the title for his daughter both the young people healthy and lusty were content to comply with their parental demands he chuckled with a wink it could be a girl rosamund said dryly it could tom agreed cheerfully both fitzhugh sons however are praise god healthy the heir will continue to get children on his bride until there is a son or two perhaps even three what if philippa and this boy do not get along rosamund asked they have not even met yet dear girl that will happen at windsor but our lass is only ten and the boy is not ready by any means for a betrothal this is merely a small fishing expedition at best i know other families with eligible sons rosamund nodded but after windsor i want to go home i have some business of my own to take care of tom and before we depart london we must meet with your goldsmiths and choose a factor for our little venture agreed he said tomorrow after we deposit philippa with her new friend we shall complete our own business dear girl and when i get home i must go to leith to see how our ship is coming along i should like to call this first vessel after you cousin i think i have a better name than mine dearest tom she told him i think we should call our ship bold venture for it is indeed a bold venture that you and i undertake he nodded aye i like it bold venture aye he agreed the following morning they took philippa to court leaving her with lucy to find cecily fitzhugh they then went on to goldsmiths row where the banking of the day was conducted lord cambridge introduced his cousin to master jacobs his goldsmith rosamund put her signature upon a piece of parchment several times so the goldsmith would have it to compare with any message purporting to come from her lord cambridge had brought master jacobs a copy of his last will and testament for safekeeping and so that the goldsmith would know that rosamund and her daughters were his heirs he brought the agreement they had both signed for their enterprise giving the goldsmith a copy of it too my cousin and i will both be depositing funds and withdrawing them master jacobs he told the goldsmith lady rosamund is a large landowner in cumbria where i now make my home what will you use the ship for my lord the goldsmith asked we will export my cousins woolen cloth to europe there is none finer and the friarsgate blue will be the most sought after tom explained what will your ship return with in exchange the goldsmith inquired tom rosamund said we have not considered another kind of cargo we cannot have our vessel returning with an empty hole there is but halfprofit in that i have relations in both holland and the baltic my lord my lady for a small percentage of your profits they could fill your ship for its return journey master jacobs said it can be nothing that stinks rosamund said we would never get the smell out of the wood of the hole the next shipment of cloth would pick up the aroma no hides or cheeses wine wood pottery gold but nothing that would leave a noxious fragrance my captain will have such orders master jacobs he will take no cargo that smells of course my lady now i comprehend your need for a new vessel the fee i suggest is fifteen percent he told her smiling it is a modest fee rosamund shook her head nay she said in a hard voice it is too much twelve he countered and seeing the look in her eye quickly said ten is the lowest i can go my lady his mouth puckered nervously eight percent and not a penny more master jacobs i am being generous with you for the sake of your longstanding arrangement with my cousin we have built the ship grown the wool and woven the cloth the risk is all ours eight percent for bringing in return cargo is more than fair the goldsmiths pursed lips turned up into a smile agreed my lady he said then he turned to lord cambridge she both bargains and reasons well old friend indeed she does tom said proudly what are we to do about a factor rosamund asked him when they were once more in their barge on the river i think there is time for that lord cambridge said thoughtfully perhaps we need not find someone on this visit to london my instincts tell me to wait your instincts have always proven reliable before rosamund said we will wait the following day the court decamped westminster palace and london for windsor where the king was looking forward to a summer of hunting in his green park they rode with the royal progress lucy toms man and the cart with their belongings mixed in with the baggage train and their own menatarms philippa rode with her friend cecily fitzhugh and rosamund and tom with the earl and countess of renfrew the earl was a large man with gray eyes and sandycolored hair his wife was petite and darkhaired with fine blue eyes i remember your late husband sir owein ned told rosamund as they traveled he was an honorable man and a devoted servant to the house of tudor i too have welsh blood owein barely remembered the place of his birth my lord he went into service as jasper tudors page when he was but six rosamund told her companion my wife and i spend more time at court now than in the marches the earl admitted our son and his wife need to learn how to manage the family estates it will be theirs one day tom tells me you have a large holding in the north friarsgate rosamund said my parents and brother perished when i was three i became the heiress to friarsgate philippa is my heiress i have land cattle and many sheep my lord now tom and i have begun a new venture exporting my fine woolen cloth we are building our own ship for the cloth must be transported carefully and your daughter will inherit all of it one day the earl said aye rosamund replied her second sister banon will inherit otterly from tom as for my youngest daughter elizabeth she will be given a very large dower portion i seek a title for her the earl of renfrew nodded understanding completely family connections were very important my second son giles he began rosamund interrupted him philippa is too young my lord for me even to consider it yet but i thank you when she is old enough in another three years perhaps your son will still be available and we may speak you are a good mother the earl told rosamund they reached windsor where tom had provided them with an entire floor of a fashionable inn he had even arranged housing for the menatarms telling them if they wished to earn extra coin they might hire themselves out they must however be prepared to depart windsor in late july when rosamund wished to return home they hardly saw philippa for she and her new friend were part of a group of young girls of good families following the progress they rode to the hunt during the day and spent part of the evening dancing and playing games philippa had never known such a life existed but she liked the court far better than her mother ever had and said so it will be so dull to return to friarsgate she said one morning as she prepared to depart for the days hunt nonetheless it is where you belong for now my daughter rosamund replied oh mama you treat me like a child and i am no longer a child philippa cried you are ten years of age rosamund said stiffly and a long way from being grown whatever you may believe philippa rolled her eyes at her mother and emitted a deep sigh we cannot go home too soon she told tom after she had repeated the conversation to him i see philippa has a stubborn streak in her that must be controlled i wonder where she has gotten that he murmured casting his eyes heavenwards tom i always did my duty when i was her age rosamund protested i cannot say dear girl for we were not acquainted then he told her with a grin edmund will tell you it is so rosamund said heatedly we are departing in another few days cousin he soothed let her have her fun soon enough she will be back in the hall studying with her sisters and father mata and the sooner the better rosamund muttered philippa was suddenly making her feel very old windsor castle was a most impressive castle it sat upon a hilltop overlooking green meadows and lush woodlands the thames river below it the castle had been begun by the normans in the year it was one in a nexus of nine castles being built to encircle and protect london in the beginning it was no more than a wooden keep used as a hunting lodge by its norman kings the first of the plantagenet kings henry ii rebuilt the castle in stone runnymede meadow where king john had signed the magna carta was nearby in the year windsor had withstood a great siege henry iii johns son had the damage repaired and enlarged the royal apartments as well a fire in destroyed much of henrys rebuilding edward iii born at windsor loved the castle and did much to add to its beauty and its use silvergray stone from a nearby quarry at bagshot was used in the new walls and buildings edward iv began building a magnificent chapel he dedicated to st george but it was not finished in his reign his grandson henry viii was now in the process of completing the chapel henry tudor loved windsor for its great forest where he might hunt at his leisure all day while rosamund found the castle an impressive edifice she thought greenwich fairer windsor had no gardens or walks to enjoy philippa didnt care she was out ahorse with cecily fitzhugh almost every day and when the two girls were not hunting they were with the queen who might or might not be with child again katherine called rosamund to her the day before the lady of friarsgate planned to depart the queen did not ask she simply said i will want philippa sent to me when she turns twelve rosamund i have decided to have her as one of my maids of honor young cecily fitzhugh will also be one of my maids you know i will keep your daughter safe and chaste while she is with me rosamund was not pleased philippa had taken too easily to court life and if she were ever to remain at court what would to happen to friarsgate still one did not argue with a queen she curtsied to katherine and said this is a great honor your highness and i know that philippa will be thrilled to have received it am i to tell her or will you i have already spoken with her and with the earl of renfrews daughter as well the queen replied rosamund curtsied again with your highness permission i will withdraw now we are departing in the morning for friarsgate you are eager katherine smiled you have always loved your home rosamund go then and travel safely with god i will pray for you and i will pray for your highness rosamund replied as she backed from the queens presence when she told her cousin of the queens words lord cambridge was delighted the trip has been a great success dear girl you are back in favor and philippa is to be a maid of honor in two years time wonderful they were seated in the small private dining room of the inn having their main meal of the day as they spoke philippa likes the court too well for my peace of mind rosamund said if she becomes involved in the life surrounding the king she will neglect friarsgate i do not like it but there is nothing i can do about it it is but a phase she is going through tom said philippa has extraordinary common sense and will not allow herself to be lured by the pleasures the court can offer her i was not like that at her age rosamund said nay you were a dutiful chatelaine with an ancient husband at ten tom reminded her the weight of friarsgate was heavy on your shoulders cousin but philippa is not you it is a different time in which she lives besides at court she is safer from henry the younger i wish we would go back to learn he has been hung rosamund said darkly i do not relish the next two years if he survives keeping philippa from him will not be easy tom but as god is my witness i will do it i know you will dear girl why you frighten me half to death when you get that look in your eye he teased her are the menatarms gathered together now she asked him we will depart as early on the morrow as you can arise cousin he said i am most eager to get back rosamund said to friarsgate or to your brazen scot he asked a single eyebrow cocked to friarsgate of course she said immediately i do not know what is to happen with logan hepburn and myself we shall see tom did not pursue the subject further with rosamund he knew what was going to happen even if she didnt she was going to marry the laird of clavens carn and damned well about time he thought he didnt know how logan would bring off this miracle but it would happen the scotsman loved his cousin deeply even if she was too stubborn to see it they had both been through much in their lives but now it was time for them and lord cambridge intended to see it happen he knew that edmund and maybel were in agreement with him on this it was just a matter of making rosamund see reason it amazed him that his cousin an intelligent and clever woman where friarsgate was concerned could be so foolish in the matter of her own emotions he did not doubt for a moment that patrick leslie would always be in her heart even if she spoke little of him anymore but there had to be room in her heart for another love as well for the first time in a long while tom prayed a knock at the chambers door opened to reveal the same page who had escorted rosamund to the king at westminster the lad bowed smartly saying as he did his majesty wishes to see the lady of friarsgate before she departs please come with me where is the king rosamund asked the boy at the edge of the wood behind the inn my lady was the answer come tom for my reputations sake i beg you to accompany me rosamund said he nodded standing immediately and together they followed the boy out the back door of the inn through the kitchen courtyard and across a small swath of meadow to the edge of the forest where the king stood halfhidden in the trees the page and lord cambridge stopped while rosamund moved forward and curtsied to the king you are determined to ruin my reputation with the queen hal she greeted him he laughed and you fair rosamund are determined to be what you were born to be reaching out he took her small hand in his big one and kissed it i came only to tell you that you will always have my friendship as you have kates i wanted there to be no misunderstanding between us on that point i am glad then that you called me to you rosamund told him it is a wise woman who keeps the friendship of both her king and her queen again he laughed direct and honest as you ever were madame i am sorry we may not take up where we left off no one has ever spoken to me as you do rosamund i am a countrywoman my liege and we do see things differently she told him then this is adieu fair rosamund he told her as he drew her into his arms and kissed her lips now it was rosamund who laughed as she drew away shaking her finger at him you will always be the bad lad she told him then she curtsied saying as she did i am grateful for your friendship hal my daughter philippa will be coming to serve the queen as a maid of honor in two years time i hope you will grant her your friendship as well she is oweins child and the merediths were ever loyal to the house of tudor i will watch over her as if she were my own child he said if i had a child the unsaid words hung in the air between them there will be a child hal i will pray for it rosamund promised then with another curtsy she backed away finally turning to rejoin her cousin the page passing her as she went he wanted to say goodbye tom said how charming it is good to know that you still retain his favor if i had remained if we had taken up where we left off he would have soon been bored hal has always sought the unattainable it is the chase he enjoys far more than the possession rosamund noted then it would appear that our business here is done cousin she nodded aye tom and i am indeed eager to get home to friarsgate chapter i wonder how long it will take the laird to know that you are home tom teased rosamund as they rode down the road to friarsgate did you not see the clansmen on the hilltop she asked him laughing he grinned at her you cant blame the man for being eager how long has he been waiting for you tom i have not said i would marry him he has not even asked me she protested do you doubt for a moment that isnt his intent dear girl he replied perhaps i just want him for a lover rosamund answered him what is the purpose in my marrying again tom i have three heiresses he has an heir for clavens carn i am english he is scots i will not give up friarsgate until i die he will not give up clavens carn we are i am coming to realize very much alike two like beingsa perfect partnership dear girl tom insisted we shall see rosamund said again as she had been saying all the way home lord cambridge clamped his lips together if he heard her utter those three words again he was simply going to scream or shake her until she got some common sense he would remain overnight and then he had to get home to otterly this whole situation was beginning to wear on his nerves he did not wish to be around while his cousin and logan hepburn sparred with each other he did not envy the laird of clavens carn and as much as tom loved his cousin she could sometimes be very difficult reaching the house philippa was off her horse before her elders throwing herself into maybels arms and chattering a mile a minute about all her adventures and her best friend cecily fitzhugh maybel hugged and kissed the girl then set her aside firmly looking to rosamund rosamund dismounted and went wordlessly into maybels outstretched arms gods blood old woman it is good to be home again she said hugging maybel has all been well while i have been away the sheep are looking fat enough edmund will tell you everything you need to know and some things that you dont but i cant stop him maybel replied you look better than i have ever seen you returning from court lass that is because i stayed but a brief time and having made my peace with the king and his queen took little part in the activities of the court i was able to eat and sleep enough which my daughter was not for she loves the court i fear she linked her arm with maybels and the two women strolled into the house seating themselves in the hall together on a settle by the fireplace philippas good manners more your doing surely than mine have won her the queens favor she is to return in two years to take her place among kates maids of honor rosamund told maybel what an honor maybel said but then she fretted she will yet be a child rosamund how can we let her go there is no choice in the matter maybel but i would trust my daughter with the queen for her household is orderly and chaste her maids are the most virtuous girls in the kingdom i am certain and philippa has made a good friend in cecily fitzhugh who will serve the queen with her she is the daughter of the earl of renfrew the younger of her two brothers may be a possible match for philippa he is fourteen and having served in the queens household is now being sent to france and italy for more studious pursuits maybel listened nodding as rosamund spoke does philippa know of this lad she finally asked what does she say i have not spoken to her about it for it is too soon but you can be certain that she knows these little girls at court know more gossip than even the servants do rosamund laughed besides they may grow acquainted and decide they do not like each other nothing has been formally discussed or settled there may be another boy better suited to philippa i have time but tom frets like an old lady and with good cause dear girl he said joining them she does not understand the necessity of looking about now and winnowing the possible from the impossible thats all right tom maybel said calmly as long as our rosamund has you to rely upon shell not go wrong of course she may take another husband one day and then your influence would certainly wane his influence will never ebb with me maybel rosamund said and as for marriage we shall see lord cambridge gritted his teeth so hard they hurt edmund and father mata joined them at the high board late in the day as the meal was served has all been well uncle in my absence rosamund asked him he nodded slowly but i have been grateful for the lairds clansmen lass for there have been strangers on the heights of late observing friarsgate who are they she wanted to know i saw one as i rode in and assumed it was a hepburn i cannot be certain for each time we have attempted to approach them they run he said i suspect they may be of your cousins ilk damn him rosamund swore softly he is after philippa the devil i will catch him and hang him myself father mata crossed himself at her words saying lady there must be another way to solve this matter tell me then good priest she answered him i have said plainly that my daughter will not marry henry bolton the younger i have said it more than once what else can i do if he will not listen young philippa must be guarded closely at all times the priest agreed you must be frank with her and explain the dangers involved it is time edmund agreed and the others about the high board nodded what must i be told philippa asked them she had been bored the entire ride home from windsor her mother and her uncle had paid little attention to her my cousin henry wants to steal you away and force you to marriage so he may get his hands on friarsgate philippa rosamund told the girl so you must be protected but i am to marry giles fitzhugh someday philippa said that is not so her mother said quickly who told you such a thing cecily did she said she overheard her father and mother discussing it when they did not realize she was nearby giles is very handsome mama rosamund shook her head wearily there has been no discussion between the earl of renfrew and me philippa giles fitzhugh might make you a good husband one day or he might not and there are other possibilities to consider before any decision regarding your future is decided but i like giles fitzhugh philippa said stubbornly he is so handsome so you have said philippa her mother remarked dryly but there are other requirements in a husband that are more important than just his features and besides you are much too young to be thinking of marriage i will not even consider a match for you until you are fourteen oh mama you were wed three times by the time you were fourteen philippa countered we are not discussing me philippa we are speaking of your future rosamund said in a steely voice now if you have finished your meal you may be excused philippa slipped from her place and as she did so one of the lairds clansmen arose to follow her was this how it was going to be from now on rosamund wondered she looked to the priest mata send to the laird on the morrow was all she said very good my lady the priest answered her but they both knew he had already done so now rosamund said turning back to her uncle other than strangers looking down on us all was well he nodded were beginning the harvest now niece it will prove to be a good one as the fields are lush with their crops the orchards too will give us a bounty but the fruits will be a bit smaller this year for we have not had quite the rains we have in most summers still the apples and pears will be the sweeter for it the wool she asked him of excellent quality he said the sheep are fat and content this year the cloth woven will be the best we have had yet well be ready for next year weve withheld enough this year that the merchants in carlisle are complaining already he chuckled ive noised about what we intend to do and they are not happy lord cambridge smiled and nodded have you begun the dyeing yet we will once the harvest is in edmund replied the dyeing and the weaving make for good winter work for the friarsgate folk tom but by springtime i promise you we will fill your ships hole with fine cargo we shall be very rich by this time next year tom said with a grin the friarsgate blue cloth will bring us a premium especially as we shall not offer much of it you must hold back at least half of every years stockpile in the warehouse edmund we alone will regulate the sale of the friarsgate blue woolen cloth should we not be more generous the first year and then hold back later in order to drive up the price of the cloth rosamund asked him nay he said there may be among our mercers some more clever than others who will hold back from their own meager supply in order to enrich themselves we cannot take that chance for that would then cut into our profits nor will we permit it tom said any mercer who does not sell his entire supply will receive none the following year we will know how much they sell by how much we sell them and we will demand proof of the sale of their entire stock i think rosamund told him i shall leave the stratagem to you cousin i shall simply watch over friarsgate and all that entails logan hepburn came late the following day rosamund looked at him as a man for the first time in a long while he was still handsome in his roughhewn way his eyes remained that blueblue color that had once had the effect of making her weak in the knees when she looked into them she wondered if they could do that again but was there the faintest touch of silver at his temples amid the ebony of his thick hair he slid easily from his mount and coming to greet her he smiled welcome home lady he said you did not bring my daughters back she asked him nay i think it best they remain hidden at clavens carn with me until we have solved the difficulty of your cousin he told her you know but she wasnt surprised the priest was his kin and would have told him of course he nodded his men have been watching friarsgate and we have watched them though they know it not logan said with an engaging grin i dont know what to do rosamund said honestly i cannot keep looking over my shoulder forever and i cannot have philippa frightened over this then we must find a way to defeat henry bolton the younger for good and for all the laird told her frankly how rosamund asked perhaps we may even use your lord dacre against him if we are clever henry is raiding on both sides of the border right now lady lord dacre is raiding on the scots side though he has been told to cease by his king still henry tudor makes no effort to enforce his edict with lord dacre which leads me to believe he raises havoc in the borders with private royal sanction though your king cries otherwise what do you propose then my lord rosamund asked him your cousin raids out of his lust for riches he has no loyalties to anyone but himself having never been taught otherwise lord dacre raids not simply for what he may carry away but out of a sense of loyalty to his king and to england lord dacre hates the ancient enemy he fights to the death what if he believed that your cousin and his band of ruffians were renegade scots what if he and his men met up with your cousin and his men the laird of clavens carn smiled wolfishly you hope that they will kill each other rosamund said thus relieving us both of an enemy you do not do this just for me i did not say i did he replied we are far enough to the west in the borders to have been safe so far but what if lord dacre comes to clavens carn unexpectedly he will not ask if any of the inhabitants are english he will simply slaughter everyone he can find lady then bring my daughters home she replied nervously dacre has not cast his eye in our direction your lasses are safer with me he reassured her this is how you would court me she demanded of him suddenly i have not come to court you rosamund bolton he told her i have come to strategize with you to our mutual benefit perhaps one day if i think you are ready i will indeed come to court you i am not of a mind to marry again quite yet he smiled good she said neither am i logan hepburn but she was thinking he was a devil if she ever had met one all that soft talk he had used before she had gone down to court implying that he loved her yet and wanted her for his wife he hadnt changed at all it had been nothing more than a deception he was probably revenging himself on her for refusing him once well she didnt need him but she did need his clansmen may i retain the use of your men she asked of course he said smiling again the look of surprise on her face when he had said he hadnt come courting her had almost caused him to laugh aloud the clansman who had ridden through the night to fetch him had brought a message from tom bolton rosamunds cousin had advised the laird of clavens carn to pretend he might not be as interested in remarrying as he had previously indicated rosamund far preferred a challenge and would respect him more if she believed she must work to regain his love follow your instincts with her lord cambridge had advised the lord of clavens carn and so he had the results had been far better than he had hoped for rosamund he knew had believed that she would control their courtship she thought that he wanted her enough to dance to her tune and he did but he realized now that tom knew exactly what he was saying when he suggested play difficult to obtain it had been just the right thing to do now the next move in this game they were playing would be up to her he wondered what she would do you will remain the night she said it was not a question on her part nay he said i think it better i return to clavens carn lady i must think on how we may bring your cousin and lord dacre into serious conflict with each other i will return when i have the answer to my questions very well my lord rosamund answered him he was not staying why would he not remain could they not have spoken together and made a plan perhaps if we dealt with the matter together logan hepburn the solution might come easier and sooner she heard herself suggesting do you think so he said she was asking him to stay rosamund nodded certainly clavens carn is well protected in your absence as your son resides there she reasoned and it would indeed be a quicker ride home for you in the daylight you may be right he said casually very well lady i will stay come into the hall then she invited him and turning she led the way logan winked at lord cambridge and then he followed her what was that all about i should like to know maybel demanded what mischief are you up to tom bolton tom grinned at the old woman i have simply advised him how to win her he must pretend his interest in her is beginning to wane so it is rosamund who will have to convince him that they should be man and wife he told maybel oh traitor maybel said and then she laughed my child would not be happy if she realized how well you have come to know her tom bolton but you are right if we are to see her married again and happy at last it must be her own wish not ours youll not tell on me he said his eyes dancing with their conspiracy nay ill not maybel promised you have been her guardian angel since the day in which you came into her life tom bolton and i thank the blessed mother for it thank you he said softly but you well know we have been a blessing to each other maybel come along now and let us see what is transpiring in the hall are you not curious i know that i am that evening after the meal had been served rosamund logan father mata maybel edmund and tom sat together in the hall plotting philippa had been sent to her bed her windows barred lucy on the trundle by her bedside and the hepburn clansman on guard outside the girls door the bait must be something tempting to them both rosamund said then the trap must be baited twice logan told them once for henry the younger and once for lord dacre if dacre believes that henry and his men are scots rosamund considered that should be bait enough for him but what will bring them together at the same time and in the same place there is a deserted abbey near lochmaben the priest said what if lord dacre learned that gold previously hidden there was to be transported from that abbey across scotland to edinburgh for the little kings use he would want to take that gold and what if henry the younger learned about the same gold the abbey is in a desolate area both men would consider it an easy haul lord dacre would be warned of this band of renegade scots in the neighborhood henry would not be warned of lord dacre if they came upon each other certainly a battle would ensue i remember once edmund remarked my brother richard saying you would go far in the church mata your talents are indeed wasted in this rural outback the young priest grinned to get them to the same place at approximately the same time logan noted that is where our problem will lie not if henry believes the shipment will be unguarded for only the first five miles of its trek that it will meet up with the kings men where the abbey road and the edinburgh road join that means he must attack before the gold reaches it guardians if he is clever he will wait until the shipment is halfway between the junction of the two roads we will make certain he does this and then we will make certain lord dacre knows it logan said your cousin is basically a coward he is not looking for a fight but rather easy pickings how do we do this rosamund asked him i will go to lord dacre tom said i am english and he will believe me particularly as i will bleat about this bandit who threatens my estates at otterly and those of my cousin the lady of friarsgate who is the queens dear friend just back from court you know where her daughter was chosen to be a maid of honor in two years time and may be matched with the earl of renfrews son his lordship is a snob he will listen carefully to what i have to say and think to gain greater favor with the king by stealing this gold for him and protecting the queens friend in the bargain and who will tell henry the younger of the gold rosamund asked i will edmund spoke up you old man are you mad maybel demanded am i to be widowed in my old age then you will do no such thing edmund bolton they all laughed but edmund replied to his wife nay old woman i will go to my nephew and tell him this tale of gold i will say i heard it from our neighbor the laird of clavens carn that i have come to him in hopes that by telling him of this bounty that can be his he will leave friarsgate and philippa meredith in peace that the gold he may steal will give him the opportunity to begin a new life somewhere else i am his uncle his blood kin he knows how much i love friarsgate and our family he will believe me for he could never conceive that i would be duplicitous with him where the safety of friarsgate and its inhabitants are concerned he is right tom said aye and brave too the laird remarked youll take an armed guard with you edmund for without them your nephew might be tempted to do something foolish and just where is this gold going to come from maybel demanded and how will you gain the monks cooperation in this charade remember the abbey is deserted maybel but neither lord dacre nor henry the younger will know that the priest said monks robes are easily available and some of the lairds men can don them to make it appear to anyone watching that the abbey is populated two monks will drive the cart up the abbey trail towards the road at the first sign of trouble the drivers will leap from the cart and flee into the woods no one will chase after them for it is the gold they want not a pair of cowardly monks you still have not said where the gold will come from maybel insisted there is a supply of bricks stored away from when we made the new bake ovens edmund said they can be wrapped in cloth and tied with yarn piled in the cart they will appear to be just what lord dacre and my nephew have been told gold it must all be done with perfect precision if we are to succeed the laird said tomorrow we will set up the steps to follow what will lord dacre think when he discovers the bricks rosamund wondered he will undoubtedly head for the abbey and discovering it empty realize he has been duped i suspect he will believe there was indeed gold but that it was transported earlier in some secret manner to foil the english tom said he stood up stretching and yawning broadly oh i believe i am ready for my bed he said all this plotting is absolutely exhausting dear girl he bent and kissed rosamund upon her forehead good night and sweet dreams cousin logan maybel edmund and then he was gone from the hall edmund arose quickly and taking his wifes hand bid rosamund and logan good night as he hurried his wife from the hall maybel who had opened her mouth to protest their swift departure suddenly realized what her husband was all about and her jaw snapped shut as their eyes met in understanding where am i to sleep lady the laird asked his hostess why was he in such a hurry she wondered had he met another woman while she was down in england bide with me a while my lord rosamund said and she arose to pour him a goblet of her best wine after all these years of his alleged devotion he was going to desert her for some other woman most certainly not until she decided if he was worth marrying she swallowed her temper and smiling handed him the wine this is my favorite time of day or rather evening she told him as she brought her own goblet back to her seat by the fire everything is quiet and there seems to be a peace on the land as at no other time she sipped her wine he couldnt resist he enjoyed it better when she fought him openly are you attempting to ply me with good wine and then seduce me madame he cocked a black eyebrow questioningly at her have you always had such a fine opinion of yourself logan she demanded with a show of her old spirit the beast could he read her mind always my darling he told her with a brash grin he saw her fingers tighten about the stem of her goblet you are contemplating hurling the contents of your vessel at me arent you he said yes she admitted through clenched teeth oh yes i have a better idea and it will save my doublet and not waste your good wine he told her with a grin then setting his own goblet aside he stood up get up rosamund and i will help you calm your temper logan said but let us put your wine aside first and he took the goblet from her hand and set it upon a table he drew her to a standing position from now on he said when you wish to do violence to me you will instead kiss me what surely she had not heard him aright but then he was folding her arms behind her as he pulled her into his arms his head was descending to meet hers his lips were pressing themselves to her lips with the touch of his flesh on hers rosamunds knees gave way but he was holding her so firmly that she did not fall her eyes had closed of their own volition and her head began to spin then he raised his mouth from hers and said kissing is much nicer rosamund than quarreling didnt anyone ever teach you that i have never quarreled with anyone the way i do with you she said as her head cleared you are the most annoying man you are no longer angry at me he teased her nay she said i do not think i am you see he said as he released her from his embrace will i have to fight with you in order for you to kiss me rosamund asked him provocatively for now aye he told her you are not an easy woman and i must bring you to reason if we are ever to marry my darling bring me to reason her outrage was more than evident her little balled fist hit him a blow on his arm not an easy woman who the hell are you to criticize me logan hepburn do you think you are some paragon of perfection even jeannie god assoil her sweet soul knew better than that he wanted to laugh but he did not instead he yanked her back into his arms and kissed her until she was breathless and halfswooning i will master you you impossible wench if i must spend the rest of my life doing it he said to her then he kissed her again and again and again until she was whimpering with pleasure finally he set her back on her feet holding her arm lightly as she swayed for a moment there he said you should be calm again now show me where i am to sleep this night rosamund bolton she shook her head to clear it saying nothing he was irritating he was impossible he was overbearing but gods wounds his kisses were divine she was surprised to discover that she could move her legs now and so she led him upstairs to the guest chamber opening the door she stepped back to allow him through good night my lord she said softly more softly than she had intended but at least she could speak rosamund thought he stepped past her and then turning said low not tonight rosamund but another night we will share this bed together i have not said i should marry you logan she replied quickly i have not said i should ask you rosamund he told her i have simply said that one night soon we will share this bed you and i good night madame astounded she stepped away from the door as he reached to close it her heart was beating madly she began to consider what it might be like in his arms and then she thought of the last time she had lain in a mans arms patrick she whispered but even as she said his name she knew that the earl of glenkirk would never deny her the happiness with another man that he could no longer give her and with that thought came the realization that the premonition they had both experienced when they had first met had finally come to pass she would never see patrick leslie again in this life and with that knowledge rosamund knew she was suddenly free to love once more she would always love patrick she knew that he would live hidden in that secret place in her heart known only to her but her life had to go on and she knew now that she could not live without love logan stood his back to the closed door breathing slowly deeply her mouth had been far sweeter than he had remembered the sensation of her full breasts against his chest had made his senses reel and his manhood ache with his need the boldness of the words he had just spoken to her burned in his throat instinct had warned him it was too soon but how he had wanted her in his bed this night toms advice had been good but he could not play this game with her forever he had not the patience for it he knew he loved her too much logan wanted rosamund as his wife and his wife she was going to be sooner than later he slept badly as did rosamund her dreams were wild jumbled impressions that left her tossing and restless and more awake than asleep she awoke blearyeyed and irritable but she was ready to begin preparing the trap they had devised the previous evening to rid friarsgate of her cousin henry bolton once and for all for all of her life she had been troubled first by her fathers youngest brother and now by his son her uncles bones rested in the family burial ground but rosamund knew she would not feel safe until her cousin lay beside his father to her surprise she found logan gone when she came down into the hall he had a servant informed her departed at first light with just a few of his clansmen then her uncle edmund entered the hall you are awake at last niece he said jovially logan has left me instructions for our part in this charade we must begin today for the sooner this is over and done with the better for friarsgate i do not relish a winter defending ourselves from not just fourlegged wolves but twolegged ones as well he might have said goodbye rosamund said annoyed i thought you might have said farewell to each other last night edmund murmured innocently she threw him an evil look i showed him to his chamber and went to my own she said i assumed he would be here when i returned to the hall and would speak with me himself instead of giving instructions to you uncle she felt her anger beginning to rise and then the oddest thing happened she remembered her anger of the previous evening and how he had calmed her she could almost feel his lips on hers now and as she did the anger began to drain away he was wise to leave early she said suddenly surprising edmund we must be scrupulous in our execution of this plan or we will fail miserably what would the laird have us do uncle we must prepare the false gold and transport it in secret to the abbey near lochmaben and we must do it without your cousins men observing us to that end the lairds men are scouring the few caves in our hillsides where an intruder might secrete himself to spy on us others of the hepburns are posted upon our heights but we must work quickly rosamund for we do not want to arouse henry the youngers suspicions have the bricks brought into the house through the kitchen garden door she said not all at once but a few at a time over the day we cannot be certain we are not being watched and i would not have anyones curiosity aroused by a constant stream of men and women going in and out of the house at twilight and in the darkness of the evening the rest of the bricks may be carried inside where do you want them he asked in the hall rosamund said we will wrap them here the morning meal was brought and eaten people came and went throughout the day while rosamund philippa maybel and several of the servingwomen carefully wrapped each brick in a naturalcolored felt fabric and then tied the wrappings with wool twine so the contents remained well concealed the pile of wrapped bricks never grew any larger for as each brick was covered with felt and tied it was removed from the hall finally all the bricks were wrapped and gone from the hall they had been taken over the long day and early evening to a barn where they were loaded in a covered wooden wagon that would be transported first over the border to clavens carn and from there to the deserted abbey where the wagons cover would then be removed a tarpaulin would replace it being tied down for effect but the transport would remain in rosamunds barn until the laird returned and gave the word it was to be moved and he did return several days later twenty of my men are now populating the abbey he said we will transport our gold over the border tomorrow and from there to lochmaben when i return again we will be ready to inform lord dacre and henry the younger of the gold they may steal he laughed you have done your part well rosamund the bricks make quite a convincing shipment of gold aye we worked hard to be certain there is not the faintest sign of what is really between those wrappings she told him in two days tom will seek out lord dacre and edmund henry the younger i know where both are now located leaving at the same time they should reach their quarry at approximately the same time the trick will be to return to us at the same time with the news that they have both taken the bait two days later edmund six menatarms with him rode to where his nephew hid himself between his border forays henry the younger was surprised to see his uncle but he greeted him cordially enough edmund did not dismount his horse this is not a social call nephew he said bluntly henry felt at somewhat of a disadvantage standing by his uncles mount get down edmund bolton so we may speak eye to eye he said come in and have some wine i have an excellent keg i relieved a traveling merchant of recently and he chuckled as if it were all a jest but edmund remained atop his mount nay there is something i have come to say henry he told his nephew i want you to cease harassing friarsgate i want you to put all thoughts of marrying philippa meredith from your head a match is being arranged for her with the second son of an earl it is what the family wants however in return for your cooperation we are willing to direct you to a rather large cache of gold yours for the taking nephew easy pickings unless of course you are afraid of a band of scottish monks he said scornfully you have no real love for friarsgate would you not be content instead with gold perhaps henry said softly tell me more uncle your word first that you will cease seeking to kidnap little philippa she is yet a child henry and would be more troublesome than useful to you and you could not keep her from her mother for long rosamund is a strongwilled woman as your father learned rosamund should have been my wife henry the younger said it could be my son who inherited friarsgate and not another girl uncle edmunds laughter was brittle what are you now nephew seventeen rosamund is twentyfive and she would kill you before she would marry you you do not want friarsgate lad that was your fathers dream and where did it get him but a narrow plot in the familys burial ground his lust for what was not his drove your mother away it turned her from a vapid but decent girl into well lad you know what mavis became and you you are hunted and will be one day caught and hung he paused for a long moment unless you decide to change your fate henry give me your word that you will leave the boltons of friarsgate alone and i will make you rich so rich you may leave here and begin your life anew you were not meant to be a bandit in the borders nephew do you really want your mother to come upon you one day hanging at the side of the road would you break her heart that way with the gold i offer you you can rescue her from her shame and let her live out her life peaceably for a brief moment henry the youngers face softened then his eyes narrowed and he said tell me your promise first edmund replied you would accept my word henry the younger sounded surprised but he was also flattered no one had ever agreed to accept his word before you have my hand on it uncle if you will tell me where this gold is and if i can obtain it i will leave friarsgate and its inhabitants in peace i will go south as thomas boltons antecedent did perhaps i will have the same good fortune as he did that is not to say i will not return one day henry the younger thought silently but friarsgate was not for him and he knew it besides he hated the stink of sheep edmund took his nephews hand and shook it the gold is at an abbey in the borders near lochmaben i learned of its existence from a hepburn clansman the lairds cousin the nowdeceased earl of bothwell had stored it there for king james before the war now it is needed to support the little king and the queen regent has sent for it to be brought to stirling there is but one place where it may be safely taken nephew the vehicle bearing the gold will travel from the abbey down to the edinburgh road it is a distance of but a few miles midway between the abbey and that junction in the road is the ideal place to snatch it the wagon will be driven by two monks it is hoped such an equipage will not attract any attention edmund said you have remarkably good information uncle henry the younger said suspiciously of course i do edmund agreed we hired out hepburn clansmen to watch over friarsgate we pay them and house and feed them we are borderers no matter which allegiance we espouse when our kings go to war nephew the scots have become comfortable with us and they talk a great deal for they are lonely for their families they are also proud of their family connections and the earl of bothwell patrick hepburn was responsible for hiding this gold at lochmaben i am sure that if lord dacre learns of this transport of gold he will want it too but that is unlikely nephew so there it is for the taking if you are not afraid i am not afraid henry the younger said quickly do you know when this gold will be moved uncle they say in three days time nephew but if i were you i should go to lochmaben as soon as possible and wait in hiding so you do not miss its departure edmund turned his horses head as he prepared to leave his nephews encampment uncle henry the younger called after him edmund twisted in his saddle yes nephew he asked if you have lied to me i will come back and kill you henry the younger said edmund laughed harshly you are surely your fathers son he said and then he rode off with his escort of clansmen to return to friarsgate where he found tom just returned from his visit to lord dacre the two men entered the hall of the house where rosamund awaited them anxiously well she said your cousin said as i was departing his camp that he would kill me if i lied to him edmund chuckled he has taken the bait niece rosamund turned to her cousin tom lord cambridge nodded at first dacre was not certain that i knew what i was talking about dear boy i told him i have not ridden across half of england for my own amusement the information i have practically comes from the source then i went on to tell him he had really been quite naughty continuing his raids in the borders i happen to know i said for havent i just returned from court that the king has told you it must stop you are endangering all of us who live here my cousin lady rosamund bolton queen katherines dear dear friend from their shared childhoods at court has a large estate friarsgate nearby then i lowered my voice and became quite chummy with dacre her daughter has just been chosen to be a maid of honor in two years time if you do not stop dear boy you endanger friarsgate for the scots will surely retaliate and come marauding now i continued one of the men who guards friarsgate has a sister married to a scot over the border and he has told her that a large shipment of gold that has been hidden at lochmaben in an abbey is to be transported across the country to the queen regent for the support of her son the little king now if you seized that shipment of gold our king would be very pleased his sister the queen of scotland is being most difficult with him right now if our dear king henry had her gold then she would have to be more amenable wouldnt she of course if you are fearful of that band of renegades that have been about of late well i might understand dear boy but would king henry they laughed and rosamund said you really are quite wicked tom he listened to you then i told him exactly where and when dear girl and suggested he would not be amiss leaving sooner than later like edmund i left behind a man to observe who will return to us when both of our unsuspecting victims reach lochmaben when the battle is over and done with lord dacre and his men are really quite well armed henry the younger will fight harder edmund said perhaps but he will be overcome tom told them then we have but to wait for news rosamund responded where is your brazen scot dear girl tom asked her he is not mine tom rosamund exclaimed of course he is lord cambridge replied with a grin now where is he he has gone to lochmaben rosamund said i will not believe that henry the younger is dead unless i see his body and bury it gods wounds dear girl tom exclaimed i am quite relieved not to be your enemy i do not do it out of vindictiveness tom but i must be certain that philippa is safe rosamund told him and he is my cousin our blood he should be interred here like his father it is all he will ever have of friarsgate so they waited and ten days later logan came riding over the border and down the hill to friarsgate with his men among their number was a riderless horse that carried a body the body had already begun to stink but in anticipation that he would not fail her rosamund had seen the grave already dug and the shroud ready the body was put into its burial cloth rosamund looked upon henry the youngers face in death he was a pleasantlooking young man who did not seem in the least dangerous she nodded silently and then she sewed the top of the shroud closed herself before they buried her young cousin it is over at last she said as they all sat together in the hall that evening for my whole life i have battled henry the elder and henry the younger thank god it is finished she looked at the three men with her thank you she said simply was it as you planned it maybel demanded wanting to know all the details exactly logan said i have never in my life known any plan to be so flawless in its execution both parties of men arrived unknown to the other they secreted themselves on opposite sides of the path they were silent and determined your cousin struck first at his attack the drivers leaped from the wagon and fled into the woods and then lord dacre swooped down on henry the younger and his men he thought them scots and he was savage in battle there were no survivors among your cousins men dacre then undid the covering on the wagon and pulled forth one of the bricks he felt its weight and grinned delighted he unwrapped the brick and seeing what was inside he swore an oath then he began with all his men unwrapping the bricks until there wasnt a one left he spoke some of the most colorful language that i have ever heard logan said smiling what happened then maybel asked leaning forward in her chair he and his men galloped down the path to the abbey they found it deserted of course they came back up the path and dismounting examined the wagon most carefully i was near enough to hear the english milord he decided that the monks had run away to hide in the woods knowing the wagon was empty of gold but that the gold must assuredly have been there at one time because of the renegades who attempted to steal it before he attempted to steal it he came to the conclusion that somewhere between there and stirling there was a wagonload of gold and he would attempt to find it before it became too dangerous for him and his men he had his men unhitch the horses and then rode off with his troop so you lost two horses i am sorry rosamund said i will replace them there is no need logan said we stole them back that night they all laughed and then the servants began bringing in the meal it has been agreed that the laird would spend the night at friarsgate and you will return my daughters tomorrow rosamund said if you want banon and bessie back he told her wickedly you must come to clavens carn and fetch them rosamund bolton the blueblue eyes were dancing rosamund felt her temper rising but when she glared down the high board at him he pursed his lips in a kiss to her for a moment her head spun at the memory of the last time he had cooled her tantrum she was to her familys surprise silent and she could see he knew exactly what she was thinking and was restraining his laughter i will not let him make me angry she decided and then she lifted her goblet to him in a taunting gesture and drank deeply she heard his chuckle as she set the goblet back down on the high board edmund and tom played a game of chess before the fire afterwards maybel dozed her feet turned towards the warmth of the hearth several dogs sprawled about them and a single cat lay dozing in philippas lap am i really safe now mama philippa asked and friarsgate too we are all safe now poppet rosamund told her daughter one day you will inherit friarsgate and your descendants after you with me the boltons die there will be none afterwards to harm you or yours she put an arm about her child and philippa dropped her head for a moment upon her mothers shoulder as she had done when she was younger seeking security and solace i do not think i could ever be as brave as you have been mama philippa said i wanted you and your sisters to have a happier time in your childhoods than i did rosamund told her daughter but you have had your share of sadness too my child i know how hard it was for you to lose your father but if you married again mama we could have another father philippa said we will see rosamund murmured not noticing her cousin tom wince when will my sisters come home mama philippa asked soon rosamund said now find your bed my daughter curtsying to her elders philippa left the hall and soon maybel and edmund were gone and tom after pouring himself a goblet of wine swiftly sought his own chamber rosamund arose from her place on the settle where she had sat with philippa come my lord i am certain you remember the way but i shall lead you she glided from the hall the laird of clavens carns footsteps behind her reaching the guest chamber she opened the door for him gasping as he drew her inside and shut the door behind them firmly my lord he stopped her mouth with a hard kiss tonight madame he told her we will begin to get to know each other as we should have years ago but that you kept marrying other men we are getting too old for these games rosamund my darling his arms tightened about her i have not said i would marry you she whispered breathlessly he took an index finger and ran it from the top of her head down her nose and over her lips and chin in a tender gesture i have not asked you to marry me rosamund he told her softly i have just said it is past time we got to know each other my darling you want to make love to me she answered him aye i do he told her logan oh logan i do not know if i can ever love you as you love me rosamund despaired so you finally see that i love you he replied tis a start my darling he kissed her face gently moving his lips from her forehead to her eyelids to her nose and finally to her sweet mouth then the blueblue eyes met her amber ones his big hand caressed her cheek you will never love me as you loved patrick leslie rosamund but you will love me i promise you tears slipped down her face and he kissed them away then turning her about he began to unlace the bodice of her plain brown velvet gown his lips found the soft nape of her neck and pressed a kiss upon it rosamund sighed wondering as she did why she had this sudden feeling of relief he removed the bodice laying it aside on a nearby chair he undid the tapes of her skirts and lifted her from the puddle of material that slipped to the floor you seem to be quite expert at this logan hepburn rosamund told him beginning to regain her equilibrium she was facing him now and her fingers were undoing his doublet unimpeded he smiled a slow smile down at her i am he admitted modestly then he lifted her up and set her down upon the bed kneeling he removed her slippers and stockings i havent finished undressing you rosamund said boldly i can do it quicker he told her and i think it necessary tonight my darling his hands undid his breeks he removed his sherte and then sat to remove his shoes and his wool stockings from his big feet he stood again pulling his breeks off then got into the bed with her for modestys sake he had left her in her chemise but he was as naked as god had made him you are a very big man she said eyeing him i am he agreed untying the ribbons that held her chemise closed he drew back the folds of fabric and stared gods wounds madame you are incredibly beautiful he said admiringly he did not touch her would you like me to remove my chemise now she asked softly he was such a handsome man with his blueblue eyes and his unruly black hair unable to help herself she reached up and ran her hand through that hair nay he told her i want to absorb your beauty a little bit at a time rosamund i am not a greedy man the dark head bent and he kissed a single nipple she shivered with the pleasure that small touch offered her it had been almost two years since she had lain in a mans arms and received the homage of his love for her that was nice she told him good he said i want to know what pleases you and then you shall learn what pleases me rosamund what if we discover that we do not enjoy each other she asked him why then we shall go our separate ways madame he replied blandly what she cried you would seduce me and then desert me you scots scoundrel she pushed him away madame twas you who introduced doubt into our passion he returned rosamund sat up what was she doing she jumped from the bed looking to gather up her other garments you shall not have me you monster oh but i shall my darling he said rising and following her drawing her back into his arms drawing the chemise off of her her breasts were crushed against his lightly furred chest her belly pressed against his dammit logan would you commit rape she demanded of him gods blood she had never felt so very naked before she hammered against him with her fists he enclosed her face between his big hands and kissed her his mouth insistent demanding and moist against her lips her face he would not be denied and the truth was she realized she didnt want to be denied either she needed him as much as he needed her if you truly want to go he said suddenly releasing her then go damn you but if you remain rosamund these fevered bodies of ours will shortly be one the blueblue eyes looked straight at her i dont know she whispered yes you do he said fiercely do you really love me logan hepburn she asked him for as long as i can remember rosamund bolton forever and i always will he told her in a sure and quiet voice please god that i am not a fool she said he smiled at her we will talk about that on the morrow my darling he told her holding out his hand in silent invitation she took it and he brought her back into the comfort of his embrace then they walked back to the bed they lay together slowly and tenderly exploring each others bodies he caressed her breasts she pressed kisses on his flat belly their mouths met again and again as their limbs intertwined rolling this way and then that finally she lay beneath him and with the most infinite care indeed as if she were a virgin he entered her body pushing his thick length slowly slowly and filling her full with his longpentup desire for her moving with a leisurely rhythm until she was whimpering softly and her head began to thrash with her rising pleasure and when their need for each other reached its peak they rose together their fingers intertwined until with great joy they fell back together into the abyss of warm and soothing release fulfilled and afterwards he told her that on the morrow she would return with him to clavens carn and they would be married if of course my darling that is your wish too he said smiling into her face devouring her with his love until she could no longer bear it for it was simply too sweet i cannot live at clavens carn always she said i am the lady of friarsgate i cannot live at friarsgate always he said i am the lord of clavens carn then we must be like the wealthy nobles who go back and forth between their homes and estates logan she told him sometimes we will live in your house and sometimes we will live in mine and if our countries continue to war he asked her then you must stay on your side of the border and i will remain on mine rosamund teased him with a smile of course he told her if we remain free of political entanglements and know nothing of the world outside of friarsgate and clavens carn we shall never be separated then he kissed the tip of her nose what a clever man you are rosamund told him i think i will marry you after all logan hepburn and one day you will come to love me he said hopefully i think some small part of me has always loved you logan she admitted and i will be a good wife to you and a good stepmother to your son i promise and i will be a good father to your girls he vowed i remember their father and he was an honorable man i can be no less to you or to them and if we should have bairns logan she asked they will belong to clavens carn he told her firmly she nodded then it is settled my lord but if we are indeed to have bairns you will have to pay more attention to me than you have been she teased him he grinned down at her madame i have already put a bairn in your belly but until he objects rosamund you and i will enjoy our bed sport and rosamund laughed aloud her heart soaring with her happiness aye she was indeed happy again and she knew that with logan hepburn by her side she would be happy forever no matter the world about them epilogue they were not married the next day but rather a month later on the eighteenth of october st lukes day the ceremony took place not at friarsgate or at clavens carn but rather in the hills between both estates where the border between england and scotland was acknowledged to be by both parties the bride stood on the english side of that border the bridegroom stood in scotland both were smiling as they joined hands across that border it was a perfect autumn day the sky above was a clear strong blue and the bright sun was warm on their shoulders the hills were dressed in russet and gold and the air about them was soft but there was no breeze the simple ceremony was performed by prior richard bolton and father mata the invited guests were few maybel edmund tom bolton philippa banon and bessie meredith little john hepburn and when the formalities were over and done with the laird of clavens carn took his bride up on his horse and invited them all back to his keep for the celebration there in the hall as the day waned his clansmen and clanswomen raised toast after toast to the newly wed couple the pipes wailed and there was much dancing john hepburn spent most of that afternoon curled in his new stepmothers lap rosamund frequently caressed the little boys dark hair wondering if the child she now carried would be darkhaired too and eight months later rosamund discovered that he was when alexander hepburn was born into the world to the delight of his three halfsisters and his halfbrother he was christened at friarsgate church by father mata edmund and tom standing as his godfathers and maybel as his godmother and watching philippa meredith could but consider if this was the last of her mothers children she would see born for in ten more short months she was to go to court and join the queens household in ten months she would see her friend cecily fitzhugh again she would be twelve years old old enough to be considered a possible match for the right young man she wondered if that young man would be giles fitzhugh or perhaps another someone she had yet to meet someone she did not even know someone with whom she would fall madly in love as her mother had with patrick leslie i cannot wait philippa said softly to herself i cannot wait and she smiled as she contemplated her life to come a note from the author i hope you have enjoyed book two of the friarsgate inheritance i will tell you
