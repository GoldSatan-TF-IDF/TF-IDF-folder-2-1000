vince flynn the last man chapter jalalabad afghanistan the four dead men were lined up on the living room floor of the safe house mitch rapp started with the one on the left the bearded face the dark lifeless eyes and the dimesized bullet hole that marked the center of the mans forehead were all expected one bullet nice and neatthe way rapp would have done it the next two bodyguards looked the same including red pucker marks in the center of their brows the fourth afghani was a different story hed been shot through the back of the head a quarter of his face was now a jagged crater of flesh blood and bone the exit wound told him the man had been shot by something a lot bigger than a mmprobably a caliber with ammunition that pancaked and tumbled for maximum damage there was nothing about this mess to give rapp any assurance that things would be fine but this last little twist cracked open the door on something he did not want to consider rapp set the troubling thought aside for a second tried to imagine how it had gone down the early signs pointed toward a wellcoordinated assault the perimeter security had been breached phone line cameras motion sensors heat sensors and even the pressure pads had all been taken off line the backup connection through the satellite dish on the roof had also been disabled whoever had attacked the safe house had the knowledge and skill to hit the place without setting off a single alarm and alerting the quickreaction force less than a mile away at the air base according to the experts at langley this was never supposed to happen four years earlier they had claimed the safe house was impregnable against any threat that the taliban or any other local group could come up with rapp had told those same experts that they were full of shit hed never seen an impregnable safe house for the simple reason that people had to come and go as with most cia safe houses this one was intentionally bland there was no american flag flown out front and there were no snappy marines standing post at the main gate this was a black site where the more unpleasant aspects of the war had been coordinated langley didnt want any official records of the comings and goings of the drug dealers warlords arms dealers local politicians police and afghan army officers who were on the take the house looked like your runofthemill twostory blockhouse in jalalabad there were quite a few upgrades that made it unique but from the outside it looked dingy and rundown just like all the other houses in the neighborhood the cinderblock wall that surrounded the property was coated with a special resin designed to prevent it from exploding into a million pieces and shredding the house in the event of a car bomb the simplelooking front door contained a oneinch steel plate and a reinforced steel frame all of the windows were bulletproof plexiglas and the hightech security cameras and sensors were concealed so as to not attract the attention of the neighbors langley had even taken the unusual precaution of buying the houses on each side and moving in the bodyguards and their families all to protect one man joe rickman was the most cunning and brilliant operative rapp had ever worked with theyd known each other for sixteen years at first rapp didnt know what to think of him rickman was pure vanilla there wasnt a single physical characteristic about him that was memorable at fivefeetten he was neither tall nor short his mousy brown hair matched his dull brown eyes and his weak chin completed the bland lines of his roundish face on the rare occasion that you heard him speak he was never animated and his voice was pure monotonethe kind of thing that could put the most restless baby to sleep rickmans forgetable face allowed him to blend in and those who met him were almost underwhelmed by his presence for rickman that was just fine much of his success was built on fools underestimating him hed worked for the cia for twentythree years and it was rumored that he had never set foot inside headquarters only a few months earlier rapp had asked him if the rumor was true rickman responded with a soft smile and said that hed never been invited at the time rapp took the comment as a selfdeprecating attempt at a little levity later he realized rickman was dead serious rickman was one of those people who were tolerated only during tough times usually war for the last eight years hed run americas clandestine war in afghanistan more than a billion dollars in cash had passed through his hands most of it was used to bribe people into playing on the right team but a fair amount of the money was used to kill enemies and for a laundry list of other unpleasant things that went with the territory people back at langley didnt want to know what rickman was up to they only wanted results and that was something rickman was exceedingly good at underneath rickmans bland facade was a cunning mind that was perfectly suited to the duplicitous infinitely complicated world of espionage rapp understood the tinge of fear in his bosss voice when shed called him a little over two hours ago when the morning guards showed up they had discovered the bodies and the absence of joe rickman and had immediately immediately alerted john hubbard the cias jalalabad base chief hubbard rang his boss in kabul and the shit rolled uphill from there rapp received a call from cia director irene kennedy while he was sitting down for breakfast in the big mess hall at bagram air force base he had just arrived incountry the previous evening on a highpriority mission that was now on hold kennedy passed along what little information she knew and ordered rapp to grab the next blackhawk to jalalabad rapp didnt argue he and four of his team members made the trip and were on the ground in jalalabad before nine in the morning hubbard met them with a threesuv convoy and a security detail and they rolled to the house langley would want rickman back but rapp got the strange feeling that all things considered they would prefer the blackops boss delivered in a body bag it would be impossible to keep the kidnapping a secret rickmans operational knowledge and reach was too vast to ignore entire teams would already be gathered at langley working around the clock to assess the damage if rapp didnt find rickman quickly then complex expensive operations would have to be unwound or assets would start showing up in morgues all across the middle east southwest asia and beyond sooner or later congress would get wind of the disaster and they would want answers for a good number of people back at langley the only thing worse than rickman spilling the company secrets to an enemy would be rickman testifying before congress rapp had a long and somewhat complicated history with rickman he respected the man but it had taken a while rapp was considering how he would handle a possible order to eliminate rickman when the towering hubbard approached this shit is really bad rapp nodded its about as bad as it could get hubbard rubbed his bald head and asked how in the hell are we going to find him at this point im not sure rapp knew their chances for success were remote but they had to start somewhere this is going to get really nasty and if you dont have the stomach for it hub i suggest you go back to the base and lock yourself in your office hubbard studied rapp for a moment and then nodded you dont have to worry about me getting all sensitive on you ive been over here for two years ive seen all kinds of crazy shit most of that crazy shit was stuff done by the enemy this time they would be the ones crossing the line i know you have rapp said but trust me if were going to get him back we are going to have to be more ruthless than you can imagine and if at any point you start to have doubts thats fine step aside but i need you to promise me youll stick your head in the sand and keep your mouth shut hubbard gave him a nervous smile i can do a sergeant schultz when i need to good rapp replied even though he had his doubts so where do you want to start rapp returned his attention to the row of dead men the bodyguards hubbard turned his sixfootfiveinch frame toward the row of men and pursed his lips i think we can rule these four out rapp focused on the man with the cratered face an inside job was the obvious conclusion but the bodyguards were all hardened northern alliance types it was possible that one of them could have been bribed into giving up the crucial information on the security system but unlikely if one of them had turned however it was also possible that the taliban or whoever was responsible for this had decided to kill the inside man as soon as they got what they wanted the wrench in the works was that rapp was pretty certain the taliban had nothing to do with this he pointed at the man missing part of his face focus on this one i want to know everything there is to know about him especially his family do his parents or wife or kids have medical problems does he have a drug problem anything you can find and the other eight a team of interrogation experts from dc were in flight but not expected to land for another thirteen hours if you have the manpower you can get started with them but i doubt theyd hang around after something like this what would you do if someone gave you a pile of cash to betray your buddies and a man like rick rickmans first name was joe but everyone who worked with him called him rick id run thats right rapp pointed to the man whod been shot with a caliber focus on this one for now so you think the taliban turned him rapp ignored the question for the moment and asked who moved these bodies what do you mean the bodies rapp said as he pointed at the row of four they werent shot here look at the blood on the floor they were dragged here after they were killed rapp pointed at the stairs one of them was dragged down from the second story hubbard shrugged they were lined up like this when i got here did the bodyguards move them not that i know of do you want me to find out in a minute rapp looked toward the front door where one of the bodyguards was standing post with an ak gripped in both hands the neighbors did they hear or see anything last night no not a thing no signs of forced entry not that weve discovered but they wouldnt need to force their way in if one of these guys were helping them so no forced entry four bodyguards four headshots four dead men anything about that seem unusual to you hubbard thought about it for a moment and said not sure what youre driving at rapp pointed at the bodies one after another saying ninemillimeter ninemillimeter nine millimeter caliber and my bet is they were all fired from suppressed weapons pretty accurate work good fire discipline look at the walls hubbard did a degree turn and said what about them you see anything no thats the point you ever seen the taliban operate like this four shots four hits and not a shot more the taliban likes to get the lead out you know their mo they would have rolled up on this place with three or four trucks and started unloading rpg rounds at all three buildings this place would be riddled with bullets this was done by pros hubbard made a sour face and then nodded yeah youre right the towelheads like to blow shit up this is more like something our guys would do hubbard kept talking but rapp had stopped listening the idea that us special operators had been involved was something he hadnt considered and something he didnt want to consider from the moment rapp had heard rickman was missing there was a gnawing fear that he was about to head down the rabbit hole rickman excelled at his job for the simple reason that he could think five ten fifteen even twenty steps ahead of the enemy and everyone else for that matter there had been many times when rapp didnt understand what the man was up to because he wasnt smart enough to follow ricks thinking how about those assholes from the isi hubbard asked rapp had considered the lessthanloyal members of the pakistani intelligence service they would be on the list as well as others dont forget the iranians the russians and the chinese and there was one other possibility that rapp wasnt quite prepared to mention my moneys on the isi this is just the kind of bullshit theyd pull a thought occurred to rapp wheres the dog that big fricken rottweiler that never left ricks side ajax he died a month ago rapp was surprised by the news what was wrong with him dont know rick was pretty bummed out though dog got sick he took him to the vet and had to put him down i think rick said it was cancer or something like that one of rapps team members came down the stairs with a disturbed look on his face the man had blond hair and blue eyes and was pushing fifty not good was all he had to say rapp looked at scott coleman and said please tell me youre talking about something other than the safe tell me the safe is untouched and all the cash drives and laptop are safely tucked inside coleman shook his head all gone completely cleaned out even though rapp had expected it he had held out some hope that he could give his boss some good news shit i need to call irene and let her know rapp reached for his phone but stopped upon hearing a commotion at the front door chapter abdul siraj zahir admired himself in the mirror at fortyeight he was an old man in his country even among the common people it was difficult to make it to manhood in zahirs line of work the challenge was much greater he was a warrior like his father and his father before him his father and all three of his older brothers were dead his father and the two oldest brothers had been killed by the soviets and the third one had died at the hands of the northern alliance zahir had learned from their mistakes afghanistan was a brutal country where the only person you could really trust was someone from your own village beyond that loyalties were an evershifting complicated game zahir had learned that to stay alive he had to be brutal and vigilant he knew that some described him as sadistic and paranoid and he wore that as a badge of honorthe more people who feared him the better in afghanistan fear ruled if you couldnt get men to fear you you became a target zahir didnt want his life to end the way it had for his father and brothers so he stoked the fear it wasnt always easy but had found that he was good at it zahir pulled down on his gray uniform blouse snapped his fingers and then held out his arms his aide rushed forward with zahirs shiny black leather service belt he buckled it around his bosss ample waist made sure it was straight and then stepped out of the way so zahir could admire himself in the mirror zahir smiled at his reflection his weapon was a stillunfired caliber smith amp wesson the fact that americans had given it to him for free made ownership all that much more delicious hed spent most of the last decade killing americans and now he was on their payroll zahir noticed something wrong with his beard and moved closer to the mirror his irritation was directed at a patch of gray that he had missed he grabbed a bottle of black dye from his desk and inserted a small brush after a few applications the gray was gone zahir smiled at his finelooking beard and placed his hands on his hips he looked good in his uniform it was a little tight around the waist but in afghanistan his expanding middle section was a sign that he was a prosperous man afghanistan was a unique place it was like a petri dish for the survival of the fittest historically it had always been a harsh country hot summers cold winters and rugged geography had shaped a breed of extremely tough people for the last three decades a state of nearconstant war had only heightened the selection process being physically strong was no longer enough one had to be adept at reading the evershifting alliances that had shaped and reshaped the power structure of the isolated country the soviets had to be appeased and then the americans and their pakistani partners who sponsored the crazed wahhabi fighters from across the persian gulf who in turn led to the taliban and their enemies the northern alliance and a long civil war then the americans and their coalition showed up and swept the taliban from power in a matter of months abdul siraj zahir had been able to look into the future on that day more than a decade ago and understand that the taliban would be back american air power and their advanced weaponry had given him doubts along the way but zahir knew the afghan people and more important the devout muslims who represented the base of the taliban they would die to the last man before they let these godless people beat them zahir also knew that the americans were too selfconscious to hunt the taliban down like the dogs that they were and exterminate them so zahir played them all against each other and never forgot the fates of his father and brothers he held on to his little enclave southeast of jalalabad and changed sides as many times as he needed to to survive zahir neither loved nor hated his country he didnt think in those terms he lived in this particular part of the world like most of its people because he had been born here he considered himself to be an aboveaverage intelligent person with a very good understanding of what motivated people and more important what they feared despite his ability to sense the shift winds of power the most recent gigantic twist was something that even he had been unable to predict after he had killed countless americans and taken their money the fools had come to him with a job offera legitimate job offer not simply a bag of cash as they had done in the past for certain information they wanted him to become commander of the local police force he thought it was a trap of course but then he learned that other lions like himself had been offered and taken similar positions in the afghan police it was a new push the americans were calling the reintegration program he had been on the job for just six weeks and he was already lining his pockets with bribes from local businessmen the taliban was a concern of course they would after all eventually work their way back into power but not for a few more years and in the meantime zahir would play both sides against each other he would work for the americans take their money and keep the taliban informed of what they needed to know as always the most important thing was to stay one step ahead of seen and unseen enemies zahir had long ago surrounded himself with fiercely loyal people there wasnt a man in his inner circle whom he had known for fewer than ten years and they were all from his village they were of his tribe and in return for their loyalty he protected their families zahir never spent more than two nights in the same place and even with his newfound legitimacy he continued his old ways part of the reason was that he had four wives they all needed his attention but it was beyond that the axiom was extremely simple they couldnt kill him if they couldnt find him nights were always the most dangerous that was when the american killers hunted they used their optics advantage to harass and assassinate his countrymen for many years now zahir had avoided sleeping at night he always made sure he was awake from midnight until one hour before sunrise that was the preferred time that the american dogs liked to attack so he stayed awake and on the move he would then sleep in the mornings and conduct business in the afternoons and evenings this morning however was different after only a few hours of sleep pamir one of his most trusted men had awoken him with a startling piece of news there was a rumor sweeping through the back alleys of jalalabad that a notorious american had been snatched from his fortress mr rickman was a very important man who had made many of zahirs countrymen extremely wealthy unfortunately mr rickman had also spent a great deal of his time and money trying to kill zahir there had been many close calls but zahir had always managed to stay one step ahead of him now that zahir was in a position to finally receive some of the cash that the american was so famous for handing out someone had grabbed him zahir had been silently berating himself all morning for not coming up with the plan first with his newfound influence it was just the type of operation he could have pulled off having been beaten to the prize however he would now be forced to adapt if the last thirty years had taught him anything it was that out of chaos came great opportunity especially to those who were bold and ruthless in the reflection in the mirror zahir saw pamir enter the man did not wear the uniform of the afghan local police he had always been more suited to lurking in the shadows what have you learned pamir inclined his head slightly and said more americans are at the house i was told they flew in from kandahar this morning and were driven to the house by the tall american hubbard yes zahir snorted the cias local man was no match for him it would be easy to manipulate him was mr sickles with them no this surprised zahir he had found it very easy to work with sickles it was easy to pick up on the fact that rickman and sickles did not get along sickles had told him to stay well clear of rickman had told him that the man was someone he had no control over but still sickles was the cias top man in kandahar these new americans any idea who they are no pamir shook his head only that there were six of them security three humvees one normal one with a caliber turret and another with a grenade turret and men eight total they control each end of the street zahir snorted again they would never stop his police vehicles he would push right past them turning to raashid his lieutenant he asked are the men ready yes sir good have everyone get in the vehicles i want to make a show of force pamir asked and what would you like me to do keep looking for him and report to me the second you learn anything useful pamir gave a slight bow and left in his outer office zahir was happy see more than a dozen men strapping on their new bulletproof vests and checking their weaponsall courtesy of the united states of america what a bunch of fools he thought to himself the americans were going to learn a very hard lesson over the next few months chapter a group of men in afghan police uniforms were trying to push their way into the house rapp looked on with irritation as a man with an oily black beard berated the cia bodyguards the mans beard was obviously dyed so much so that he looked like a silentmovie actor playing a pirate to his right he heard hubbard muttering to himself the only thing rapp could make out were the words this is not good who is he rapp asked commander abdul siraj zahir alp alp stood for afghan local police whats his story up until six months ago he was an insurgent more of a crime boss really extorted and kidnapped every village between here and the border and now with the new reintegration program the geniuses in kabul have seen fit to put him in charge of the local police the info clicked and rapp remembered the name he and his group were responsible for a good number of the roadside bombs in the area was he on ricks payroll they were working on it hubbard motioned to the guards at the door and said its all right let him in with obvious displeasure on his face zahir pushed his way past the guards and approached hubbard rapp and coleman he focused his attention on hubbard and unleashed a torrent of expletives that were meant to punctuate his lessthanstellar view of hubbards abilities and his view in general of americans rapp took a step back his dark eyes dissecting this strange man who had so rudely forced his way into the safe house the bombastic behavior and bluster were not entirely unexpected but something else was the fact that hubbard was letting this piece of human refuse walk all over him rapp reminded himself that hubbard didnt have the luxury of flying under the radar as he did he had to report to his boss in kabul darren sickles who was more concerned with appearances than results sickles had to work side by side with the alphabet soup of us agencies and departments that had come up with the touchyfeely reintegration program the consensus with the foot soldiers in the clandestine service was that sickles didnt back them up rapp was willing to bet that this unhealthy and unproductive style of cooperation had something to do with sickles when zahir was done berating hubbard he turned to rapp and coleman and asked and who in the hell are these two why wasnt i called about these murders never one to run from a fight rapp squared himself so he was within striking distance of the police officer even though the man looked over fifty he was probably in his early forties like rapp unlike rapp though he was pudgy and out of shape he had a little potbelly and that ridiculous shoepolishblack beard hubbard started to answer but rapp reached out and grabbed his arm turning his eyes on the afghani rapp said who i am is none of your fucking business as to why we didnt call you that should be obvious youre a thug and a piece of shit zahirs face flushed with anger and he began to stutter hubbard put up his hands and said commander what hes trying to say is that it has been a very busy morning and that we were about to call you rapp kept his eyes on the zahir but directed his ire at the jalalabad base chief hub shut up thats not what i was about to say i was about to tell this little yellow turd that i know exactly who he is and if he has a half a brain hell get the hell out of here before i shoot him how dare you speak to me in such a way zahir stepped back and began clutching at his big leather holster for his sidearm from the right inside fold of his jacket rapp produced his glock in an easy fluid motion zahir was still struggling with the flap on his holster when he looked up to find the square black frame of rapps gun in his face i want you to listen to me rapp said in an easy tone and i dont want you to say a fucking word until im done coleman had already drawn his gun a big h ampk caliber and maneuvered to cover the other two police officers who were just one step inside the doorway the safety was already off and he spoke to the officers in pashto telling them to keep their hands where he could see them rapp pressed the gun into zahirs face just under his nose heres what you need to know im not some state department weenie or some twostar corporate general who thinks the best way to advance my career is to kiss your terrorist ass and get the hell out of this place so someone else can come deal with all you assholes again in twenty years im the guy they call when the shit hits the fan im the one they bring in to get results because they know i dont play by the rules i know who you are i know youve killed plenty of gis and youve tormented and kidnapped your fellow citizens for your own profit youre a bully and piece of shit and youre the kind of guy who i actually enjoy killing normally i dont put a lot of thought into the people i shoot but you fall into a special category i figure id be doing the human race a favor by ending your worthless life add to that the fact that im in a really bad mood in fact im in such a shitty mood that putting a bullet in your head might be just the thing to make me feel better rapp studied the man for a moment and then tilted his head toward his right shoulder as if he thought there might be some other way to deal with him in the interest of fairness i suppose i should give you a chance to convince me otherwise zahirs chest was heaving as he struggled to get his lungs working his eyes nervously darted between hubbard and this crazed man sticking a gun in his face hed been around plenty of killers and felt he could tell the difference between the pretenders and the men who meant what they said this man had the look of someone who clearly meant what he said the only lifeline that came to mind was the person who had negotiated zahir into leaving behind his lawless ways mr sickles is a good friend of mine zahir sputtered he is a very good friend he is a very important man he will be very upset when he finds out about this rapps instincts were right the kabul station chief had put this goon in a position of power darren sickles rapp said with contempt dripping from each word is important in his own mind but thats about as far as it goes he is the cias man here in my country hes an idiot and the fact that he put you in a police uniform pretty much proves the point so youre going to have to come up with something better than darren sickles zahir licked his dry lips and struggled to find something that would make this american reconsider his vile threat after an uncomfortably long silence nothing had come to mind so zahir forced a smile on his face and retreated a step i think it would be best if i left rapp grabbed the mans uniform shirt thats not an option you either come up with a way to show me you might be useful or im going to blow your brains all over the floor zahirs eyes showed hope and he said useful thats right i can be extremely valuable im listening i know many people i know many things i can get you anything you want zahirs nature allowed him to go only so far and he quickly added for the right price of course the right price rapp said amused by the comment im going to tell you how this is going to work and thats only if you can prove to me that i should let you live youre not going to get paid a dime the only thing youll get from me is your life which i would assume is fairly important to you it is very important to me but i am not a wealthy man stop talking about money youre boring me and if you bore me enough this negotiation will be over and youll be dead tell me what it is you want me to do i will do anything rapp thought about rickman the truth was very few people knew what the man was up to in a general sense kennedy and a few others knew his operational orders but in terms of specifics rickman had left them in the dark zahir might be able to pull back the curtains on some of those details the man who lives here you know him mr rickman very much yes we were good friends lets not get carried away why did you decide to come here this morning i was driving by and i saw mr hubbards mercenaries it looked like there was something wrong so i stopped to investigate do i look stupid abdul no he answered quickly i did not say that then tell me the real reason why you stopped rapp watched the man fidget he was clearly trying to figure out a way to shade the truth rapps patience was nearly gone so he took his pistol and tapped zahir on the top of his head i know lying is like breathing to you rapp shook his head as if he were admonishing a child you need to fight that its going to get you killed zahir rubbed his head with his right hand i heard a rumor what kind of rumor that something had happened to mr rickman keep going that something very bad happened that he was missing and you learned this how sharing information without getting something back was very foreign to zahir so he lied one of my men saw mr hubbard leave the base in a panic i started to make calls and soon found out that something was wrong at mr rickmans house so you were concerned for mr rickman yes and thats why you showed up here acting like a jackass and threatening people no i was concerned rapp glanced at his watch it was eight minutes past ten in the morning and he had a growing list of priorities that needed his immediate attention zahir as disreputable as he was might indeed have some use rapp made a quick decision heres what were going to do you will work for me you will find out who grabbed mr rickman and youve got fortyeight hours to come up with the answers i need if you fail me youre a dead man zahir once again tried to retreat he needed room to think and he couldnt do that with a gun in his face but it did no good the american simply followed him zahirs eyes pleaded for hubbard to give him a reprieve he didnt receive any help so he reverted to what he knew best how much will you pay me rapp laughed but there was no levity in it im not going to pay you shit in fact im going to do the exact opposite if i find out youre fucking me im going to text your photo to every jerkoff with a gun in this town and on the other side of the border as well and im going to put a fivehundredthousanddollar bounty on your head and if you think about heading for the hills ill have a predator on you twentyfour seven if you make a call if you step into the clear for a second ill shove a hellfire missile up your ass and blow you to hell to zahir the threat was all too real he had used the cia to decimate his own enemies by giving up their locations and phone numbers the drone strikes were very effective after a little consideration zahir realized that at least for the moment he had no choice but to go along with this man he slowly nodded his head and said i will see what i can do if you want to live youll do more than that rapp lowered his gun and said give me your phone zahir scrambled to retrieve the phone from the breast pocket of his bluegray uniform shirt he surrendered it to rapp who handed it to hubbard go upstairs and give this to sid tell her i want the usual and have our friends stateside move it into heavy rotation tell her i need a clone as well hubbard left and rapp turned his focus back to zahir were going to be listening to everything you say and if at any time im not satisfied with your efforts our deal is off off off means you broke the deal and youre dead and what if i dont like this deal rapp raised his pistol and pointed it at the mans face its pretty simple i blow your brains all over the floor right now and you end up like those four guys over there rapp motioned toward the four bodyguards youre not giving me much of a choice and when you kidnap villagers and hold them for ransom do you give them a choice zahir stubbornly refused to respond i know you dont like this abdul and the reasons pretty simple youre a bully youre used to pushing people around threatening them and their families with violence to get what you want now youre the one being bullied and you dont like it and i dont give a shit the only thing thats important is that you understand and accept our deal do you with barrel of the gun in his face zahir knew he had only one optionto acquiesce later when he was away from this madman he could figure out a way to go back on the deal you have left me with no other choice good id shake your hand but i know it wouldnt mean anything since you plan on fucking me over the first chance you get so heres what were going to do rapp grabbed his phone with his right hand tapped a few icons and then held it out to take a photo of zahir smile this is for the poster im going to send out with a fiftythousanddollar bounty on your head but you said relax i know what i said if you come through with what i need youll be fine i might even give you the fifty grand but if i get even the slightest whiff that youre screwing with me youre done you have enough enemies as it is if i put a bounty on your head theyll be lining up to collect hell its probably cheaper than wasting a missile on your ass hubbard came back with zahirs phone and gave it to him he handed a plain black flip phone to rapp rapp held it up and said this is how were going to talk to each other ill be able to track you with both phones but this is the one well use to communicate rapp gave him the phone im going to call you in two hours and if you dont answer the phone youre dead if you answer the phone and tell me you havent discovered anything youre dead do you understand how this is going to work zahir reluctantly stuffed the phone in his pocket and nodded what do i call you harry rapp said giving him one of his aliases now get out of here and find out what happened to joe rickman chapter bethesda maryland joel wilson impatiently tapped the fingers of his right hand on his right thigh while he was driven through the dark streets of the sleepy maryland neighborhood it was a few hours before dawn and the thought of waking his boss this early was less than appealing but wilson had learned the hard way that the stodgy old fool needed to be kept in the loop it was becoming an increasing source of irritation for wilson whose unbridled energy did not often jell with the slower pace of samuel hargrave the fbis executive assistant director for national security to those outside the bureau the job title meant little but within the fbi it was a position that had grown significantly in stature after hargrave was in charge of counterterrorism counterintelligence and the directorate of intelligence and weapons of mass destruction he dutifully reported to the top man at the fbi and beyond that he kept an extremely low profile and demanded the same of his peopleanother sore spot with wilson in wilsons succinct opinion hargrave was a relic from the fbis cold war days a man who was no longer suited to handle the multiple threats of this fasterpaced world he reminded wilson of that bushy eye browed law professor in the movie paper chase he was a real pain in the butt who spent his life looking to catch the tiniest of mistakes while losing sight of the big picture the man loved to point out every flaw no matter how small he was the most analretentive crotchety jerk wilson had ever worked for if only the fool would drop dead of an aneurysm wilson could get on with saving the country from the various threats that were circling wilson believed that his job was the most difficult and demanding at the bureau he was the deputy director of counterintelligence which meant that he not the cia was the tip of the spear it was simple the biggest threats to the nation were the foreign intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations that were looking to attack and weaken america it was wilsons job to stop them and those americans who might be aiding the enemy hargrave was everything a boss shouldnt be he was an obstacle to every decision and operation that wilson tried to launch wilsons frustration had grown to the point that he began to cut hargrave out of the decision process only to be severely reprimanded by the director of the fbi himself it was the lowest point of wilsons otherwise sterling twentyoneyear career with the bureau and it couldnt have come at a worse time wilsons boss the man who ran the counterintelligence division had been on leave for four months after a back surgery that didnt go as planned wilson had been asked to step in and take over as acting director it was one of the three most coveted jobs at the fbi and wilson didnt balk at the opportunity he took over as if hed been running the place for several years and not long after he ran afoul of hargrave since then wilson had explored every conceivable avenue around the man but hed been stymied as the director himself eventually told wilson the federal bureau of investigation is big on chain of command for a reason wilson disagreed with them both but he was not so bullheaded as to run afoul of the director so he kept hargrave informed of his every decision no matter how small wilson got the sense that hargrave knew what he was up to but so far the man had remained unflappable tonights developments however might be enough to undo him but for now wilson was once again forced to perform this stupid dance that was why he was rolling along this beautiful treelined street in chevy chase when he should have been with the rest of his team boarding one of the bureaus gulfstream s for a jaunt halfway around the globe the vehicle began to slow and wilson noticed his driver searching for the right address its up there on the left wilson said the white colonial with green shutters under his breath he added boring just like his personality excuse me sir the young agent asked nothing wilson replied cal patterson was in his third year with the bureau and he considered himself a lucky man to be one of the youngest agents in the counterintelligence division he liked his job but his boss made him nervous patterson casually turned the wheel of the ford taurus and edged the sedan into the narrow drive anything youd like me to take care of while youre briefing the ead boss wilson grabbed the handle and said check in with the go team i want everyone on that plane and their gear stowed when we arrive we should have been in the air an hour ago ill let them know sir wilson closed the car door and proceeded up the bricklined walkway he glanced through what looked like the dining room window and could see the faint glow of a light in what he presumed was the kitchen the front stoop was smallenough for two people wilson reached out to press the doorbell and then caught himself probably better to knock at this hour he held his left hand up to the door and rapped his knuckles twice on the green door he waited a long moment and then heard the locking mechanism turn the door cracked to reveal the high forehead of samuel hargrave without so much as a nod hargrave opened the door and motioned for wilson to enter the senior man closed the door and started down the center hallway to the back of the house wilson took in the lack leather slippers the black watch plaid pajama bottoms and the navy blue robe the man looked as if hed stepped off the set of a cary grant movie wilson started to ponder what is was like to be born fifty years too late but before he got too far hargrave asked him if hed like a cup of coffee no thank you ive already had my fill and i have a long flight ahead of me hargrave stared at him for a moment dissecting the words trying to figure out a shaded message he poured himself a cup of black coffee and sat at the small fourperson kitchen table after a sip he asked long flight where are you headed afghanistan wilson offered nothing more afghanistan is a big country any place in particular jalalabad jalalabad hargrave mused i think this is a first a first wilson frowned i dont understand sir hargrave had told him to call him sam a hundred times but wilson still refused it was a control thing he knew but hargrave wasnt willing to make a big deal out of something so petty still it was one more reason to worry that his acting director of counterintelligence was someone who needed close monitoring if he played these kinds of games with him what must he be like with his colleagues and subordinates how were his convictions when it came to following the law hargrave had learned long ago that these little things could eventually spell big problems for the bureau in all the years ive been doing this ive been pulled out of bed for a lot of reasons but no one has ever told me theyre flying to jalalabad hargrave set his cup down and rubbed his eyes we really have become a global law enforcement agency no shit you moron wilson thought where the hell have you been for the last decade so why jalalabad joe rickman wilson had a bigger target in mind but rickman would do for now hargrave was familiar with the name hed heard some rumblings that the covert officer had become a bit of an obsession with wilson he could tell the temperamental wilson was on edge so he chose his words carefully what has mr rickman done now i received a tip three hours ago that he was kidnapped from a safe house in jalalabad hargrave did not speak for several moments his mind was occupied with all of the ramifications of someone like joe rickmans falling into the hands of americas enemies to say that the men and women at langley would be distraught would be an understatement do you know who took him no but i find the timing suspect suspect hargrave asked with a curious tone i have been investigating him for the past two months rickman as well as a few others but hargrave didnt need to know that excuse me hargrave asked not quite sure hed heard right starting almost a year ago i began to receive some disturbing information about mr rickman accusations that he was siphoning off large amounts of money from his covert fund and that he was getting a little too close to some nefarious individuals hargrave closed his eyes and then help up his right hand youve known about this for almost a year and didnt bring it to my attention wilsons back stiffened it didnt warrant your attention sir it was nothing more than rumors to begin with if i passed along every rumor that came into my office id be running upstairs to meet with you eight times a day hargrave could feel the pressure building and reminded himself that his doctors had warned him against getting too upset mr rickman he said slowly is a unique individual anything concerning him and his activities automatically rises to the top of the heap so i dont accept your premise i am very disappointed that you decided to keep this from me hargrave shook his head and added weve been over this before you were told by the director himself what was expected of you wilson had known this was how it would play out and he was ready i am sorry sir but there are some extenuating circumstances really yes im listening wilson intentionally fidgeted in his chair he wanted to convey the sense that he was taking all this very seriously the information was originally passed on to me by a very important person who did not want their name connected to this in any way hargrave had started his career at the fbi and then at the age of forty he was appointed to the us foreign intelligence surveillance court he had spent eleven years on the bench and knew how this game was played and that person is im afraid i cant say sir wilson remained stoic although inside he took great joy in the fact that hargraves pale face had turned suddenly red that is unacceptable we sat in the directors office less than a month ago and he specifically told you that you were to keep me involved in any investigations your office was handling there was no gray area hargrave shook his head the director is going to be very disappointed im not sure youre going to be catching that flight to jalalabad wilson had expected this and was prepared to take the right tack sir there has been no investigation just some very troubling accusations made by a very prominent player i didnt feel it was right to bring any of this to your attention because frankly it was beneath you until i could figure out if these accusations were fact or fiction i didnt want to give the matter any more life than it deserved hargrave dissected the words for a few seconds and asked who is the power player who made the accusations id rather not say sir im sure you wouldnt but thats now how this works im your boss and if you want to fly to the other side of the world and spend taxpayer dollars investigating a fellow federal employee you need to read me in on this wilson crossed his legs and made a great show of looking at the round clock on the wall he sighed and offered the person in question is a senator sir and as part of our agreement he made me swear that his name would not be dragged into this how convenient im not making this up wilson said defensively it doesnt matter if you want to get on that plane you are going to tell me the name of this mystery senator sir i gave my word im losing my patience joel im your boss this isnt the cub scouts its the fbi and we have rules and laws that we are duty bound to follow a personal promise you made to a politician holds no water with us you are going to tell me everything you know right now or i will call dulles and pull your flight plan and then in about four hours ill be having breakfast with the director and i will brief him on your most recent activities when im done he will ask me for my recommendation as to your future as acting director of counterintelligence hargrave paused and stared at wilson for an uncomfortably long moment based on your refusal to follow the most simple of orders im fairly certain my recommendation will be less than stellar wilson had been fairly certain this was how this little drama would play out but in order to make it convincing he needed to follow his script he blurted out the name carl ferris hargrave nearly choked you mean to tell me you launched an investigation based on innuendo from one of the biggest partisan hacks to ever serve in the united states senate wilson played dumb i have no opinion on the man sir when a sitting us senator asks for a private meeting i take it very seriously good god you fool hargrave said haltingly i dont believe for a second that you are that naive hargrave was on his feet pacing nowhis brain struggling for a way to unwind this potential mess before it saw the light of day carl ferris was a master manipulator of the media and the supposed facts they reported wilson offered an additional piece of information he told me you had it in for him excuse me senator ferris told me that you didnt like him he wouldnt get into specifics but he said it had something to do with your days on the fisa bench hargrave turned to wilson and said the issue he is alluding to is sealed and not up for discussion but i can tell you that the senator did not comport himself well i dont want to get in the middle of a pissing match between you two what happened is none of my business there is no pissing match hargrave didnt like the way wilson had turned this into a personal matter whats at issue here is that you have once again failed to keep me informed of what you are up to and now you are about to get on a plane with one of my go teams and insert yourself into an extremely delicate situation hargrave grabbed the back of one of the chairs and said let me ask you something have you bothered to think of how our friends at the cia are going to react when you show up and start sticking your nose in the middle of this mess personally i could care less what those neanderthals at langley think hargrave had encountered this type of behavior in others before and he knew how destructive it could be we are on the same team he said flatly and my job is to make sure we stay on the same team what is that supposed to mean in my department no one is above suspicion my job is to stop the enemy from penetrating our national security apparatus and the easiest way for the enemy to do that is to get one of our people to turn on us what are you implying im implying nothing the facts are that joe rickman is one of the darkest spooks this country has hes a walking breathing encyclopedia of things that are so wrong its ridiculous if he has been kidnapped it is our duty to offer langley our capable assistance if for no other reason than that we need to get a handle on the breadth of the damage we should be the coordinating agency because god knows langley will want to admit only a fraction of the possible damage we need a full accounting of our exposure hargrave didnt want to but he had to concede the point six months from now it might look very bad if he forced counterespionage to sit this out i see where youre coming from but i want you to play nice i will be there to offer assistance in finding rickman and if along the way i see that any laws have been broken i will consult you before i move my investigation in a new direction thats what i wanted to hear wilson smiled there was no need to report his other concerns at this point as senator ferris had already warned him hargrave wouldnt believe them anyway wilson stood saying thank you sir now if youll excuse me i need to get moving one more thing joel i want you to check in with me every day i need to know what youre up to i was planning on it sir hargrave walked wilson to the door and watched him leave he didnt believe for a second that wilson was planning on keeping him informed and he found it even less believable that wilson was planning on simply aiding the cia in finding rickman all things considered though he had to let him go rickman was a valuable asset and the fbi needed to make sure the broader national security interests were being looked after still he couldnt shake the feeling that there was something else going on here something that wilson was keeping from him chapter jalalabad afghanistan hubbard was clearly agitated hed gone over to the window to watch zahir and his men leave rapp ignored him and took a moment to discuss something he wanted coleman to follow up on rapp was just finishing his point when hubbard approached them hubbard blinked several times and asked rapp do you have any idea what youve just done i think so rapp replied calmly im not sure you do that man is crazy hubbard pointed toward the door as if zahir was still there i have to work with him what in the hell were you thinking rapp remained cool and said you cant bribe a guy like that hell screw you over in the end every time the only way to deal with a guy like zahir is to make him fear for his life hubbard was incredulous darren is going to flip when he finds out hes worked nearly a year to bring zahir back into the fold at the mention of sickless first name rapp began to lose his grip darren is an idiot idiot or not hes my boss and the agencys top guy here in afghanistan are you done it was more of a warning than a question no im not done im far from done youre going to be here for a week or two at the most and then youll head back to the states and ill have to deal with him you dont know shit about zahir hes a ruthless son of a bitch hes probably going to kill me then kill him first rapp growled hubbard looked at rapp as if hed lost his mind darrens his handler i cant kill him ill deal with darren in the meantime you need to grow a set of balls the way you let him walk in here and talk to you what the hell is wrong with you you work for the damn agency hub not the state department start acting like it or find another job shit youve got mercenaries former taliban northern alliance former coalition special forces theyre all hanging out looking to make a buck you could have gone to rick given him ten or twenty grand and found fifteen guys thatd be willing to shoot the prick in the head when he left his house in the morning its not that easy really rapp asked his jaw clenched with anger well then i must be frickin superman because ive lost track of how many scumbags like zahir ive plugged over the years its not fuckin rocket science rapp said poking hubbard in the chest darren would lose his mind hubbard said in his own defense i just told you ill deal with darren rapp couldnt wait to get his hands on the pencilpushing prick right now i need you to work every source you have start shaking the trees and find out what happened to rick and if you run into zahir and he so much as looks at you the wrong way i want you to call me do you understand hubbard slowly nodded knowing it was unwise to continue to push the point with rapp yeah ill get on it good and remember we need to move fast rapp heard his name called from upstairs he looked at the staircase and then back at hubbard he slapped the taller man on the shoulder and said remember who we are hub dont take any crap especially for the next fortyeight hours if we dont get rick back zahir is going to be the least of our problems hubbard moved toward the door coleman stood at rapps side his caliber h ampk hanging loosely at his side when the junior operative was gone coleman said im not sure hes cut out for this job rapp wasnt sure either but he couldnt be mad at hubbard if darren sickles had been my boss god only knows how i would have turned out coleman kept his blue eyes focused on the door and said if darren sickles had been your boss you would have killed him hell stan was your boss and you almost killed him and hes one tough bastard sickles is a pussy rapp thought of stan hurley the man who had trained him pound for pound hurley was the toughest man rapp had ever knownone mean son of a bitch that was more than twenty years ago though more recently hurley had begun to show his age his mind was still sharp as hell but he was looking frail they dont make em like stan anymore coleman cracked a smile they sure dont but youre not too far off rapp feigned insult are you trying to say im some crotchety setinhisways old man who drinks and smokes too much and still chases women like im in my twenties youre more like him than youll ever admit if he was here the two of you would have gotten in a fight over who got to stick a gun in that terrorists face rapp laughed yeah and he would have won and then he would have flown up to kabul and done the same thing to sickles well the days far from over id say theres a better than fiftyfifty chance you and sickles will have it out rapp cursed under his breath one more thing to deal with he thought to himself he heard his name called again and walked to the bottom of the stairs stepping around the dead bodyguards he looked up the flight of stairs and said whats up a brunette poked her head around the corner and said i think you should come up here theres something you need to see rapp started up the stairs keeping his feet near the wall so as to not step in the trail of smeared blood sydney hayek was the newest member of rapps team and it had been kennedys idea to have hayek fill a vacant spot rapp had been less than enthused for several reasons the first was pretty straightforwardhis line of work didnt lend itself toward trusting people the room for error was thin and the stakes were so high that rapp preferred running an op with an understaffed team over risking a new recruit who might get the entire team killed the second reason for his apprehension was obvioushayek had come to them from the fbi rapp hit the top landing and asked whats up like the rest of the team hayek was wearing an olive drab field jacket the pockets stuffed with the various tools of the trade as directed by rapp she wore her flak jacket under her field jacket to draw less attention she was also wearing a pair of jeans a pair of merrell hiking boots and a blue detroit tigers baseball cap with a light and a small fiberoptic camera clipped to each side of the visor she looked at rapp with her almond eyes and asked scott told you about the safe yeah any sign of forced entry no im afraid it looks like it was opened by mr rickman rapp frowned lets not jump to any unfounded conclusions hayek shrugged i never met the man but i assume he was the only person within a couple thousand miles who had the code it was more like seven thousand miles but rapp didnt bother to correct her hayek had grown up in detroit the only daughter of armenians who had emigrated from lebanon she was fluent in arabic and most important she could walk down the streets of nearly any middle eastern city without anyone giving her a second glance in response to her accusation rapp said he was the only one with the code well the safe was opened using the code there was no tampering with the locking mechanism and as best i can tell it wasnt hacked youre sure as sure as i can be after being here less than an hour rapp tried to picture how it had gone down so he was forced to open the safe at gunpoint i didnt know the man so i cant say after working with her for seven months rapp was starting to get a sense of how hayek operated it was more what she didnt say than what she said you have some concerns i always have concerns share them some things dont make sense such as she hesitated and then said come here and ill show you they started down the hall careful where you step rapp looked down and stepped around a sizable pool of blood that was when he noticed the splatter on the wall whats this hayek looked over her shoulder one thing at a time i want to show you the office first she entered the room and walked behind the desk there were no windows the walls and ceiling were covered with acoustic foam and the floor was covered with a series of rubber squares behind the desk a narrow door covered in foam was open behind it was the open safe what am i looking for rapp asked nothing hayek turned off the lamp on the desk and then hit the uv light on her visor she looked down at the floor in front of the safe and then expanded the area sweeping the light back and forth no blood not a drop i still dont get it come here she walked across the room and stepped into the hallway she hit the light switch and extinguished the hallway lights the uv light on her visor lit up splotches and splatters of blood lots of blood out here but none in there now i dont know rickman but ive heard he was a pretty serious man your point ive been around you long enough to guess that someone would have to beat you to a bloody pulp before youd even think of opening that safe rapp nodded theres no blood in the office the rough stuff could have started anywhere down in the kitchen hayek shook her head and there would be blood in that office even if it were just small traces but there isnt any hayeks theory was slowly sinking in what else do you have this mess hayek pointed at the blood on the wall best guess is it belongs to one of the bodyguards downstairs the one missing half his face yeah hayek edged closer to the wall she pointed at a gooey chunk i have samples of everything and ill be able to test them for verification when we get back stateside but im percent sure this is brain matter with a little bit of bone and blood consistent with the gunshot wound received by john doe number four downstairs and this should interest me how look at the pattern of the splatter hayek acted as if she was holding a gun the bodyguard would have been facing this way toward the stairs the person came up and shot him from behind the bullet tore through his head exited leaving this large splatter on the wall and then the bodyguard fell facedown here thats why theres the big pool of blood rapp studied the blood splatter on the wall it all lined up i agree so whats your point three of the four guards were shot in the face makes sense they were reacting to the intrusion going to meet the threat this one though is shot in the back of the head doesnt make sense he should have been shot over there at the top of the stairs by the perps coming up the stairs rapp ignored her police talk he was a little irritated with himself for not seeing it sooner how closely did you look at the bodies downstairs close enough did you take measurements of the entrance wounds not exact but im pretty confident that the first three men were shot by a ninemillimeter and you know that how hayek held up a ziploc bag with three brass shell casings i found these on the floor and the fourth man hayek shook her head ive looked all over this hallway and the stairs and i cant find the casing best guess on the caliber best guess a hollow point definitely not the same caliber that took out the other guys rapp ran all the information through his head knew where it was taking him but didnt want to go there even though he knew he had to he looked back in the office there was no sign of struggle not a thing out of place the hallway was a bloody mess rapps eyes focused on the rorschachlike splatter i suppose the slug is buried in that wall yeah i was going to dig it out but i wanted to ask you first i dont know this team coming in from langley dont want to step on their toes it would be a problem but rapp could deal with it dig it out as quick as you can anything else you need to tell me about hayek hesitated and then said no what is it nothing she shook her head ill know more when i start matching up the blood samples with the bodies i think well be able to get a pretty clear picture of where everyone was when this thing went down nice work sid do me a favor and keep this between the two of us until we know for certain i dont want anyone running around pedaling halfbaked ideas anyone leans on you send them to me understood kennedy had asked her to relay as much information as possible as quickly as possible hayek could see that she was caught between her two bosses but rapp was just starting to trust her so she said understood good wrap things up and be ready to pull out in ten whats the rush theres a meeting back in kabul the whole alphabet soup you hate those kinds of meetings i hate any meeting but especially this kind rapp thought of sickles running the meeting without him why the man worked for the company was beyond rapps ability to comprehend i need to make sure a certain idiot doesnt make this shit show any worse than it already is chapter us embassy kabul afghanistan ive never even heard of this man the woman said with obvious frustration who the hell does he think he is colonel hunter poole took a final drag from his cigarette then tossed it to the gravel and crushed it with the heel of his black jump boot i dont know much about him but youve heard of him poole knew he needed to be careful arianna vinter was a passionate woman whose one glaring weakness was that she thought she could bully her way to any victory and from what hed heard about this rapp fellow it was probably not wise to attack him in a direct fashion poole shrugged and said hes a spook they dont exactly advertise their resumes vinter regarded her military man with a skeptical squint of her hazel eyes youre holding back poole played it cool ive heard a few things the kind of stuff that doesnt make it into official reports he lit another cigarette and said hes notorious in certain circles notorious how vinter asked taking a deep pull off her thin menthol cigarette their liaisons had become increasingly common the embassy was a crowded cramped place and smoking indoors by americans was strictly forbidden even in a country where virtually everyone smoked and then there was the simple fact that they needed to be careful about their relationship so they came to this corner of the compound where the multicolored shipping containers were stacked it was the hinterlands where the workers and the occasional jarhead came to replenish supplies but never the higherups from the embassy and poole and vinter were definitely higherups poole placed a hand against a rustcolored conex container and thought about the various rumors regarding mitch rapp the man like poole was in his midforties unlike rapp however poole had a sterling record hed graduated in the top percent of his class from west point completed ranger school and then blazed a trail through the big green machine with stops at the us army command and general staff college and the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university he was a platoon leader in the first gulf war and by the time the iraq campaign started he was the company commander of alpha company second ranger battalion he completed three combat tours with the rangers two in afghanistan and one in iraq during his second tour in afghanistan he was serving as an intelligence officer on the joint special operations command staff when he heard his commanding officer tell a story about a cia covert officer who had bluffed his way into a detention facility at the bagram air base by impersonating a us air force colonel from the office of special investigations a week earlier two highvalue taliban commanders had been caught on the battlefield and thus far had refused to talk in less than an hour rapp managed to get one of the men to spill the beans on an impending terrorist operation set to target the united states the rumors about how he pulled this off were varied but they all circled around some very orwellian tactics that created a mix of awe and fear among the men at jsoc there were other stories out there about rapp most of them from second or thirdhand accounts of his exploits in indian country if they were to be believed rapp was a person capable of extreme violence with little concern for his own mortality and an absolute disregard for the political and legal issues that the men and women in uniform had to wrestle with poole had followed the rules as any smart west pointer would and he was now on the doorstep of receiving his first stara lifelong dream but that wasnt where it was going to end poole felt he had the right stuff shooting for the chairmanship of the joint chiefs was his ultimate goal and if that worked out who knew maybe even the oval office was a possibility up until recently poole would have found it difficult to understand a man like rapp poole had been a rule follower but vinter had opened his eyes to the reality of washington she had shown him that there were times where rules were senseless obstacles rapp appeared to have built his entire career and reputation on the same philosophy as enticing as it was to cut corners poole knew he needed to be careful the us army was an entirely different playground one misstep in the eyes of the wrong general and your career was over it was the fear of just that kind of misstep that caused poole to temper what he knew about rapp its not easy to separate fact from fiction where hes concerned but if you believe even half of what is said about him hes an extremely reckless individual the kind of man that could sink my career poole thought to himself dammit vinter flicked her cigarette into the side of the container sparks cascading to the ground the last thing we need right now is some brute from the cia screwing this up ive worked way to hard vinter thought of her career at the state department and all of the sacrifices shed made to climb the ladder alongside all of the other scheming and plotting diplomats shed taken this godawful posting in afghanistan for multiple complicated reasons and one very simple onebecause it would further her career vinter hated afghanistan it was a country filled with people who were stuck in some ancient misogynistic culture that should have died a century ago the place was filled with hocuspocus religious fanatics who had less respect for women than most men had for their dogs as much as it bothered vinter that a bunch of bearded freaks could terrorize women with impunity while the us government stood by her boss had made it clear that there were other priorities the orders had come from the white house that with the election bearing down on the administration they needed to accelerate the military withdrawal the administration was looking for an excuse any excuse that would satisfy the independent voters for several years vinter had been pushing reintegration as a solution the original term had been amnesty but it didnt poll well so she came up with something more benign after multiple focus groups and to one of k streets top pr firms they landed on reintegration the word had a more clinical sound to it but more important it would pave the way for exit and victory it was one of those rare moments in vinters career when her genius had led to something that she didnt want it had been nearly a year ago when the secretary of states assistant told her to come on up to the palatial office for a very important meeting it started out well enough the secretary told her the president loved her idea vinter had beamed with pride like a child finally receiving due recognition from a distant parent and then came the bad part the president wanted her to take the lead run with her idea and make sure it got implemented her boss told her the president wants you on the ground in kabul supervising the entire operation youll report directly to me were putting a lot of power in your hands the ambassador will be told to aid you in any way you need and the white house is prepared to lean very heavily on the pentagon and the cia to make sure they support you for all intent and purposes you will be running the show in afghanistan vinter didnt really hear the rest of it her mind hung up on the part about living in kabul as if it were some bonejarring pothole in an otherwise smooth road vinter had traveled to afghanistan on multiple occasions and she had long ago decided that she detested the place but this was a career maker she knew almost immediately that if she did her year or two in hell she could demand any post she wanted afterward her husband was not thrilled that she had failed to consult him on the decision but she knew he wouldnt have the balls to really stand up to her and besides her teenage son was driving her nuts there was too much testosterone in the house for her liking she rationalized that it might be the best thing for her to take a break from the two men in her life and if it caused her marriage to fall apart that was something she could deal with after seventeen years change might not be the worst thing hes a small cog in an extremely big wheel poole said trying to calm her down vinter was an extremely intelligent and passionate woman but she could handle only one passion at a time and poole was more interested in getting her to hike up her skirt at the moment he reached out and placed his right hand on her shoulder one call to the secretary and you can have him shipped off to antarctica he started rubbing her shoulder vinter turned that possibility over in her mind until she figured out that her little army boy was a little too earnest in his physical contact what in the hell are you doing im trying to help you relax you dont think clearly when you get like this and you dont think clearly when you let your dick do your thinking ive seen that look in your eye before youre not worried about me thinking clearly youre focused on having sex vinter saw the playful grin on pooles face its only been what six weeks and i already have you figured out there will be no screwing back here between the storage containers like a couple of dogs in heat it happened once it was a moment of weakness and it will never happen again come on poole half moaned he pulled her close adding i need you you had me two days ago i dont think you need it that bad normally im not like this but you make me crazy he kissed her lips while his hands found her backside vinter pushed him away we have a meeting in ten minutes snap out of it zahir is threatening to take his men and go back to the mountains if that happens it could create a domino effect and all of the progress ive achieved over the past year will vanish all because some spook got kidnapped she thought about the strange turn of events i hear this mercenary who is trying to undo all of our hard work is going to show his face at the meeting poole pulled vinters hand toward his crotch speaking of hard vinter almost slapped him stop it we need to focus darren is absolutely beside himself he says this rapp has serious mental issues do you know what washington will do if they hear we screwed this up poole had finally got it through his head that they werent going to have sex he took a deep sigh youre making way too big of a deal out of this we didnt screw anything up were on schedule with reintegration if this thing goes off the tracks at this point we blame it on rapp we lay it at the feet of the cia and get out of the way that doesnt work for me i dont fail vinter stabbed herself in the chest with her index finger attempting to add some unneeded emphasis to her position her hazel eyes wild with fury she added im not going back to dc a fucking disaster poole sighed it appeared that a confrontation was unavoidable he wondered if there was any way to minimize the oncoming clash vinter would expect percent support from him but poole had already decided it would be foolish to confront rapp in such an open way poole had learned that when going into battle against an unknown enemy you must set your ego aside and have a contingency in place for a tactical withdrawal that was the careful course he would have to navigate vinter would scream at him later but even with the great sex he was growing tired of her browbeatings maybe this would present an opportunity to balance the scales and make her more compliant im going to support you but im warning you he might not be the kind of guy you want to pick a fight with well im not the kind of woman you want to pick a fight with and its not going to be a fight im going to tear his balls off and send him packing and thats going to be the end of it as much as poole wanted to believe her he shared none of her confidence arianna i know im not going to be able to change your mind but dont tell me i didnt warn you having no desire to hear her response poole turned and began making his way toward the main building chapter interservices intelligence hq islamabad pakistan nadeem ashan walked down the broad hallway with a sense of dread after twentynine years of working for pakistani intelligence one would think ashan would be used to these bumps in the road but this particular bump concerned him for reasons that he was extremely reluctant to share with anyone else in the building ashan was an expert navigator when it came to the turbulent waters of the isi and that historical knowledge only added to his growing concern the place was not some monolithic bureaucracy where likeminded men shaped the intelligencegathering and covert activities of pakistan the isi was a deeply divided sectarian institution composed of intelligence professionals and military personnel who had vastly different ideas about what was best for their country the main fault line lay between the secularists and the religious fanatics with various groups within each camp the secularists typically pushed for modernity and stability they had warned for years that the intelligence agencys support of the taliban in afghanistan and lashkaretaiba in kashmir india would eventually bite them in their proverbial behind the religious fanatics saw the taliban as an ally that could be used to keep neighboring afghanistan weak and the fiercely nationalistic element of the group refused to waver in their support for the terrorists in kashmir their hatred for india ran so deep that they blindly supported the savages who intentionally killed civilians in an effort to make kashmir a free state the hardliners were exposed as reckless fools in the aftermath of the mumbai terrorist attacks that left dead and the worldfamous taj hotel a smoldering ruin the international outcry was deafening as the deputy general for analysis and foreign relations ashan heard it the loudest even before the attacks on new york and washington ashan had had a very close relationship with the cia and mi after those attacks ashan began to see just how dangerous it was to support the mongrel dogs of jihad even president musharraf began to see the light and when he moved to support the united states in the war on terror those dogs turned on him and tried unsuccessfully to take his life seven times during his tenure as pakistans head of state only five of those incidents had been reported ashan and his colleagues at isi helped cover up the other two due to the conspirators ties to certain intelligence officials all of these incidents were embarrassing for the isi but none of them compared to what was uncovered when the americans sent in one of their elite commando units to kill the worlds most notorious terrorist bin laden it turned out had been hiding in pakistan for years ashan instantly knew that factions within the isi had been harboring him money would have changed hands to be sure but the primary motivation was undoubtedly ideological symmetry no matter how pakistan tried to deny it there were a significant number of men in the pakistani military and isi who supported and applauded the actions of the taliban and al qaeda ashan was on his way to see just such an individual lieutenant general akhtar durrani was the deputy general of the isis external wing durrani and ashan ran two of the isis three main groups their influence was vast and they both reported directly to the isis director general ashan managed to move back and forth between the secularists and the hardliners depending on the situation while durrani was firmly in the camp of the hardliners ashans pragmatism was driven by an obvious factpakistan was overwhelmingly a muslim country ashan moved past the handpicked military bodyguards and his colleagues male personal assistant with nothing more than a nod isi headquarters was a sprawling compound and the foreign relations wing was a healthy distance from the offices of the external wing but even so the two deputy generals were very close almost every day ashan made the lengthy walk from his office to durranis unlike most of the pakistani men his age ashan was very focused on his health neither of his parents had made it to sixty his father died of a heart attack brought on by years of smoking cigarettes and his mother died of lung cancer brought on by years of smoking ashan abhorred smoking and made every effort to eat right and walk every day he was intent on living well into his eighties the heavy door to durranis office was closed ashan glanced over his shoulder at the assistant who checked the lights on his phone hes alone ashan knocked on the door and turned the knob he stepped into the large rectangular office and was enveloped in a haze of gray smoke ashan didnt hesitate he flipped a switch on the wall and the hum of an exhaust fan kicked in he had had the unit installed nearly four years ago because he could no longer tolerate sitting in the smokefilled office he considered chastising his friend for not having it on but thought better of it the man was breathing the carcinogens directly into his lungs the exhaust fan would make little difference nadeem durrani said leaning back in his highback black leather chair what a pleasure durrani was dressed in his army uniform lest anyone forget the duality of his importance ashan having served only four years in the air force was dressed in a blue suit and yellow tie i was in the neighborhood and i decided to stop by exercising again durrani smiled and held out his cigarette ive warned you if you keep that up it will kill you yes i know if only i smoked like you and the rest of the country i would be much healthier you might have more fun durrani said with a broad grin forming under the ample black mustache that seemed to be a prerequisite for being an officer in the pakistan military i have plenty of fun ashan continued past the two chairs in front of his friends large desk and sat in the chair by the window that looked out onto one of the many inner courtyards of the compound the armchair was something else he had ordered on his own the two chairs in front of durranis desk were stubby little things that forced the occupants to look up at durrani as if he sat high atop k ashan couldnt be certain but he suspected that the seating arrangement was a holdover from the old colonial days when british officers ran their country so what brings you to my little enclave this morning do you need the dirty tricks of the external wing to save your rear end once again more serious than kidding ashan said your dirty tricks are usually what puts my posterior into the hot water oh come now durrani said with a deep laugh we all have our roles to play ashan was not in such a playful mood he knew his friend too well knew his capabilities and his weaknesses and if he had been stupid enough to lend any of his people or expertise to facilitate the lunacy in jalalabad then they were all in a great deal of trouble let us just pray for a moment that no one in the external wing had anything to do with what happened across the border last night which border are you referring to ashan ran a hand across his cleanshaven face and tried to gauge whether his old friends ignorance was real of feigned the man had become so adept at playing this game that ashan could no longer glean the difference he decided to play it straight the border to our north ah mr rickman very unfortunate im surprised you have heard ashan was used to the constant shots at the capabilities of his department foreign relations is our specialty how did you learn of it the embassy they sent a cable this morning ashan told only half the truth hed also spoken with the cia directly the americans are very upset i would imagine they are mr rickman is not someone i would want to lose ashan turned and glanced out the window he sensed his friend was playing some kind of game but he could no longer be sure they had met thirtyfive years ago while he was studying at oxford and durrani was at the royal military academy at sandhurst back then durrani was an open booktransparent about his passions and plans ashan had always appreciated his honesty and forthright manner the isi had slowly turned him into a duplicitous spymaster however and ashan feared there was an everdeepening divide between them akhtar i have to ask you something durrani gave a welcoming smile signaling for his friend to proceed you will not like this question people ask me questions every day that i do not like it is part of my job ashan watched him light another cigarette and then casually asked do you or any of your people have any information about the kidnapping of rickman durrani didnt answer right away as he was taking in a deep breath of smoke to make sure the cigarette stayed lit only fools had to relight a cigarette he shook his head and exhaled saying that is a pretty broad question could you be more specific did you have any knowledge that he was a target personally i had no knowledge and your people durrani scoffed why would my people be involved in something so reckless ashan could come up with a half dozen reasons that would make his point he was going to let it go and then something pushed him further than he had gone with his friend in some time maybe you should tell me since we both know some of your people decided it was a good idea to hide bin laden from the world in our own backyard i should add durranis easy expression hardened it has been decided that we are not to discuss that matter yes it had been decided in the embarrassing aftermath of the seal team raid the president and the director general had asked ashan to investigate any potential involvement by the isi in aiding bin laden a twostar army general had been ordered to investigate the potential involvement of the armed forces as well the general had come back with a pathetic report that cleared the military of all involvement ashans investigation was an entirely different matter six intelligence officers were implicated as well as five army officers and a handful of subordinates and there were more before ashan could finish his investigation the director general stepped in and seized all evidence and had it destroyed ashan was furious but he was told it was for the good of pakistan the director general told him the americans had penetrated his investigation and were now in possession of information that they could use to blackmail pakistan into doing their bidding ashan knew the answer was a complete fabrication his investigation was taking him to the doorsteps of some very influential people he was on the brink of exposing to the world that senior pakistani officials had harbored the worlds most notorious terrorist rather than clean house and admit their mistakes the president and his senior cabinet members decided to bury the entire matter not a single person was punished and since firing those involved might bring about more speculation they were allowed to stay in their positions ashan found the entire thing infuriating but was left with no recourse except one he very quietly and carefully passed what he knew on to the americans yes it has been decided that we are not to discuss the matter but we have always prided ourselves on being realists and since we are in your office which we both know to be secure i see no harm in pointing out that we know for a fact that some of your people are indeed reckless dont be so smug your department was implicated as well yes ashan nodded one reckless moron and i have done my best to make his life miserable i have him stuffed down in one of the sublevels digitizing old files and the five men in your department how are they faring how i run my department is my business ashan took the defensive answer for what it wasan admission that the duplicitous scum still held their old positions so now that weve established that we have people in our fine organization who would indeed participate in a plan as reckless as kidnapping someone like joe rickman how do you suggest we make sure that none of our people had anything to do with this i would suggest doing nothing nothing even investigating such a thing will draw the attention of the americans i see no reason to open my wing up to more of their accusations when i am confident that my people had nothing to do with this afghanistan is a rough place as the americans have found out they should have gone home a long time ago ashan made no attempted to conceal his exasperation why must you continue to treat the americans as if they are our enemy durrani stabbed out his cigarette in the large copper ashtray and folded his hands across his tight green uniform shirt afghanistan is our toy the british thought it was their toy for a long time and then the russians thought they could take it and then the americans in their arrogance thought they could do what neither the british nor the russians could accomplish they thought they could tame the savages and take what is ours ashan shook his head he had heard all of this before again you have conveniently left out the part where al qaeda attacked them we could have handled al qaeda for them all they had to do was ask they didnt need to invade our neighbor look at all the damage they have caused ashan started to speak and then stopped it was all a waste of his time they had been over all of this before durrani loved to feign ignorance and spout his dislike for the americans all while gladly taking their money it was rumored that hed pocketed millions over the course of the war some of it undoubtedly coming directly from rickman ashan had been on the verge of leveling the accusation on multiple occasions but had always maintained just enough control to avoid suicide durrani wasnt the only one who took money most of the leadership at the isi received some form of payment from the americans including ashan himself the problem with durrani was that he took the money and then worked feverishly to undermine the legitimate goals of their ally the damage they have caused and i suppose you think weve had no hand in this mess training and funding the mujahideen and then the taliban and even some members of al qaeda afghanistan is a mess but it is our mess it is time for the americans to leave and what do you think theyre trying to do this reintegration program that ive been helping them with is so they can pull out and maintain a network of paid spies to continue to manipulate the affairs of this region durrani shook his head it is unacceptable it is understandable considering everything theyve been through would they allow us to meddle in the affairs of countries in their geographical sphere of influence durrani didnt wait for an answer they most certainly wouldnt they have worn out their welcome it is time for them to go home increasingly this was how their conversations played out to push further would be a waste of time and energy and what about rickman the general shrugged another casualty of war everyone involved in this mess has lost thousands rickman is just another body ashan shook his head in genuine disbelief thats where youre wrong joe rickman is not just another body he is one of the cias most important assets and they are not just going to sit back while hes tortured the man has too many secrets extremely valuable secrets you are overstating his importance and even if you werent good luck finding him overstating his importance ashan stood and walked to the other side of the large desk he faced his friend and said do you know who the americans have dispatched to find rickman i have no idea ashan placed both hands on the desk and said your old friend mitch rapp durrani looked away and swallowed hard after a moment of silence he said we will offer him any assistance he needs the words were flat with no real commitment behind them akhtar we have been friends for a long time i dont want you to react i dont want you to say a word for once please listen to me mitch rapp is an extremely dangerous man the fact that they have sent him over here is proof of how serious the americans are about getting rickman back rapp doesnt care about diplomacy or politics he is the last man you want to cross he will kill anyone who has anything to do with this im going to leave now but i suggest you follow through on your words offer him any assistance he needs and if you find out that any of your people have aided the taliban in we have no idea who did this durrani said with more than a tinge of irritation in his voice you are correct ashan said in a soothing voice but we can make some educated guesses and if the usual suspects are involved we can almost guarantee that somewhere someone has a connection to the isi we need to put our people to work they need to tell us what they find out and we need to hand it over to the americans i know this is painful for you but you need to act like a true ally durrani looked as if hed taken a bite out of a sour lemon i am sick of the americans and their arrogance this is not my problem they can find rickman on their own ashan stepped back fine you stubborn fool rapp has already warned you what he would do to you if you stabbed him in the back again he retreated toward the door and asked does he strike you as a man who doesnt follow through on his threats i am not afraid of mitch rapp ashan placed his hand on the doorknob a genuine feeling of sadness in his heart his friend had turned into a stubborn old fool who thought the americans lacked the resolve to play this nasty game at his ruthless level for the average american he had a point but mitch rapp was in no way average ashan opened the door and over his shoulder said if you arent afraid of mr rapp then you need to have your head examined chapter kabul afghanistan rapp looked out the porthole of the enormous mrap cougar the drive from the airport to the embassy was short just under two miles the army corp of engineers had done a nice job widening the great massoud road to relieve as many choke points as possible cameras had been installed and fresh blacktop prevented insurgents from trying to bury roadside bombs no parking was permitted on the street and the sidewalks were kept clear of garbage vendors and pretty much anything that could conceal a roadside bomb despite all of these precautions rapp was filled with anxiety while most people found comfort in the mine resistant ambush protected vehicles rapp thought of them as big rolling coffins you might as well paint a sign on the hulking side that said infidels rapp preferred a more lowprofile form of transportation the clandestine service at langley bought oldermodel vehicles and had private contractors make sure the cars were in top mechanical shape occasionally they would add bulletproof glass and some armor but in afghanistan rapp felt the key was to change vehicles often and blend in as they hit the big turnaround at the corner of the embassy rapp felt his chest tighten they were close to the gate and this was where the crazies liked to attack the vehicle came to a sudden stop they were the third in a threevehicle convoy rapp looked up at coleman with irritation washed across his face and asked why are we stopping coleman gave him an easy shrug probably checking our creds you mean to tell me those dumbasses didnt preclear us no idea coleman smiled amused at rapps nervousness rapp punched the button to lower the back hatch well im not going be a sitting duck as the stairs lowered rapp nimbly navigated them before they were all the way down coleman laughed at him and popped the button to close the hatch the air force security guys driving the vehicle were grumbling up front wanting to know who the moron was who had just compromised their secure vehicle coleman waved them off and apologized outside rapp came facetoface with a us marine who couldnt have been older than twenty the corporal gave rapp a knowing nod and said i dont like those things either rapp took a quick look around and realized the marine was part of a security team that had been pushed out one hundred feet from the main gate they were in a semicircle spaced every thirty feet a loose picket designed to create a secure pocket while credentials were verified and vehicles checked the embassys perimeter blast walls ballistic glass and kevlarreinforced walls were impervious to car bombs but visitors were vulnerable during this brief window when they were at the embassys doorstep two fourman fire teams composed the extended security what a shitty job rapp thought to himself they were a thin tripwire out here to slow down any crazy bastards who were barreling down on the gate in an explosivesladen vehicle their early shots with their ms were not likely to stop the vehicle nor were the rounds of the m saw it was the job of the big caliber guns back at the gate to punch a hole in the engine of any unauthorized vehicle howd you end up with this powderpuff job rapp asked as his eyes continued to sweep the area the marine tapped the two chevrons on his sleeve shit rolls downhill and as my gunny likes to remind me the corps is not a democracy so i do what im told rapp noddedunderstood it was the way it had to be good luck rapp turned and headed for the door next to the big steel gate a sergeant in his tan combat utility uniform and decked out in body armor intercepted him rapp pulled out a set of fake state department credentials the sergeant took the credentials and said wait here he walked over to the closest guard booth and slid the identification through the metal box a few moments later he returned with rapps fake creds and a badge are you armed mr cox rapp shook his head and said nope even though he was carrying two pistols and a knife he followed the sergeant to the small door and stepped through on the other side a familiar face was waiting for him rapp was neither pleased nor bothered to see mike nash irene decided to send over reinforcements nash had been attached to rapps team for almost five years and had recently been promoted to deputy director of the counter terrorism center at langley im only the first wave shes pulling in clandestine boys from all over the place rapp grimaced he didnt have the time or the patience to manage all of these people it quickly dawned on him that he wouldnt have to that was why nash was here still he needed to have a say in what these people would be doing or theyd end up falling all over each other and what are we going to do with everyone nash shrugged theyre gonna beat the bushes until we find something more specific normally rapp would have been drastically against drawing too much attention to what they were doing but this little disaster was a unique problem beating the bushes was as a good a start as any for the moment any orders rapp asked knowing there would be yeah nash said as he jerked his head toward a treelined walkway signaling rapp to follow him the two men looked enough alike to be confused as brothers rapp was five years older and an inch taller his hair was black with a touch of gray where nashs was dark brown the main similarities were in their square jaws and overall demeanor when they were a good distance away from the gate nash found a spot under a towering cypress tree whatd you find out in jalalabad four dead bodyguards safes empty his laptop is gone and god only knows what else its a fucking disaster any leads not really rapp shook his head although i met some asshole named zahir he used to be a terrorist but now hes supposedly our friend rapps tone made it obvious that he didnt buy the last part abdul siraj zahir im familiar with his work i warned both rick and sickles that we didnt want to get in bed with him but they ignored me well the asshole showed up at the safe house and tried to throw his weight around and im sure you employed all of your diplomatic skill to defuse the situation youre a smart man he took a shit all over hubbard and when i couldnt take it anymore i stuck a gun in his face and threatened to blow his head off nash laughed he thought briefly about telling rapp how dangerous zahir could be but hed be wasting his breath mitch knew his type all too well not the most subtle approach listen id love to be all sneaky and clever about this but we dont have the time we either get him back in the next few days or all hell is going to break loose nash concurred irene agrees we all know the score and know what has to be done rapp was suspicious that the higherups in dc were of a single mind listen ive seen this movie before they say all kinds of shit talk tough and demand results and then we run off and start kicking in doors and knocking heads and then a year from now if things start to leak theyll act all shocked and demand we swing from the mast i dont disagree but at least this time irene says dod state and the white house are all on board rapp still wasnt buying it thats what they say now but im telling you down the road theyll bail on our asses so fast itll make your head spin youre probably right but what in the hell are we going to do about it we either play by the book and watch it all fall apart or we get rough and hope we get him back before he spills the family jewels i know what we have to do and im willing to do it but youre not going to convince me that those clowns in dc will support us for a second nash didnt have much faith in his fellow bureaucrats and even less in the politicians who ran the city but they had more leverage than rapp was giving them credit for did you know rick became the de facto paymaster for this reintegration program rapp was surprised by the news i thought state was running that cluster fuck they were the lead agency but they didnt have the wherewithal or i suspect the guts to actually shake hands with this collection of misfits so the president asked irene if we could help out and she said yes thats correct so irene has a little more leverage on all of them this time around since they all signed on maybe theyll be more cooperative i wont hold my breath none of us expect you to which is what we need to talk about this meeting thats about to take place irene wants you to keep a low profile why shes working directly with the sec def and the sec state to keep their people in line the white house is helping out and she thinks she can get all of them to basically close their eyes and cover their ears for the next seventytwo hours fine by me nash pressed she doesnt want you to pick any fights rapp scoffed and shook his head with who with anyone what about that sickles dumbass she wants me to handle him really rapp said with a raised brow then youd better keep him away from me nash knew this wouldnt be easy and dancing around the issue would only make it worse listen everyone knows youre point on this but you have a history of not playing nice on the playground with the other kids rapp heard the first mrap roll through the gate shook his head in frustration and said spit it out im not in the most patient mood this morning youre never in a patient mood so i need you to slow down for a second hear me out theres going to be a woman in this meeting arianna vinter have you heard of her no shes from state shes the one who came up with this whole reintegration business apparently shes a real ball buster very connected and shes not afraid to chew ass wonderful yeah well irene thinks you two are going to have a problem why would you guys want to put me in a room with this woman believe me irene thought long and hard about it then why dont i just skip it we thought about that but irene wants them to understand how serious this is and she wants them to all know that we are running the show until the white house says different then i dont see a problem irenes not so sure she doesnt want you getting distracted and she thinks this vinter will do exactly that this was the type of stuff that drove rapp nuts in the best of times he couldnt give a rats ass about the feelings of some state department bureaucrat but now in the midst of one of the worst debacles the agency had seen in decades his fuse was so short he was ready to explode he pointed his finger at nash and was about to unleash a torrent of expletives when coleman rolled up and interrupted him mike how was your flight coleman extended his hand fine nash shook his hand and then pointed at rapp with his thumb im just trying to calm down our friend dont waste your time wheres stan i need to talk to him for no apparent reason other than the mention of stan hurley nashs demeanor melted into a mask of concern at the mention of the man who had trained both him and rapp rapp picked up on it immediately whats wrong hes not going to be making the trip why nash looked at the ground for a few seconds and then said he got some bad news while you guys were in the air what kind of bad news rapp asked cancer shit rapp said under his breath his lungs stan hurley had smoked for more than forty years nash nodded stage four theyre giving him six months maybe a little more maybe a little less it was as if all of rapps energy had left him just melted away from his head down to his feet and onto the pavement his relationship with hurley was a complicated one that couldnt have started off on a worse footing but over the last two decades the irascible old cuss had become an extremely valuable mentor often he was the only person that rapp could really confide in hurley was the only man who had truly walked in his shoes rapp turned away from coleman and nash and began to walk he had no destination in mind only a feeling that he needed to be alone so he could get a handle on the sadness that was beginning to wash over him chapter the assassins attention was focused on the fifteeninch screen of his laptop a do not disturb sign was hung on his hotel room door to make sure housekeeping didnt accidentally wander in and catch him doing something nefarious even so if they did there wouldnt be much for them to see gone were the days of all the bulky surveillance equipment tripods for big cameras with even bigger lenses video recorders and big dish parabolic microphones and the big suitcase packed with monitors for video and audio all of that now fit into a wireless device no bigger than a tissue box he had helped design it in his ample spare time for just such a reason the americans would love to get their hands on something so portable and effective the act of surveillance was far more complicated than one would think static targets like embassies often conducted countersurveillance standing in the window of a hotel room across the street from a major embassy with a pair of binoculars to your eyes and a set of cameras on each side was a near sure ticket to getting your door kicked in and a bag put over your head what would follow after that was sure to be very unpleasant the assassin had been on the receiving end just once and he had spent years trying to erase his unpleasant week as a guest of the russian foreign intelligence service he had no desire to be the subject of such barbarity again and while the americans were not quite as ruthless as the russians they had shown that they could be brutally efficient in the face of an enemy who refused to put on a uniform the new surveillance equipment consisted of two cameras and a directional microphone both cameras were capable of extreme magnification but for the assassins purpose he kept one on the wideangle setting so he didnt lose sight of the big picture the two cameras and microphone were combined in the tissuesized gray box it was mounted on a small lightweight tripod with a motor that allowed him to remotely turn and focus the device the functions were controlled with a joystick and the laptops mouse instead of standing in the window and risking exposure he sat on the bed with the lightweight computer on his lap it felt good to be back in the game the assassin had never fully retired but he had significantly cut back on the number and type of contracts he would take he still traveled a great dealmost of it to handle his farflung finances but he had also created a job that gave him the perfect cover to travel he was now a security consultant having spent so many years trying to figure out how to kill someone it was an easy transition he basically stalked his client and then instead of killing him he would debrief him by pointing out his vulnerabilities and the precautions he should take the pay was okay and the work was somewhat fulfilling although ultimately disappointing hunting a fellow human being without killing him was a little bit like getting half a blow jobthrilling yet ultimately disappointing this contract however had been a little unusual from the start he had been contacted through his legitimate consulting firm for a job in abu dhabi he did a lot of business in the united arab emirates so he thought nothing of it a week later the assassin checked into his room at the jumeirah at etihad towers an hour later a package was delivered to his suite containing a smartphone a very vague explanation of the job that was being offered to him and how he would be paid his client was exceptionally cautious which the assassin liked he also liked that the client was offering a large sum of money his finances were still in decent shape but million would go a long way the only thing that he didnt like was that the target was only described only in vague terms but even though he didnt like it it wasnt that unusual the most serious clients usually made you jump through a few hoops to gauge if they could trust you and then they would reveal the full identity of the target the size of the contract combined with the challenge of assassinating an american official in afghanistan was too much to resist so as per the instructions he turned on the smartphone tapped the texting icon and punched his answer into the dialogue box that had been two weeks ago since then the assassin had flown more than twenty thousand miles and received million in three separate wire transfers as per his orders he had checked into the kabul grand hotel the previous day and patiently awaited further instructions five minutes earlier a text had informed him that the target was headed his way in a military convoy consisting of three vehicles the first tan mrap came into view and the assassins anticipation grew that he would finally learn the identity of the target hed spent much of the last two weeks wondering who it could be he liked a challenge so part of him was hoping it would be the ambassador or a fourstar general and based on the fee his wishes were likely to come true hed done some checking however and the ambassador was already at the embassy so he could rule him out the trucks came to a stop outside the main gate of the embassy as was to be expected a few seconds later he watched as the back hatch of the last vehicle opened a head popped out into the bright sunlight and the assassin squinted as he watched a man hurry down the steps his fingers quickly adjusted the camera and brought the picture in tight on the man the hair on the back of the assassins neck bristled with a combination of excitement and fear his job had just gone from complicated to dangerous most of his targets over the years had been businessmen or government officials who were either too corrupt or too pious usually men in their fifties or sixties who were out of shape their senses almost completely dulled by women drugs booze and a life of luxury they were often surrounded by bodyguards who were well past their prime the man he was now staring at on his screen was far from past his prime and even if had lost a step he was perhaps one of the most dangerous animals on the planet it had been a few years since the assassin had last seen the cia operative but the details of his near death experience were forever seared into his psyche he still moved with that rare mix of athleticism grace and menace he stopped next to a soldier and spoke a few words the assassin watched as rapps head turned from side to side surveying the landscape for any threats his first encounter with rapp had been eerily similar even back then there was a part of his deeply embedded survival instinct that told him this wasnt someone to be messed with the challenge however proved too great to resist and the assassin was lucky to be alive reason would dictate that rapp was here to protect the prospective target the assassin ran through a quick list of possibilities a midlevel cia official would not garner a million payday and it was unlikely that rapp would be wasting his time riding shotgun for such a person it was possible that it could be an afghan official but again the price was too high the image of the woman popped into his mind almost without effort irene kennedy was the director of the cia and she and rapp were very close that would make perfect sense it had to be irene kennedy the director of the cia the assassin suddenly got the feeling that he had made a huge mistake as a general rule the cia was not an organization you wanted to cross swords with precisely because they had men like rapp who would hunt you to the end of the world to settle the score the price also seemed a little low for someone like kennedy for a long moment the assassin considered his options if the target was kennedy the smartest course would be to pack up his gear and catch the next flight out of kabul it wouldnt matter where just so long as it was as far away from here as possible if it came to it he would return all of the money and eat his expenses he needed the money but it wasnt worth it the odds for success with rapp involved decreased by at least half and there were other issues that complicated the matter it would take no longer than five minutes to pack his gear he picked up the htc one phone that his employer had left him with one simple text he would find the identity of the target the agreement had been such that once the identity was revealed the assassin could not back out he was tempted to run but he was more curious to find out the identity of the target the assassin tapped out his message the convoy has arrived i am in position he hit send and then sat back and watched rapp enter the embassy grounds through a gate so far the client had been good about getting back to him it had been a strange dance up to this point but one that had a certain logic to it the contract had rolled out in a graduated manner the basic terms were agreed on but the target was not to be revealed until he was in country and in a position to act five minutes passed and then ten and the assassin was growing uncharacteristically anxious he went to the bathroom and heard the phone beep as he was washing his hands when he came back into the bedroom he opened the text and stared at the icon for an encrypted file and then tapped it a split second later a photo of mitch rapp engulfed his screen the assassin dropped the phone on the bed and almost opened the shades before he caught himself how in the hell he blurted out as he began to sweat he told himself to calm down and think this through very carefully there had to be a way out of this million was not enough money to take on someone like rapp million wasnt enough and even if it was there were other factors to consider the assassin ran his fingers through his dark brown hair and walked into the bathroom he stared at himself in the mirror and asked himself how he had gotten into such a ludicrous situation it was the money of course and the thrill of the hunt domestic life had become extremely boring but it was better than being dead what are the odds he asked aloud the question steered his mind in a mystical direction and he now focused on a powerful word that was thousands of years old it was karma of course it was the only thing that could explain the odds what he had done years ago had almost certainly led him to this place he owed a debt and it was time to repay it in full with absolute conviction the assassin knew what he must do he went back into the bedroom and forwarded the encrypted file to his laptop where he began to review rapps dossier it was incredibly detailed so detailed it caused the assassin to worry about who had hired him there were very few organizations that could put something like this together he flipped back to the surveillance screen and found rapp talking to another man inside the embassy compound the odds were staggering but the payoff would be far better than jus the million a smile of anticipation spread across the assassins face this would be perhaps the most fulfilling contract of his career the trick of course would be to get close enough to rapp without alerting him first if rapp detected him he would be dead before he had a chance to collect on his debt chapter the conference room was located off one of the interior corridors on the sixth floor of the embassy it was state department turf which nash didnt like but kennedy wanted him to make this one effort to play nice and get these people to understand what was at stake if they didnt get in line after that he was supposed to turn rapp loose the idea that nash could control rapp in the first place was ludicrous he made that exact point to kennedy but she remained obstinate on the matter she wouldnt go into detail about why they had to go through this little dance but as director of the cia kennedy did not always feel that she had to explain every order she gave she operated on a level that was way beyond nashs understanding influenced by people and organizations that he fortunately didnt have to answer to add to that the fact that she was the smartest person hed ever worked for and he decided to simply carry out her orders that was all back in washington over here in afghanistan however he was once again questioning the wisdom of her strategy to say that rapp wasnt suited for this kind of thing wasnt entirely fair a more accurate description would be to say that these other people werent suited for the war on terror rapp was more driven than any person hed ever encountered and that took a lot of getting used to his lack of patience was a byproduct of that drive and his intimate knowledge of the enemy while others debated a problem from every conceivable angle often arguing over degrees rapp analyzed the same problem with a rapidity that was astounding and then chose a course of action or decided not to act his default setting more often than not however was to act rapp understood that kinetic energy was more apt to bring about a desired result than sitting around waiting for the enemy to move first if they got through this meeting without rapp punching sickles nash would consider it a major accomplishment darren sickles the station chief had assured nash that the room was secure nash received the information as if he was satisfied and then followed his own protocols and quietly had a member of his team sweep the room for devices sickles found out about it shortly before the meeting was to commence and told nash that he was offended with kennedys orders paramount he offered sickles a halfhearted apology and said something to the effect that you can never be too careful there was a very good chance nash would put sickless reaction in a report when this saga was over kennedy preached vigilance when it came to making sure lines of communication were secure no one in the community had a right to be offended by someone taking extra care to make sure a room was clean that sickles felt the need to let nash know he was offended was juvenile nash was growing used to it however when he was called on to run the cias counterterrorism center at the relatively young age of thirtynine it had pissed off a whole bevy of professionals who had more experience than he did nash gave it all as little thought as possible but there were certain individuals whom he had to act more guarded around and sickles had just added his name to that list nash stepped off the elevator and was surprised to see rapp standing in the hallway by himself i just lost a hundred dollars why i didnt think youd show rapp ignored his friends attempt at humor lets go the sooner we get this thing over the sooner i can get back to whats important rapp turned and started down the hall have you seen darren nash asked rapp shook his head you know hes upset right rapp stopped turned abruptly gave the appearance that he was going to blow his lid and then restrained himself i just wanted to make sure you knew the lie of the land nash said a bit defensively trust me i know the lie of the land and i dont give a shit about darren sickles and whether or not hes offended mitch this is coming from irene id prefer it if you skipped this meeting but she insisted that you be here why i have no idea so if you dont think you can keep your temper in check then i think you should take off enough anger flashed across rapps face that nash took a step back rapp said lets be clear about something i know you have a fancy new title and a nice office at langley but you are not in my chain of command youre irenes message boy and i personally couldnt give a fuck what you think if irene wants me here then ill act like a good soldier ill follow her orders but i dont need your personal input or darren sickles or anyone else for that matter nash was used to rapps rough edges but there was something more to this the two men had been in plenty of heated arguments over the years but there seemed to be some genuine animosity this time as if rapp now thought they were on opposite sides nash took a long breath and said youve never been one to follow orders and i sure as hell dont see why youd start now very funny big man im really not in the mood for your shit ill play your game but im warning you that idiot sickles better watch himself or im coming across the table dont let darren get to you hes freaking out because all of this went down on his watch hes probably scared to death that this will be a career ender yeah well im freaking out too joe rickman is missing and if we dont get him back the bodies are going to start piling up from here to islamabad and tehran and god only knows where else good people who have put their asses on the line for us are going to die and on top of that i just found out the man who trained me who ive spent the last twentyplus years working with has terminal cancer so excuse me if im not exactly in the mood to deal with these people and their petty turf wars thats fine im not looking forward to it either but we need to work with these people you said it yourself ricks files are gone these people are our only hope we need what they have we need to know who ricks been meeting with somebody got on the inside and helped pull this thing off rapp slowly nodded i know we need their shit but that doesnt mean we have to kiss their ass yes it does at least to start with rapp mumbled something to himself and then walked away nash followed a few steps behind wondering if perhaps hurleys diagnosis had affected rapp more harshly than he would have guessed true theyd worked closely together for a long time but both men had an emotional side that was about as soft as granite nash followed rapp into the conference room closing the door behind him standing to his left in the far corner were sickles arianna vinter and a man who he assumed was the dods military attache nash had skimmed his jacket on the flight over he couldnt remember his name offhand but recalled that he was a west pointer the room was standard government decorating the carpet was a dark mix of gray and black that would serve to hide any stains and a large brown table with a fake wood grain top dominated the room in the center of the table was a tray with a coffeepot cream sweetener sugar some straws a half dozen mugs and as many bottles of water there were ten black swivel chairs arranged four on each side and one on each end vinter held up her hand in a gesture to silence sickles then smiled at the two men who had just entered the room good morning i assume you are mr rapp and mr nash rapp didnt speak so nash answered for them thats right i assume you are arianna vinter yes please have a seat nash noted that she was much prettier than in the photograph on her governmentissue id nash looked at the man to vinters left and noted the eagle on the patch in the center of his chest and the name on the right side of his chest reaching across the table nash extended his hand and said mike nash colonel nice to meet you poole took his hand counterterrorism right thats correct poole looked at rapp and stuck out his hand colonel poole military attache mr rapp nodding rapp took the mans hand but didnt say anything after a firm handshake rapp sat down may i offer either of you anything to drink vinter asked rapp kept his mouth shut and offered only a slight shake of his head nash said coffee would be great vinter grabbed the carafe and poured a cup you strike me as the kind of man who takes it black thats right nash smiled thank you nash took the mug and set it in front of him vinter told poole and sickles to sit and then she grabbed a seat across from rapp and nash sickles was on her right and poole on her left she directed her gaze at rapp and in a sweet voice said mr rapp weve never met before what exactly is it that you do for the cia im in the clandestine service do you have a title rapp shook his head i report directly to dci kennedy i see vinter said placing her hands flat on the table she examined her fingers for a long moment and then in a casual voice asked do you think im stupid mr rapp rapp didnt take the bait he instead turned to nash and gave him a look that said this is your show feel free to jump in nash cleared his throat arianna im not sure we understand the question her expression flared briefly as she turned her attention to nash i wasnt addressing you i was speaking to your colleague mr rapp now mr rapp i asked you a straightforward question do you think im stupid i dont know you you dont know me thats all you have to say ive never met you before and i havent heard anything about you until this morning so im not really in a position to answer your question you could be a genius or an imbecile as of right now i cant answer that question but keep talking and i should be able to give you an answer in a few minutes vinter took in a long breath do you think the president is a smart man rapp thought about that for a moment the man had his strengths and weaknesses but all in all he was no dummy yes i think the president is a smart man well the president put me in charge of this little hellhole because he thought i was the best person for the job my team and i have worked extremely hard to implement the presidents plan and things were going very smoothly until you showed up this morning and shoved a gun in the face of one of our allies vinters agreeable facade was slowly melting away revealing her angry side i know you think youre some hotshot but you need to understand something im in charge around here and if i dont like you and what youre up to youre going to find your ass on the next flight out of here do you understand me instead of answering the question rapp again turned to nash and said i think youd better field this one arianna we are in a unique situation none of us are questioning what you have accomplished but you need to understand i dont need to understand a thing vinter said slicing her hand through the air like a karate chop i live here i know whats going on you two dont she wagged her finger at nash and then rapp im not going to have you come in here and screw up a years worth of work because youre upset that one of your blackbag guys got kidnapped no fucking way thats going to happen so lets be real clear about this i dont want you two going to the bathroom without asking me for permission first you dont talk to anyone whos involved in reintegration unless i clear it do you understand me rapp raised his hand as if he was waiting to be called on by his teacher what vinter asked i have the answer to your question i think youre an imbecile there could be some underlying psychological issues as well but id need to spend more time with you which isnt going to happen beyond that im pretty sure youre stupid vinters even complexion became blotchy with anger dont fuck with me im not going to warn you again you two are not in charge im in charge around here i make one phone call and your lame ass is on the next military transport out in fact ill make sure its one of those big ones with all the props that makes you feel like youve been in a blender a c rapp said the vibration helps me sleep i dont give a shit if the vibration gives you a hardon one wrong move and you two are gone listen nash said were all on the same team im not on your team vinter said with absolute conviction rapp turned his attention to the cia station chief the fact that he had decided to sit on the other side of the table spoke volumes about him did you bother to brief her on who we are sickles cleared his throat i gave her some basic background thats it more or less nash dropped his head into his hands and waited for what was about to happen there could be no blaming rapp this time this woman had clearly picked the fight rapp knew sickles was holding back theyd revisit all of this later when they could keep it within the family and rapp would remind sickles in a very persuasive way where his loyalties were supposed to lie but for now vinter was the problem he looked across the table with his near black eyes and said do you like your job let me guess this is the part where youre going to ask me a bunch of questions and then threaten me well ill save you the time you cant threaten me im untouchable im the presidents point person in afghanistan i run the show here theres a few generals and an ambassador who might disagree with you but i dont have the time to argue with you if youre in charge all the better we need you to hand over everything that you were working on with joe rickman thats not going to happen its highly classified information rapp shook his head in semidisbelief you do realize were the cia our job is classified information not my classified information after nodding a few times rapp stood so theres not going to be any cooperation i told you the deal you two dont move without talking to me first well see how you behave and then well revisit the cooperation looking at sickles rapp asked have you briefed her on how serious this is she understands the situation and she also knows about your reputation weve worked long and hard on reintegration and none of us are too happy to see you barge in here and begin destroying everything weve accomplished rapp stared at sickles for a long moment he could scarcely believe what he was hearing he pointed at the station chief snapped his fingers and then hooked his thumb toward the door youre done get out the hell out of here ill come find you in your office when im done you have no right to darren rapp yelled shut your mouth i have every right i have the dcis full backing on this and i swear to god if youre not out of this room in the next five seconds you can kiss your pension goodbye as it is your ass is in hot water joe fuckin rickman got snatched on your watch do you have any idea how bad this is i never mind just get the hell out of here well talk about this in your office go now move it sickles had tried to call kennedy three times this morning and kennedy had not taken any of his calls maybe rapp was telling the truth the station chief got up and left the room without saying another word when the door was closed again rapp looked at poole and said if youd prefer to leave as well you wont hear me complain ill stay fine turning his attention back to vinter rapp said you might think youre connected you might even think youre important and in certain circles you might be but not this time around oh really yeah let me explain how this works were the guys they call in when the shit hits the fan go ahead and call your boss when were done shell tell you the same thing in fact im pretty sure shell tell you to do what we ask and then get the hell out of our way vinter shook her head the secretary of state has complete confidence in me after i tell her what you did to commander zahir this morning youre the one whos going to be praying they let you keep your pension you go ahead and make that call but just remember i warned you this reintegration crap is a circle jerk and everyone whos anyone in dc knows it its a gimmick so we can declare victory and get the hell out of here joe rickman getting snatched is serious shit and they all know it you see his head is full of a lot of nasty secrets that will embarrass your boss and a lot of other heavy hitters back in dc they dont like being embarrassed so your little circle jerk is going to take a backseat to my problem for a while i dont really care if the papers print nasty stuff about your boss or anyone else but i do care about all the agents that work for us who will more than likely end up dead if we dont find rick and find him quick you have no idea who youre screwing with mr rapp actually i have a really good idea youre some spoiled brat whos gotten her way her entire life he pointed at her wedding ring and added your husband is miserable some poor browbeaten son of a bitch you probably keep his balls in a little box on your desk and based on your selfish attitude this morning id say theres a pretty good chance youve been having an affair with the colonel here the point is i dont give a shit who you are but youd better care who i am and understand that im the meanest son of a bitch you will ever meet thats why the president sent me over here because he wants results and he knows i wont put up with people like you so you go ahead and call your boss and anyone else you need to and after theyve all told you what ive just told you you will hand over every shred of information you have regarding joe rickman and the scumbags you had him making deals with and if you dont i can guarantee you will be the one on the next flight out of here chapter jalalabad afghanistan he lay on the floor wearing only a pair of us armyissue boxer shorts curled up in the fetal position his face and body battered to a pulp joe rickman tried to open his eyes but they were either too swollen or too caked with dry blood to yield he had never felt such pain never even imagined that it could be so bad his trainers back at the farm had warned him and he had nodded as if he understood everything they were saying at the time but they said he didnt anyone who hadnt been through it could never really understand just how bad it was now rickman understood hed kept it together so far but just barely there had been a few moments when he was on the verge of calling it quits he told himself that they would know when to stop after all rickman had always known when to call his people off he had sat through countless interrogations and had never lost a single subject rickmans methods and those of his colleagues were a bit more clinical though before an interrogation started they met and put a script in place what questions were to be asked and what methods they would use to inflict pain rickman was never one to get his hands dirty of course he didnt even like his people getting their hands dirty that was why he was such a big fan of electricity it was nice and clean no blood to mop up when everything was done his team appreciated it as well as they were the ones who had to clean up the room it wasnt as if you could grab a janitor and bring him to the secure detention facility to clean up the blood from a rough session that in the eyes of some of his fellow countrymen was blatantly illegal rickmans captors were obviously less concerned about the mess the people in this part of the world were far more accepting of torture in a sense these animals had followed their version of a script they had spared his feet and genitals and for the most part had slapped rather than punched him in the head most of the beating had been inflicted with a rubber hose and open palms methods that were designed to elicit pain without causing lifethreatening injury at least thats what he kept telling himself as each blow landed even during the height of the beating rickman had kept a careful inventory of where and how they were hitting him fortunately they had restrained themselves from striking him in the head too many times other than a heart attack the easiest way to lose a subject during interrogation was to create hemorrhaging in the brain rickman tried his eyes again and got one of them partially open the eyelid fluttered to life to reveal his dank surroundings he was in a cellar of some sort with a dirt floor white sheets were draped along the walls his hosts had spraypainted the word infidel in black across one of the sheets they had made sure to follow their script while filming his beating and kept the word infidel in the frame just behind him the place reeked of urine that was the first thing rickman thought of when theyd brought him here and he was repulsed by it he was a neat freak and the idea of being held captive in such a foul place gave him almost as much anxiety as the impending session after the beating started however the smell quickly became the least of his problems and now he cared even less since he was pretty sure hed added to the potpourri during his beating rickman tried to lift his head but it hurt too much so he lay there the last man and tried to take an inventory of his pain nearly every inch of his body was aching but there were a few areas that stood out chief among them were his ribs he was pretty sure a few of them were broken or at a bare minimum bruised the majority of the session had been conducted with rickmans arms strung above his head to some contraption on the ceilinghis flanks exposed to the brutal blows even when they werent beating him his shoulders screamed with pain as if they were going to be ripped from their sockets rickman gathered the strength to roll from his side onto his back he winced as shards of pain shot through his rib cage slowly he turned his head toward the door the video camera was mounted on a tripod the red light under the lens told him it was still recording that was good record all of it for all he cared he heard movement and voices outside the door rickman tensed with the anticipation that the beating would begin again the door opened throwing more light into the room the man turned off the camera and stood over rickman he was wearing a gray kneelength shirt with gray baggy trousers that the locals called perahan tunban he squatted and held a bottle of water to rickmans swollen lips it will go much easier if you tell them what they want to know it doesnt have to be like this i guess im into pain what can i tell you the man frowned and shook his head in a sad manner after a long moment he fished a bottle of pills from his pocket and took off the cap he tapped out two pills into the palm of his hand and then shoved them one by one into rickmans mouth these will help rickman tried to spit them out but the man covered his mouth with his hand and said dont be a fool a little bit of water and the pills slid right down the man stood and walked back to the door he opened it and waved another man in the new man was carrying a small black bag it occurred to rickman that he was a doctor that was a good sign his captors were taking this seriously the man dropped to one knee next to rickman and placed a stethoscope against his chest after that he slapped on a blood pressure cuff and then dilated both eyes with a penlight after no more than two minutes the doctor announced that he was strong enough to resume the interrogation the doctor left two new men entered the room masks pulled on to conceal their faces the camera was turned back on and the man in the baggy gray pants nodded for the two men to continue a rope ran through a pulley on the ceiling and was tied to rickmans wrists the two men yanked on the rope and pulled rickman into a standing position this time you will answer my questions yes rickman looked at the man through his one good eye and spat a glob of blood into his face the beating commenced immediately strangely the blows didnt hurt as much this time he told himself to stay strong it wouldnt be much longer it couldnt be or he might die and he doubted these men would want that discipline was paramount chapter kabul afghanistan everyone made mistakes it was how you handled them that counted own up to them make a few adjustments and move on at least that was the way rapp had been taught anything short of that was counterproductive selfserving and typically dishonest rapp didnt like having his time wasted under normal circumstances but in a crisis like this it unnerved him when people couldnt at least set aside their issues grab a bucket of water and help put the damn fire out act like sickles and deny that a mistake had been made and that little pressure cooker inside rapps head got so hot he became explosive there was a distinct possibility that rapp might break the station chiefs jaw and nash knew it he also couldnt blame him but at this point it might or might not solve their problems there were certain guys at langley who were oldschool and would be more than willing to take a beating if it saved them from being dragged back to langley but sickles wasnt one of them he would love nothing more at this point than to claim victimhood and nash couldnt allow that to happen rapp stopped outside the secure door that led to the cias suite of embassy offices he looked at nash and said tell me again why you think we need him he knows these people hes worked with rick for the last two years he has to have some info we could use we ship him back to langley and hes going to become significantly less cooperative i dont give a shit we ship him back to langley and hell realize real quick im not the only whos pissed at him his career is over unless he gets some religion real quick and even then id stuff him in some cubicle before nash could respond coleman approached and said hubbard called he talked to that veterinarian in j bad and the vet says he never put the dog down told hub he couldnt figure out what was wrong with it so he referred rick to another vet here in kabul better animal hospital so was hub wrong or misinformed im not sure i understand he told us the dog was put down by a vet in jalalabad did rick tell him that or did he just assume i dont know get him on the phone i want to talk to him rapp pivoted and faced nash youve got about a minute to convince me we need to be out there not in here we need to be kicking down the door of every scumbag we can find and maybe if we get a whiff that iran is behind this we need to return the favor im as pissed at him as you are he broke our first rule he forgot who he works for its not state its us but you said it yourself the clock is ticking this trail is going colder by the second and lets face it ricks got the brains not the brawn if he hasnt already broken it wont take much longer we need darren to give us everything now not two or three days from now when hes back at langley and irene finally makes him see what a jackass hes been the last man rapp didnt like it but nash was right then put all the cards on the table and give him two clear choices he either gets his shit together and remembers which team he plays for or hes done this is his last chance nash nodded and said i think you should be the one to deliver that message before rapp could reply coleman handed him the phone hub did rick tell you that he had ajax put down by the vet down there in jalalabad or did you just assume he did rapp listened as hubbard relayed his answer and then said text me the info on the vet here in kabul im going to have a talk with him rapp handed the phone back to coleman and before he could return the problem of darren sickles nash asked a question of his own what was that all about rapp wasnt about to go into his suspicions not until he had more information im just trying to run down a few leads darren is all yours i need to get out of this building or im going to commit some serious violence give me five minutes nash begged holding up the fingers on his right hand no im sick of talking i need to get back out there a vet what in the hell is he going to tell you dont worry about me focus on darren and those other idiots weve got more people coming in rapp checked his watch about three hours from now they need to hit the ground running and that means you have to put a game plan together for them nashs face soured who said i was the office manager it goes along with your fancy new title youre the senior man on the ground so you get to stay here and babysit everyone while we go kick down some doors and knock a few heads this is bullshit rapp smiled youre a national hero we cant afford to lose you more bullshit nash barked you were there too in fact you were the crazy son of a bitch who rushed those guys with nothing more than a pistol shhhhh rapp said with a finger over his mouth that is classified information he laughed and then said to coleman get the boys saddled up you want to travel light or in force light just you me joe and reavers and none of that mrap shit rapp started to walk with coleman at his side find us an old beatup sedan nash was genuinely conflicted as he watched rapp and coleman walk down the long hallway it pained him to not be included in stuff like this he had officially become a paper pusher and it killed him it made his wife a great deal happier and in light of the fact that he had four kids one of whom was still in diapers it was probably a good idea to hang up his spurs but god he missed it chapter the assassin had killed eightyseven of his fellow human beings at least that was how many he had specifically tallied there were likely a few more bodyguards and such who died later from injuries suffered at his hands so he reasoned the number could be as high as one hundred but the official tally stood at eightyseven many of those kills he was proud of nasty people who were creating pain and destruction in their lust for power or profit there were also more than a few that he knew hed answer to his maker for most of those came early in his career before hed honed his skills and become more selective some were mistakes and some were a simple lack of experience hed used his hands wires knives and poison but most often he used a gun or a rifle there were a few regrettable times when hed employed explosives which were extremely effective but unruly in the sense that the odds for collateral damage increased dramatically he was good at killing too good really and that was what brought about his near downfall you didnt get good in this line of work from a lack of confidence but you could definitely end up dead from an overabundance of belief in your abilities after thirteen years in the business he learned that there were certain times when you needed to say nosometimes for no reason other than the fact that youd said yes too many times the challenge to test your abilities and the money were incredible motivators and hed found himself competing to be the best increasingly he needed to take the most difficult jobs so he could prove to himself that he had no peer it was stupid really as if there would one day be an awards ceremony for the greatest assassin of the last decade eventually his ego and an extremely big payday put him on a collision course with mortality that one job had changed everything it had made him wiser he was still confident but he was also keenly aware of his weaknesses and the fact there were others out there who were every bit as talented as he was and even a few who were better the last and final piece was perhaps the most difficult to judge by necessity he never met his employers he didnt want them to know what he looked like and if they had any brains they knew it was best not to reveal themselves to a worldclass killer this type of arrangement necessitated a middleman who was able to negotiate contracts and make sure that payments were made on time he had used three such individuals over the years the first two were deadone of natural causes the other from a bullet to the back of the head while he was taking a leisurely stroll through del retiro park in madrid the spaniard it turned out didnt fully embrace the confidential aspect of their work and it didnt help that he was stealing money from him his agent for the last twoplus years had been a russian and up until this point things had gone smoothly this current contract was beginning to take on the stench of a job that he should have declined separate the most obvious problem which was the target and he was left with a bevy of red flags chief among them his employer was showing himself to be a control freak just in the last few hours the anonymous employer had provided information that left him to wonder who he might be it was natural to wonder such things in this line of work but more often than not there was a simple motivation this one was beginning to feel different the mystery man was feeding him with information that could be provided only by someone on the inside in the assassins mind that distinctly raised the possibility that he was being watched the anonymous employer was now calling the shots at a level the assassin did not like this employer was a puppet master who thought he needed to pull the assassins strings as if the assassin was an amateur after revealing that the target was none other than mitch rapp a bellman delivered a large manila envelope with which contained an address a map a key and specific instructions on when and how he was to take the shot the assassin was at first offended he was the professional after all if this employer was so good at this he should come and take the shot himself the assassin checked his ego however and for the moment was willing to explore what was increasingly feeling like a contract that fell outside his normal risk parameters one voice inside his head the one that was ruled by common sense was telling him to go to the airport and leave the country immediately if he was being watched though this could cause a problem the other voice inside his head the one that could sometimes get him to overextend himself was telling him this was far too exciting to walk away from for the moment curiosity and the large payday got the best of him he retrieved his alias passport from the hotel safe with a matching credit card and cash as well as other worn forms of id that any seasoned customs agent would expect to find in a fortyish old mans wallet he donned a pair of cargo pants hiking boots field shirt and light gray north face vest into the left cargo pocket of his pants he slid a kershaw black blur folding knife in the event that he needed to discreetly kill someone next came what he considered his lifeline should things go drastically bad he laid his specially designed backpack down on the bed and went over his gear inside was an fnh singleaction autoloading pistol hed fired virtually every handgun known to man and in the hands of a trained marksman there was no better pistol to carry into a gunfight for three reasons the first was the low recoil of the weapon the second was the twentyround magazine capacity and the third was its unique xmm round which was capable of defeating all but the best body armor the pistol had a short suppressor attached to the end and three extra magazines the pack also contained two m stun grenades with timers which hed learned could come in very handy should he need a distraction to complete his job the backpack itself was the most impressive piece of equipment it was made out of ballistic fabric and with the quick pull of a zipper and the yank of a handle he could pull half of the backpack over his head where it would rest on his chest with a few swift moves that took no longer than two seconds the backpack became a bulletproof tactical vest with his pistol and his other muchneeded tools readily available on his chest he hooked a fanny pack around his waist inside was a second lens for his digital camera and a subcompact mm beretta with a twoinch suppressor on the end the rest of his gear was thrown into a generic black carryon bag he was always careful about what he touched so it didnt take more than five minutes to wipe down the room the hotel was filled with security cameras and he wouldnt be surprised if the embassy had realtime access to those cameras there was absolutely no doubt that his image would be captured and as much as he didnt like it there wasnt a thing he could do to prevent it from happening so he slung his canon eos d mark ii camera around his neck to complete his cover as a freelance photographer and headed for the lobby he kept the two key cards one in his backpack and the other in his wallet in case he needed to return to the hotel but past experience told him he would not be coming back in fact it was extremely likely he would be making a hasty exit from the country he smiled for all of the digital cameras in the lobby and then asked the doorman for a taxi the man asked him if he was checking out and he told him no even though it was likely he was doing just that the assassin had been to virtually every major city on every continent with the exception of antarctica he had a very good grasp of how standards of living fluctuated from one country to another even with all of the money that the americans and their coalition partners had used to build up the citys infrastructure kabul was still basically a hellhole garbage was plastered against the curbs of virtually every potholestrewn street and if the city owned a street sweeper there was no evidence of it the relative high altitude and lack of rain helped cover everything with a film of dirt beyond that the citys inhabitants seemed to embrace throwing their garbage wherever they liked almost as if it were a national pastime the driver was a talkative fellow which the assassin didnt like but things were coming to a head so quickly that there was no time to be picky normally he would have changed cabs at least three times but he was more interested in checking out the location where he had been told to kill rapp that was the part that was grating on his nerves more than anything else he was a professional and was used to picking a time and place of his own choosing this entire thing was becoming a little too orchestrated the office building was a half block off the kabul river a muddy morass of refuse that in the late spring and early summer was bursting at the banks from all the snowmelt from the mountains but in the fall it slowed to a trickle and again revealed that the inhabitants of kabul thought of the river as a garbage dump even though the office was only a few miles from the hotel the drive took nearly fifteen minutes the lack of traffic lights and the heavy noontime traffic made the going slow his arabic was basic enough to find out that the driver vince fly nn spoke english which made things much easier after some haggling they agreed on what it would cost to hire him for the next few hours the assassin directed him to the location where he wanted him to wait and then tore a hundreddollar bill in half the driver didnt like that one bit after some cursing the assassin explained to him that hed get the other half when he came back and a fresh hundreddollar bill as well this seemed to calm the man a bit the two exchanged mobile numbers and then the assassin left the taxi along with the roller bag in the trunk he circled the block snapping photos as he went but in reality he was taking a digital recording of everything it was a mixed businessresidential district with a good number of two and threestory buildings by european standards the place was a dump but here in kabul it was considered upper class vendors lined both sides of the streets selling everything from the popular vests that most men wore to brightly colored plastic chairs and tables to tea with a surprisingly varied selection there were fruit and produce vendors of almost all imaginable kinds these merchants the assassin knew would have their finger on the pulse of this street where they lived six days a week from sunrise to sundown anything out of the ordinary and they would seem a bit agitated he was careful to not appear to be taking any direct shots of any particular people as it could make them jumpy rather he made it look as if he was taking longdistance shots of faraway objects the veterinary hospital was near the end of the block with a park next door that was adjacent to side door of the hospital the office building he was as supposed to take his shot from was across the street and about meters down the block at first glance the location was perfect the assassin took a final casual look around and then entered the building there really wasnt a lobby just a small landing for the stairs that led to the second floor he did a quick walkthrough of the first floor and was alarmed to see that there was no secondary exit that was reason enough to pull the plug on the assignment but he had some time to spare and curiosity drove him to take the steps to the second floor it took his eyes a moment to adjust to the poor lighting he walked past the office that was in his instructions and went to the end of the hall where he was relieved to find a ladder that led to the roof going back to the office he unzipped the fanny pack and slid his right hand around the grip of the beretta should he need it the key slid into the lock easily enough the assassin stayed behind the doorframe and pushed the door open the office was a simple fifteenbyfifteenfoot space with dirty cracked walls and carpeting that was worn in the places where the previous tenants desk had sat underneath the window someone had set up a folding table and chair on top of the table sat a rectangular tan nylon bag that he had seen many times he closed and locked the door and approached the bag as if it might bite him after hesitating for a moment he retrieved a pair of latex gloves from his fanny pack and snapped them on each hand he ran the zipper all the way along the perimeter and carefully folded the top over to reveal a shiny new heckler amp koch hk a soft whistle of admiration rolled past the assassins lips the h ampk was the most advanced m carbine available the weapon was outfitted with the topoftheline optics that in the hands of the assassin would make it lethal out to six hundred meters at eighty meters a headshot would be a snap the shortstroke gaspiston operating system delivered the round with incredible accuracy and more important the weapon rarely jammed he lifted the weapon from its case and turned it over in his hands the suppressor was tucked in a separate compartment the carbine was a fine piece of craftsmanship his thumb pressed the magazine release and he inspected the rounds as per his request the magazine was loaded with remingtons revolutionary blk subsonic round which had significantly more punch than the standard he seated the magazine back into the weapon turned on the eotech sight and brought the weapon up to his right shoulder standing five feet back vince fly nn from the window he sighted in the front door of the clinic with both eyes open the red dot balanced perfectly on the door handle at this short distance there would be no need for tripod or shooting stick at this distance he wouldnt need the x magnifier but he flipped it into place nonetheless he wanted to see if there was anyone out there watching him he started to his left and searched for a likely sniper position after five minutes of carefully probing he was left with no evidence that he was being watched but he knew the absence of such evidence meant nothing if the person was good it was a simple thing to conceal a position that was one thousand meters away after placing the h ampk back in the case he picked up a manila envelope and dumped the contents on the table there was a handmade map that showed the location of the rooftop access and a line of exfiltration across several rooftops to a ladder that would lead to the street he set it off to the side and picked up a photo of rapp this caused him to frown his employer had already provided the same photo via text he grabbed his lighter and burned both map and photo dropping them to the floor and stamping them into the carpet when they were nothing more than a few fragments he grabbed his digital camera and began going through the footage hed taken he was roughly three minutes in and had picked out two interesting individuals who seemed to pay him a little too much attention they were also conveniently located at each end of the block the assassin was about to explore this further when a text arrived informing him that mr rapp was on the way estimated time of arrival was six minutes he felt his heart begin to quickensomething that hadnt happened in a long time the assassin took in several deep breaths and then shook his arms loose to try to let out some of the tension why put two watchers on the street if they already had eyes on the target the answer was unfortunately obvious they were not here to keep an eye on rapp they were standing at their posts doing one of two things the first was simple enough his success or failure would be reported in near real time to his employer no real harm but another sign that his employer had some serious assets at his disposal the second possibility was more ominoushis employer planned on killing him as soon as rapp had been taken care of chapter the silver toyota runner hadnt been washed in over a month the windshield had a divot from a rock and a crack that crawled its way along the bottom dying the right corner the front bumper had seen some use but not as much as the rear both sides had enough scrapes and dents so that the vehicle fit right in on the wild streets of kabul this all made rapp happy as he greatly preferred anonymity to large steelplated vehicles that screamed usa rapp was in back looking out the dirty rearpassenger window at nothing in particular his mind was revisiting what hed seen at the safe house that morning sydney hayek didnt think shed get the preliminary ballistics back for another twentyfour hours and rapp was already starting to think he didnt need them the way the bodies were strewn about the house the big caliber hole in the back of the one guys head and the security system being defeated without the slightest warning it all looked bad throw the dog on top of that and he cringed at the possible outcomes the real question was why rickman was a strange bird there was no doubt about that but it was a big jump from being a little different to being a traitor rapp knew he was getting a bit ahead of himself though the dog could have been an honest mistake hubbard could have easily misheard rickman or just assumed that hed put the dog down at the local clinic but when rapp got these kinds of feelings more often than not they turned out to be right the difference this time around was that he was hoping he was wrong maslick was driving and big reavers riding shotgun with his bushy dark beard a pair of wraparound oakleys and his standard fuckoff expression on his face like a pit bull he was not the friendliest creature when it came to new faces but immensely loyal to those whom he knew coleman had been his co when the two men were seals and then after they had continued to work together as private contractors for the cia maslick was former delta force and had been attached to rapps team on and off for three years both men had a cool detachment that had been honed by killing enemies who had desperately tried to kill them first they never looked nervous but they never stopped surveying the landscape for threats rapp pulled out his phone and checked to see if there were any new emails from langley that might shed some light on rickmans location kennedy had told him that rickman was the top priority for the national security agency until the president said otherwise every conversation email tweet and text within a thousand miles was being translated and crunched by the nsas cray supercomputers they were bound to pick up something rapp just hoped it was enough for him to get a solid lead so are you going to tell me why youve got a hardon for some vet rapp looked up from his phone and wondered how much he should share with coleman it wasnt that he didnt trust him next to kennedy and maybe hurley there was no one he trusted more it was just that a gut feeling like this could poison what they were trying to do coleman waited a few seconds for rapp to answer and then said youre not the only one who thinks this thing doesnt smell right rapp made no attempt to hide his surprise what are you talking about please ive been in enough shootouts to know how things go down youre hung up on the bodyguard the one missing half his face rapp confirmed his suspicions with a simple nod it jumped out at me too the rest were all shot with nine millimeters and then theres this guy who was obviously tapped by a and we both know rick loves his big kimber and the guy was shot in the back of the head while he was moving down the hall away from ricks office and bedroom rapp added i noticed the same thing but then i started thinking what if rick found out this bodyguard had set him up maybe he had some suspicions and then the guy went and took the security system offline hell rick could have been sleeping he hears the commotion downstairs and as a last act of desperation he shoots this guy in the back of the head rapp turned colemans scenario over in his mind hoping that it would explain away his fears i hadnt thought of that rapp tried to imagine rickman being roused from his bed and springing into action joe rickman was anything but a foot soldier officially he was a midlevel case officer in the cias clandestine service unofficially hed spent the last eight years running the clandestine services black ops in the islamic republic he didnt show up on the flow charts that were given to congress there was no important title before his name he wasnt a station chief or a deputy director he was a black hole that happened to be a repository of a mountain of dirty nasty secrets so far no one knew the exact number but the best guess what that more than a quarter of a billion dollars in cash had passed through rickmans hands while hed played this dangerous game there was no oversight no accounting no one back in washington asking for receipts and riding his ass to fill out expense forms the suits didnt want to know the details of what rickman was up to and because of his big brain he was able to keep it all straight without writing anything down he continued to pass his twiceayear lie detector test and that was good enough for the people in charge rapp had worried for some time that it was a recipe for disaster yes rick loved his kimber but there could be an absolute chasm between spending time on the range in a controlled environment and getting yanked from a deep sleep and not shooting yourself in the foot the more rapp contemplated the mess the more he thought the biggest red flag was the security system if coleman was right and the one bodyguard had been the inside man he would need to see proof that this guy had the ability to defeat an extremely complicated security system rapp was no dummy and hed been stymied plenty of times by the technological aspect of his job that was why he normally traveled with experts like marcus dumond who was a hacker extraordinaire rick was no shooter rapp said im not saying its not possible but i have a hard time seeing rick plugging a guy in the back of the head in the middle of the night especially one of these hardened guards we chose for him well find out if the bodyguard was bad therell be something now what about this vet rapp sighed rick had a dog i remember rottweiler slobbered all over the place thing never left his side he treated it like it was his kid coleman shook his head with disapproval no way to train a dog like that i asked hub about the dog he said itd been sick only six years old or something like that rick brought it to the vet down in jbad and had it put down i told hub to talk to the vet and make sure the dog was put down the vet didnt put it down nope in fact he couldnt figure out what was wrong with it so he told rick to bring it to the bigcity vet up here in kabul coleman looked skeptical sounds like a bit of a reach maslick announced that they were two blocks away from the clinic rapp looked out a window as they passed a green ford ranger pickup that was the local police departments main form of transportation four men were sitting in back decked out in full combat gear more to himself than coleman he said yeah well were about to find out chapter the office window consisted of two laterally sliding pieces of glass with an aluminum frame there was no screen and the channel was filled with so much debris that it was difficult to open the window it was neither a warm nor a cold october day and the way people smoked in this city a cracked window would not stand out as a possible threat even to someone as aware as rapp the assassin decided four inches would give him enough range to cover the twenty or so feet in front of the clinics main door he checked his sight line once again and then returned to the question that was chewing on his nerves it was possible that his employer was cheap and simply wanted to save himself million but considering the lengths that hed gone to that was unlikely the more plausible explanation was that this control freak on the other end of the text messages and envelopes didnt like loose ends and the assassin was about to become a loose end he prided himself on his instincts and when a hunter realizes he might soon become the hunted it is a feeling that is impossible to ignore his mind was speeding to calculate his avenues of escape when a truly frightening thought hit him square in the cerebral cortex what if his employer had somehow discovered his past with rapp surely there were a handful of people in the us government who knew the details of that catastrophe the scales in his mind that were trying to weigh his employers honesty against the possibility that he was being set up suddenly jerked in favor of the latter as if an anvil had been dropped on that side there was no longer any doubt in the assassins mind he was being set up the front door did not seem like a great option as both ends of the street were being watched but the roof gave him even greater concern it was obviously the avenue of escape that the employer preferred him to take which likely meant there was a trap waiting for him he looked down at the phone that had been his link to the employer and had the ominous feeling that it was being used to track his every move even worse the thing could have a small bomb in it not enough to kill him unless it was placed next to his ear intelligence agencies had used cell phones to assassinate enemies for more than a decade he decided he wouldnt be answering any calls as if on cue the phone bleeped and the screen lit up the assassin flinched slightly and was embarrassed control of his nerves would be the difference between life and death the screen told him his target was less than a minute away it also gave him the make and model of the vehicle as if by reflex he picked up the m and snapped the suppressor onto the end of the barrel his eyes looked over the case taking a quick inventory the magazine in the rifle was the only one provided no spares in the event of a shootout he let out a deep sigh and the thought occurred to him that the room itself could be wired for sound and image or worse yet boobytrapped to explode after hed completed his mission that idea more than anything caused him to go through the motions he placed the tactical sling over his head and stepped a few feet back so that no one on the street could see him he brought the rifle up and tested the sling as if he were trying to find the right amount of tension he eased his eye in behind the viewfinder and placed the red dot on the front door of the clinic his mind was already counting down the seconds to rapps arrival everything at this point was natural pounded into his brain through repetition physically he was doing everything that he would normally do and if he were being watched there would be no reason for his employer to think he was on to him he lowered the rifle and kept his breathing easy the shot would happen during a brief windowmaybe five seconds as rapp left the vehicle and made his way to the door while all looked normal physically his mind was behaving quite differently it was churning through every available option over and over trying to calculate which avenue would lead to his best chance for survival suddenly the money didnt mean very much oh hed keep the million and if he made it out of this hellhole alive hed do his best to track down this asshole who was setting him up he wondered if yuri was in on it his agent a former russian svr intelligence officer was more than capable of doing what was best for himself that was why the assassin had never met him facetoface and communicated with him almost entirely through email all of this would have to be dealt with later for now he needed to stay focused on saving his own hide the toyota suv rolled into sight beneath him and stopped at the curb directly in front of the clinic the assassin brought the rifle up and thanks to the modern technology of his eotech sight was able to keep both eyes open he timed his next move perfectly all four doors of the suv opened and men piled out all of them wearing baseball hats even though he couldnt see rapps face he knew which one he was within a split second he slid the red dot in the center of the viewfinder onto the middle of rapps back and moved his finger from the trigger guard to the trigger he watched rapp cover the ground between the car and the front door smoothly following him with the weapon suddenly the assassins head jerked toward the door as if hed heard a noise in the hallway his finger slid off the trigger and straightened he moved quickly to the door and listened for any other sound after a few seconds he returned to the window only to see that rapp was already in the building two of his men were standing on the sidewalk keeping an eye on the car he did his best to look disappointed the assassin picked up the camera popped out the memory card and slid it in his pocket he didnt want to lug the camera around not knowing what he would find in the hallway he unslung the m and then pulled the cord on the backpack that converted it into a tactical vest he wanted quick access to one of his stun grenades if anyone was waiting for him in the hall after grabbing the m he moved to the door and did not hesitate he yanked it open and took a quick look the hallway was empty so he moved with speed to the stairs and down one flight as he pushed through the main door onto the sidewalk he was fully committed the m was slung with the butt just under his right armpit and the suppressor down by his left thigh his right hand gripped the handle but his finger was clearly visible and off the trigger as he moved onto the street he looked to his left and then his right and all his fears were validated parked at the end of each block were police trucks filled with officers in full combat gear when he looked across the street at rapps men he saw that they had also noticed the men the one with the beard noticed him first he casually changed his stance and brought his rifle into a position where he could quickly dispatch this potential threat the assassin let his weapon hang from his neck raising both hands to shoulder height his palms out when he was twenty feet away he kept moving and said i need to speak to mitch the familiarity in his voice seemed to relax the two watchdogs a bit the assassin closed the distance to within six feet and then stopped he looked to his right and then to his left one of the men whom he had seen earlier was talking on a cell phone and began yelling and motioning at the police officers to get out of the truck a second truck with six more men raced to a stop behind the first the assassin resisted the urge to raise his rifle and shoot the spotter with the cell phone instead he turned to the two big americans and in near flawless english said i think you guys better call for some backup chapter the sparse waiting area held four people a dog three cats and a bird the bird was in a cage behind the receptionists counter as well as the two cats that were sleeping in wicker baskets a little boy not more than eight held the leash of a small pooch while his mother sat protectively next to him an elderly man with a cigarette dangling from his mouth cradled a sicklylooking black cat that was missing large clumps of hair the old man looked depressed neither adult made eye contact but the little boy gave rapp a friendly smile rapp returned the gesture with a nod of thanks most of the people in kabul tried to ignore foreigners and rapp didnt blame them one bit their country had been at near constant war for thirty years there were others who stared you down as if they wanted to kill you and a small minority who would smile and maybe even say hello rapp approached the blue formica reception desk a nice young woman in a black hijab looked up at him and asked in english how may i help you do i look that american rapp asked trying to seem offended no but he does she pointed over rapps shoulder at coleman vince fly nn rapp turned around and looked at his friends blond hair and blue eyes colemans northern european ethnicity made it nearly impossible for him to blend in on ops like this yeah rapp said he works for the united nations i think hes swedish or something like that i cant understand a thing he says at any rate we were hoping to speak with dr amin im sorry but hes at the university right now do you expect him back this afternoon normally not but if were busy he stops by on his way home may ask what you need to discuss with him rapp hesitated he was not used to sharing information but this woman seemed nice enough and she might be able to save him a step its a rather important matter rapp retrieved his joe cox credentials emblazoned in gold with the seal of the united states and the allimportant somewhat vague words federal officer raised and embossed were trying to track down a missing person we were told that he brought his dog to your clinic about a month ago he was an american and his dog was a rottweiler do you remember anyone like that she shook her head no but im only here parttime do you have a name rickman had more than a few aliases as well rapp had no idea if he had used one so he started with rickmans real name the receptionist spun her chair around and crabwalked the chair over to a row of file cabinets rapp looked over his shoulder to find coleman with his arms folded across his chest and shaking his head swedish what in the hell is wrong with you rapp started to laugh and then his eyes caught something beyond the glass doors his left hand slid between the folds of his jacket and around the grip of his mm glock the change in rapps demeanor didnt go unnoticed by coleman who did a casual degree turn to see what was going on rapp could scarcely believe his eyes it was as if a ghost had walked out of his notsodistant past nearly four years ago to be exact he watched the man walk past reavers and maslick stopping briefly to point at something down the street in rapps mind it was a move to distract them but rapp could not be distracted not by this man he drew his gun and lined the sights up on the head of the man who had killed his wife the receptionist said something but rapp didnt hear her he was too intent on the man coming through the door the only thing that prevented rapp from shooting him on the spot was that he had his hands in the air in what seemed to be a genuine posture of surrender coleman said is that who i think it is yes one of the glass doors opened and the assassin stepped slowly into the lobby he glanced at coleman and then focused on rapp we need to talk and we must do it quickly give me one good reason why i shouldnt shoot you louie gould kept his hands in the air and gave a slight shrug i can give you several but since time is of the essence lets start with the fact that i didnt shoot you in the head when you got out of your truck a minute ago even more important i think youre going to need my help in the very near future possibly the next thirty seconds despite the anger that was coursing through his veins rapps pistol was extremely steady what in the hell are you talking about gould took a quick look around the waiting room he would have preferred to have this discussion in a more intimate setting but there was no time for that so before he got into the details he looked at rapps blondhaired friend and said i told your guys outside that they should call for backup but i dont think they took my advice trust me you are going to want to make that call and do it quickly the assassin then said to rapp i still take the occasional contract rapp shook his head that wasnt part of the deal i know he said sheepishly but we needed money and i have been very selective he shook his head showing the first sign of frus vince fly nn tration we can discuss this all later the important thing is that i took a contract from an anonymous employer my instructions were to fly into kabul yesterday about ninety minutes ago i received instructions to come to an office building on this street when i arrived this rifle was waiting for me along with a photograph of my target gould pointed at rapp you youre full of shit i wish i was but thats not the real problem gould kept his hands up while he took a step back to see if he could see what was going on at the one end of the block as he did so one of rapps men came through the door it was maslick theres something going on out here both ends of the street are blocked by the police and theyve got about ten guys at each end that look like theyre planning some kind of an assault gould confirmed with his own eyes what the man had said theyre here to kill you and me too i suppose a single rifle shot cracked the relative calm of the afternoon the four men in the lobby were all combat veterans and none of them flinched they all looked at reavers who was standing on the sidewalk before any of them could react a fusillade of bullets rang out the glass doors shattered and when they looked up reavers was falling to the ground coleman shouted above the roar of the rifle shots suppressive fire ill grab him rapp moved to his left and pushed his back against the wall while maslick moved to his right and did the same both men began squeezing off wellaimed shots at the officers at the opposite end of the street coleman holstered his gun yanked open the door and grabbed reavers by the tactical vest the big man didnt budge on the first try so coleman put all of his muscle into it bullets were zipping past his head in both directions he backpedaled into the reception area and immediately noticed the streak of red blood on the white tile floor out of the line of direct fire he knelt and tried to find where hed been shot his hands slid over reaverss body checking for blood within seconds he found two fatal wounds the first was in his hairline on the top right side of his head and the second was in the groin reaverss brain was gone but his heart was still pumping and from the looks of the pool of blood on the floor his femoral artery had been hit in battle the passage of time slowed for coleman in a brief instant he acknowledged that his friend was gone and that now was not the time to deal with it that would come lateranger frustration genuine sadness and some laughs to be sure but right now was about survival reavers is dead coleman announced above the roar of fire he grabbed his friends m rifle and started stuffing his extra magazines into his vest and cargo pockets rapp stole a quick glance at reaverss lifeless body and then he noticed the frightened look on the little boys face he yelled to coleman get these people back into one of the exam rooms gould showed up at rapps side and dropped to one knee he began firing wellaimed single shots in less than five seconds he counted three kills with as many shots we need to put someone on the roof after a couple more shots he yelled and you might want to see if you can get someone to come help us scott rapp barked without taking his eyes off the street call mike and tell him what were up against tell him we need a quick reaction force asap or were all dead rapp stepped back ejected an empty magazine and popped in a fresh one yelling back to coleman he added a gunship would be nice rapp popped off a couple of rounds and saw a man go down then looking down at gould he said get up on the roof and see what you can do ill join you as soon as i can how much ammo do you have gould shook his head just this one thirtyround magazine and then im down to my pistol rapp noted the make and model of the pistol in goulds vest at these distances i bet youre pretty good with that thing gould nodded the best well see about that grab one extra magazine for the m from the blond guy and then get your ass up on the roof before were all dead chapter coleman had stashed the old man the mother and son their animals and the receptionist in one of the exam rooms down the hall rapp assumed there were some nurses and at least one vet somewhere in the building but there wasnt a lot he could do about their safety other than keep the local police at bay until the cavalry arrived as best he could tell three more pickups filled with combatclad cops had arrived it begged the question could that many kabul police officers be corrupt the front entrance to the clinic was a tangled mess of broken glass and chipped stone the door and the two side windows were completely blown out and the metal frame was twisted and punctured from bullet strikes rapp was about five feet from the edge with his back pressed against the wall maslick was standing directly across from him they were alternating darting out and taking a few shots to keep the cops from rushing the door so far they were succeeding but just barely rapp watched maslick eject a spent magazine and insert a fresh one their advantage in this fight was their ability to hit targets with consistent frightening accuracy coleman maslick and rapp had all fired thousands of practice rounds a month with pistols carbines and long rifles rapp had no idea how much gould practiced but his fee was likely a good predictor of his ability even though they were outgunned this was all going to come down to ammunition rapp knew a little about how these men were selected and trained most of them were simply trying to make a living and were extremely brave as the taliban often targeted them and their families he found the idea that they were all corrupt to be a bit of a stretch it was more plausible that it was someone in their chain of command who was corrupt rapp thought of commander zahir down in jalalabad until recently the man had been a terrorist and had a bounty on his head courtesy of the us government not only was the bounty gone but the man was now on our payroll how many assholes like zahir were now wearing the uniform of the afghan police innocent or not these cops were trying to kill rapp and his men so he was left with no alternative if he wanted to survive a fresh barrage of bullets slammed into the front wall of the building peppering rapp with tiny pebbles he darted out fired two wellaimed shots and ducked back into the lobby as a dozenplus bullets raked the spot where hed been standing less than a second ago rapp shook his head with anger that had been closer than he would have liked he looked across at maslick again and noticed a splotch of blood on his right shoulder this position was quickly becoming too hot to defend sooner or later one of them was going to pop out and take a bullet in the head rapp made a snap decision and ordered maslick to the roof maslick tried to argue but rapp made it clear there was no time for debate as rapp began his retreat from the lobby he passed reaverss body he noted the sig p pistol still in the mans thigh holster kneeling rapp grabbed the gun and the three spare magazines the anger came boiling to the surface and rapp said to himself i swear to god im going to kill these idiots who came up with this reintegration crap the image of sickles popped into rapps mind and it suddenly occurred to rapp that sickles had probably recruited the man who was now trying to kill him rapp popped in his earpiece and looked up sickless mobile number he tapped the number and listened as began to ring rapp left the lobby and entered the hallway that bisected the building down at the far end coleman was stacking and shoving equipment against a side exit taking up position against the doorframe so he could cover the front entrance rapp began to wonder if the wall he was behind was thick enough to stop a round the answer was likely no so as darren sickles voice came on the line rapp walked back into the lobby hey dickhead rapp barked above the roar of gunfire did mike tell you the shitstorm were in rapp holstered his gun stepped behind the reception desk and began yanking up on the heavy formica countertop he just told me i have no shut up and listen to me rapp gave the top one more shove and it broke free this is your fault you recruited these scumbags and you were dumb enough to think you could trust them rapp grabbed the top and lugged it back into the hallway you are going to get on the fucking phone and you are going to call every last one of them and you are going to tell them that im going to place a milliondollar bounty on every one of their fucking heads and im going to be the one collecting it rapp tossed the heavy top up against the doorframe and leaned against it he drew his weapon again feeling a lot better about his position but not so good about sickles who was yammering about how he didnt understand any of this that it simply didnt make sense with more important things to do than listen to sickless senseless speculation rapp yelled darren i dont give a shit what you think just get on the damn phone and make it clear to these assholes that im going to hunt them down and kill them rapp was tempted to tell sickles that he was going to kill him as well but it was likely to be an extremely counterproductive threat so he bit his tongue and hung up vince fly nn rapp knew what their next move would be and it likely wouldnt take long the us had outfitted the afghan police with takedown gear that included battering rams breaching shotguns ribbon charges and bulletproof riot shields it was the bulletproof riot shields that worried rapp the most all a thoughtful commander needed to do was grab a couple of shields and do the old roman tortoise the first man in the line would hold the shield directly in front of him and the second man would hold the shield above them protecting them from the men on the roof theyd rush the front door with one or two lines of men if that happened rapp knew they would overpower him and his little mm pistol in a matter of seconds the thought of dying like that got rapp thinking and he yelled down the hall scott coleman shoved a big metal exam table against his pile and turned to look at rapp what you come across any oxygen tanks yeah coleman didnt have to be told what to do he ducked into one of the rooms and came out with two green tanks he dragged them down the hall by the necks and dropped them at rapps feet rapp kept his eyes and his pistol on the door and asked any more yeah put em in front of your pile down there and get your ass up on the roof coleman shook his head you get up on the roof ive got this handled stop wasting time drop the tanks down there and get moving theyre probably running low on ammunition coleman reluctantly dropped two more tanks by the side door and then stopped to offer rapp reaverss m rifle nope no need for that down here this is all close quarters get your ass up on the roof and buy us some time coleman started to leave but rapp grabbed him by the arm what did mike say he said hell get some shooters here as soon as is humanly possible call him back and tell him well take anything get a little bird to give us an ammo drop and maybe a saw or two rapp glanced back at the front door maybe some grenades too im on it coleman had his phone out and was calling nash again call if you need help rapp knew hed be making no such call hed hold them off as long as he could and then if he was still alive hed limp his way up to the roof what a shitty way to die rapp thought to himself all of the close calls hed had and it was going to come down to being killed by men who were supposed to be his allies he heard stan hurleys gruff voice telling him to suck it up now was not the time to think about death unless it was the other guys mortality that you were focused on hurley was fond of saying that no matter how bad things got there was always a way out rapp clung to that idea as there was an ebb in the volume of shots being firedjust a pop here and there instead of the sustained blister of rounds smacking into the building unfortunately rapp knew what that meant it was too soon for nash or sickles to have been able to call off the dogs so it was more likely that someone in a command position with half a brain had showed up and was now getting the men ready for an organized assault rapp holstered his gun and dragged the two oxygen tanks into the lobby he stopped about six feet short of the front door laid the tanks on their sides and then drew his gun lest they think no one was guarding the front door he slid along the wall until he had an angle to shoot from he squeezed off two shots and then two more and ducked back into the lobby he was pretty certain the first two shots had hit one man but the second two had bounced harmlessly off a clear plexiglas riot shield rapp went back to his position in the hallway with the foreboding feeling that this might be one situation he wasnt going to be able to get out of chapter gould popped the hatch and had to will himself onto the flat roof somewhere out there he feared a sniper was still lurking he rolled onto his side the m cradled protectively in both hands and then crawled his way to the parapet of the roof there was a twofoot stone parapet that provided sufficient cover he carefully brought his head above the lip and scanned the buildings across the street with no shooters in sight he got up on his right knee and brought the butt of the rifle up to his right shoulder gould swung the muzzle over the edge of the roof sweeping it from left to right with both eyes open the big square eotech aperture bringing his targets clearly into view the spotter in civilian clothes was standing behind one of the police trucks with his cell phone held to his left ear there you are you little prick the assassin said with a smile creasing his lips gould placed the red dot right over the cell phone let loose an even exhalation and then casually squeezed the trigger the rifle jumped a quarter inch but gould never lost sight of the target the heavy bullet shattered the cell phone and then exploded through vince fly nn the mans head spraying blood bone and brain matter in a mini mushroom cloud onto the men and street just past him three police officers were left standing in shock gaping at the man who had just been urging them into action and then three seconds after that they were all lying on the street dead gould worked his targets methodically keeping the rifle in singleshot mode it took the police approximately ten seconds to realize there was a new threat on the roof but it had cost them dearly seven officers had been dispatched gould was about to swing his rifle around so he could go to work on the cops at the other end of the street when the air around him exploded with the sharp snaps of bullets he dropped flat behind the lip as bullets began to thump into the stone like a jackhammer it took a second to sink in but gould realized that his position had been discovered and that the men at the other end of street had something more to bring to the fight than the relatively light m rifle since everything they had was provided by the americans it was likely that it was the heaviercaliber m squad automatic weapon or saw the machine gun fired the heavier xmm nato round and was effective out to one thousand yards gould guessed that they were firing from no farther than one hundred yards the machine gun continued to rake the edge of the roof raining down shards of stone on gould for the moment all gould could do was take cover beneath the edge of the roof and try to move to a different position on his own this was pure suicide gould began to wonder why he was sticking around he had done his job and warned rapp true the act had not been entirely selfless as it had gotten him out his own hot corner but now he was in an even less desirable situation he glanced across the roof wondering what lay on the other side he couldnt tell if there was a small gap between the two buildings or if they shared a wall worst case hed have to jump a gap he could then scurry across that roof and find access to the street the police would be so focused on this gunfight that he was sure to go unnoticed gould made up his mind hed done enough and martyrdom really didnt the last man suit him so it was time to bolt before another hundred cops showed up and brought this building down around them it was time to save his own ass so without further internal debate gould rolled onto his stomach began to crawl toward the far side halfway across one of rapps men popped out of the hatch and asked where you going gould ignored the question and said theyre raking the parapet with machinegun fire the man nodded looked over at the parapet and asked which direction is it coming from gould pointed to their left all right you get back over there near the middle and when i give you the signal stick your rifle over the parapet dont bother firing any shots until ive taken care of the machine gun go maslick watched the man crawl away and then scrambled over to the corner on all fours once in position he checked his weapon and visualized what he was about to do he then whistled and signaled for the man to make his move maslick watched as the black barrel went over the parapet a split second later the position was hammered with incoming fire maslick shouldered his weapon and popped over the parapet below him no more than fifty yards away six green police pickups were blocking the intersection men were huddled behind each but in the bed of one of the vehicles a man was crouched down with an m in his hands and the bipod resting on the roof of the cab maslick brought the man into the center of his sights just as the machine gun ran out of ammunition the police officer had turned to reach for another canvas ammunition drum when maslick shot him in the head the fact that maslick had just killed someone who was more than likely on his side was irrelevant to the former delta force operator the only thing on his mind as he began shooting one man after another was his friend mick reavers chapter the ebb in the relative number of shots fired at the front entrance was bringing on a bit of an adrenaline hangover for rapp this wasnt the first time hed experienced the physiological problem it had happened many times before it started with a dry throat and sour stomach for most people it eventually led to a headache sometimes one that was debilitating but rapp got only the dryness and the upset stomach his hands used to get a little shaky and his vision would blur at the far edges but hed mastered those two crucial problems either through willpower or through repetition his body was no longer as shocked by these neardeath experiences rapps left ear was ringing from all of the shots that had been fired whenever possible he operated with a suppressor he did so for multiple reasons that included stealth increased accuracy and the fact that he didnt want to be deaf by the time he was fifty because of the loud reports from all of the gunshots he almost missed the beeping tone in his right ear that was coming out of his bose bluetooth earpiece reaching into his pocket to look at the caller id seemed like too much effort so he tapped the button on top of the device and said rapp its mike i just spoke to scott we havent been able to get anyone at the afghan police to cooperate but im on my way with some boys from jsoc i hope by chopper yeah weve got two black hawks and two little birds eta there was a long pause and then theyre firing up the birds right now we hope to be airborne in the next sixty seconds pilot told me we should be on station two minutes after that youre not far rapp pushed back from the wall and took a deep breath he didnt like the silence and suddenly felt the need to see what was going on out on the street as he moved slowly across the lobby he asked have you guys discussed your roes rapp knew this was going to catch nash off guard roes or rules of engagement within the military and especially special operations were very specific they outlined who could be engaged and how and rapp very much doubted the brass was going to let their shooters come in and open fire on the afghan police no matter how fucked up the situation was no we havent let me save you guys the headache of trying to sort this mess out we have police at both ends of the street my guess is when you guys show up theyre going to think youre here to help them hopefully theyll stop shooting put the black hawks over them and hit em with the rotor wash and then bring the little birds in to pick us up on the roof i dont think theyll shoot at you but i cant make any promises ill pass it along anything else yeah if i dont make it out of here theres something you need to know does the name louie gould ring a bell there was a moment of silence followed by the man who killed your wife thats him somebody hired him a few weeks ago to fulfill a con the last man tract in kabul he says he didnt know it was me until this morning he was set up in an office building across the street and was supposed to shoot me when i showed up to see the vet how the hell exactly do you want to tell me how the fuck somebody knew two weeks ago that i would be in kabul talking to this vet when i didnt even know id fucking be here i have no idea but no more of this bullshit about not making it well be there in minutes and after i pull your ass out of the fire again well figure out what in the hell is going on ill tell you what in the hell is going on somebody set my ass up rick was the first domino and they knew how we would react were being played rapp carefully moved along the wall until he was just a few feet from the blownout entrance is gould still with you yeah hes on the roof the only police that rapp could see were taking cover behind their vehicles did scott tell you we lost reavers yeah im sorry about that rapp flexed his knees and then stuck his head out so he could see down the length of the front of the building he ducked back just as a flurry of shots rang out what he saw scared him more than the shots mike rapp yelled as he hustled across the lobby theyre getting ready to rush the building with riot shields you guys better haul ass or theres going to be no one left to save were getting in the birds right now hold on for a few more minutes rapp didnt bother to answer he moved in behind his piece of formica and switched his pistol to his right hand he counted the seconds in his head figured it would take the cops another eight seconds to shuffle down the sidewalk in their tight formation he extended his arm sighted the glock in on one of the tanks and then decided it would be better to pull the gun in close and cradle the grip with his left hand the first shield came into view the man behind it clasping the shield with his left arm and holding a pistol in his right hand three men followed all with shields two protecting their flanks and the fourth holding his shield above their heads when they reached the front door rapp slid his head back behind the formica closed his eyes and squeezed the trigger the mm round punctured the first tank and the explosion was instantaneous rapp attempted to pull the gun back behind his relative cover but there wasnt enough time the energy from the shock wave hit him like a massive hammer it slammed into the countertop and shot rapp across the hall and into the far wall rapp bounced off the wall and slid to the floor with the countertop and a good portion of the wall falling on top of him his hearing was completely gone he tried to open his eyes but felt himself slipping away falling into a deep hole and then everything went black chapter coleman joined maslick and gould on the roof just as things were settling down the sun was starting to slide out from the cloudfilled sky and the wind was picking up a bit coleman ran across the roof in a low crouch as sporadic bullets zipped overhead he did a quick ammunition check with the other two and then handed each of them a thirtyround magazine leaving himself two coleman then surveyed the situation at both ends of the block it appeared maslick and gould had taken the fight out of the police coleman had seen it many times before put a group of special operators in an allout gunfight with a force superior in size and they would balance the scales quicker than you could imagine the simple fact was that at these distances they hit what they were shooting at it was demoralizing for the opposing force as they watched one friend after another get shot in the head the ones who managed to stay alive got the message real quick that it was a good idea to keep their heads down and when you decided to keep your head down you ceased to become an effective fighter for the simple reason that you couldnt hit a target if you werent willing to expose yourself and aim your weapon properly having been in combat many times coleman knew how to recognize the ebb and flow of a battle the frantic adrenaline rush of the initial engagement was almost always followed by a lull as each side took stock of its losses and either retrenched or prepared for another assault the dynamics of this battle dictated who would do what they were in no position to launch an assault so it would be the other side that would have to make the next move coleman moved to the roofs edge a few feet away and dropped to one knee any movement on the roofs across the street gould glanced across the street hed been worried about the same thing crossways from them was a threestory building that was the high ground on the block gould pointed his rifle at the building and said if they put a few decent shooters up there they could make our lives miserable yeah keep your eye on it gould looked behind them there were multiple elevated rooftop positions within five hundred yards if they get behind us were done for coleman checked his watch well be out of here before they figure that out off in the distance he heard the dull thumping of rotor blades coleman looked to the east toward the airport at first he couldnt find a sign of the helicopters as they were flying so low and then he saw the shimmer of movement as they skimmed the rooftops almost two miles out scott coleman turned his head and looked at maslick who was pointing over the edge of the building weve got trouble coleman looked down and saw the men with the clear bulletproof shields forming up along the edge of the building he looked to his right and saw the same thing he grabbed gould and said get over there and help him a bullet slammed into the top of the stone parapet just a few inches from goulds face he almost immediately realized from the trajectory that it had to have come from above lunging forward from his knees he shoved coleman to the ground as a barrage of bullets hit their position gould rolled off coleman and said ill deal with the men across the street he handed coleman one of the canisters from his vest its only a flashbang but it might help coleman grabbed it from him ill try to draw their fire in a second on all fours he stayed near the edge and began crawling to the far corner he looked back at gould counted down with his fingers and rose onto one knee he was surprised to see four gun barrels pointed in his general direction from an elevated position he was expecting just one or two colemans right index finger began rapidly squeezing off rounds his aim was far from exact as he was trying to draw the attention of these men so gould get a few good shots gould came up a second later and quickly moved his aperture into position he placed the red dot on the closest mans head and fired at the exact same instant he saw a muzzle flash from the man he was trying to kill before gould had a chance to seek out a second target he was knocked on his ass he knew immediately it was his left shoulder he looked over and saw the nearperfect circle of blood slowly growing his shoulder was screaming with pain but gould knew the injury was not fatal at least it wasnt if he got medical care in the notsodistant future his best hope for that was if he got off his ass and back in the fight with a grunt and more effort than he should have needed he got back on his knees and took aim at the men across the street goulds left hand was still functional so his aim was as steady as ever although he knew that might not last only two heads were visible gould lined up the first one took the shot and saw the man go down he was moving the rifle into position for the second shot when there was a large explosion beneath him the building shook for a second and then all was quiet dammit coleman yelled cover me he tore off across the roof for the hatch gould shouldered his weapon and began firing on the rooftop position across the street more barrels suddenly appeared and he had to seek cover beneath the stone parapet when he looked back the blondhaired guy was gone gould lay on his back for a moment trying to survey the damage to his shoulder and then he suddenly became aware of the growing noise of helicopter rotors slicing through the air coleman found his way down the ladder as quickly as youd expect from a guy who had spent a good portion of his life on ships by the time he reached the staircase he had reaverss m up and ready to engage he flew down the stairs and into a cloud of floating debris in the firstfloor hallway he didnt care how many men there were he was going to rush them headon moving down the hallway at a steady pace he saw the pile of debris near where he had last seen rapp colemans heart sank as he stepped on the pile and swung his weapon to the left to engage the men who would be coming through the front door he was shocked to find not a person standing on the sidewalk just outside the front entrance there was a tangle of bodies coleman saw some movement and almost fired one of the cops was trying to roll onto his side colemans conscience got the better of him and he took his finger off the trigger two sounds suddenly filled the relative silence the first was a low moan which seemed to be fading and the second one was the roar of us special operations helicopters which was definitely growing in volume coleman turned and looked down at the pile of debris that he had just walked over he began yanking ceiling tiles and pieces of wood and sheetrock from the heap and then he saw the blue countertop that rapp had used to fortify his position next he spotted a hand and an arm coleman released the rifle letting it hang from the sling around his neck taking both hands he lifted the large piece of formica up revealing a dusty and pale rapp he chucked the large board off to the side dropped down to one knee and stared at rapps lifeless face coleman placed a finger on rapps neck to search for a pulse and then slapped him a couple times on each cheek rapp gasped his eyes shot open wide and his left hand shot up and grabbed coleman by the throat coleman removed rapps hand from his throat by applying just the right amount of pressure to his wrist its me you idiot do you think you can stand the former navy seal could tell by the way rapps eyes were darting around that he still wasnt entirely with it he ran his hands up and down rapps body looking for any injuries the thumpthump signature of the helicopters was growing louder by the second the thought of missing their ride or worse getting one of the birds blown out of the sky because they werent up on the lz made coleman skip the rest of the medical assessment he stood and grabbed rapp by his tactical vest yanking him to his feet rapp wobbled and almost fell to his left but coleman steadied him come on this way our ride is waiting for us what the fuck are you talking about we have a hot double date coleman squatted threw rapps right arm around his neck and then moved the two of them down the hallway dont want to be late come on we need to hustle where the hell are we rapp wobbled again and his legs gave out coleman struggled to keep him upright and then decided he needed to change tactics he spun rapp toward him bent over and threw rapp over his shoulder coleman hefted him in a firemans carry and started up the steps damn youre getting fat put me down you idiot what are you doing saving your fat ass you dumb shit coleman reached the second floor and stopped at the ladder that led to the roof the rotor wash from one of the helicopters was blowing through the opening coleman didnt think he could climb the ladder with rapp over his shoulder so he set him down rapps pupils were as big as saucers shit coleman muttered he turned rapp toward the ladder and placed his hands on the rung just above his head come on climb lets go rapp turned his head and gave him a blank stare coleman screamed at him were going to die if you dont get moving snap out of it coleman grabbed him by the waist and started pushing him up the ladder rapp seemed to finally come out of his stupor his hands grasping at the rungs above him thats right coleman prodded him on as they made painfully slow progress fortunately maslick appeared in the hatch opening he grabbed one of the shoulders on rapps vest and practically yanked him onto the roof by the time coleman cleared the ladder the big former delta force operator had rapp on his feet and was dragging him toward one of the waiting little birds coleman watched as bullets began impacting the ground around rapp and maslick he snapped his m up to his shoulder flipped the selector to full automatic and began raking the roofline across the street with fire coleman marched steadily forward and when his weapon locked out he ejected the spent magazine and inserted a fresh one charging the weapon and then releasing another volley ducking under the little birds rotors coleman kept up the suppressive fire and jumped onto the portside external bench he looked inside the back compartment and saw rapp and gould in a pile on the floor maslick was sitting on the starboard side bench laying down suppressive fire coleman took his finger off the trigger and reached forward slapping the pilot on the shoulder coleman gave the man the thumbsup signal and the bird immediately lifted into the air they banked to the right which gave coleman a good vantage point to fire at the building with the men on the roof no one however was getting up to shoot at the helicopter they were either all dead or had finally taken the hint that it was a good idea to stay down as they gained elevation and distance coleman released his rifle and strapped himself in that was when he noticed that rapp was out again he reached in and slapped him on the cheek coleman had seen a lot of concussions and this was not the norm gould was lying next to rapp with a bullet hole in his shoulder his face tight with pain coleman seemed to remember seeing some blood on maslick as well a hospital was more important than getting back to the embassy plus the cia had its detention facility at the bagram air base leaning forward he shouted above the roar of the rotors and engine we need to go to bagram straight to the base hospital the pilot nodded and began speaking into his lip mike about five seconds later the little bird and one of the black hawks broke formation and headed to the northeast for the fifteenminute flight to the main us air base and its levelone trauma center the black hawk pulled alongside and coleman could see mike nash sitting in the back of the much larger black hawk talking on a headset the fallout from what had just happened was going to be huge nash was probably already dealing with it coleman checked on rapp again he was still unconscious which from a medical standpoint was a concern but there was a silver lining if rapp were awake right now hed probably have them on their way to assault the police headquarters in kabul no afghani politician or state department official would be able to calm rapp down even kennedy would have a hard time convincing him to stand down the only thing that could stop him would be a hospital bed once rapp started coleman knew there would be no stopping him hed kill every last corrupt official he could get his hands on chapter jalalabad afghanistan rickman no longer wondered if his ribs were brokenhe was convinced three of them he was pretty sure both eyes were now firmly closed the skin so swollen and tight that he probably looked like he was morphing into an insect his tongue told him that two of his teeth were knocked out and a third was chipped he had finally broken hed heard the maxim many times beforeeveryone broke he was no different of course and no one would expect him to hold out for very long he had lived a life insulated from physical pain hed been hired for his intellect not like mitch rapp for his predatory instincts emotional agony rickman could write the book on but this physical stuff was an entirely different game he had prepared himself in a broad conceptual sense he understood what it would be like and that it would not last forever that the physical scars would heal nothing however no amount of meditation and careful consideration could prepare him for the absolute brutality the hairsplitting agony that would result from his nerve endings being so assaulted there was some embarrassment that he couldnt even last two days barely twentyfour hours after the torture started rickman caved the secrets came flowing out in a torrent he babbled from one subject to another like a crack addict who could not keep a train of thought it would take multiple experts to decipher what he had really said and that was intentional on rickmans part there was just enough truth in his words to make them believe him but there were also traps and deceptions that would give the cia the time they would need to maneuver and possibly save a few people there were also a few scores to be settled some enemies who would now have to answer to the taliban and defend what hed said theyd done the words would be a waste as they always were with groups like the taliban the group was all that mattered individual needs were not important the more the person tried to deny something that couldnt be proven the more it looked to these obtuse fools as if that person was putting himself before the needs of the group unable to decipher what had really happened the taliban would act predictably they would kill the perceived traitor it was a complex mix of facts outright lies halftruths and complicated misinformation that was possible only with rickmans genius they thought they were in control but they werent by the time he was done with them rickman would have these fools killing each other terrorist would be pitted against terrorist unfortunately a few allies would be killed but his side was not without fault soldiers died every week in this war a few intelligence assets werent worth getting too spun up about rickman heard the door open and he didnt bother to try to open his eyes hed stopped trying hours ago they were too puffy to work properly he felt a certain sense of calm the end was near and then the pain would stop it is time a steady soft voice announced rickman sighed he so much preferred this one to the others he was smart and actually knew what questions to ask but im having so much fun rickman tried to smile through his swollen lips i know you are but we all have our orders to follow yes rickman said we all must be good soldiers the man squatted next to rickman keeping his back to the camera deftly he slid an unseen syringe into the crook of rickmans left arm while pretending to take the mans pulse he depressed the plunger he doubted rickman noticed the prick the mans body was so overwhelmed with pain that this little stab wouldnt even register so now that ive begun talking it would be nice if we could conduct the followup questions in a more civilized setting hmm the man seemed to be pondering rickmans request theres only one problem whats that you lied to us i did not lie to you i told you what you wanted to know ahh i find it interesting how you phrased that you told me what i wanted to know that is not what i wanted i wanted the truth i gave you the truth you did not the man said in a voice bereft of emotion rickman grew nervous and began coughing up blood ive told you everything he managed to blurt out in his defense you are a devious man his tone had shifted to that of a disappointed father we all know this so the beatings will have to continue but dont worry you will learn very quickly that your games are not worth the effort please rickman blindly reached out clutching for the mans arm i am doing everything you have asked of me the man stood and took a step back not everything you have told us a few of your secrets but you have also told us many lies that means we will have to do this the hard way please rickman started crying i will tell you what you want to know the man was wearing a mask over his face and shook his head sadly you will tell me the truth not what i want to know the truth is the only thing that will save you i will tell you the truth then rickman pleaded yes you will the man turned and walked past the camera its red light glowing in the hallway he took off his hood and tossed it on a wooden table the two men were waiting like obedient dogs for instructions on what do next vazir kassar was apprehensive about how to proceed he didnt have much confidence in these men one of them started to speak but kassar held up a hand the men had at least learned that much kassar despised people who talked too much and had explained to the two halfwits that there was nothing they could say that he hadnt already thought of after fishing out a cigarette and lighting it kassar exhaled a cloud of smoke and said it is time to increase the pain both men nodded eagerly the taller of the two said the genitals can we hit him in the genitals now yes you may hit him in the genitals kassar took no joy in this it was simply part of the job i have given you the area i want you to focus on where i know he has lied you will increase the pain until he tells us the truth yes yes both men answered kassar waved for them to proceed he took another puff of his cigarette while the two simpletons put their masks on kassar couldnt shake the feeling that these two fools might somehow mess this up there were no guarantees in life and definitely none in the dangerous waters where they were swimming kassar settled into a wooden chair and watched the single monitor he checked the time on his watch and made a quick calculation this shouldnt take long he said to himself rickman was strung up once again by his wrists they had yet to lay a hand on him but he was already sniffling the men began taking turns slapping him in the head and heaving insult after insult at him kassar could tell that the cia man was losing control of his legendary wits hed been awake for a day and a half and hed been beaten so severely that he could barely stand he was exhausted and on the verge of a complete collapse the men paused for a moment and then without warning one of them took a rubber hose and swung it up between rickmans legs striking him in the groin a glob of blood exited rickmans mouth as his entire body convulsed forward his sniffles turned into sobs and his chin was coated with spit tears and blood rickman was begging for them to stop but the men paid him no heed they were literally kicking the crap out of him as rickman defecated in his boxers this only upset the men more the slaps were now replaced with punches kassar watched rickman slump suddenly his legs completely giving out the pakistani moved closer to the screen and tried to see what was wrong it was not unheard of for a subject to lose consciousness during an interrogation kassar checked his watch again and frowned as the two men continued to beat their unconscious prisoner it took them another minute to realize that something was wrong and by then it was too late chapter bagram air base rapp heard voices he opened his eyes and looked up at a ceiling he was pretty sure hed never seen before his brain didnt seem to be working quite right as the only thing he could figure out was that he was in a bed and his head hurt the voices were coming from somewhere down by his feet moving his eyes caused discomfort but he caught a glimpse of two men and a woman talking none of the their faces were familiar but one of the men and the woman were wearing white coats the other man was in what looked like lightblue pajamas rapp didnt know why but their clothes had some meaning to him that he couldnt grasp he closed his eyes and let out a long sigh suddenly the three people were standing over him two on his right and one on his left he opened his eyes and could see their lips moving but it was all scrambled suddenly the woman shined a bright light in his eyes rapp didnt like it one bit but his limbs felt as if they were encased in concrete so all he could do was lie there thinking of moving them hurt his head so he gave up on the idea and let the woman move the light from one vince fly nn eye to the other when she finally clicked the light off he was so relieved he fell back asleep rapp had no idea how long hed been out but sometime later he woke to find a familiar face his head rolled to his right and there in a chair next to his bed was someone who he knew was very important to him he couldnt come up with her name or how he knew her but he knew he should have known in a moment of panic he asked himself if he knew his own name he came up with that one pretty quickly but when he asked himself where he was a half dozen cities popped into his head which got him wondering what he did for a living then things got really murky youre awake the woman said with a warm smile rapp noted the familiar brown eyes the glasses and the auburn hair pulled back in a tight ponytail and then something clicked boss irene kennedy said you had us a bit worried where am i heath craig joint theater hospital bagram air base rapp frowned and another link popped into his head afghanistan kennedy looked at him with appraising eyes mitch what is your last memory rapp looked past her at the far wall some part of his brain was telling him to bluff his way through this but another part was telling him he needed to tell her the truth he couldnt remember everything about her but he knew she was someone he could trustperhaps the only person he could truly trust is there any water around here kennedy grabbed a covered plastic glass with a pink straw sticking out of a round hole in the center of the lid she raised the elevation on rapps bed about six inches and then held the straw to his lips after hed had a good gulp she repeated the question so what is the last thing you remember rapp tried to recall but nothing was coming to him he gave a slight shrug and said i dont know but you remember who i am where you work things like that it took me a moment to remember you it didnt come right away and where you work ahh i think its in washington but im not sure exactly where my title youre my boss kennedy nodded the doctors had warned her that things could be patchy im the director of the central intelligence agency oh rapp said as something fell into place its coming back to me now good do you remember my son rapp started to shake his head and then stopped because of the pain sorry thats all right his name is tommy the two of you are rather close what happened to me rapp reached a hand to his head and winced there was an explosion you hit your head you have swelling on the brain they call it a subdural hematoma explosion she shook her head i dont think we want to get into that right now the fact that youre awake and fairly lucid is a good sign the doctors tell me all of this is normal and with time you should regain most if not all of your memory kennedy smiled and put on a brave face rapp was her top operative even at percent he could be exceptional but that depended on which percent was lost how long have i been out a little over a day a day rapp asked in surprise vince fly nn yes and it had been a stressful day twentyone dead police officers all killed by her men and an assassin which further complicated the entire affair she was sitting on that particular piece of information for the moment the facts as shed gathered them showed that rapp and his men were left with no choice but to defend themselves those facts however didnt matter to the afghani people and their political leadersat least not in the immediate aftermath of the slaughter the president had ordered kennedy to afghanistan to see if she could straighten out the mess before the damage was irreversible by the time she landed she was in possession of the information she needed her people had already identified the corrupt afghani police commander who had ordered the attack the man had simply vanished his government sponsored house cleaned out of anything of value contacts within the afghan national police confirmed that most of the police officers who were killed were former taliban members whom the corrupt commander had brought onto the force they were all part of the state departments vaunted reintegration program kennedy gave the goahead for her assets to begin sharing this information far and wide by the time she landed the afghans were firmly split one camp of hardliners refused to blame anyone other than america for the catastrophe it was no shock to anyone who followed afghan politics that these men were the ones who had pushed reintegration in the first place the second camp was made up of the various groups that had fought the taliban for more than a decade and had warned the first group that their scheme of bringing them into the fold was shortsighted and naive kennedy arrived at the us embassy and after giving darren sickles a very cool reception she kicked him out of his office and called the president and his national security team in her typical analytical manner she relayed the information regarding the corrupt afghan police commander the president asked just two questions did we suspect that this commander was a bad egg and did kennedy think this was linked to the abduction of rickman the first question was easy to answer the cia had a file as thick as a phone book on lieutenant general abdul rauf qayem they had warned the state department that the man was hardcore taliban and should not be included in the reintegration program kennedy relayed this as dispassionately as possible the secretary of state would get beat up over this and kennedy didnt need to pile on they had a good working relationship and she wanted to keep it that way the answer to the presidents second question was less clear kennedy wasnt ready to share the information surrounding louie gould until she knew more it was looking as if the abduction of rickman and the attack on rapp were part of a coordinated effort to damage the cias ability to operate in afghanistan until she had more information though she simply told the president that they were proceeding under the premise that the two events were linked chapter kennedy spent another ten minutes with rapp both answering and evading his questions and gently probing to gauge the depth of his memory loss his inability to recall information stretched across all aspects of his life one pattern did emerge thoughhis mind was blank when it came to anything that involved the last three days before that things were spotty but rapps recall seemed to get better as each memory fell into place not wanting to overwhelm him she didnt bother to tell him that in the middle of the night the doctors had been on the verge of drilling into his head to drain the clotted blood that was creating pressure on the brain the prognosis was very iffy at the moment the military doctors had ample experience with head trauma caused by explosions every case was different some patients progressed to a full recovery with nothing more than a weeks bed rest while others never fully recovered despite the best effort and medical care kennedy would not allow herself to think the worst over the years rapp had proven that he had an extremely strong ability to survive what would kill most people his refusal to be deterred despite overwhelming odds while it often put him in harms way was the very thing that drove him to never quit dying simply wasnt an option his recovery right now depended on rest and relaxationtwo things that were as foreign to rapp as not barking at a stranger was to a dog this put kennedy in a unique quandary she needed rapp to find rickman there was no other asset up to the task there were others who could help but she needed rapps fearless ruthless behavior to deal with the miscreants who orbited their interests in this part of the world unfortunately he was sidelined until the doctors told her otherwise so far they were being vague telling her he would likely be kept in bed for a week and then there would be another week of rehabilitation a variety of symptoms could persist including lethargy slurred speech difficulty in walking blurred vision numbness headaches amnesia dizziness and pain the last part didnt concern kennedy rapps pain threshold was off the charts she was betting that he would recover way ahead of the curve but she couldnt count on that so she told him she had some things to attend to but shed be back to see him in a bit kennedy found one of the doctors in the hall an air force major and told him that rapp was awake she filled him in on their conversation and the doctor said this was a very positive development he then excused himself and went to personally check on his patient kennedy found coleman in the small lounge with two of her bodyguards she asked her men for a bit of privacy and sat down next to coleman kennedy grabbed colemans hand you know you saved his life coleman was embarrassed lets not get all melodramatic an uncharacteristically big smile spread across kennedys face i dont think you understand youll be able to hold this over his head for years coleman joined in with a big grin good point the only problem is that i think hes saved my life at least twice im still behind his memory is a little shaky at the moment maybe hell forget hes ahead ill never tell him hes awake kennedy nodded coleman breathed a sigh of relief thank god hows he doing he seems to be okay but he doesnt remember much what does that mean im not sure he knew who i was when he woke up he recognized me but he had to struggle to come up with my name he remembered his own name but he couldnt tell me where he worked at least not at first as we talked more and more things seemed to fall into place rick no idea in fact i dont think he can remember a single detail over the past seventytwo hours shit coleman dropped his face into his hands so hes out of commission id say for at least the next week what are we going to do im not sure at this point do you have it in you to take the lead kennedy thought she knew the answer but she needed to ask the question coleman thought about it for a moment and then said i have the drive but mitch and i are very different you know that im not afraid to break a few rules and even a few noses but im an amateur compared to him the only other person i know who could do it is stan and from what i heard yesterday hes not exactly up to the challenge what about mike kennedy asked referring to mike nash her counterterrorism director after inhaling sharply coleman shook his head i like mike but im not sure hes cut out for this rough stuff i dont blame him hes got a wife and kids and you gave him an important job with a nice title hell do well and if he had his back to the wall hed do whatever it would take to survive but thats not what this is what is this you want rick back you need to find someone whos willing to throw out the rule book you need someone like mitch who doesnt give a shit about the politics someone whos fearless someone who will make these dirt bags fear for their lives kennedy agreed the only problem was that she had no such man available louie gould have you had a chance to talk to him only briefly do you buy his story coleman let out a small laugh that said what he thought of the question im not sure i believe a thing that comes out of that guys mouth what does mike say nash and another cia interrogator had been tagteaming gould since the night before trying to sort through his lies he says progress is slow im going over there in a minute gould doesnt know it but i have some leverage on him hell tell us what we need to know and then some if we can find out who hired him everything might fall into place it would be nice if it were that easy but im guessing there are some firewalls in place that are going to make that very difficult probably but he might be able to point us in the right direction im counting on it kennedy closed her eyes briefly and then said you lost a man coleman wore the fateful memory on his face yeah one of my best mick reavers thats right kennedy could tell coleman had some emotions that he hadnt yet begun to deal with she looked away and said through back channels ive made it very clear that i want his body back by the end of the day i appreciate that coleman looked across the room for a second and stared at a poster of an a warthog he never had a chance they shot him before he even got his weapon up it wasnt often that kennedy allowed herself to get pissed off and it was even more rare for her to show it she supposed she was filling the void left by both rapp and hurley scott i want to make something clear we are not going to allow this crap to go unchallenged ive got more shooters on the way over and within twentyfour hours i am going to have some targets for you were going to find general qayem it might not be this week or the following but you are going to find him and you are going to kill him do you understand me coleman nodded thats what i was hoping you were going to say and by the time were done my guess is theres going to be a few more names added to our list chapter interservices intelligence hq islamabad pakistan a shan had been summoned to the director generals office and he thought he knew why his people had informed him of the developments across the border not only was rickman gone but another operative in jalalabad had gone missing and there had been an attempt on mitch rapps life as the deputy general of the foreign relations wing the only thing that surprised ashan was that he hadnt heard directly from the americans even so he had directed his people in both jalalabad and kabul to aid their counterparts from the cia the isi was an extremely controversial yet influential part of the pakistani government in recent years there had been pressure to make the intelligence agency more accountable parliament had decided that the best way to avoid future scandal would be to make sure the head of the spy agency wasnt anyone too special in other words they wanted someone they could control they found just the person in air force general ahmed taj tajs career in the air force had been spent almost entirely in supply and logistics he had both a fondness and an aptitude for moving men and equipment from point a to point b ashan had noticed this some time ago as it seemed that nearly every time he was called to tajs office he was ordered to get on a plane and go somewhere when hed been informed of the meeting he called his wife and asked her to pack a bag for him just in case the office of the director general was decadent the space was nearly as big as a tennis court the walls and ceiling were covered in a deep brown rosewood paneling and there were three granite fireplaces most of the walls were covered with bookcases but there had been updates that included several large flatscreen monitors tastefully concealed behind tapestries ashan was five minutes early and was irritated to find his friend general durrani seated and sharing tea with their boss it was just like durrani to arrive early in an attempt to reform and dictate the agenda the room was divided into three parts to the far left was the director generals mammoth desk a map table and four chairs the middle of the room was dominated by a conference table for sixteen the most ashan had ever seen at the table were six people to the right was a sitting area a massive leather couch that could seat six was centered on the fireplace two more couches framed the area around a large glass coffee table taj greeted ashan and asked him if hed like some tea ashan graciously accepted and sat by himself on one of the shorter couches he accepted his tea and saucer with both hands and placed it on the glass tabletop he would very much like to know what the two men had been discussing but would never want to seem so desperate besides there was a good chance it would be revealed during the course of their conversation how are things in foreign relations taj asked ashan was pleased to see that in a break from his predecessors taj was dressed in a light gray suit as opposed to his military uniform were getting along good so said taj picking up his cup of tea and taking a sip i assume youve been following the recent developments in afghanistan i have any thoughts taj was less than average in height and sitting by himself in the middle of the massive couch gave him kind of a childlike appearance ashan hated such openended questions especially when there was likely an agenda or at least a formed opinion behind it his job was to offer his insights to the director general so he took in a short breath and pushed ahead it appears at least from a timing standpoint that someone has decided to launch an operation against our american friends any idea who this was where it always got tricky ashan decided to start out cautiously beyond the usual suspects no sir as for the usual suspects id like to hear your list the taliban is the obvious choice although i doubt that they have the organization to be able to conduct such a complicated operation explain please three different targets all individuals which means its very hard to predict where they will be in advance from everything we know the taliban by themselves dont have the assets to pull something like this off by themselves they are ashan started and then stopped there was a safer way to go about this all we need to do sir is look at a map afghanistan is landlocked ashan ticked off the neighbors iran turkmenistan uzbekistan tajikistan china and us dont leave out the americans durrani interjected ashan was struck by the stupidity of the statement you think the cia is doing this to itself i dont pretend to know the american mind im simply saying they are highly invested in maintaining their influence over the region ashan decided to let the stupidity of his colleagues statement stand on its own historically the stans have had no relationship with the taliban if anything they have been pulled into americas orbit it is however possible that russia could be involved do you have any evidence no ashan said with a quick shake of his head although they seem to be taking great joy in poking the americans as of late so we should at least consider them iran is growing in influence and we all know they have ample hatred to attempt something so brazen china so far has shown almost no interest in the region as to why that is fairly obvious there are no natural resources other than the opium trade as weve discussed if afghanistan had oil china would be very interested the director general rubbed his fingers along his mustache while he considered the analysis so we think it is likely that it is either the iranians or the russians there is one more possibility sir you forgot about us it was immediately obvious that durrani had been waiting for this i told you he would try to pull us into this sordid mess i am trying to do no such thing ashan answered in a voice bereft of tension the director general asked for my analysis and i gave it to him durrani ignored his old friend and looked directly at taj i warned you this is dangerous he has absolutely no evidence yet he is willing to implicate us how long do you think it will take until the americans get word of this they have spies all over this building shifting his butt so he could face ashan directly he asked how many people have you told of this ashan would have burst out laughing if the entire thing wasnt so serious akhtar you must not be listening let me phrase this a different way if you were the americans where would you start looking i dont give a damn about the americans this is not our problem it is theirs and we should keep it that way not help them try to implicate us ashan sat back and threw up his hands director general i do not understand his animosity there is no place for it here taj looked as if he wished the entire matter would simply go away but with these two strongwilled subordinates the chances of that were remote i think you both have valid points looking meekly at durrani he added you really should take a less aggressive approach when it comes to the americans i assume that when we are in your office you would like us to speak freely durrani acted hurt by his bosss admonition unless ashan added quickly the subject involves your departments unseemly relationship with the taliban then were not allowed to speak freely durrani realized he had set himself up for the rebuttal and could see that his anger was pushing the director general toward ashans position rather than speak and risk alienating the director further he clamped his mouth shut and began a lengthy internal indictment of his friend taj took a last sip of his tea placed it on the saucer and pushed it a few inches away after leaning back and throwing his arm over the back of the couch he announced i think we need to show the americans our support nadeem i spoke with director kennedy earlier shes at the bagram air base id like you to fly up there and offer our assistance durrani practically leaped to his feet surely you cant be serious i dont trust him not at all how do you know he wont say to her what he just said to us the last time ashan had seen his friend this upset was after the bin laden raid youve met director kennedy before the womans intellect within the intelligence community was well known you dont think shes already thought of this herself you dont think the entire bin laden fiasco isnt seared into her brain why do you keep bringing that up because its relevant ashan couldnt believe he had to keep pointing out something so obvious the more i think about it if i were them the first place id look is the external wing durrani was on his feet this time stabbing the air with his finger threating ashan that his career was over there is no room for anglo lovers in our world anymore we are a sovereign nation not their trained dogs if i were you are not me and i must tell you akhtar you are behaving like a man who has something to hide i will not stand here and take this durrani proclaimed looking at the director for support taj made a calming motion with his hands sit everyone needs to calm down ashan felt like pointing out that only one person needed to calm themselves but taj was smart enough to know that bringing it up would only serve to irritate durrani akhtar if you do not trust nadeem then i think you should accompany him to bagram taj paused for a long beat and then held up a cautionary finger your lack of emotional control however worries me if you cannot conduct yourself in a civil helpful way with our american friends then i do not want you to go anywhere near them are we clear durrani looked like someone had just forcefed him a shit sandwich he didnt want to leave especially not now he needed to keep an eye on things but at the same time it pained him to think of ashan licking the boots of the americans ultimately the only rational choice was to stay in islamabad if ashan was right and he usually was about these things the americans would already have his department under their watchful eye ashan could go play nice with the americans durrani would stay where he was and make sure there was nothing to raise their ire chapter bagram air base afghanistan the cias offices were off the main drag from the airport in an area that housed the intel fusion center and the snake eaters from the joint special operations command langley also had another piece of real estate at the far end of the flight line where they housed their planes and a few other things it was their own little domain within the sprawling air base out of necessity the spooks had to share information with the various military branches but there were times when it was unwise for the cia to be too open with its military brethren necessity was after all the mother of invention and the cia had a real need to keep much of what they did secret louie gould was a perfect example bagram had a brandnew shiny detention center replete with prayer rooms prayer mats video games flatscreen tvs and a koran on every bed putting a man like gould under the care of the military was an inherently bad idea for the simple reason that once they had their hands on him there would be an official record kennedy made it clear to nash in the aftermath of the disaster with the afghan police that goulds identity was to be kept secret from everyone outside their immediate circle she went so far as to put darren sickles and anyone else at the embassy on an exclusion list until they knew more gould was nothing more than another one of rapps hired guns who was shot during the conflict kennedy wanted him kept under wraps until she could question him herself the two had a shared history that she was certain gould was not entirely aware of early reports were that he had been evasive and uncooperative when questioned by nash kennedy had a piece of leverage that she was almost certain nash was unaware of kennedy left the hospital and asked her security team to bring her back to the hangar where her plane was parked clark jones the head of her security detail gave her a concerned look are we leaving no just some business i need to take care of they rolled down the bases smooth asphalt streets in the black suburban that had been provided by the base chief they passed the post office a burger king a fitness center and bunch of other nondescript buildings the place was a little slice of america the hangar was at the far end of the flight line far away from prying eyes it looked like all the hangars the helicopters parked on the tarmac were no different than the us army black hawks all up and down the flight line the black suv pulled into the hangar and two beautiful gulfstream gs came into viewnoticeably absent were any us air force markings three twin turboprop mc surveillance planes were clustered in the other corner and a smattering of other smaller planes and helicopters were spread about the cavernous space kennedys vehicle came to a stop near the glass offices her security team jumped out of the vehicle before she could put her hand on the door bill schneeman the base chief was waiting for kennedy by the office door the bodyguards dismounted and formed their protective bubble around the director she found the entire thing a bit much but jones had given her a firm lecture on the flight over jones had been in charge of her detail for just under two years this was the first time he had laid down the law as he called it he was rarely briefed on the intricacies of what was going on but because of his proximity he often picked up bits and pieces of information in this case hed heard about the abduction of rickman one of her most senior people in afghanistan and the attempt on the life of mitch rapp her most trusted advisor and top counterterrorism operative there was one other piece of information that he was not privy to john hubbard the jalalabad base chief had gone missing and local assets were frantically searching for him even without the knowledge of hubbard jones and his men hovered like overly protective mothers of a first child it was all very stifling schneeman started to approach kennedy but stopped on the other side of the security team boss schneeman called out with his typical smartass grin do you think you could get your guys to relax a little we own this site all the jihadists are on the other side of the wire kennedy gave jones a sideways glance clark while were on base do you think you guys could relax your posture just a bit kennedy put her words in the form of a question but her tone made it was obvious that it was an order jones didnt flinch his dark eyes and tight black skin gave him a nononsense intensity that was perfect for his job he might as well have had dont mess with me on his forehead for a moment it looked as they were going to have at least a standoff if not a confrontation jones looked around the hangar as if he was making one last check for threats and then motioned for his men to give the director some room schneeman moved past the big men with all the weapons and extended his hand welcome to spa bagram kennedy grinned at the reference back at hq people liked to joke that the bagram assignment was a cakewalk most of the people posted to bagram came back thin fit and in the best shape of their careers kennedy knew the real toll of the posting however marriages had fallen apart due to distance and in more than a few cases infidelity the bigger problem though was stresslong hours and big demands for results had burned out a good number of her people sorry i didnt stop by sooner but i was at the hospital kennedy offered dont worry about it hows he doing better hes awake but it looks like hes going to be out of commission for a while thats not what i wanted to hear i mean the part about him being out of commission i knew what you meant very few people knew that kennedy had increasingly turned to schneeman to get a handle on what was going on in country she had lost confidence in sickles months ago as she began to receive reports of his unabashed enthusiasm for reintegration how one of the top people in the clandestine service could think the plan was a good idea was beyond kennedys ability to comprehend the blame she knew rested squarely on her as she had been the one who made him station chief in kabul and then the fool had gotten too cozy with the state department contingent that awful woman arianna vinter in particular what have you found out about hubbard nothing so far his phone doesnt even show up on the satellites which we both know is a really bad sign schneeman shrugged and added i hate to give you more bad news but it is what it is keep looking we cant keep losing people like this she was about to add the fact that it was embarrassing but she knew it would sound selfserving these were the people that she sent into harms way her number one priority was to get them back alive im not going to lie to you a lot of our people are spooked they think this has to be part of bigger plan by the taliban to cripple us in country they might be right after staring at his shoes for a second schneeman said no ones turned me down yet but i almost had to make them draw straws to see who would go down to jbad to search for hubbard kennedy did not take this information well this was another reason she needed rapp his unabashed fearless attitude was contagious the last thing she needed right now were operatives who were afraid to leave the base if this problem got worse she would have to lean on jsoc for muscle the special operators shared rapps bold manner schneeman motioned toward a doorway next to the glasswalled offices can i get you a cup of coffee tea please schneeman led and she followed i apologize but things are pretty hectic around here including the nine people in your entourage we have fiftysix additional people whove been brought in over the last two days you need to push them out how many people did you send down to jbad im keeping all the analysts up here i sent six operatives and twelve sog guys i told them i dont want anyone going anywhere by themselves i assigned two sog guys to each operative and they need to check in every hour they entered a small break room with a microwave and refrigerator schneeman started rifling through cupboards until he found a box of assorted teas he handed the box to kennedy and then poured himself a cup of coffee and kennedy a cup of hot water when was the last time this room was swept kennedy asked schneeman knew kennedys expectations less than thirty minutes ago she gave a nod of satisfaction and asked how closely was rick working with darren the short answer is im not sure i mean im out here most of the time darren runs the show from kabul dont ask me how but i think he got the sense that im his replacement hes been a real prick the last five months the good news is im lucky if i see him once a month the bad news is he hasnt been managing his people i have no idea what he and rick were up to kennedy gave him a small disbelieving frown their business was to collect facts but intermixed with the facts was often a lot of gossip and innuendo brian you cant honestly expect me to believe that you havent heard a thing the guys my immediate boss irene and hes a real prick not to you of course but to most of the people who work for him hes insufferable i understand theres a chain of command but how do you people expect me to make good decisions when you keep me in the dark on this stuff rapp had warned her that he thought sickles was in over his head but no one else had bothered to make so much as a peep i dont know what to say were thousands of miles away we deal with what we have as best we can these are all decisions that get made way above my pay grade kennedy wasnt going to push the point schneeman was right of course going behind your bosss back to say that he was incompetent without any real proof was a great way to torpedo your career this stays between the two of us darren is not going to be the station chief much longer schneeman wasnt totally surprised how much longer im not sure hes going to make it to the end of the day but i need to get a few things out of him first so well have to see schneeman almost asked who was going to be his replacement but thought it would sound too selfserving instead he moved back to the earlier topic there were a few things that didnt exactly pass the smell test kennedy folded her arms across her chest and asked like what over the last few months they seemed to really kick this program into high gear they were handing out bags of cash to every asshole in the country most of them guys weve spent the last ten years trying to kill schneeman shook his head in disgust and added in an acid tone fucking abdul rauf qayem i told darren id put a bullet in the guys head and he could pocket the cash do you know what darren did no kennedy responded he freaked out and not about the bullet in the head he gave me this big lecture about the inspector generals office and how they were all over him how they had controls in place to make sure every penny was accounted for kennedy was surprised as this was all news to her the inspector general thats right for obvious reasons langleys inspector general had a certain amount of autonomy that was the idea after all an inhouse group tasked with making sure the spooks were playing by the rules the idea was almost laughable and had of course been foisted on the agency by the politicians on capitol hill the fact that they thought it would work was interesting in itself if the cia could penetrate the worlds top governments how difficult would it be to recruit a few people who worked in the inspector generals office the answer was simpleit wasnt kennedy had people in the office who kept her informed of anything of consequence it they had been looking into rickman and this reintegration business kennedy would have known as a precaution though she would need to do a little doublechecking what about hubbard kennedy asked he gave a shrug hes competent enough ive heard he became ricks goto guy yeah if he needed any heavy lifting done he usually arranged it through hubbard although schneemans voice trailed off he was thinking about something hed heard what kennedy asked rick was involved with a lot of bad characters always has been but when this reintegration thing got going he really started hanging out with a rough crowd i picked something up from one of the sog guys more of a complaint really sog stood for special operations group they were the paramilitary arm of the national clandestine service and were the men and women whom kennedy used to conduct covert operations what did you hear guy told me ricks security was dog shit couldnt understand why hed turned everything over to the natives said a guy like rick should always have some american shooters with him he had too big a target on his back to trust everything to a bunch of local mercenaries you passed this concern on to darren yep this was the first kennedy had heard of any of this so ricks normal detail they stayed at the air base and he used them from time to time when he needed to make a show of force kennedy considered the new information for a moment in the aftermath of stuff like this certain bits of information could take on oversized importance she told herself not to get hung up on it if it were important she would revisit it later so we have no idea where hubbard may be none and weve talked to a ton of sources okay she looked back toward the door our number one priority right now is to find hubbard number two is qayem understood good now tell me what you and mike have learned from our guest chapter nash had followed kennedys orders to the letter she wanted gould treated with respect until she said otherwise the injury to his shoulder wasnt too bad the bullet had gone clean through and left a dimesized pucker on entry and a quartersized one on the back end it was easy to pass gould off as one of the cias hired guns that they used for security the medical officials at the base hospital had worked on people from every nato country multiple times and the cia had a reputation for outsourcing the doctors had learned to not probe too deeply with men who wouldnt even admit they worked for the cia and instead threw out the generic acronym oga which stood for other government agency the doctor cleaned and patched up goulds wound gave him some blood put him on some antibiotics and at the urging of nash sent him on his way after leaving the hospital the previous evening nash and schneeman brought gould to the air hangar where they had a suite of rooms that doubled as an interrogation facility it was nothing more than two soundproof rooms one of them wired for sound and video and the other to receive and monitor the initial interrogation produced nothing more than the same story gould had told from the beginning hed taken a contract and was instructed to fly to kabul and await further instructions he spent one night at the grand marriott and then received a text and was told to go to the office building across the street from the veterinary clinic while waiting to take the shot he received for the first time the photo of the man he was supposed to kill that was when he discovered it was mitch rapp do you understand our history gould asked nash nash was tired and his nerves were frayed he probably should have played dumb but gould was giving him so little to work with he said you mean the fact that you killed his pregnant wife yeah im well aware that next to child rapists youre probably the biggest piece of shit on the planet so youll have to excuse me if i dont believe a single word that comes out of your mouth gould sighed as if this man was so predictable and said i am telling you the truth do you want to hear the truth nash said leaning across the table his jaw rip tight with anger the truth is i dont understand why mitch spared your life i get why he couldnt kill your wife and your kid but you nash shook his head it makes no sense and im beyond trying to figure it out hes my friend you caused him a shitload of pain so i figure i should do him a favor and toss you in a black hawk fly up to one of the remote ranges and toss your ass out the door no one would even know youre gone your wife and kid would probably thank me it was the only time gould showed any emotion but it lasted for only a split second you dont want to do that gould said regaining his composure and why not because i can help you nash laughed at him weve been talking half the night and you havent said a single thing that has helped me i told you i need to talk to mitch he doesnt want to talk to you so youre going to have to deal with me and so it went round and round for most of the night with nash and schneeman taking turns neither of them getting any useful information out of the assassin at four in the morning nash called kennedy midair and gave her a vague report covering what they had learned which was pretty much nothing kennedy told nash that she wanted all of them to get some sleep and that included gould despite his anger at the man nash didnt stop schneeman from giving gould a bedroll pillow and blanket the door locked from the outside and they put one guard in the hallway and another one in the observation room to keep an eye on the prisoner they let gould sleep until almost noon and then fed him and started again again nash failed to learn anything of value gould refused to speak to anyone other than rapp with everything this clown had done nash could not understand why they werent taking off the gloves and slapping him around he was thinking about what kind of rough stuff hed like to try when the door opened time for a break schneeman announced this is not personal gould said to nash i need to speak to mr rapp nash pushed his chair back and stood schneeman closed the door and led nash into the observation room where kennedy was waiting hows it going kennedy asked the question even though she knew they hadnt learned a thing horseshit kennedy digested his coarse answer with a nod then looked at the surveillance monitors so weve learned nothing of value that about sums it up schneeman said erase everything excuse me erase everything you have of gould i dont want a shred of proof vince fly nn that he was here when she noticed that they were hesitating she said its of no value erase all the recordings and then turn off all the equipment whats your plan nash asked im going to go in there and hes going to tell me what i want to know really nash flashed a crooked grin youre just going to ask him thats right she said without undue confidence now if youd please open the door for me id like to talk to him kennedy followed nash back to the interrogation room where he punched in the fourdigit code on the cipher lock nash held the door open for his boss and then tried to follow her in kennedy held up a hand ive got this leaving a stunned nash in the hallway she closed the door and turned to face louie gould kennedy took a seat and studied the face of a man she had spent more time thinking of than even she realized he had a nice face nothing too sharp and his mouth had an almost perpetual soft smile he was an interesting contrast to rapp whose face was composed of sharp lines rapp knew how to blend in and hide the fact that he was a killer but he had to put some effort into it gould was a natural his soft eyes had a sadness in them that she was sure hed used to get past more than a few bodyguards you know who i am kennedy asked gould shook his head you sure kennedy said as she offered him a faint smile sorry mr gould i know more about you than you could possibly imagine i need to speak to mr rapp im afraid thats not going to happen why because if i let him in here im pretty sure hell kill you gould let out a deep sigh and let his sad eyes drop to the tabletop i want to try to help him i know i owe him then why dont you stop lying i am not lying gould looked exasperated why wont anyone believe me you cant be serious kennedy asked more amused than upset i ask you a simple question do you know who i am and you cant even answer that i did i told you i didnt know who you were and you are lying you see mr gould i know everything there is to know about you where you grew up the units you served in when you were with the french foreign legion and a good number of the people you have killed over the last fifteenodd years gould shrugged im not impressed kennedy flashed one of those confident smiles that only a person who is holding all the cards can carry off im not trying to impress you mr gould im simply trying to speed along this process and get you to drop your charade showing a hint of anger gould leaned forward and said if it wasnt for me rapp and the rest of your men would be dead is there anyone around here who knows how to show some gratitude and if you dont know who i am how is it that you know they are my men gould shook off her question it was a lucky guess no it wasnt kennedy said with absolute confidence we both know that you know who i am what im trying to figure out is why you think denying that you know me will somehow help your cause this is a waste of time get rapp in here until you do that im not saying a word i have done nothing wrong ive helped you guys gould said while poking himself in the chest maybe we could get your wife on the phone and you could try to explain to her what you were doing in kabul nice try vince fly nn claudia and i spoke yesterday youre full of shit you think because you have a name you can scare me into thinking youve got something on me kennedy paused she wasnt sure if she admired the way he was sticking to his story or thought him a fool she would discover her answer in the next few minutes chapter rapp awoke from another slumber to find a new woman sitting at his bedside there was a similar feeling of recognition as if they had a common past a collection of faint memories that he couldnt access but nonetheless were there just beyond his grasp there was also something different with kennedy the sentiment had been one of safety and familiarity almost as if they were relatives with this woman there was an emotion that told him their history was very different from that of being siblings rapp tried to come up with her name she was in her early to mid thirties with ravenblack hair pulled back in a low loose ponytail she had beautiful dark almondshaped eyes set atop high cheekbones and a strong jawline she was all the more stunning because she wasnt wearing any makeup if rapp was in love with her or lusted for her it was easy to see why his memory had been coming back in chunks and even though he could not place this woman he was confident that she meant something more to him than just a casual friend he feigned familiarity smiled and asked how are you vince fly nn sydney hayek returned the smile and said im fine youre the one were all worried about rapp played it off like it was no big deal im a little sore thats all i heard you have some memory issues rapp didnt notice an accent her diction was flat like all the tv anchors she was probably from the midwest but she looked as if shed been born in amman or beirut michigan popped into his head giving him the first clue to her identity thats what they tell me well she asked in a nonprodding manner well what hows your memory rapp held up his hand and let it wobble back and forth its a little iffy hayek gave him a suspicious look whats my name rapp smiled i know youre from michigan thats correct for reasons that he didnt know at the time and couldnt explain later he reached out and grabbed her hand im sorry i feel like youre important to me that weve shared something that could be important it wasnt easy to see hayek blush with her smooth olive skin but she was her lips formed a smile that was one part shock and the other part sheer flattery we work with each other and i get the feeling theres a little something more to our relationship than just work hayek cleared her throat and laughed she had sensed the tension between them but her history of work relationships was so bad that she had ignored it to the best of her ability that didnt mean however that she wasnt attracted to him she was very much so to the point where she was worried that it had begun to affect her work she had even allowed her mind to wonder what it would be like rapp was such a dynamic force volatile but in a very predictable way that he actually scared her at first the man across from her now however was a new the last man version of rapp where all of those walls had been stripped away for a split second she was tempted to tell him that they were in a committed relationship and then she decided against it instead her juvenile streak took over and she said weve been sleeping with each other for the last six months rapps eyes opened wide really hayek burst out laughing and unable to talk because she couldnt stop laughing she managed to shake her head finally after about ten seconds she said no im sorry i shouldnt have said that were coworkers youre my boss rapp looked bummed out that sucks im sorry she giggled some more placed her other hand over rapps and said that wasnt very nice of me rapp cracked a smile and asked do you think theres a chance we might be able to hayek laughed even harder this time and had to cover her mouth this was so unlike rapp she wished she had taped it to show everyone no that would be mean she thought but it would be fun to show him do they have you on any painkillers rapp smiled and his smile gave her the answer to her question now it was his turn to clasp her hand in both of his are you sure we never slept together chapter kennedy had maneuvered gould to the exact spot where she wanted him the intelligence business was many things but stripped down to its basic elements it was about people how they interacted with other people in normal daytoday activities and how they might change their behavior in a stressful situation it was easy to lose sight of this and get hung up on all the satellite imagery signal intercepts and endless reports from analysts but it all came back to human interaction kennedy was fairly certain gould was a misogynist it was observable in the way he treated his wife for a misogynist it was almost impossible to underestimate a woman so she said you think you are the only one who keeps secrets everyone has secrets claudia your wife does she have secrets kennedy saw a crack in his detached demeanor the mention of his wife in such a personal way had its desired effect in case youve forgotten she was the one who contacted me after you screwed up and killed mitchs wife you see she knew that she couldnt bring a baby into this world with that kind of dark cloud hanging over her head unlike you she gets it she understands that you cant take innocent life and expect to create life save your psychobabble for someone who cares i can only imagine how many people youve killed over the years some people in kennedys position would try to argue the fine point with gould and claim that they had killed no one but kennedy had never deluded herself that she was uninvolved because someone else pulled the trigger she understood fully the responsibilities of her job kennedy did not want to get sidetracked from the point at hand but she needed to clear something up first youll have to excuse me but im not naive enough to buy your postmodern relativism i have killed people more people than you have but there are several rather distinct differences between us i have received no fees bounties or contract payments for the people i have ordered killed and i most certainly dont find some perverse thrill in it as you do i kill bad people in an effort to keep innocent people safe you on the other hand it doesnt matter to you if you kill good people or bad people just so long as someone is willing to pay your fee please gould scoffed im not sure why you think this game is helpful but we both know the truth you are not a good man you are a selfish narcissist ass who despite being given a second chance in life could not walk away from an extremely dangerous profession a profession that will likely get you your wife and your daughter killed please stop lecturing me and go get mr rapp kennedy was ready to drop the bomb claudia and i have been in contact for the last four years she usually calls when youve left her and anna to go on one of your trips where you claim you need to see your bankers kennedy caught the change in his eyes and she knew she had him ive even had you followed a few times gould shook his head i dont know what youre talking about youre not very good at this neither are you my people were following you when you killed your old business partner gaspar navarro in that park in spain this information should have been enough to get him to fold but it was obvious he had a rather severe obstinate streak you thought he was taking money from you yes gould shook his head none of this matters rapp is the only person i will talk to thats not going to happen mr gould why i already told you im fairly certain if i put the two of you in a room together he is going to kill you and to be honest id like to keep you alive for a little while why why do you think he shrugged as if he didnt have the foggiest idea you possess information that i require information that you will give me sometime in the next minute or two is my guess gould laughed in her face oh are we going to start the cias vaunted enhanced interrogation process now please if you think those techniques will work on me you are a fool this doesnt happen very often but im tempted to test you just to see your arrogance stripped away torture will not work and you have yet to convince me why i would want to tell you a thing kennedy smiled because i hold the key to your future and im actually fond of your wife i think shes a good person who fell in love with the wrong man i wouldnt want to hold that against her the fact that youre a serial liar and a murderer amongst other things you dont know a thing about me you couldnt be more wrong mr gould in fact i think i care more about your wife than you do you have gotten into bed with some bad people i think its safe to say they wanted you dead yesterday after you completed their work for them people like that wont stop until they get what they want they are running now trying to tie up all their loose ends to make sure there is nothing left to connect them to you so while you sit here and refuse to talk your wife and child are vulnerable the men who hired you dont know youre here kennedy stood they will start looking for you and they will eventually find your wife and child you dont really expect me to fall for this do you oh i do mr gould because if i could find them im guessing that your employer can as well youre bluffing kennedy spoke each word in a staccato rhythm nelson new zealand vickerman street she saw the panic in the way his right cheek twitched at least he cared about them would you like me to describe the house to you the facade melted away at the mention of the city let alone his address he shook his head i had claudia and anna placed into protective custody last night kennedy turned for the door and just so were clear on this i did it because i dont think they should die because of your greed and stupidity gould felt the walls closing in around him he watched kennedy reach for the buzzer next to the door and he blurted out how did you find us kennedy made a half turn and looked down at gould this is your last chance mr gould you either tell me everything i want to know or i will tell claudia how you have continued with your little hobby despite promising her you were done i will tell her about the type of people youve been working with and how you have put her and anna in harms way all for your own selfish gratification and then you can spend the rest of your life in a cell agonizing over your stupidity and wondering what your daughter looks like with each passing birthday so whats it going to be mr gould are you ready to talk or do want to continue with these stupid games his head hung in defeat gould said im ready to talk what is my name and what do i do for a living youre dr irene kennedy director of the central intelligence agency kennedy nodded and pressed the buzzer it opened a second later to reveal nash she told him i need a pen and a pad of paper mr gould is about to give us a good deal of information nash looked more than a little surprised that his boss had been able to accomplish what he couldnt and in only a few minutes he nodded and turned to get what shed asked for and you can turn everything back on kennedy let the door close and surveyed the strange man sitting across from her you might not understand this but i care about what happens to you gould looked up at her with disbelieving eyes i know thats hard for someone like you to believe but its true mitch spared your life for reasons that i dont entirely understand which leaves me to wonder if there isnt a bigger reason that none of us understood and still dont understand kennedy watched for a sign that the man was capable of feeling either guilt or gratitude she saw neither but she wasnt displeased for his expression was one of fear and kennedy knew from personal experience that fear could be a great motivator you have a role to play here mr gould i dont know what it is yet but i think were about to find out chapter joel wilson was used to getting his way so much so that when people didnt bow to his whims he became such an insufferable bastard that his opponents only option was to surrender at least thats the way it usually worked but every once in a while wilson ran up against someone who was more than willing to match him toe to toe in his little game of threats wild conjecture and pure bluster it had started off well enough wilson had landed at the kabul international airport without alerting the cia or anyone from the fbi for that matter that he and his team had arrived he then placed a call to the fbi liaison at the embassy and explained to him that they needed to talk no wilson explained to the man you are not in any troubleat least none that i know of so i suggest you follow my orders to the tee wilson went on to explain that no one including the ambassador was to know that he and his people were in the country the liaison went along with wilsons requests and within the hour his team was inside the embassy and ready to descend upon the cia personnel that was when things started to get a little bumpy wilson primed for his first confrontation was extremely disappointed when he discovered that darren sickles the cias station chief was not in the building wilson badgered sickless secretary for a good ten minutes the only thing he managed to get out of her was that sickles was at the ministry of the interior on important business when he asked for sickless second in command he was told he was in jalalabad when he inquired as to the whereabouts of mitch rapp the woman completely shut down it didnt matter how many threats he leveled at her she refused to answer his questions in the end it was the liaison that came through a pasty little man with too much hair wilson thought he looked like a foreigner apparently there had been a gunfight with the local police and rapp it was causing an uproar in the capital early reports had it that rapp and his men had killed more than twenty police officers and rapp had been injured in the battle the liaison discovered that rapp had been taken to the cure international hospital so wilson loaded up his team went to see what they could find out the decision proved to be a colossal mistake angry relatives and locals had congregated at the hospital where many of the dead and wounded police officers had been taken wilson and his people were pelted with rocks and garbage as they entered the hospital only to find out that rapp wasnt there they wasted two additional hours at the hospital waiting for a military escort to take them back to the embassy by then wilson had heard bits and pieces of what had happened to rapp and his men apparently a corrupt police commander had ordered the attack wilson had his own priorities to deal with but this also sounded like an area he might have to look into after returning to the embassy wilson learned that director kennedy was in the country wilson became irate over their squandered opportunity kennedy could easily insert herself between wilson and her people making his investigation nearly impossible the liaison came to wilson for a second time claiming to know where rapp was wilson told him if was wrong this time he would find the worst posting the fbi had and he would make sure he was sent there the team went back to the kabul airport and was ferried by helicopter up to the bagram air base landing at the base was uneventful as they were met by another contingent of fbi special agents who were assigned to the base wilson was pleased to see the stress that his visit had induced hed learned from the past that transported to the base hospital and that was where the real problems started the nearly insurmountable obstacle came in the form of a little fivefoottall latino air force sergeant who for reasons that wilson could not grasp had decided to become his archenemy it started out simple enough the fuzzy liaison from the embassy inquiring at the main desk about a patient named mitch rapp the young man sitting behind the desk had two chevrons and a star wilson had no idea what rank that was but he assumed it was very low because the enlisted person in question had bad acne the airman first class was a lawabiding extremely patriotic twentyoneyearold from kansas who didnt have it in him to challenge authority so he simply gave them directions to the ward where rapp could be found it was at that second desk where wilson ran into immovable air force command master sergeant sheila sanchezall four feet eleven inches of her in hindsight wilson realized that his tactics had been wrong something not easy for him to admit his fiveperson entourage had grown to nine special agents by the time theyd arrived at the hospital these wards were filled with young men and women whod had their bodies mangled in the most awful ways typically from explosions that meant that the people who cared for them conducted themselves almost as if they were cloistered nuns who had taken a vow of silence so the mob of agents stumbled upon the ward that among other things handled head trauma the badges came out and wilson was both too loud and too firm about what he wanted the women behind the desk grew horrified as the male agents began looking in open doors to see if they could identify rapp upon hearing the disturbance sheila sanchez quickly removed her reading glasses spun her chair away from her computer and waddled at double pace out of her office and into the hallway sanchez ran her ward with an iron fist the patients came first and the patients on this particular floor needed a great deal of rest which required peace and quiet as she was the highestranking noncommissioned officer on the floor even the doctors gave her a wide swath it wasnt that they feared sanchez so much as that the woman knew what she was doing so the officers let her call the shots everywhere except the operating room sanchez had seen it all in her time on the base presidents vice presidents cabinet members generals from every service admirals rock stars movie stars and comedians they all came with their entourages and even though they meant well they were all a pain in the ass sanchez had made it very clear to the people down at the front desk that when these groups came through they were not to be sent to her floor send them to see the patients with broken bones and bullet holes but leave her head trauma patients the hell alone the first thing she did was draw the index finger of her left hand up in front of her mouth and shush the entire group of men having silenced the crowd she headed for a man who had made it around the desk and had pushed his head into one of the rooms the agent caught in nomansland didnt know what to do so he stood there frozen in the doorway sanchez swatted him in the ass as if he were a threeyearold boy who had just run out in the street when the agent turned to protest sanchez grabbed him by the tie and yanked him down the hall and back to the area on the other side of the desk keeping her voice down but her intensity extremely high sanchez hissed do you people think youre at the zoo my patients are just animals you can just walk in here loud as hell and start poking around wilson stepped forward with a scowl on his face and his credentials in his left hand listen here lady were here on official fbi business i need to speak to one of your patients and i need to speak to him right now lady the word flew out of sanchezs round little mouth like a counter punch you see this here she swung her left shoulder around so wilson had a clear view its not lady its command master sergeant sanchez wilson still didnt get it he rolled his eyes and said i dont have time for this i am running a very important investigation get out of my way or or youll what sanchez stepped forward and poked wilson at the base of his sternum right above his solar plexus wilson retreated two quick steps and brought his hand up in case she tried again you just assaulted a federal agent then arrest me you big pussy im not going to warn you again without turning sanchez called to one of the nurses amanda get base security up here right now listen la wilson almost said lady but stopped himself and then noticed the name tag on this crazy womans ample breast ms sanchez this is a federal facility we work for the fbi we have jurisdiction over this base the hell you do sanchez laughed in his face and its command master sergeant sanchez special agent dumb ass or whatever your name is i have been in this mans united states air force for thirty years and i know every regulation from top to bottom did you check in with usaf security forces when you came on base she paused a beat to see if he could muster an answer which he couldnt of course you didnt are you working with the usaf office of special investigations wilson knew he was in trouble and managed to look at one of the special agents who was assigned to the base to see if he could offer a little assistance the man shrugged and shook his head command master sergeant sanchez i run the counterintelligence division at the fbi this is a national security issue and if you dont step aside im going to have to have you arrested sanchez raised her fist again as if she might strike him i cant seem to get it through your thick headyou are not in charge here i am i am a federal i dont give a rats ass who you are you are not authorized to be on my floor but but nothing youve got two strikes and that means you only have one more chance here comes the third pitch and my guess is youre gonna whiff on this one just like the first two sanchez held up the stubby index finger on her right hand started with the first man on her left and then continued around to her right saying do any of you have a warrant issued from a federal judge that specifically states that you can bully your way into an intensive care unit on this particular united states air base she continued her sweep looking each man in the eye for a second time when she made it back to wilson she said i didnt think so she stepped forward shooing the herd of men toward the staircase so get the hell off my floor right now and dont you dare come back until you have that warrant chapter jalalabad afghanistan kassar attempted to remain calm as he studied the twentythreeinch color monitor the hostage was limp his arms stretched above his head his knees buckled the two dimwitted interrogators trying to figure out what to do kassar looked calm but inside his stomach was turning flips if he botched this in any way he might as well put a bullet in his own head and save himself from the misguided hope that they might let him live after calming himself with a few deep breaths he pushed himself away from the table and grabbed his mask before entering the room he pulled it down to make sure none of his face was showing the door opened to reveal the two fools checking rickman for a pulse they had pulled their masks up so they fit like winter caps they looked like a couple of common criminals in a hollywood movie kassar filed past the camera and went straight to the extremely valuable rickman he shooed the other two men away and checked rickmans neck he spent almost a minute searching for a pulse two separate times he thought he felt a weak pulse but then he lost it next he tried the wrist and there was nothing his anxiety growing with each passing second kassar finally placed his ear over rickmans heart again there was nothing kassar stepped away from the lifeless rickman and looked at his men the two simpletons couldnt have looked more ashamed he was doing fine the doctor said he could take more we didnt hit him that hard the shorter one said kassar was more nervous than angry i forbade you two from killing him yet thats exactly what you did we are sorry not as sorry as i am kassar turned to leave and while facing the camera he drew his pistol from under his tunic a long silencer was attached to the end kassar stepped to the side and spun around facing the men i told you i would kill you if anything happened to him im sorry the bigger one said in a pleading tone kassar squeezed the trigger five times in quick succession and then turned the weapon on the other man who was cowering with his hands over his face kassar was amused that this idiot thought covering his face could somehow stop a bullet kassar placed the tip of the silencer against the mans palms and started pulling the trigger he didnt bother to count this time he let his rage flow when the pistol was empty kassar turned to face the camera they could still make it look as if rickman was alive at least for a while all they had to do was release some propaganda on the internet showing rickman when he started to break the americans would fear the worst kassar kept telling himself that it would work hed been telling himself the same thing for days even though he had his doubts he would have to move quickly though or all would be lost kassar swung his empty pistol at the camera knocking it to the floor the camera broke into several pieces the red light blinking several times and then going out kassar stuffed his pistol back in his waistband and yanked off the stifling black hood he walked from one wall to the last man the other and back going over what had to be done with his nerves calmed just enough to carry on he approached rickman and with a knife cut the rope that was holding him up kassar caught the body over his left shoulder and after moving him around a bit he had him balanced just right the stench of urine and feces was awful kassar almost retched twice before he even got him out of the room he stopped in the next room and closed and unhooked the laptop that had recorded all the sessions he then started up the stairs and again almost vomited kassar was about to lay rickman on the floor and then he thought of the long drive ahead there was no way he could stand the smell and if he was stopped by the police or border agents the smell alone might cause them to search the vehicle so instead of tossing him on the floor kassar carried him down the hall to the back of the house and laid the body in the bathtub he checked his watch and wondered how much time he could spare he decided ten minutes wouldnt make a difference kassar turned on the water and used his knife to cut rickmans foulsmelling boxers from his body once the underwear was disposed of it was relatively easy a little bit of soap and a washcloth and the body was clean enough for the journey kassar dried rickman as best he could and then carried him to the bedroom where he dressed him in some loosefitting clothes the only problem they had now was the bloody and battered face kassar would lay him in the backseat and cover him with a blanket if he were stopped he would tell them that he was bringing his brother home to be buried in the west it might have seemed strange but here in afghanistan morticians were not so common kassar had to take care of one more thing he sat down on the edge of the bed and opened the laptop his fingers glided over the track pad until he had what he wanted he had edited the video earlier in the day rickman had spoken a few lies but he had also given up some valuable secrets the americans would lose their minds when they saw this kassar was smiling as he posted the video on a popular jihadist website like a pebble in a lake the video would ripple across the world wide web there was no way the americans could hope to contain it chapter bagram air base afghanistan wilson was back down in front of the main desk and the pimplefaced airman was trying to figure out how some uneducated latino woman could deter nine special agents of the federal bureau of investigation from doing their job the only reason he wasnt yelling at his overpaid overqualified entourage was that hed been unable to get past her as well and he was in charge wilson hadnt gotten to where he was in this world by simply quit ting every time an obstacle was placed in front of him no joel wilson was better than that if this air force bitch thought she could defy his authority she was in for a rude lesson tapping the reception counter with his knuckles he demanded whos in charge of this place im sorry sir youll have to be more specific this place wilson repeated and waved his arms around this further cemented wilsons belief that the military had become the great dumping ground for americas dimwitted masses brigadier general earl kreitzer sir wilson filed that one away what about this hospital overall is colonel wyman sir hes the task force medical commander but lieutenant colonel brunkhorst is the medical chief of staff are either of them here right now lieutenant colonel brunkhorst is sir may i ask what this is about the man snatched the handset out of the cradle shes going to want to know its about that rude woman you have in icu something something sergeant sanchez the eyes on the young man from kansas grew large with recognition and he placed the handset back in its cradle command master sergeant sanchez thats right the kansan looked over both shoulders technically sir lieutenant colonel brunkhorst is senior in the chain of command but truth be told command master sergeant sanchez runs this place shit wilson slapped his hand on countertop i hope you didnt do anything to upset her sir then he leaned forward and whispered shes not someone you want to get on the wrong side of no shit sherlock wilson was on the verge of really losing it when the most surprising sight caught his eye coming down the hall toward him was one of his former fbi special agents sydney hayek they had a deeply complicated relationship that hayek had ruined according to wilsons very credible information she was now working for the cia wilson stepped away from the desk sydney he shouted with a friendly wave youre the last person i expected to find here hayek normally good at masking her emotions was incapable of doing so joel wilson was the sole reason she had decided to leave the fbi why are you here wilson flashed the boyish grin that he was so proud of im the one asking the questions around here he reached out to touch her shoulder but she took a quick step back wilson tried to cover and said you look good hayek crossed her arms her eyes glancing at the men behind wilson why are you here well its good to see you as well sydney wilson said in an easy tone its too bad i had to fly to the other side of the planet to run into you do you have time to grab a cup of coffee there was no answer hayek couldnt process what she was hearing standing before her was a man who had tried to destroy her life a man who had sexually harassed her and made her actually contemplate suicide he knew all these things yet here he was standing in front of her acting as if they were old friends were not going to have coffee hayek said remembering how her therapist had told her she needed to be firm and unambiguous thats too bad because i could really use your help on something i hear youre out at langley these days what i do is classified none of your business wilson laughed heartily you must not be aware of my new job at the bureau im running the counterintelligence division you know who watches the watchers and all that stuff hayek shrugged in an effort to convey what she was thinking which was i dont give a shit what you do wilson leaned forward and with a suave smile said so your business actually is my business hayek wanted to crawl out of her skin she took a step to the side and said i need to be someplace right now two steps later he grabbed her arm slow down there missy hayek pivoted and came back at wilson with her left fist cocked take your damn hands off me wilson let go and put his hands up in the air you need to calm down striking a federal agent will land your pretty little ass in jail how about sexually harassing a federal agent and stalking her after having kept it pent up for years and thinking she was free from this imbalanced egomaniac she could no longer keep her feelings bottled up wilson had handled her before and he could handle her now i see that arab temper of yours hasnt gotten any better im half lebanese half american you arrogant wasp under his breath but loud enough for several of them to hear he said hell hath no furylike a spurned woman is that what you tell yourself you think stalking your subordinate and making up fake excuses to be alone with me and me shutting down your perverted attempts at getting me into bed somehow adds up to me wanting you hayek had been over and over all of this in therapy with dr lewis the cias resident shrink hayek had been raised in a culture in which she was a disappointment her father a lebanese immigrant had wanted her to be nothing more than a nurse women had their place in this world and it didnt involve a gun a badge and chasing down bad guys he wanted to marry off his beautiful daughter at eighteen to one of his friends sons it was all arranged she was supposed to begin providing grandchildren immediately without her knowledge a date had already been set at st marons church hayek a gifted student had caught the eye of her high schools guidance counselor by the time her father announced his grand plans hayek had already been notified that she had not only been accepted to the university of chicago but she was going on a full ride her entire world fell apart in just a few days she defied her father and he in turn threw her out on the street in a classic iwillshowyou showdown neither hayek nor her father backed down the years ticked by and the distance grew and hayek found out she could survive without her family her classmates at the university of chicago became her new family and the fbi became her life hayek became a force of independence promising herself that she would never be a victim that she would never allow a man to dictate her life she had done just fine until the deceitful and manipulative joel wilson came along during the seemingly neverending therapy sessions dr lewis helped her see that she had built up some very unhealthy coping mechanisms the most obvious was that she rarely let her feelings be known she simply put her head down kept her complaints to herself and moved forward when wilson began twisting her into knots her silence only made things worse well theres not going to be any more silence she told herself id hoped you got some help after you washed out of the bureau but it doesnt look like it you asshole no one can manipulate the facts like you hayek turned back toward the other men some dressed in dark suits others in more casual base attire do any of you actually like working with this jerk they all stared at her stonefaced well dont trust him never not for a second because you dont mean a thing to him you see hes the only honorable man in all of dc that means all of you are expendable thats enough a redfaced wilson snapped your psychological issues aside im here in an official capacity and you are going to answer some questions pound sand asshole you want to talk to me you call my lawyer and set it up wilson grinned you already have a lawyer you must have something to hide hayek had said her piece she was shaking from the release of all the things that she should have said years ago lets hear it hayek said forcefully for all to hear ask your questions lets go wilson wasnt quite ready for this level of vitriol in his mind he had been nothing but supportive of hayeks career they were two extremely attractive people and it seemed natural for them to indulge in a physical relationship in his mind at least he was in an open marriage nice try this is a highly classified investigation why dont you take a ride with us and well discuss what in the hell is going on here the icy voice cut through the air it wasnt loud or forceful but it had a tone of absolute authority wilson watched his sea of agents part to reveal cia director irene kennedy and a group of men who made his gaggle of fbi agents look like a bunch of pussies her security detail looked a bunch of mixed martial arts fighters carrying machine guns and lots of ammunition director wilson said trying to sound calm youre just the person i wanted to talk to kennedy stood her ground like a predator trying to decide if this was worth the physical exertion after an uncomfortable silence she said i find that hard to believe whats that wilson said casually that you wanted to talk to me come now director i always enjoy catching up with you how could i be just the person you wanted to talk to when you didnt even know i was here wilson smiled awkwardly while he tried to come up with an answer kennedy was no fool its not every day the director of the cia lands in bagram word travels quickly on these bases kennedy appraised him with cautious eyes she didnt believe him for a second i think its far more rare to have the fbis acting head of counterintelligence so far from home we go where we must normally kennedy would have been more diplomatic but with one of her men dead two missing a fourth in the hospital and the entire afghani government screaming for blood she was in no mood for whatever wilson was up to so she cut to the heart of the matter what did you want to question agent hayek about wilson hesitated for a second im sorry but im not at liberty to discuss matters pertaining to an ongoing investigation you think so kennedy said taking two steps forward i want you to think long and hard about how you answer this next question are you aware of the protocols you are to follow if you want to question one of my people of course i am so you went through all the proper channels agent hayek and i go way back wilson said as if the entire thing was being blown out of proportion it was going to be simple offtherecord discussion kennedy nodded slowly and then walked across the lobby until she was just two feet from wilson she gestured with her finger for him to come closer so they could speak in confidence wilson bent forward at the waist and offered kennedy his left ear i am well aware of your history with agent hayek stay the hell away from her or i will make your life miserable in ways you cant even begin to imagine kennedy took a step back and in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear said now in the future special agent wilson if you would like to conduct an interview with any of my people you will contact my office to coordinate are we clear before wilson could answer a shrill voice carried down the hallway like a klaxon what in the hell is going on here wilson looked over his shoulder to see the ballbusting latino waddling her way toward them his face went slack shaking her finger at wilson she said you better have that warrant we talked about or i swear to god im not just going to have you thrown out of this hospital im going to have you thrown off this base wilson had had enough altercations for the day and he really didnt want to stick around and answer more of kennedys questions sorry about the miscommunication director ill be in contact with your office not waiting for a reply he brushed past kennedy and out the door kennedy watched with more than a bit of confusion the blustering joel wilson was known for seeking out confrontation not running from it she looked back to a very upset command master sergeant sanchez who was still making her way down the hall kennedy had spoken with sanchez earlier and the woman had been very helpful in regard to rapps care command master sergeant sanchez what was that you said about a warrant sanchez was out of breath and flushed she held a finger up to kennedy and said excuse me one second she turned to the young airman behind the desk and said get base security on the horn i want to speak to colonel depuglio asap and if hes not available get me major callahan youd think we were running a damn zoo here turning back to kennedy sanchez took a heavy breath and said im sorry director what did you want that man who just left did you say something about a warrant she nodded vigorously he was trying to bully his way in to see your man mr cox part of some official investigation he said all full of himself sanchez was still talking but kennedy was only half listening she had the ominous feeling that someone out there or more likely an organization had gone to great lengths to cripple the clandestine service too many seemingly random things were beginning to pile upfar too many to be a coincidence wilson would be easy enough to play the man had an infatuation with himself and by extension a need to validate himself by tearing down those who were not part of the counterintelligence division unfortunately the cia was the perfect target for him and wilson had a reputation for tenacity he would dig until he got what he wanted and he wouldnt play fair kennedy decided then and there that she was going to need to get proactive chapter kennedy asked sanchez if wilson had gotten in to see rapp and if so what he want sanchez retold the events in her colorful clipped military diction and made it very clear that she wasnt going to let that clown get anywhere near any of her patients mr cox was safe sanchez assured kennedy kennedy wondered if she should suggest placing a guard outside rapps door but thought better of it sanchez was likely to take that as an indictment that she couldnt do her job a better angle was to bring sanchez into her confidence asking her for a word in private kennedy followed sanchez down the hall about twenty feet and then said i need to be very careful about what i say since this is all very classified material but i get the sense i can trust you sanchez nodded as if to say youre damn right mr cox is one of my top covert operatives he was working on something very sensitive another one of my people has gone missing and we need to find him asap i think mr cox might have some information that could help us but unfortunately his memory is very spotty at the moment sanchez nodded doctors told me they dont expect that to last every day hell remember more and more kennedy smiled and when he does i need someone there with your permission i would like to have one of my people at his bedside twentyfourseven sanchez frowned it was obvious she didnt like the sound of this if at any point you think someone is misbehaving by all means you can throw them off your floor but i can assure you command master sergeant like you i run a tight ship my people will be as quiet as church mice after considerable thought sanchez relented kennedy thanked her for all of her help and handed her a card thats my mobile number i always have it if you need me for anything please call and if that man from the fbi shows up again please call i will have him dealt with when sanchez was gone kennedy turned to her assistant eugene please get samuel hargrave on the line and tell him it is extremely urgent paranoia was part of her business sometimes it was a big part and other times not so much as discomforting as it was you were a fool to ignore it the key was to make sure it didnt paralyze you after nearly three decades in the intelligence business kennedy had learned to recognize the natural rhythms of the job the pace usually glacial was often interrupted by moments of extreme actionlike right now this one felt different though it was too orchestrated her mentor thomas stansfield had taught her to think in broad strategic termslike a battlefield commander your flanks must always be protected and your center must be anchored with reinforcements supplies needed to be secured from raids and scouts needed to be deployed as aggressively as possible to discern the strength and position of the enemy the problem right now was that kennedy was flying blind some the last man one was maneuvering against her and she had no idea who they were or what their next move would be rickman hubbard the attack on rapp and now wilson showing up she had an unnerving suspicion that they were all part of a concerted effort to weaken her clandestine service she and her people could draw up a list of who would benefit most from this type of action but it would only be a list kennedy wanted something more concrete and she thought she knew where to start mike kennedy said to nash she motioned for him to follow her and the two walked to the far corner of the lobby where is marcus virginia as far as i know nash thought about their extremely quirky computer hacker despite all of the protocols they put in place the man could be unnervingly difficult to track down find him and bring in your best people i want to know what joel wilson is up to nashs face turned pensive are you sure this is a good idea if anything goes wrong nash shuddered at the thought of the fbi finding out they were spying on them kennedy remained stoic nash was one of her top people but he was increasingly becoming the type of person who was followed by dark storm clouds in other words he spent too much time worrying about the downside of everything this had been rapps chief complaint of late mike kennedy said in a firm tone were flying blind and it looks like someone has launched an operation aimed at crippling the clandestine service sitting around is not an option get your people spun up in two hours i want to hear how you are going to penetrate joel wilsons group and i want to start seeing results in the next twentyfour hours what about hargrave hes wilsons boss you two have a good relationship maybe he can tell us whats going on kennedy exhaled sharply and gave nash a look that said her patience was gone do you honestly think that i havent already thought of that no i just im trying to make sure we dont make a mistake well regret kennedy had heard enough mitch is laid up and i dont know when im going to get him back and stan has just been told he has a few months to live youre the next guy on my bench i need you to execute for me not question my orders nash didnt like being shut down like this and his face showed it the fact that he couldnt simply suck it up and follow an order was the breaking point for kennedy forget it she said ill find someone else to handle it not waiting for a response she left him in the corner and motioned for scott coleman to follow her she repeated the orders to coleman who received them without protest after kennedy was done explaining what she wanted coleman had a better idea the guys right here on base ill put him under surveillance starting now and see what i can find out and call marcus first thing ill do anything else kennedy thought about it for a second while she looked back down the hall at mike nash who seemed to be pouting for the first time she understood hurley and rapps recent frustrations with the man when this was over she was going to have to assess his role moving forward turning back to coleman she said thats all for now let me know the second you find anything chapter the image of a bloodied and battered joe rickman was all over the internet thanks to an alert analyst in the cias ops center kennedy was spared having to learn the information from al jazeera the analyst who was working the night shift was surfing her way through a series of hardcore jihadist web sites when she stumbled across the video ten minutes later she had a voice match on rickman and the alert went out for reasons kennedy could never quite understand bagram and kabul were eight hours and thirty minutes ahead of dc not eight hours or nine hours the thirty minutes threw her off so when her eugene told her that it was in dc took her a second to run the calculationit was am in bagram eugene handed kennedy the secure phone and she sat up in bed its brad he informed her kennedy rubbed the sleep from her eyes said im here brad whats up irene its not good kennedy was billeted in one of the bases vip trailers she motioned for eugene to turn on the tv im listening its rick its all over the internet kennedy felt a lump in her throat as she assumed the worst is he alive barely his face is unrecognizable we had to do a voice analysis to make sure it was him but youre sure its him one hundred percent kennedy heard the stress in her deputy directors voice brad stofer had been in his new job for just eight months but he had been at langley for twentysix years he was a pro and if he was bothered by what he had seen it meant it wasnt good kennedy also knew that voiceprints rarely came back with a percent match she feared the worst describe it to me its four minutes and thirtyseven seconds long its heavily edited his arms are tied above his head looks like hes hanging from the ceiling they were smart enough to cover the walls with sheets two men handle the interrogation it starts out with a lot of head slaps and then they bring out the rubber hoses hes a bloody mess by the end of it there was a long pause and then stofer added its fucking horrible kennedy started to think about what rickman was going through and then she got a grip on her emotions now was not the time to lose it what does he say the audio isnt great but our people say they can clean it up we should have a good copy in the next thirty minutes ill get it to you as soon as its ready brad kennedy said in a slightly impatient voice how bad is the damage bad some names are thrown around which ones five of our people in afghanistan the two cabinet members the general the head of intel and the president the afghanistan assets were the least of her concerns the accusations were already out there the people expected it what else he mentions how much were paying them and were pretty sure he names the bank in switzerland where we keep their money for them well know more when the audio gets cleaned up what else she knew there had to be more he mentions nawaz gillani yep kennedy thought of the pakistani foreign minister who had been their best window in the decisionmaking process of their hotandcold ally trying to pull him out would be impossible does he know yes hes going to sit it out i think hes betting on indefinite house arrest kennedy wasnt so sure but there wasnt much she could do about it what else theres a spot on the tape where it sounds like he says sitting bull kennedy threw off the covers and stood sitting bull was the code name for their highly placed mole in russias foreign intelligence service does he say anything other than the name no he blurts it out in the middle of one of the beatings send me the current version i need to see this for myself its on its way what do you want to do about sitting bull kennedy was holding a fistful of her hair she had on a modest pair of gray pajama pants with a matching longsleeved top eugene was in a pair of boxers and a tshirt he wasnt doing any good standing there so she covered the phone and said wake everybody up get the coffee going and tell them we have a meeting in twenty minutes she watched eugene leave and looked at al jazeera on the tv so far there was nothing but that wouldnt last a cia clandestine service operative being tortured was their bread and butter give me a second she told stofer the damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of rickmans abduction hadnt come anywhere near sitting bull get our people to take a fresh look at this i want to know how in the hell rick even knew about sitting bull as far as i know he wasnt read in on him get his handlers in tonight and find out if one of them happened to casually mention it to rick and if no one fesses up hook em all up and polly them so we leave him where he is i need to think about that sitting bull was their best source in the russian government by a long shot she needed to be certain before she gave the order to bring him in put an extraction team on standby find out if he has any reason to travel in the next twentyfour hours if we can meet him on neutral ground we can have a sitdown and he can decide but i dont want anyone telling him until we know for certain am i clear yes any thing else those are the major points he mentions hubbard and sickles and a few other people but other than hubbard everyone is secure all right kennedy let out a huge sigh as she tried to digest the scope of the problem give me twenty minutes and ill call you back kennedy ended the call and turned on her laptop she used the bathroom and brushed her teeth while she waited for the encrypted file to download when she came back out she sat on the edge of the bed and hit play her job required a good deal of detachment but there was no way to remain detached from this she winced with each blow felt rickmans pain wanted to scream along with him but knew she had to keep it together by the end of the tape she was on the verge of throwing the laptop against the wall instead she bit her fist and let loose a silent scream tears streaming down her cheeks she closed the laptop and went back into the bathroom to collect herself in a matter of minutes she would be watching this in a room with as many as eight of her people she needed to keep it together emotions would only cloud her judgment she was going to have to make some very difficult decisions and her people needed to see that they were coming from a spy boss not some blubbering mother chapter cal patterson was about to shit a brick hed busted his ass at holy cross playing football and graduating with honors and an accounting degree three years later he had a law degree from the university of virginia and a job with the fbi hed made all the right moves done everything his uncle had told him to do his uncle had put in thirtyfive years with the fbi and patterson idolized him during pattersons first two years he worked seventyhour weeks and volunteered for everything that was dangled in front of him and then some his bosses loved him and he was rewarded with an assignment to the counterintelligence division even his uncle was impressed now after just twentynine days in his new job his entire career was hanging in the lurch patterson was all screwed up from the time change and couldnt sleep so he rose early put on his workout gear and headed to the bases fitness center patterson was pleased to find out that the facility was nicer than anything the bureau had he was in the middle of a fivemile run on the treadmill when he saw the screen on his phone light up with the words private number patterson smacked the pause button and yanked out his earbuds private number usually meant wilson or someone in their group hello he said a little out of breath special agent patterson speaking this is executive assistant director hargrave would you like to tell me just where in the hell agent wilson is ah i assume hes sleeping sir patterson knew exactly who hargrave was as he had just brought wilson by his house before they left for afghanistan any idea why hes not answering his phone probably because hes sleeping sir patterson regretted the answer immediately agent patterson who do you work for the fbi sir thats correct and who does special agent wilson work for the fbi sir thats correct we dont turn our phones off ever do you understand me young man i do sir do you like your job ahhhh yes i do sir very much sir well let me give you a little advice if you want to keep working for the fbi you are going to follow my instructions to the letter do you know where agent wilson is right now i think hes sleeping sir and where are you im at the gym well you are going to go wake his insubordinate ass up and you are going to call me back and put him on the phone have i made myself clear patterson stepped off the treadmill crystal clear sir if i dont hear back from you in ten minutes your career is over sir what i need your number ill text it to you call me back in ten minutes patterson was about to respond but the line went dead he noted the time on his watch and stuffed his phone and his earbuds in the zippered pockets of his running shorts he grabbed his sweatshirt and started running the trailer where wilson was sleeping was only two minutes from where he was but patterson wasnt about to take any chances it was getting light outside as he broke into a near sprint people were already out doing their morning pt and patterson got more than a few strange looks as he blew down the street as if he was running for his life which he basically was there was a moment of near panic when he couldnt locate the specific trailer they all looked alike on his second try he found the right place and as he burst through the door he found one of his fellow agents drinking coffee and staring at his ipad wheres wilson the agent pointed with his coffee mug toward the back of the trailer sleeping patterson pulled out his phone and was relieved to see the text from hargrave he tapped the number as he moved down the hallway passing the smaller bedrooms on his left and right he was tempted to knock on the door but when he heard hargrave answer he decided not to stop he flung the door open and marched right to the bedside wilson looked up dazed and confused by the light spilling in from the hallway here he is sir patterson placed the phone in front of wilsons face and said its an emergency wilson took the phone and said hello i have been trying to call you for the past sixteen hours shit wilson said to himself hargrave was the last person he wanted to talk to ah sorry but ive been a little preoccupied wilson rolled onto his side and looked at his watch what do you need i need you to follow through on your promises remember a few days ago when you woke me up in the middle of the night to get permission to go on this little excursion of yours do you remember what you promised me not really wilson yawned youre going to have to cut me some slack this time change has me a little off you woke me up have you been asleep for sixteen hours because thats how long ive been trying to get hold of you no its just that things have been kind of complicated since we landed listen why dont i call you back in thirty minutes and give you a briefing youll do no such thing before you left we agreed that you would call me every day and give me a progress report you have not called me once i received a call from director kennedy she wanted to know why in the midst of the extremely serious problems shes trying to deal with you decide to show up and start questioning her people sir theres a reason for that stop talking i get the feeling every time i hear your voice youre lying to me i need you to listen and listen carefully because you decided not to return my calls i was not able to return director kennedys calls she is so incensed by your poor timing and selfimportant behavior that she decided to go over my head call our boss the director of the fbi remember him as the old saying in this town goes shit rolls downhill i was attempting to enjoy a nice evening with my wife when the director called me and asked me if id lost my mind i had a sneaky suspicion it involved you and your asinine behavior and the director confirmed those suspicions director kennedy told him about some stunt you pulled at the base hospital trying to bully your way onto the icu so you could interrogate one of her people who had barely escaped an assassination attempt wilson was standing now i did not try to bully my way dont speak im not done talking before you left i told you how i expected you to behave i explained to the director the scope of your investigation that you told me that you were going to be there to offer assistance in finding rickman and if along the way you saw that any laws had been broken you would consult me before moving the investigation in a new direction you lied to me i did not you sure as hell did and thats how the director sees it as well what i cant figure out is how you thought you were going to get away with this you already have a reputation as a duplicitous bastard people are watching you and your timing is awful by the way the cia is in the middle of a shitstorm and you show up and start poking them with a stick do have any idea the respect that irene kennedy garners in this town i think a better word is fear youre a fool and im wasting my time trying to help you the director wants you back here immediately and just so you have something to think about on your long flight it looks like hes going to order an official inquiry into just what in the hell youve been up to wilson had already been through one of those and it had almost killed his career he doubted he would survive a second one sir youre making a big mistake the only mistake i made was letting you go in the first place thats not true sir there are some things you dont know by all means please enlighten me and keep in mind ive learned my lesson with you this call is being recorded so dont think you can sell me another pile of lies and then feign ignorance later wilson was thinking as fast as he could trying to find a way to give hargrave as little information as possible and still convince him that he should be allowed to not only stay in afghanistan but also increase the scope of the investigation i have reason to believe that joe rickman and mitch rapp have been stealing millions of dollars from the us government hargrave laughed at him reason to believe thats the best you can do joel sir youre going to have to trust me on this i am going to have to do no such thing you have burned your way through all the trust i have you have precisely one minute to convince me that you deserve the latitude to go digging around one of our countrys most secretive institutions wilson saw no other choice i have the account numbers the amounts when the transfers were made and a sworn affidavit from the banker who says mitch rapp came into his bank and set up the account wheres the bank zurich and how long have you had this information in truth wilson had possessed the information for eighteen days but telling hargrave that in his present state of mind would do him no good about two weeks there was a long silence and then youve had this information for two weeks and you didnt bring it to me i wanted to make sure it was real before i brought it to you and just how did you come to possess this information wilson knew how this was going to sound but he also knew that sooner rather than later he would have to present a chain of evidence if there were any inconsistencies the former judge would eat him alive the information was provided by an anonymous source good god hargrave yelled how long have you worked in counterintelligence do you have any idea how many times the russians alone have tried to turn us against ourselves with this little trick i am well aware sir thats why i followed up and met with the banker and youve fully vetted this banker you know for a fact that hes not a foreign asset im in the process of doing that right now sir you dont think you should have done that first the abduction of rickman forced me to move up my timetable so you thought you should lie to me and then jet off to afghanistan so you could ambush rapp do you understand that he was al most killed hes in icu he can barely remember his name how convenient do you have any common sense do you understand that the cia is our sister agency that we are supposed to work together i thought we were supposed to keep them honest sam when the evidence dictates yes but that doesnt mean running off half cocked because of an anonymous tip and by the way how did you receive this anonymous tip i received a package where your house or the office what does it matter answer my question the office postmark zurich and let me guess the lab didnt find any fingerprints or dna or anything that could help us find this anonymous source that doesnt prove anything there was a long sigh of frustration and then youre done pack up your team you have precisely two hours and that jet is going to be in the air and during those two hours you are not to speak to anyone from the cia am i clear oh im reading you loud and clear wilson was sick of being kicked around by this old fool are you still recording our conversation because i want to make sure you get this part i didnt tell you any of this because i cant trust you because the entire counterintelligence division knows that youre too close to director kennedy and based on what ive experienced the last few days im inclined to believe those rumors so you better get ready for your own board of inquiry wilson spun around and whipped pattersons phone against the wall fuck he collapsed on the edge of the bed his head in his hands trying to figure out how everything had gotten all twisted around hargrave was an idiot the clandestine service was filled with crooksrickman rapp and probably dozens of other officers senator ferris had shown him the numbers almost a billion dollars in cash had passed through the clandestine service and into the hands of all of these corrupt warlords drug dealers and politicians the system was rife with corruption and wilson had the evidence to prove it there was only one reason why hargrave would do this and it was to protect kennedy wilson had no choice but to return to dc but he wasnt going to do it quietly senator ferris was no slouch they shared a belief that the cia had been given too much power and not enough oversight after that was going to change once the people found out that these crooks were stealing taxpayer dollars hargrave director miller and all the other assholes would get dragged up to capitol hill and have to explain how they interfered with his investigation and then the senate would clean house after that wilson could write his own ticket and they could all kiss his ass chapter kennedy caught rapps doctor just as he was about to start his morning rounds major nathan was a thirtyfiveyearold neurosurgeon who spent two weeks of every month at bagram and the other two at sloankettering in new york he had a surprisingly affable bedside manner for a brain surgeon good morning major do you have a second to chat i was just heading to see mr cox the major smiled i dont suppose thats his real name in a rare moment of honesty kennedy shook her head i was wondering if you could tell me how hes doing much better according to his recent scars theres been a drastic reduction in swelling do you think hes ready to fly major nathan winced and shook his head these head cases are tricky theyre all unique some patients bounce back after a few days some people never bounce back so he could fly if he had to the major sighed if he absolutely has to yes but id like to give it a few more days kennedy frowned whats the problem i cant really talk about it but lets just say mr cox is extremely good at his job and we need him kennedy wanted him back but she also wanted to put rapp somewhere where joel wilson couldnt get his hands on him the major had immediately recognized kennedy when one of the nurses had brought her into his office the day before she explained politely that his newest patient was one of her top operatives nathan had already guessed that mr cox was no mere analyst it was standard procedure for the staff to cut the clothes off emergency patients since they only got in the way mr cox had no open wounds but nathan counted three bullet holes and a scar that looked like it had come from a knife even the nurses commented his battle scars combined with his rockhard physique made the deduction simple nathan had rotated in and out of bagram for nine straight months he had pretty much seen it all or at least he thought he had mr cox was something of an anomaly nathan understood that kennedy held a unique position if he could he would try to help her why dont we go see how hes doing and then we can reassess they found rapp sitting up in his bed with a tray of food in front of him watching an episode of justified after some brief pleasantries the doctor looked his chart and asked how do you feel this morning mr cox better rapp said moving his head around no headache and ive got my appetite back the doctor scribbled a few notes on the chart thats good hows your memory pretty good rapp pointed at the tv i know that ive seen this episode before and i remember most of the characters dewey crowe boyd crowder raylan givens art mullen and dickie bennett good show nathan asked without looking up i think im the wrong guy to ask doc i really dont have much to compare it to nathan laughed and your recall in general seems like its getting a lot better all right whered you go to college syracuse nathan rattled off the same questions hed given rapp late yesterday mothers maiden name grade school high school childhood best friend and on and on unlike yesterday he got them all correct today nathan decided to expand the list first job out of college rapp gave kennedy a strange look and then told nathan he didnt know current job i think im an assassin rapp watched his doctor look up with wide eyes im just kidding doc i work for the cia and if i tell you any more than that ill have to kill me nathan finished the sentence for him exactly nathan glanced sideways at kennedy is he always this funny kennedy was relieved that he was coming back she smiled and shook her head hes never had much of a sense of humor before rapp could comment nathan asked favorite color blue i think wife kids the smile fell from rapps face and his entire bearing changed he didnt answer for a long time and then he looked at kennedy for help kennedy had been dreading this it was hard enough to live through it once it couldnt be easy learning it for a second time it was obvious from the pained expression on his face that he remembered something about the tragedy your wife kennedy started and then stopped nathan picked up on the mood and nodded for kennedy to continue all memories are important the good ones and the bad ones i remember rapp said his voice almost disembodied her name was anna and she was pregnant kennedy nodded slowly caught up in the story nathan asked how did she die i dont think we want to talk about this right now rapp looked up and said she was murdered im sorry nathan answered softly there was a long silence and then rapp began to frown as if something was occurring to him for the first time what is it nathan asked kennedy thought she knew what it was and she stepped forward i think this is enough for now rapp shook his head as if trying to free a jumbled thought theres a face a man i know but i cant remember his name he has something to do with my wife but i cant make it connect kennedy chastised herself for not consulting with dr lewis thomas lewis was their inhouse psychologist he had worked very closely with rapp over the years and it was likely that he could offer insight about how they should handle this unique situation between rickman hubbard and wilson showing up shed simply forgot to call lewis her fear that rapp would kill gould was not unfounded and she wasnt even sure she would object to it but major nathan had warned them that rapp didnt need any undue stress until he his condition was stabilized there was a knock on the doorframe and she turned to see coleman with a welcome expression the retired seal had blond hair blue eyes and dimples which gave him a boyish look at times this morning however his sharp jaw was set in a way that she had seen many times before he had news that she was waiting for please excuse me for a second kennedy left the room and stepped into the hallway with coleman wilson yep we had both his phones dialed in but he wasnt using them we found out which trailer he was staying in and bugged it while he was at dinner last night im still trying to get my hands on his laptop but no luck so far about thirty minutes ago one of his agents wakes him up and hands him a phone it was hargrave on the line and although its a onesided conversation its pretty obvious wilson is getting his ass handed to him coleman held up his iphone ive got it all right here for you would you like the highlights first please wilson claims to have received an anonymous package at work that contained evidence that rick and mitch were siphoning off cash and putting it into personal accounts in zurich kennedy frowned with rickman it was a possibility but not mitch no way the man had his own money he didnt need to steal cash from langley it sounded like hargrave pressed wilson pretty hard wilson claims to have account numbers dates of transfers and a sworn affidavit from the banker who says mitch came into his bank and set up the account do we know who this banker is not yet but well keep digging theres one more thing wilsons been recalled and he didnt take it well he told hargrave that everyone knows hes too close to you and when hes done proving that rick and mitch were stealing funds hes going to make sure hargrave goes down kennedy was thinking about hargrave sam was a good man trying to manage an ego like wilson was going to drive him to an early grave when is he leaving about two hours from the way theyre talking hes really throwing hargrave under the bus to his people i mean the type of shit that could land his ass in some serious hot water maybe well send an anonymous package of our own i was thinking the same thing any chance you can get your hands on his computer before he leaves coleman thought about it for a second ill try but its unlikely im not worried though marcus can do this shit in his sleep kennedy nodded have marcus start poking around their data base see what he can find out will do both kennedy and coleman looked up to see hayek coming down the hall she was moving at a good clip and as she drew to within a few steps she shook her head and said i screwed up chapter operating in the field always presented a unique set of problems but a good number of them were predictable there was a mark that they were all aware of or at least were supposed to be aware of itseventytwo hours into any crisis the effectiveness of the team dropped off considerably the agency wasnt the only group that had studied the issue every branch of the military looked into the issue with a need to understand combat effectiveness battlefield commanders needed to know how long they could keep a unit in the fight without sleep with food and water and without food and water the fbi cia and any other federal agencies that dealt with crisis or catastrophe all conducted their own studies and they all pretty much found the same thingseventytwo hours was the limit after that your people became almost worthless cognitive skills were drastically reduced hallucination set in and the body began to shut down as with everything of course there were a few exceptions elite warriors like the ones produced by delta force and the seal teams could push beyond the seventytwohour mark in extreme circumstances but not much further they taught their men to grab an hour or two of sleep whenever they couldeven during a prolonged firefight if the manpower was available it was crucial to rotate teams three teams were ideal each one working an eighthour shift but kennedy didnt have that luxury as it was the go team that had been assembled was barely sufficient to operate in two twelvehour shifts and that was to handle the rickman crisis that team was weakened when she pulled people off it to start looking for hubbard then she had to deal with the aftermath of the police shooting and now with the release of rickmans interrogation more of her attention was put into damage control it was no longer just about joe rickman even though it felt like it kennedy knew from the start that it had always been about more than just rickman rickmans brain possessed hundreds of names and those names represented real people who were assets of the cia some of them were americans deepcover operatives who were operating in foreign countries without the aid of diplomatic cover if these people were exposed the likelihood was that theyd be killed and then there were the agentsthe men and women who worked for foreign governments they came in every stripe from politicians to bureaucrats to scientists to financiers to military personnel to intelligence operatives and janitors and secretaries more than any satellite or listening device these men and women were the eyes and ears of the cia they offered snippets of information that when pieced together aided kennedy and her people in understanding the intent of their foes and sometimes when needed the ability to predict their next move these assets were the lifeblood of the cia without them the agency would cease to become an effective intelligence agency if rickman continued to crack kennedy would have no choice but to begin pulling out her network of spies it would take at least a decade to rebuild the network possibly longer despite the urgency kennedy knew what had to be done hayek looked tired they all looked tired they understood what was at stake so they were all eager to prove the doctors wrong and push past the seventytwohour mark kennedy held up her palm and stopped hayeks rambling apology when was the last time you slept the question caught her off guard and she took an unfocused look at nothing and tried to recall the last time shed closed her eyes for more than a few seconds i think i got an hour or two last night kennedy looked at coleman and asked the same question as much as possible ive stuck to a schedule ten on and two off kennedy thought of colemans sixman team starting when from the very beginning i made sure everyone grabbed at least four hours on the flight over he shrugged there wasnt much for us to do until we landed leave it up to the retired seal to maintain discipline in the midst of chaos hed done this countless times kennedy was embarrassed that she hadnt maintained better discipline over the schedules ill be honest coleman said i could use some sleep ive been up for thirtyplus hours straight with everything that went down two days ago and losing reavers that put me down one man and i didnt bother to reshuffle the schedule kennedy placed a hand on his arm but looked at hayek dont be so hard on yourself we were understaffed to start with and then the shootout with the police threw us all for a loop we have another twentysix people due to land in about three hours once theyre in position i dont want anyone working more than a sixteenhour shift scott keep an eye on wilson until hes in the air and then stand down your whole team dont set any alarms just sleep were going to need you at some point and you guys need to be fresh kennedy considered her own schedule for a second shed been able to grab four hours of sleep overnight and all things considered felt pretty good she had a staff meeting in fifteen minutes and then after that the working group back at langley was to give her a full report on the potential extent of the damage that could be caused by the rickman affair then she had a meeting with nadeem ashan from the pakistani intelligence service she liked ashan and hoped that he was here to offer some information and assistance but knowing the isi his motives lay more in selfpreservation this police officer kennedy said to hayek im not sure i understand his relevance coleman answered for hayek we ran into him at the safe house hes one of darrens reintegration projects abdul siraj zahir a real piece of shit long story short he barges into the safe house and starts making threats mitch pulls on him coleman looked quickly over both shoulders to make sure no one else could hear him and then added mitch tells the guy hes going to blow his head off kennedy shook her head ever so slightly and frowned i know it doesnt sound good but when it happened it didnt seem so bad at any rate theres some back and forth and then mitch decides hell let this guy live if he works for us and finds out what happened to rick despite not wanting to coleman decided he needed to give her the full context mitch gave the guy fortyeight hours to come through with some information or he was going to put a fivehundredthousanddollar bounty on the guys head and mitch asked me to put a trace on his phone hayek quickly added langley has been recording his calls and following his moves for the past two days only i forgot about it until about fifteen minutes ago and kennedy asked hes been trying to get hold of mitch hes left him five messages since last night saying basically dont kill me i have some information for you the guy sounds scared well if the guy has information call him hayek shook her head i think mitch needs to make the call if i or anyone else calls hes going to want to renegotiate i agree does mitch even remember the guy i dont know coleman said but i could probably talk him through it kennedy thought about her other problems and wilson i have two people on him all right brief mitch and make the call if anything important comes out of it call me rapp didnt remember zahir at first but after coleman described the mans shoepolishblack beard and his snug grayblue police uniform he got the visual the context of their meeting was a little more complicated the previous night coleman had explained to rapp why they were in afghanistan rapp had only a vague recollection of rickman when coleman explained to rapp how he had threatened the local police commander rapps eyes got big i said that coleman laughed you sure did do i speak this way to people very often when they happen to be coleman said scumbags like zahir the answer is yes it seemed as if each hour rapp was learning more about his past and by association himself he had a basic overview of who he was but the details were always a little shocking it was eerie coming to grips with the stark reality that he had murdered people there were no ohmygodimamonster type moments it was more or less thats who i am i need to keep filling in this puzzle and when its done i can sit back and judge my actions in their totality or not that was the other abnormal thing about this process of getting to know himself again the second time around you saw things that you might have missed on the first go round so i threatened to put a fivehundredk bounty on this guys head yes and you threatened to stick a tomahawk missile up his ass as well grinning coleman added i know it sounds harsh but it couldnt happen to a nicer guy hes a real piece of shit i think you made that pretty clear to him as well so i call him back and find out what he has yes but youre probably going to have to be a bit of a prick do you think youre up to it i dont see why not all right we have him marked in jalalabad coleman looked over hayeks shoulder at the blinking red light hmm what rapp asked it looks like hes just a block away from the safe house he tapped hayek on the shoulder everything ready to go in a second all of rapps clothes had been cut off him when he arrived at the hospital and his personal possessions such as his phones and fake ids and credit cards had been placed in a bag and kept in a storage room it was just another thing that was overlooked in the chaos hayek was now syncing rapps phone via bluetooth to her laptop so they could record and monitor the call when it was ready to go she plugged in two sets of headphones handing one to coleman and keeping the other for herself the numbers already punched in she said as she handed rapp the phone just hit send you said we have people back at langley monitoring all of his calls thats right and if they record me threatening to kill him on the phone coleman jumped in were not the fbi were supposed to threaten people like zahir when were done well make sure all the recordings are erased fine rapp hit send and tried to put himself in the proper mindset chapter jalalabad afghanistan zahir had no formal police training but he was no fool he stroked his thick black beard and looked at the bodies the big man he thought he recognized he was hardcore taliban unlike zahir who was whatever he needed to be to survive this man had stayed faithful when the americans swept in and mopped up the taliban that was the first time zahir had done business with rickman he had shown up in his village on horseback with a dozen bearded fighters and two american warplanes circling overhead like predators by then the news had spread the taliban had collapsed in the face of the american onslaught for zahir an expert at predicting which way the wind would blow the decision was easy as rickman laid it out zahir could either take twentyfive thousand dollars in cash and contribute some fighters to the cause or the navy f hornets circling above would lay his village to waste zahir wasnt even offended it was the easiest decision he had ever made it was made all the more easier knowing that he would likely change sides many times as this war raged on the taliban had run to their haven on the other side of the pakistani border but they would be back zahir liked rickman and respected him he never took it personally when zahirs loyalty wavered he simply looked at it as a challenge to bring zahir back to his side that fool hubbard however was another story he lacked rickmans cunning he had been so easy to push around not like the crazy american from two days ago zahir had tried to find out who he was but his resources were limited and he had a feeling that like so many of these damn cia men he had been given a fake name for the first time in four years sickles had refused to take his calls which was not a good sign then hubbard disappeared which seemed strange since he was last seen at the air base and there was no record of him leaving the base and then there was the big gunfight in kabul twentyone police officers killed in broad daylight by a group of american contractors it had filled the airwaves for two straight days he knew that most of it was inaccurate as zahir had been briefed that general qayem and his men ambushed the americans the general had fled and the afghan national police were reeling from the treachery it was one thing to siphon off funds for your own personal use but to use your men to try and kill americans was madness add to it that twentyone of his own men had been killed and zahir was willing to bet that the reckless general qayem would be moved to the top of the americans mostwanted list it was total chaos why would qayem do such a thing zahir could only hazard a few guesses but it was likely a mix of large amounts of money and promises of more power when the americans left that was the new gameeveryone was gambling on when the americans would pull out and the taliban would come rushing back in zahir wasnt so sure it was that black and white the taliban even at their peak couldnt control the entire country various local factions including warlords and drug dealers had consolidated power and armed themselves with the tools of war zahir was a perfect example plans were in place to move all of his men and the americansupplied equipment back to their villages ammunition and spare parts had been disappearing since the day he put on his uniform and this time would be easier with the fleet of wellmaintained trucks under his command zahir had never doubted that the taliban would be back they were like weeds as much a part of the landscape as the rocks and the trees but zahir understood their power would be limited this time the secret to afghanistan was that anyone could wreak havoc but none could govern the taliban had learned that mistake just as countless others had dating all the way back to alexander the great even with all of the brutality they employed against the people they were struggling to maintain their hold on kabul and other large cities where the people didnt feel like living under absolute sharia law most afghans were willing to live under a more relaxed form of the muslim law but when men from the mountains start beating your wife or daughters because they dont like the color of their hijab resentment and hatred mounts quickly there was one very simple reason zahir would never throw his complete support behind the taliban they had no airpower it was zahirs greatest fear the americans had killed countless men with their unmanned drones and their hightech jets what most people didnt understand was that the americans would never truly leave those drones would always be overhead listening and watching and that was why zahir wanted so badly to give the crazy american some information that would satisfy him the future of afghanistan was uncertain as it always had been alliances would continue to shift but on this particular day zahir was sure of just one thinghe had stumbled upon something that would likely save his life now he just needed the american to call him back when his phone finally rang he was back on the street smoking and relieved he was breathing fresh air the house behind him was a mess the basement so foul he could not last more than a minute breathing the putrid smells the small screen on his phone told him the number was blocked he was both hopeful and nervous this is commander zahir you better have something for me zahir thought he heard the menacing drone of a propeller overhead craning his neck skyward he searched for the telltale speck of gray a layer of high clouds made it impossible he couldnt fight the ominous feeling that the american had him literally in the crosshairs i do zahir started have you seen the tape of mr rick the one that is all over the internet there was a pause and then yes i have found something that you need to see what is it i am pretty sure it is the house where mr rick was being tortured why do you think that zahir turned and looked at the twostory stone house he had one of his people looking into the utility and ownership records there is a room in the basement two of the walls are covered with sheets just like in the video what else a rope attached to the ceiling just like in the video and there is lots of blood on the floor any thing else yes two bodies zahirs pulse quickened this he hoped was what would save his life i am certain they are the two men seen in the video who are beating mr rick there was another awkward silence zahir could barely make out other people talking the men are wearing masks in the video how can you be certain they are still wearing their masks on their heads not covering their faces and theyre dead yes shot many times all right commander youve made a big step in getting your ass out of trouble but youre not all the way there i need you to text me photos of the bodies and room do you think you can do that yes now im looking at a screen that tells me youre close to mr ricks safe house is that right yes very close do you have the house secure yes we have touched nothing good after a long pause the american said send me those photos and then i will call you back in five minutes with instructions yes but i can promise you it is them and i can promise you if youre lying to me or this is some kind of trap youre as good as dead i would never do such a thing really the american said in a disbelieving voice you know general qayem zahir cringed this was the last man he wanted to be compared with yes you heard what happened in kabul the other day with your fellow police officers yes we are all deeply ashamed spare me the bullshit commander i was there they tried to ambush us we lost one man before we even knew we were in a fight after that it was just four of us against all of those cops it didnt turn out so well for them do you know what i mean i think i understand zahir said turning away from one of his officers who was trying to get his attention im not so sure you do the point is thanks to general qayem were a little itchy with our trigger fingers right now and when we come to see you well be traveling with a lot more than four people mr harry zahir said with a sigh i am many things but i am not stupid i know you will hunt down general qayem like a dog and he will pay for his treachery i do not want you as my enemy i do not want the us as my enemy youre saying all the right things abdul which makes me nervous dont fuck with me i will not fuck with you mr harry send me the photos and ill be in contact the line went dead and zahir stared down at his phone cursing the modern technology that enabled the americans to track him theyd known where he was he looked skyward again in search of one of their drones he thought he could hear a faint hum but he couldnt be sure that was another effect of the americans air campaign the psychological stress could be overwhelming the fear that there was a drone circling above out of sight that was tracking your every move was incredibly disruptive add to that the awareness that there was some man in a trailer thousands of miles away following you with targeting crosshairs just waiting for the green light to press a button and end your life zahir had seen it drive men mad and as he continued to search the sky for the predator he understood how easily it could happen chapter bagram air base afghanistan headaches were rare for kennedy shed already had two cups of coffee and popped two excedrin but it didnt matter the nagging buzz in her left temple persisted trying to diagnose why it had come on wouldnt do her any good but it wasnt ashans fault nadeem was a pleasant man who had been a fair partner in the war on terror the same unfortunately couldnt be said of most of his colleagues at the pakistani interservices intelligence maybe that was the reason for this rare headache ashan had picked up on it immediately kennedy had a reputation as unflappable in times of calm or crisis she always maintained her composure the steady demeanor she was known for made her pained expression all the more obvious are you sure you are okay ashan asked kennedy removed her hand from her forehead and although she was wincing in pain said ill be fine she looked around the table and was not comforted by the concerned expressions on both nashs and schneemans faces the two deputies that ashan had brought along seemed unfazed nash leaned over and quietly offered take a break ill handle it until you get back it was a nice offer but one that kennedy wasnt about to take see if you can find me a couple of excedrin or extrastrength tylenol and a bottle of water please she watched nash leave and forced herself to put on a smile she thought ashan might understand the monumental pressure the rickman problem was getting bigger every hour after the posting of the video she had been called by the head of every allied intelligence agency they all wanted to know their level of exposure it was common to share assets especially with the british and although the agreement might only be for one person at the agency to know the identity of their spy say in budapest it was not irrational to wonder if that person had told other colleagues at the cia kennedy assured all of them that rickman had not been read in on any of their assets while technically correct the statement in a more broad sense was false god only knew what rickman had picked up over the years the mans memory was well known he forgot nothing which was a great advantage until he ended up in the hands of the enemy it was very possible that rickman knew the code names and directorates where many of these spies worked he also knew what information had been passed along a skilled interrogation team could take that information and over a month or so reconstruct the damage that had been done and come up with a small list of potential traitors beyond the intelligence heads stofer had called to report that their case officers were getting deluged with extraction requests from their assets men and women from all over europe the middle east and southeast asia who had seen the coverage of the cia clandestine officer breaking under the harsh interrogation they were part of the game in the most real way the pakistani foreign ministers residence was now surrounded by the pakistani army and it was reported that he was under house arrest it was easy enough for these assets to imagine themselves in a similar situation but for nearly all of them it would be much worse they would be dragged from their houses or more likely apartments and thrown into a dark cell where they would be brutalized by men with gorillalike forearms who reeked of cigarettes it might sound a bit melodramatic but for these lonely souls who were on their own the fear was well founded director kennedy ashan said on behalf of the isi i would like to say how sorry we are about mr rickman and if there is anything we can do to help please ask thank you nadeem ive told you before please call me irene of course my apologies i would like to assure you that we are using all of our contacts to find out who was responsible for this and how is that going schneeman asked his skepticism obvious ashan had been hoping to have some piece of information to show that they were trying to cooperate he was secretly hoping that they could lay this at the feet of the taliban but so far there was nothing he did not blame the americans there was no denying the isis involvement in the mumbai massacre the americans had the recordings of the terrorists calling their isi handler in karachi in the midst of the attack ashan reflected on that extremely uncomfortable meeting his colleagues had spent the better part of an hour denying any involvement and then director kennedy put the isi agents photo up on a big screen while she played the audio of the phone call the meeting was held at the cia headquarters in langley virginia durrani was there as well and had the gall to act enraged over the accusation kennedy let him bluster and cry foul play and when he was done with his performance she put more images up on the screen that showed the bank transfers to fund the operation as well as preliminary plans for the operation which included a list of primary and secondary targets the last photo was the most dramatic it showed the isi agent lying in a pool of his own blood with a single bullet hole in his head kennedy calmly turned to durrani and said general id appreciate it if rather than lie in the face of overwhelming evidence you simply kept your mouth shut because the more you protest the more im inclined to think you were directly involved in this their relationship with the cia had been one of fits and starts ashan would get things moving on mutual cooperation and then durrani and others would undermine the hard work of the foreign relations wing over the years they had sat through innumerable meetings with their counterparts at langley and had gotten to know them fairly well each side understood the others rosters of personnelthe power structure of the other who ran which division or department and who outranked whom there were others who did not attend these meetings but were known to the isi by reputation or through surveillance mitch rapp was one of those individuals rapp attended the meeting after the mumbai massacre and although there were no formal introductions they all knew who he was the fact that he sat immediately to kennedys right was in ashans mind a clear message he spoke only once during the meeting it was after kennedys admonishment of durrani and the generals desperate gambit to deflect rather than heed kennedys advice durrani continued to protest his departments innocence and went so far as to say he was offended that kennedy would dare make such accusations that was when they heard rapp speak for the first and last time general i dont attend these meetings because i cant deal with the bullshit im not equipped to sit and listen to someone lie to my face especially someone whos supposed to be an ally were all professionals and we all know whats at stake to a certain degree we will keep things from each other but as allies there are some lines that we should never cross that man up on the screen rapp pointed at the photo of the dead pakistani agent mawaan rana we know he worked for your department and we know he helped fund and train the islamic nut jobs that killed people at that point durrani tried to speak but rapp stopped him general im not asking for you to confirm or deny what i just said i dont need you to because i know it to be a fact not only do we have phone records and financial transactions but your man rana confessed to me that he worked for the external wing and that he was following official orders durrani scoffed at the accusation when did you speak to him rapp stared down the general and said right before i put that bullet in his head rapps words were chilling he didnt speak for the rest of the meeting but he kept his predatory gaze locked on durrani as he was going over in his mind a list of possible ways to kill the man ashan had never seen his friend so upset upon returning to pakistan they pieced enough information together to confirm that rapps claim was not false bravado the message from the americans was clear if you continue to support terrorists in the mass killing of innocent civilians you too might end up with a bullet in your head ashan half expected rapp to be here this morning and was secretly relieved that the assassin was elsewhere irene i can assure you that we are using all of our resources to find out who was behind this brazen attack i appreciate that nadeem you know of course that the taliban is at the top of our list she didnt bother to share rapps insight that the abduction was too precise to have been pulled off by the taliban as you know i have had no dealings with them but i have been promised that the right people are looking into the matter the headache was starting a slow retreat which came as a great relief kennedy considered ashans remarks and then said nadeem you have been a fair partner but there are others in the isi who despite our alliance continue to work against us this has never been acceptable but with the abduction of joe rickman we have now moved into a dangerous new arena if at any point i discover that the isi had any hand in this or that you are protecting the taliban i will be forced to react in a very serious way ashan digested her words and wondered if this was just another threat to cut off the billions of dollars in aid the americans provided every year what type of reprisals are we talking about an eye for an eye nadeem joe rickman was an extremely valuable asset someone has launched a wellcoordinated attack aimed at crippling my clandestine service when i find out who was behind it i will make them pay dearly it might not happen immediately but eventually people will disappear they will pay for this little gambit with their lives and i will make it my goal in life to penetrate that organization and steal everything that is valuable to them and then when im done i will leave behind so much disinformation that it will sow seeds of dissent for decades to come this organization will cease to be effective it will be an organization afraid of its own shadows and dont doubt me for a second nadeem i have the budget the fortitude and the talent to make this happen so you can tell your cohorts like general durrani that this is their last chance i want joe rickman back and i want him back in the next twentyfour hours or this is going to get extremely uncomfortable for everyone chapter jalalabad afghanistan they werent going to take any undue chances this time with any green on blue attacks that was the term that the military used to describe afghan military or police who murdered coalition personnel as the drawdown and eventual pullout neared the problem was getting worse and they all agreed that the best way to avoid it was to move on the house with overwhelming force the predator drone that had been tracking the movements of commander zahir was used to provide realtime imagery of the location and more important they were able to go back and see how zahir and his people deployed to the house nearly two hours ago as far as the joint special operation command planners could tell there were no surprises waiting for them the intel supplied by the drone made it possible for the planners to expedite the mission they coordinated with the quick reaction force from the base in jalalabad a platoon from the seventyfifth ranger regiment first battalion mounted up in eight mraps and rolled out the main gate as the first two assets from bagram lifted into the air two of the big mineresistant vehicles were outfitted with mk automatic grenade launchers two more vehicles had caliber guns on the turret and the remaining four all had remotecontrolled mm miniguns it helped that the folks at jsoc had been running operations on a daily basis for more than a decade many of them rapid deployments there was a certain rhythm the shooters and aircrews slept during the midmorning and into the afternoon while the ground crews made sure the birds were prepped for the evenings missions and there was always another mission in the works the planners in the joint fusion center tasked and retasked ops shuffling the deck based on the input of the dod and agencies like the cia rickman was the top priority incountry so other ops got kicked and the shooters and aircrews were roused early from their slumbers the two apache attack helicopters arrived on station over the target house providing more live tactical imaging five thousand feet above the apaches the command and control bird moved into position now receiving live imaging from both the apaches in the back of the specially equipped black hawk three men from jsoc monitored a bank of consoles after the blocking force rolled into position at each end of the long street the green light was given to the assault force two black hawks came in fast nose on tail and flared up fifty feet above the street they had considered landing but the air boss decided that it was a little too tight so the big black ropes were kicked out two on each side of each chopper the men began to slither down the ropes ten from each chopper moving off with haste to their prearranged positions it took less than thirty seconds and then the aircrews pulled the pins and dropped the thick ropes to the ground if all went well they would be collected later as the first two black hawks climbed into the latemorning air a third black hawk began circling counterclockwise overhead at fifteen hundred feet off the ground two delta force snipers were strapped in hanging out the portside door providing overwatch for the operation each man carried a m xmm sniper rifle with a twentyround magazine in truth the apaches were mainly a show of force in a neighborhood like this the apaches m chain gun mm rockets and hellfire missiles would likely bring about an unacceptable level of collateral damage if anything popped up the snipers flying overwatch would be called on first to deal with the threat two little birds were the last part of the air element they landed without hazard on the street in front of the house a german shepherd and his handler jumped out of the first bird along with two bomb techs lugging their gear out of the second little bird came coleman hayek and rapp rapp and coleman were suited up in full combat gear having learned a very hard lesson only a few days earlier while coleman wore a boonie hat rapps head was covered with an integrated ballistic helmet at the insistence of dr nathan they hadnt bothered to inform kennedy as she was tied up in a highlevel meeting rapp didnt want to raise anyones hopes until they were sure zahir wasnt jerking their chains a quick comparison of the photos zahir had sent compared to the video posted on the internet looked legitimate the trick had been getting major nathan to agree to rapps release the major ran rapp through a series of tests most of them involving balance to the doctors surprise his patient fared very well on the tests nathan still thought it was too early for rapp to be up and moving around let alone flying off on a mission that might involve more concussive blasts the doctor never really agreed to release rapp but he was forced to reluctantly admit that he had no authority to keep rapp against his will he did add however that if rapp left and came back wounded he would do his best to make sure he ignored his medical needs the metal gate was open and zahir was waiting for them in the driveway rapp and coleman paid him no attention and instead approached the commander for the assault team chief coleman said whats the status perimeter is secure and the handler just sent in his dog the senior chief looked at the local cops they look pretty nervous yeah well if twentyone of our boys had just been greased two days ago wed be pretty nervous too good point the dog have a camera yep handlers looking at that as well as the brains back at jsoc when the big brains give us the goahead the bomb guys are going to send in their robot rapp asked how long is that going to take twenty to thirty minutes rapp frowned i dont want to wait that long he looked over at zahir ive got a better idea after the dog came back out they asked the handler if he had seen anything unusual other than the two dead bodies in the basement everything looked pretty normal while the bomb techs unpacked their equipment rapp told hayek to stay put and approached zahir with coleman commander you and your men didnt happen to find any booby traps while you were in there zahir was very unhappy that the americans were playing this game with him he shook his head and refused to speak good rapp said so youre willing to go back in with us and show us what youve found zahir nodded waved for them to follow and then marched past his men in and into the house you sure about this coleman asked rapp figured he could spend the rest of his life worrying that there was a bomb around every corner or he could get back on this horse you read the report on zahir suicide isnt his deal too narcissistic if hes willing to walk in there were safe i hope youre right coleman look over his shoulder chief were going in when jsoc starts freaking out tell them mr cox made the call having served in the military coleman didnt want the guy getting reamed for something that wasnt his fault as he started walking he called back you can still send in the robot if you want zahir led them through the first floor anything worth seeing up here rapp asked as they reached the stairwell im sure youre going to want to take this house apart piece by piece but i didnt see much pointing down the staircase zahir said the important stuff is down there rapp had zahir go first and followed him down the steps with his m rifle pointed at zahirs back halfway down the stairs the stench hit them zahir pulled out a handkerchief and covered his mouth at the bottom of the stairs was a table with a computer monitor keyboard and mouse zahir led them through the open door and the stench became almost unbearable rapp and coleman were both covering their noses with gloved hands as they looked around the rectangular room the first thing rapp noticed were the two bodies on the floor they looked like the men in video the sheets were covering the walls and attached to one of the floor joists was a metal hook with a length of knotted rope this one here zahir pointed at the larger of the two men is shahrukh ahmad wazir hes taliban youre sure rapp asked yes and the other one i have no idea but we will find out very likely he is taliban as well god it stinks down here rapp said what is that smell these guys dont look like theyve been dead long enough to smell like this zahir pointed at a puddle between the two bodies and a little closer to where they were standing it was a rusty brown mixture that is blood and i think feces and im sure urine as well zahir had seen many men shit themselves when interrogated but he didnt think now was a good time to offer this knowledge what was the big ones name again coleman asked he had his phone out and was about to send the name back to the intel fusion center zahir spelled it for him and coleman sent the message if zahir knew who he was it was likely the name would pop up in one of their databases rapp stepped around the putrid liquid to get a better look at the two men they both had bruised knuckles and their hands were swollen just beyond the bodies were two rubber hoses more evidence that this was the place where rickman had been interrogated he counted no fewer than four bullet holes in each man the image of the dead bodyguards lined up in the safe house came back to him this murder scene couldnt have been more different look at this rapp said to coleman remember ricks four guys each one with a single bullet hole yeah coleman said this was done by someone who was pissed off he turned around and looked at the other two walls as far as he could tell they didnt have any pockmarks from bullets this wasnt a gunfight it was an execution rapp noticed the video camera and tripod knocked over on the floor they needed hayek down here rapp reached up and grabbed the lip mike from the side of his helmet he swung it down and hit the twoway button on his motorola radio sid this is harry over im here did you bring any masks it smells pretty bad down here yeah i have some good grab your gear and come on in ill meet you on the first floor harry the voice crackled over the radio our boss is out of that meeting and shes not very happy with you rapps memory was still a little spotty but he got the feeling that this wasnt the first time shed been mad at him tell her im percent sure we found the place where rick was interrogated that should calm her down a bit ill meet you by the front door rapp flipped the lip mike back up and started for the stairs this is pretty fucking ballsy coleman said whats that were a block and half from the safe house were looking all over the planet for him and he was here just a couple hundred yards away i hate to admit it but its a pretty fucking smart move who would have ever thought of looking this close colemans words triggered something familiar in rapps mind his brain was still having some issues like it knew what it was searching for but it was stuck in that pinwheel mode that a computer went into when it couldnt get out of program coleman could see hed triggered something what are you thinking about i dont know i think something you said is important but the old noggin still isnt working quite right itll come rapp stepped into the other room and zahir followed him mr harry are you satisfied rapp stopped on the first step and looked back at the corrupt police officer he sighed and reluctantly said yes abdul youve done a good job rapp climbed two more steps and then thought of something abdul how did you discover these bodies zahir wanted to tell him that it was through his contacts but he was afraid the american would discover the truth the man was no longer mad at him so he said we received an anonymous call at the police station anonymous yes that sounded funny to rapp they were offering thousands of dollars in cash to anyone who could help them find rickman you would think someone would want to collect that money rapp shook his head and started up the stairs again with ashan in tow mr harry i would just like to say that i am sorry we started off on the wrong foot me too abdul but maybe we can start over rapp stopped in the front entryway sidestepping the robot i would like that rapp thought of something else good now you need to find mr hubbard alive preferably zahir hemmed and hawed and then asked is there a reward rapp should have expected it guys like zahir never changed fifty grand maybe more depending on how hard you have to work zahir smiled this was a huge relief he much preferred doing business this way his joy was shortlived however rapp pointed the muzzle of his rifle at zahirs chest and said but if i find out youre fucking me or that you had a hand in any of this youre dead chapter hayek had donned her white paper suit hood and booties she wore her mask and kicked everyone out of the house including the bomb techs for more than an hour she thoroughly photographed everything and in the room where the torture had taken place she took two samples of every fluid she could potentially identify when shed been with the fbi they would have had no fewer than six agents combing over a crime scene like this she was well aware that she was likely missing a bevy of potential evidence but her focus here was very different from that of an agent collecting evidence that would be challenged in a courtroom her immediate goal was pretty straightforwardshe needed to be able to tell kennedy with near certainty that joe rickman had in fact been in this room even as hayek carefully collected her evidence she knew what she would recommend to kennedy she needed to bring in a forensic team from the joint expeditionary forensic laboratory at bagram or have the fbi send one of their teams over kennedy wouldnt like the idea of bringing in someone from outside the agency but the truth was the cia didnt have the capability to do this job at the level it needed to be done hayeks preference was the fbi but she recognized that she was biased from having worked with them when she was finished collecting all of her samples she was left with one small dilemma on the floor across the room from the two dead men was a digital camera with a tripod screwed into the bottom it appeared the camera had been knocked over as only a small wire tethered the viewfinder several pieces of the cameras black plastic casing were also cracked and broken if the fbi were going to get involved they would want her to leave the camera where it was so they could follow their own strict protocols for evidence collection hayek was no electronics expert but she knew that some cameras came equipped with internal memory drives as well as slots for removable memory cards using her gloved hands she cradled the camera as if it were a bird with a broken wing she carefully turned it over in her hands and saw that the slot for the memory card was empty she was about to leave the camera when she decided that would be foolish hayek chastised herself there were times where she still thought too much like a law enforcement officer and not enough like a member of the clandestine service the priority was to get kennedy as much information as possible as quickly as possible she could always hand the camera over to the fbi later along with the photographs that would show where shed found the camera she carefully unscrewed the tripod from the bottom and placed the camera in a clear evidence bag when she stepped into the afternoon sun she saw that everyone was in a far more relaxed posture rapp was standing just inside the gate with coleman who looked like he was about to fall asleep rapp asked how did it go hayek pulled the paper hood off her head and the mask from her face ive got what we need to get a start but we need to get someone in there to go over the entire house like who rapp asked probably one of the fbis forensic teams im not sure i like that idea i didnt think you would but theyre the best irenes going to have to make that call i agree in the meantime we need this place secured i dont want anyone going in or out including the local police rapp looked to coleman any ideas well he rubbed his tired eyes having the jsoc boys guard an empty house is like asking a thoroughbred horse to plow a field besides im sure they have ops they have to run tonight coleman was about to say he could call hubbard and get some grunts from the air base to come over and secure the place but then he remembered hubbard was missing ill make some calls in the meantime ill see if we can get the rangers to keep an eye on things coleman got patched in to the ops boss back at bagram and explained the situation a solution was reached in less than sixty seconds that was one of the nice things about jsoc there was so much practical experience involving missions that on the surface were very similar but in the details every one unique the two black hawks that had delivered the assault team were standing by on the tarmac only a few miles away at the jalalabad air base jsoc had already arranged for three mraps to transport the assault team and their gear back to the airfield for linkup with their black hawks and transport back to bagram the interim solution was to have the rangers close up their position on the house and run security until another force could be found to relieve them coleman also arranged to have their little bird come back in and pick them up for the return to bagram five minutes after they were airborne coleman was asleep and rapp was wide awake trying to understand what was gnawing at the edges of his memory at this juncture kennedy was less concerned about maintaining absolute secrecy and more interested in getting results so hayek requested access to the joint expeditionary forensic facility at bagram kennedy explained her situation to the base commander a twostar from idaho who had been an extremely gracious host one quick phone call from the co and hayek had complete access to the lab and any help that the staff could offer hayek was impressed with the facility which was run by the us army criminal investigative command as with all things to do with the army they had turned the name into an acronym rather than call it the joint expeditionary forensic facility they called it jeff hayek laid her evidence bags out on a stainlesssteel table and doublechecked that she had a backup for each sample she then took the extra bags placed them in a larger evidence bag and sealed them if anything went wrong in the lab she could rely on these samples and test them on familiar equipment back in the states she had taken fingerprints and dna samples from the two dead men she turned those samples over to the labs latentprint examiners and dna analysts and told them which databases to check them against the two women smiled and reassured her that they had done this more times than either of them could count the officer in charge of the lab was a major archer hayek showed him the clear evidence bag with the damaged camera do you have anyone on staff who could check and see if there are any useful images on this the major wasnt wearing gloves so he made no attempt to touch the bag yes maam we have an information technology analyst this is just his kind of thing ill be back in a second when the major reappeared he had a small black man with him who was wearing bulky black us armyissue eyeglasses agent hayek this is corporal floyd hes one of our best if theres anything in there hell find it the corporal was wearing a white paper evidence suit he snapped on a pair of latex gloves and without saying a word he held out his hands hayek gave him the bag and watched him hold the camera up to the light and look at it from several angles when he finally spoke he asked do you have a power cord hayek could have kicked herself she could see the cord still sitting on the floor the thought of bringing it with her never crossed her mind sorry no cord the corporal shrugged his small shoulders i should be able to find something canon cameras pretty much use the same power source he looked at the bottom and then moved to open the bag asking do you mind go ahead he pulled the camcorder out of the bag and checked the sd card slot no memory card hayek pointed out the obvious any chance we can find something on there the corporal nodded this is a canon vixia hf r sdhc comes with an eightgigabyte internal flash drive three hours of highdef recording if the wifi is still working itll be a snap if it isnt i might have to take the flash drive out which will take some time how much maybe a few hours hayek wasnt happy cant you just hook it up to a tv and play it back a small grin formed on the corporals lips if i had all the right cables and the thing wasnt all busted up yes i could hook it up to a tv but i dont have those cables so it might take a little while to get it running but dont worry if there are any images on here ill retrieve them for you the imagesthats what this was all about and this young soldier if he was able to retrieve them was in for quite a shock hayek still hadnt gotten used to this double life she hadnt bothered to give the officer in charge or anyone else for that matter her alias there were times where she truly wondered whether she was cut out to be a clandestine service officer listen she said to the two men in a confidential tone the images on that thing are likely to be extremely disturbing one of our clandestine officers was kidnapped a few days ago and we think that camera might contain parts of his interrogation no one can have access to those images as soon as you get it working you need to stop stop doing what floyd asked stop watching it if my fears are correct i dont think im cleared to see and hear whats on that drive and i trust corporal you dont want to have to put yourself through a debriefing on this it wouldnt be pretty fair enough let me see what i can do the second i get it working its all yours hayek turned her attention to the one thing she could get a fairly quick answer on every clandestine service officer serving overseas had a dna sample on file at langley and hayek was in possession of rickmans she looked at the six evidence bags that she had collected from the slurry of fluids underneath the hook where it was most likely that rickman had been beaten blood would give her the best match she took the cleanest sample and gave it to the dna analyst lets start with this chapter kennedy yawned into the back of her hand and hoped no one back at langley noticed they were nearly an hour into the secure videoconference the yawn wasnt from boredom but fatigue they had spent the majority of the briefing talking about life and death the crisis seemed to have no end in sight in fact it was expanding like some plague hopping from population center to population center creating a kind of mini panic among people in the business with one side running and the other sensing blood in the water the pakistani foreign minister had been literally dragged from his house by the isi with media recording every brutal moment that visual alone had started a second exodus of lesser assets in pakistan four midlevel spies had shown up at the embassy in islamabad despite being told not to do so three more had simply disappeared and it was anyones guess if they had been picked up or were trying to flee on their own none of these individuals were mentioned in the video posted on the internet but it didnt matter once fear gripped the lonely mind of a spy panic was already breathing down his neck the embassy in islamabad reported that the isi had stepped up their surveillance around the embassy and they were almost certain to have photographed the assets entering the embassy it was only a matter of time before an official protest was filed and the pakistanis started tossing americans out of their country on top of that she would still have to deal with the fools who had ignored their handlers and fled to the embassy seeking asylum the pakistani government would demand that those individuals be turned over and considering the current climate kennedy would be left with little alternative how many of them would live was impossible to guess but they would all be brutally tortured and this was just pakistan the deputy director of the clandestine service and his staff had just delivered a devastating report thirteen assets not counting the five in pakistan had jumped the reservation five had landed on the doorsteps of american embassies throughout europe and their handlers were working feverishly to get them to return to their lives before anyone noticed but so far none of them were willing of the remaining eight they had no idea if theyd been arrested or were making a run for the nearest border and the safety of america kennedys network of spies was crumbling with each tick of the clock and they were only in the infancy of this crisis she wondered how many of these brave individuals understood what she knew that rickman had only just begun telling secrets the video was just the first installment of a plague that would cripple the cia as she looked at the faces around the conference table and the ones on the large screen relaying the image from langley she wondered how many of these people understood what was at stake they were all smart or they wouldnt have risen to such important posts but there was a learning curve during a catastrophe it was extremely easy to be myopic there were specific tasks that needed to be performed and more than a few people were afraid to look up and see just how bad things could get kennedy couldnt afford to bury her head in a bunch of files it was her job to steer this ship away from the shoals and right now she was beginning to wonder if it was possible you okay kennedy turned to look at rapp who was studying her with his dark eyes there were times like now when that gaze unnerved her she swore he could look into a persons soul and smell fear proving her point he said i know this looks hopeless right now but well catch a break sooner or later i wish i shared your confidence he leaned in even closer right now its all about damage control the bleeding will eventually stop and when it does were just going to have to bust our butt to get back in the game right now kennedy didnt feel like the bleeding would ever stop and if it did she wasnt so sure she wouldnt be out of a job looking at rapp it occurred to her that she still hadnt talked to him about gould there were obviously still some memory issues or she was pretty certain he would have brought it up more than likely he would have demanded to see him maybe she could ask coleman to go over it with him before dr lewis arrived in the morning at least gould was cooperating nash was meticulously rebuilding the last four years of the mans life with special attention paid to his financial transactions and employers kennedy found it hard to swallow that it had been purely coincidental that gould had been hired for the second time in four years to kill rapp and then there was wilson the clandestine service was by necessity an organization staffed with people who were the opposite of dudley doright rapp had done plenty of business with banks specializing in secrecy from switzerland to cyprus to gibraltar and all the way to singapore all of it authorized by kennedy the question was how did wilson find out and who had wanted him to find out the door to the conference room was yanked open and sydney hayek entered out of breath and carrying a laptop kennedys assistant eugene was on her heels im sorry to barge in like this hayek announced but i found something that i thought youd all want to see immediately hayek followed eugene to a console full of electronics at the far end of the room she handed him the laptop and he connected several cables and then switched one of the flatscreen monitors over to the laptop feed eugene handed her a remote and left the room closing the soundproof door on his way out even though he was kennedys personal assistant he knew he didnt have the clearance to see everything hayek took a brief moment to gather herself looking around the table at kennedy rapp schneeman and nash and then at the larger gathering on the screen youre all aware of the house we found in jalalabad it turns out we have a dna match for joe rickman i heard that room was a mess nash said how sure are you that its a match hayek rocked her head from side to side not sure where she should begin so she just started im one hundred percent sure the dna match is ninetyninepointnine percent but we have other evidence she looked at kennedy there was a camcorder in the basement it was smashed and the memory card was missing this type of camera however also has an internal flash drive the questions started in earnest but she raised her voice and her hands and talked over everyone i want to caution everyone that this is extremely graphic there are at least two hours of footage and we will be analyzing it for months to come but i wanted to show you one thing that everyone needs to see before we get into the rest of it hayek hit the play button and started the video the flatscreen showed the same image as the one that had gone viral a bloodied battered and shirtless rickman hung from the ceiling his hands stretched above his head his torso was covered with red welts both eyes were swollen shut and from the unnatural angle of his mouth it looked like his jaw was broken the two men were beating him senseless each one taking turns so they could conserve their energy as the video continued they began striking him in the groin with rubber hoses and then rickmans body convulsed and he coughed up a glob of blood the hooded men continued their onslaught for another dozen seconds and then seemed to sense that something was wrong they stopped hitting rickman and lifted his swollen chin as soon as the shorter man let go of rickmans chin his head dropped lifelessly to rest on his chest the two men began arguing in pashto and then they pulled their masks up to reveal their faces it was obvious they were panicked while they started to check for a pulse a third man entered the picture a blur as he passed the camera he ignored the two men and put his fingers to rickmans neck it seemed like an eternity as the man continued to search for a pulse going back and forth between rickmans neck and his wrists eventually the man placed an ear over rickmans bloody chest after what seemed like an eternity he stepped away from rickman and the two men began to defend themselves the third man began screaming at them and then pulled a pistol there was more arguing and then the third man who still had his mask on started pumping rounds into the taller of the two men when he was done with him he turned the pistol on the other man and kept firing until his pistol was empty the man then turned marched straight for the camera swung at it with his pistol and the screen went black there was nothing but stunned silence kennedys mind was trying to process what she had just seen torn between horror and sadness and relief and a deep personal revulsion over the fact that she was comforted by the knowledge that one of her top people was dead in a matter of seconds her mind ran the gamut processing the violence the tragedy and the calculation that while joe rickmans final days on this planet were as awful as one could imagine he had been spared months of cruel unthinkable torture there was a rationalization at workone man was dead but countless others would avoid the gallows with a wave of relief kennedy realized her network of spies was safe and in the same time and space she hated herself for coming to that conclusion without mourning for rickman chapter washington dc joel wilson didnt have the energy or the desire to take his dog for a walk but it was part of the plan so he slid on a pair of tennis shoes and grabbed his barn jacket from the front hall closet his wife a skinny little platinum blonde who was a fitness freak walked the dog both before and after work so when wilson grabbed the leash the dog cocked his head to one side as if to say are you kidding me i dont need any attitude from you ive got enough shit going on what was that honey nothing wilson called to his wife who was down the hall working on the computer im going to take rose for a walk really sally wilson appeared in the doorway of the study a pair of black reading glasses perched on the end of her nose i know its not usually my thing but i need to clear my mind is it that bad sally worked at the department of energy and had a good sense of just how nasty office politics could get in the big bureaucracy of washington im about to find out wilson thought to himself its pretty bad but its not over by a long shot just because crazy old hargrave is mad at me doesnt mean hes right she came down the hall and kissed him on the cheek youll figure it out you always do youre the smartest best man i know wilson blushed he loved her dearly most marriages that couldnt produce children ended up in the ditch theirs had grown stronger they were a great team thank you honey i love you love you too their twostory brownstone was in a new development sandwiched between reagan national airport and the pentagon an old industrial park had been bulldozed and the developer had created a neighborhood that was supposed to give the feel of historic georgetown this had been accomplished by building four different types of brownstones that were basically the same in terms of the foundation and mechanicals but slightly different in floor plans and the color of shutters and front doors it was a nice neighborhood filled with lobbyists and uppermiddle government types wilson let the cocker spaniel take the lead to say that he was a little down would have been an understatement the long flight back from afghanistan had given him way too much time to think even the members of his own team avoided talking to him it was almost as if they all realized hed become toxic hed tried to come up with an excuse for why they had to pack up all their stuff after having landed two days earlier they had been operating under the assumption that they were going to be in the country for at least a week and that then the bulk of the team would return to washington leaving a few agents behind to follow up on things but in the mad dash to get everyone up and packed there was no way for him to massage what was going on before the flight was off the ground the entire team had heard about cal pattersons alarming phone call from executive assistant director hargrave none of the team knew hargrave the way wilson did they saw him as a serious man with an important title who could banish them to whatever post he liked wilson knew the man for the phony he was but trying to convince his team would only make things worse two blocks away from the house under a streetlight he stopped and looked for the car the dog turned around gave him a what are you doing look and then tried to get him to keep moving stay put you stupid mutt wilson hissed a block away a pair of headlights snapped on and the vehicle started moving wilsons way when the black lincoln town car stopped the only thing wilson could see was his reflection in the tinted windows a click announced that the power locks had been tripped wilson opened the rear passenger door and looked into the dark back seat get in wilson picked up the dog and climbed into the backseat he set rose on his lap and closed the door the vehicle started moving and the privacy glass between the front and back seats were raised goodlooking dog whats his name rose and hes a she senator carl ferris reached out and allowed the dog to lick his liverspotted hand i love dogs did you know that nope wilson couldnt give a shit ive had them my whole life three of them right now two of them stay at the big house up in connecticut the other one travels with us a little cockapoo cutest thing youve ever seen wilson watched as the senator went to work scratching roses neck and talking to her in that stupid babytalk voice that his wife used when she thought she and the dog were carrying on a conversation im really glad youre so interested in my dog but ive got bigger problems right now ferris kept scratching the dog yes you do very unfortunate the way samuel behaved the man is extremely petulant the word i would use is asshole ferris pulled the dog onto his lap just how serious are things pretty bad im supposed to be in the directors office at am sharp tomorrow morning i have no idea who is going to be there but you can bet hargrave has the deck stacked against me ive kept him out of the loop just as you advised me and now hes going to use that against me and trust me it isnt going to be good they take this shit very seriously at the fbi i wish i had just let him in on what i was doing that would have been a huge mistake ferris was a portly man with a slight combover he would have run to kennedy and you would have never gotten your investigation off the ground what does it matter theyre going to pull the rug out from under me tomorrow theyre going to transfer my ass to the office of equal employment opportunity or some other bs post shit ill be lucky if i have a job when theyre done now now ferris said in a caring voice you need to gather yourself and remember that while you may have stepped on a few toes youre still right you have uncovered a massive fraud millions of dollars in funds that have been stolen by a corrupt and outofcontrol cia you dont need to convince me its themmy bosses hargrave really director miller would stand behind you if things werent already so muddied so you think im screwed i didnt say that i think youre in a tough spot but ive seen worse ferris shifted the dog and said the key is for you to state your case tomorrow you have the affidavit from the banker you have the bank records i dont know how they can ignore that kind of information for starters theyre going to want to know how i came by all of this evidence and they are not going to like my answers this is the cia were talking about i understand that ferris said with a trace of impatience evidence is evidence it will simply have to see the light of day people will understand just how serious things are then wilson cocked his head to the side and said are you suggesting that i leak this information to the press because if you are ill be the one to have my ass thrown in jail calm down ferris said sternly i said no such thing i know you have certain rules you must follow the key is for you to get them to see that by not letting you proceed it will open the fbi up to allegations of a coverup wilson liked the sound of that that was the kind of thing that could scare the crap out of any high levelbureaucrat you know if i dropped your name and mentioned that the judiciary committee was keeping an eye on this it might be enough to get them to back off the senators expression soured for now you need to minimize our relationship trust me on this we havent reached the point yet where im ready to get involved but i promise you when the time is right i will jump on them like an eighthundredpound gorilla and until then im just going to get my ass kicked ferris sighed dont be so melodramatic its very unbecoming in a man who carries a badge and a gun chapter islamabad pakistan general durrani was sitting in the rear passenger seat of his armored mercedes sedan two identical black mercedes e sedans followed the cars were indistinguishable from one another and tinted windows made it impossible to see who was inside the vehicles durrani preferred that his car take the lead as bombers more often than not assumed their target was in the middle sedan truth be known however durrani didnt worry much about being blown up the people who did that type of stuff the militants were all in his back pocket the motorcade pulled up to the main security post of his gated community bahria town on the outskirts of islamabad durrani had helped the developer get his fortyfivethousandacre gated community off the ground evicting tenants and intimidating reluctant landowners into selling in addition to making sure the right people were bribed or threatened durrani had also made sure that the private security force was composed of former army personnel who were entirely loyal to him in exchange for his help he was given his own compound nestled on a very private palmtreelined lot the compound was surrounded by tenfoot walls that protected an eightthousandsquarefoot main house two guesthouses a pool house and an eightcar garage with rooms for his servants and bodyguards durrani was filled with a sense of bliss every time he entered the gated community only in his beloved pakistan could you work this hard and be rewarded with such opulence the cars sped down a wide treelined boulevard unlike the rest of islamabad and rawalpindi here there wasnt a speck of garbage in sight the gate to the compound was open and two of durranis military bodyguards were standing next to the large stone columns holding their heckler amp koch g rifles the vehicles sped past them and up the long private driveway durrani did not wait for his detail to take up their positions this was his compound after all and there had to be at least one place in his life where he could feel free to move about on his own he headed for the main house where his butler was waiting at the door good evening general a small man in a white tunic and black pants greeted him is there anything i can get you durrani walked past his butler without making eye contact and then stopped in the middle of the large marble foyer is vazir here yes general he is in the shahi house durrani gave a quick nod and proceeded down the hallway to the elevator when the doors opened he stepped inside and pressed the button for the basement durrani was extremely paranoid and his job only amplified his distrustfulness so when he was having the house built hed had the contractor a very good friend and business partner put in tunnels that linked all the structures on the property as much as possible he did not want the americans to know what he was doing the tunnels allowed him to stay away from the prying eyes of their satellites durrani had even gone so far as to have an analyst give him the known overpass times of american satellites so he could be extra cautious the problem was that americans could move those satellites and even worse through the use of stealth drones they were finding more and more ways to spy on him durrani punched in the code and opened the steel door the corridors were nothing special just poured eightfoot concrete walls and ceilings with caged industrial lights every twenty feet the tunnel from the main house to the first guesthouse was feet long at the next door he took a right turn and continued down a much shorter tunnel he punched in another code entered the stark basement and started up the steps by the time he reached the main floor his breathing was labored durrani placed one hand on the railing and patted his chest with the other a voice called out from the next room is that you general when he spoke durrani was still out of breath yes he reached for his cigarettes and lit one before pushing off the railing and walking into the sunken living room the theme for this particular house was clean and contemporary with lots of white in the middle of the sunken living room were two white leather couches and two modern white leather chairs with chrome frames the furniture rested on a large white shag rug and a white marble floor with subtle shades of gray durrani did not approach the man in the dark suit he was sitting with his legs crossed on one of the white couches a magazine in one hand a cigarette in the other and a bulky black pistol next to him vazir kassar was one of his most trusted officers he was also an insolent son of a bitch at times he knew that durrani was dying to know how things had turned out but he was going to make him ask well durranis eyes were wide with anticipation well what general durrani was suddenly irritated by the gun sitting on the couch put that away you are a guest in my house i thought i was your employee the dark thin man answered in a voice that conveyed ambivalence dont play your games with me how did it go the man remained serious it wasnt easy but hes alive yes kassar jerked his head toward the hallway hes in the bedroom at the end of the hall durrani clapped his hands together and stifled a scream of joy you will have to tell me all the details later but first i must see him durrani hurried down the hallway his black dress shoes clicking on the stone floor he would have run if his lungs could have taken it when he reached the door at the end of the hall he didnt bother knocking he threw open the door and froze in disbelief the blackout shades were not pulled and the bright afternoon light streamed through the gauzy white linen curtains there in the middle of the king size bed filled with white pillows white sheets and a fluffy white feather comforter lay a mass of purple and red flesh the smile on durranis face vanished good god what did those fools do to you durrani rushed to the bedside and looked at the swollen and bruised face is it you i cant be sure the monstrous face slowly turned in his direction the man was blind his eyes swollen tightly shut looked like two peaches his lips were cut cracked and so puffy the top one touched his broken and deformed nose durrani had seen the video on the internet and assumed that they had used makeup to exaggerate the injuries what happened when he spoke he sounded congested its not easy to talk i think they broke my jaw durranis entire being stiffened with anger i will kill them i swear to you i will kill them there was gruff laughter from the doorway i think youre a little late for that durrani looked over his shoulder at kassar how could you have let this happen it was your idea he said not wanting to own any of this all part of your grand plan this durrani said pointing at rickman was not my plan relax akhtar rickman said reaching out with his left hand when durrani saw the mangled and broken fingers he took a quick step back im alive rickman said it worked vazir took care of your two taliban dupes im told the entire thing was quite dramatic fortunately i had passed out by then are you in pain durrani asked it was a relative question or at least the pain was relative he was not comfortable but compared to his pain during the beatings he was at peace im okay you are no such thing you are a bloody mess ill survive im not sure you will durrani looked to kassar again how could you have let this happen he insisted kassar said youve told me many times my job is to follow orders i wanted to stop sooner but he said we had to make sure it was convincing to follow my orders durrani hit himself in the chest repeatedly well you werent there general i was following joes orders durrani found kassars unflappable behavior unnerving at times rather start yelling at him durrani turned his attention back to rickman there wasnt an inch of his face that wasnt bruised swollen or cut why did you do this to yourself i didnt it was your taliban flunkies they were not very smart by the way perfect for the job really i must compliment you durrani cracked a small smile he had always found rickman humorous it looks like they went too far it was the only way i had to sell it durrani was dumbfounded he knew the american was smart but he had no idea he was so tough you are either the bravest man i know or you are crazy which one is it i little bit of both i suppose rickman started to smile but then had to stop because it hurt too much durrani considered the bigger picture he would have preferred not to cut this so close but he was thankful that rickman was alive he had pulled off one of the greatest intelligence coups in the history of the world this is a great day he put his right hand on rickmans shoulder and gave him a reassuring squeeze rickman moaned and kassar said i think his shoulders were dislocated while they were tied above his head i wouldnt do that durrani withdrew his hand and said has the doctor seen him kassar shook his head and grabbed a pack of cigarettes from his suit coat he tapped one free and pointed the unfiltered end at rickman he wont allow it what i said he wont allow it durrani shot kassar a scowl he was the only person who worked for durrani who even attempted to defy him i heard what you said why wont he allow it because he doesnt trust our doctor he thinks the fewer the people who see him the better but he needs medical attention durrani looked at the broken man lying on the large bed we need to have a doctor look at you and then you will kill him rickman shook his head slowly an inch to his left and then his right i will heal just let me rest thank you kassar said i will be the one who has to kill him and i like dr bhutani he has stitched me up on several occasions a very handy man to have around i would prefer it if we could keep him durrani turned halfway and swatted the air with his arm telling kassar to leave the impudent man took a long pull from his cigarette shrugged and then disappeared hovering over rickman durrani said are you taking anything for the pain yes rickman squirmed a bit in an effort to lift his head its not as bad as it looks at least not compared to the beating i had to go through what can i get you nothing i just want to lie here durranis gaze narrowed he had no great knowledge of medicine or the human anatomy but he had been involved in plenty of interrogations a good number of them had ended in death and it wasnt always because the heart gave out there had been plenty of cases in which the subject died from infection the infections were no surprise considering the squalor of the cells add to that the way the nervous system was assaulted and the lack of sleep and it was no wonder the immune system crashed and the patient died durrani decided at that exact moment that he would have his doctor here within the hour he was former army and was cleared to work with the isi he was also sympathetic to the cause of pakistani selfdetermination there was always a risk of course but durrani could have him killed later if there was a problem rickman stifled a cough and asked what about rapp this was the one part durrani had been dreading everything else had worked so well he escaped death but do not worry he has other problems rickman tried to sit up but didnt make it very far before a coughing fit ensued and he was forced to lie back down blood began to trickle from his mouth as he said i cant believe this calm down do not upset yourself i told you rapp absolutely had to be dealt with it was the one part of the operation that couldnt fail i know durrani said prepared to deflect but your assassin didnt take the shot what do you mean he walked across the street to the clinic and surrendered himself to rapp i dont believe you well youd better i had two of my best men there and i lost one of them your assassin marched right across the street and presented himself to rapp your man failed so i had to use my backup general qayem sent in his men and it was a bloodbath bloodbath twentyone men were killed rickman was shellshocked how many people did rapp have with him four durrani held up his nicotinestained fingers practically yelling and then your assassin joined his ranks im told he personally killed a good number of qayems men rickman was suddenly feeling every ache and pain what was it about rapp why wouldnt the man just die a sense of foreboding weighed on rickmans chest and he began to worry that he wouldnt be able to breathe at that same moment he feared for hubbard the plan had been for him to send rapp to the veterinary clinic rickman had thought this through for more than a year he knew kennedy would send rapp to head the search for him and he knew how rapp thought better than rapp himself did rickman had carefully left those clues for rapp knowing his damn instincts would tell him that certain things didnt add up if rapp had survived the trap he had laid for him that would mean hubbard was either dead or running for his life rickman suddenly wished he could open his eyes so he could read durranis face what about hubbard where is he durrani knew this was inevitable but the truth was not an option for him not if he wanted rickman to work with him his friend was already clearly agitated which was a shame as there was so much to celebrate the truth was that durrani had never planned on getting hubbard out of afghanistan where was he supposed to hide a sixfootfiveinch bald pasty american in a country filled with darkskinned men where the average height was fiveseven hed gone along with rickmans desire to bring hubbard to pakistan because it was the only way to get him to agree to the plan but in truth he knew he would kill hubbard from the onset it pains me to tell you that your friend is dead rickman swallowed hard are you sure yes how did it happen we think it was rapp but were not sure rickmans battered body tensed and he yelled did you do anything right that is not fair joe we knew from the very beginning that this was going to be a very complicated operation your friend knew that as well i cant believe rapp is still alive and hubbard is dead you need to get men to zurich rapp cannot get his hands on obrecht i have already taken care of it durrani lied he had completely forgotten about the deception involving the swiss banker with rapp dead he was going to be a crucial witness to rapps corruption it was rickmans idea of muddying the water you are still alive durrani said that is whats important you are free and you are rich beyond your dreams with each passing revelation rickman was feeling less than stellar about his situation and mitch rapp is still alive and hes going to hunt my ass down and kill me he will never find you my plans are intact once you undergo the surgery no one will ever know rickmans thoughts returned to hubbard how did hubbard die were not sure other than the fact that mr hubbard did not make it to his rendezvous point hubbard had in fact made it to the warehouse in jalalabad and that was where he was killed but that information would only serve to upset rickman durrani knew what was best for him things would be much smoother this way so he might be alive we dont think so there was a shootout things are a little sketchy but it sounds like rapp killed him sounds like so youre not sure rickman was becoming extremely agitated if hubbard is still alive you and i are as good as dead well durrani said trying to think of a way to calm rickman down he is most certainly dead im just being cautious vigilant you should have been more vigilant in making sure rapp was killed fuck the word was filled with despondency i told you killing rapp was crucial ive run all the calculations mitch rapp is the last man i want looking for me you dont know him like i do he wont stop until he finds me and that means you too they all think youre dead durrani said dismissively most of them will because thats what they want to believe but rapp doesnt operate that way its not a matter of what he wants to believe or doesnt want to believe hes human bullshit detector hes going to sniff out the cracks in our plan and hes going to start hammering away until the entire thing collapses and then he is going to hunt our asses down rickman moaned and then added i went through all of that pain for nothing you exaggerate the abilities of your former colleague i exaggerate nothing ive worked with him for over twenty years hes the fucking energizer bunny of covert operatives he just keeps killing and killing and if you want to stay alive youd better figure out a way to kill him and youd better do it quick rickman was overreacting i want you to calm down there is far too much to celebrate i cant calm down as long as that man is above ground rickman started coughing and it wasnt long before a trickle of blood began to run down the corner of his swollen mouth durrani couldnt believe the doctor wasnt here just one minute durrani said holding up a finger and retreating from the room he ignored rickmans coughing and moved quickly down the hall and into the living room get dr bhutani here immediately i am extremely disappointed that you ignored my orders kassar looked up from his magazine and said he refused to let me call a doctor and he was doing fine until you got here and upset him one of these days durrani said shaking his fist you are going to push me too far you may get rid of me any time you like just get dr bhutani and get him fast kassar set down the magazine and stabbed out his cigarette in the large copper ashtray in the middle of the table he stood and said i will get dr bhutani but as i said i like the man if you decide he is a liability at some point you will have to find someone else to do your dirty work fine durrani snapped just get him and i heard what you two were talking about what rapp durrani was exasperated he didnt want to talk right now he wanted kassar to get the doctor what about him put it out of your mind put what out of my mind killing him or at least asking me to kill him i dont know when you got the idea that we were equals i give the orders and you follow them kassar gave a nod of mutual understanding you have made that clear i am a contract employee you have me on a retainer and if at any point you are not satisfied with my performance my contract will be terminated that goes both ways are you threatening me no kassar said tersely im simply trying to stop you from doing something stupid leave mr rapp alone and hope that he never discovers your hand in this are you afraid of him durrani asked mockingly kassar pulled out his phone and began searching for dr bhutanis number i respect the man and his abilities and you should as well if you are foolish enough to try to kill him again youre going to have to find someone other than me someone who is reckless enough to think he can take him chapter langley virginia kennedy reviewed the final edited version for the eighth time the assault on her conscience was not quite as bad as it had been on the first or second viewing the impact had lessened a degree or two which made her wonder how many times shed have to watch it before she was completely desensitized to the horror she knew that would never happen but there was a part of her brain that wished it could be that simple the internal drive from the camcorder provided exactly two hours of footage two hours of the most brutal dehumanizing violence kennedy had ever witnessed and she was not unaware that things like this happened she had in fact seen similar tapes before saddam hussein had tapes like this all over his palaces those tapes never required more than a minute or two of viewing as analysts sifted through them to see if there was any actionable intelligence kennedy was then brought individual snippets to view this time she had forced herself to watch the entire two hours shed done it on the flight back from bagram the morning after hayek had shown them the video they received word that hubbards body had been discovered in a warehouse of an industrial park on the outskirts of jalalabad the cause of death was a single bullet to the head mike nash had approached her midmorning and told her that she needed to get back to headquarters kennedy was reluctant but nash was forceful telling her that with rickman and hubbard dead the worst of the crisis had passed she was needed back in dc where there would be a lot of important people asking questions they all knew it would get ugly and kennedy knew nash was right she needed to be in washington so she left nash behind to help schneeman manage the cleanup kennedy had been trained to accept the more difficult aspects of her job but she was still human watching rickman beg his captors to stop was one of the most heartwrenching things shed ever experienced the ugly specter of the outcome hung over the entire thing there was no surprise ending no hope that seals or delta force commandos would burst into the room and gun down the two interrogators shed seen the ending first which made watching it all that much harder all the relief shed felt knowing that her secrets were now safe with the death of rickman quickly transformed into a crippling guilt that shed found solace in the death of someone she was responsible for rapp as always had been able to look right through her and know what she was thinking somewhere over europe in the middle of the night kennedy looked down the fuselage of the g and decided that everyone was either sleeping or trying to sleep she decided it was time to watch the interrogation in its entirety she opened her laptop and began watching rickmans final two hours of life she cried for most of it somewhere near the end rapp came up on her left shoulder and closed her laptop she took off her headphones he sat down across from her leaned forward and said why are you doing this to yourself kennedy tried to compose herself wiping her tears with the sleeve of her sweater i had to watch it i need to know what he gave up rapp shook his head in a slow disapproving way thats not true and you know it you cant make out half of what he says in a quiet room up here forty thousand feet you might be able decipher percent the audio needs to be cleaned up and thats what theyre doing at langley right now by the time we land youll have a detailed transcript of everything he said twentyfour hours after that youll have a damage assessment from your top people and well deal with it but there is no reason to watch that other than to beat yourself up thomas always told me i needed to understand just how rough things could get in the field thomas was thomas stansfield kennedys mentor and her predecessor rapp thought highly of the man but there were times where he wondered if kennedy didnt try a little too hard to live up to stansfield and his legend being detached has never been a problem of yours dont beat yourself up over this its not your fault its no ones fault its just part of the job its a part i dont like its a part none of us like but we move on rapp grabbed her hand and said someone i respect told me once to take a little time to grieve and then get my shit together and get back in the game stan rapp nodded the tough nononsense stan hurley was famous for telling people to suck it up and if i cant then you go see our favorite shrink kennedy spun her chair and looked out across the treeladen landscape of the potomac river valley she hadnt made an appointment with dr lewis yet but she would have to she was going to need some help sorting through all of this guilt and relief the problem would be finding the time her schedule was booked solid with meetings that had been rescheduled because of the emergency trip to afghanistan and fresh meetings with allies who wanted to discuss the fallout from rickman and then there was congress they wanted a briefing this afternoon and kennedy had a little surprise for them hayeks dna samples from the torture room had brought in a match one of the men in the video was wafa zadran who had spent three years in guantanamo several members of the joint intelligence committee were harsh critics of the detention center in cuba and had made a platform out of lecturing the cia and the pentagon that gitmo was a recruiting tool for terrorists this particular group of politicians fell into the dangerous mindset that islamic radicals thought acted and behaved like anyone else and if you were simply nice to them they would be nice to you in return in its mildest form this type of this was naive and in its harshest form it was extremely narcissistic either way it was wrong and did nothing to help fight islamic terrorism zadran was yet another example of their failed and shortsighted policy but kennedy knew these politicians all too well they would never accept responsibility for what theyd done there was a soft knock on the door and then a woman in her midfifties entered it was betty walner the cias director of the office of public affairs everything is ready do i have your authorization to release the clip the clip was their solution to the stampede of panicked agents and assets chuck obrien the director of the national clandestine service had advocated the idea as obrien put it dead men dont tell secrets this will put an end to it kennedy was averse to the idea at first the cia didnt like making sensitive things public and this was about as sensitive as it could get her mind had been pretty much made up for her when the terrorists decided to release a second edited clip of rickmans beating it became obvious that they were going to try to milk rickmans interrogation to make it seem as if he was still alive obriens idea became the toaster in the bathwater release the clip of rickmans death and shortcircuit the entire game there was also a serious opportunity to embarrass the taliban by showing the execution of the two interrogators by one of their own it would make them look like rank amateurs yes the white house signed off on it kennedy said reaching for her cup of tea ive already received more than a few requests for interviews with you im too busy right now i know you are but youre going to need to make some statements first about rickman and hubbard and their service to our country you have to do that kennedy nodded i will at some point it needs to be today kennedy didnt take it personally walner was just trying to do her job ill have something prepared by the end of the day and it would really help if youd do a sitdown with a half dozen or so reporters off the record walner shook her head not on this one irene its too big have you had time to read the papers today no the hawks on the hill are screaming bloody murder over the reintegration program in afghanistan and all the greenonblue violence theyre laying all the blame on the white house and youre stuck in the middle five at the most and theyll have you in a committee room with cameras and theyll be asking anything they want your best chance is to start shaping your message right now kennedy looked down the length of her office at the small hallway that connected her office to the deputy directors office stofer was leading a group of her top advisors her way she didnt have the energy to deal with the media right now and she wanted to hear what her advisors had to say stop back in a few hours with a plan and well review it she said to walner walner left and kennedy got up with her cup of tea and moved over to the seating area which was composed of one long couch with its back to the window a rectangular glass coffee table and four chairs two across from the couch and one at each end of the coffee table kennedy took her normal seat and set her cup of tea on the table so where do we stand she asked her advisers the director of the clandestine service looked at stofer and then rapp and cleared his throat irene none of us are taking this well it sucks but all things considered rick dying is not a bad outcome i know it sounds harsh but its the reality of our business so this is your glassishalffull pep talk obrien looked a bit sheepish im not proud of it but if thats the way you want to look at thats fine with me he nervously twisted the gold band on his weddingring finger and added it could have been a hundred times worse kennedy took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes sometimes it doesnt feel that way remember buckley obrien said in an ominous tone bill buckley was the cias station chief in beirut who was kidnapped by hezbollah in kennedy remembered buckley he was a friend of her parents after his kidnapping and subsequent torture his interrogators beat information out of him until theyd discovered his entire network of spies and assets one by one those people simply disappeared or were found dead the disaster crippled the cia for more than a decade in the region i imagine weve all spent a good deal of time thinking about bill this week she looked at her tea for a moment and admitted youre right it could have been a lot worse but somehow that doesnt make me feel very good right now i hate to sound harsh obrien said in his deep voice but rick probably welcomed this after what he went through obrien shook his head i wouldnt want to see my worst enemy have to endure that rapp didnt know if it was his head injury or if hed always thought like this but he was not comfortable with all of the emotions that everyone was wearing on their sleeves this was cia and more precisely the clandestine service the department were filled with badasses from every branch of the military they were the risk takers the ones who were sent in to do the dirty work you could try to soften torture and call it enhanced interrogation measures but rapp had used more than enhanced interrogation measures and so had rickman it was the world they lived in it sucked that rickman had to endure that kind of abuse but they were professionals there was also something else bothering him that he couldnt put his finger on it was a feeling that something wasnt right that things didnt add up hows your head rapp looked up to see kennedy studying him he felt fine just a little tired not bad her gaze narrowed and she said you looked like you were in pain no just thinking about something rapp leaned forward and brought his hands together and then deflecting kennedy asked so where are we with this idiot from the fbi youll be interested to know that scott saw him take a little ride with our old friend senator ferris last night do we have audio im afraid not do i need to worry about this guy kennedy shook her head he has a meeting this morning with director miller weve already discussed the matter and miller assures me agent wilson will no longer be a problem good rapp said and then changing gears asked and the transcript i heard rick threw them a curveball or two stofer opened a black leather briefing folder thats right he tossed out a few names the names of people who as far as i know do not work for us who kennedy asked stofer adjusted his reading glasses and said aleksei garin svr directorate s stofer whistled thats going to be a tough one to swallow im not sure anyone over there has the balls to confront aleksei hes not afraid to put bullets in peoples heads everyone agreed and then stofer said shahram jafari head of irans atomic energy organization another tough one to swallow but theyre so damn paranoid they might make jafaris life miserable at least for a while theyll be turning themselves inside out trying to find out if jafari is a traitor the last one isnt so clean he identified nadeem ashan with the isi he doesnt work for us per se but we consider him a valuable ally why would rick throw ashans name in the mix rapp asked obrien poured himself a cup of coffee and said it could have been the first name that popped into his head anything to stop the pain you know how it goes rapp did but rickman was smarter than that he would have had a prearranged list in his head we should to look into ricks relationship with ashan see if theres anything there were already on it stofer said the main door to the office opened and stan hurley entered sorry im late what did i miss rapp looked at his mentor as he moved across the large office with his smooth amble for a seventyplusyearold with terminal cancer he sure didnt act like it hurleys gait was the only thing about him that was smooth he was a hard man with hard edges a hard personality and a craggy disposition this was the first time rapp had seen him since learning he had cancer for a split second he was about to stand to greet hurley maybe even give him a hug but the reaction lost steam as quickly as it had come on hurley wasnt a hugger he didnt like people touching him he called it an institutional hazard so instead rapp gave him a short nod of recognition kennedy and stofer quickly filled hurley in on what hed missed when they were done obrien filled the dead air by saying irene betty wants me to say some things to the press a few comments about rick and hub and their sacrifice kennedy nodded slowly thatd be nice thank you no one spoke for a long moment and eventually all eyes turned to rapp who was clutching and unclutching his hands as if he were doing some newage stress reduction exercise stofer spoke first mitch whats wrong rapp wasnt sure this was the time but he knew it was better to speak his mind now im sorry to spoil the party here but somethings not right whats not right kennedy asked were all breathing a big sigh of relief when i cant shake the feeling that were being set up im not sure i follow obrien said ricks dead rapp wasnt prepared to refute that point but neither was he convinced that rickman was no longer of this world i was at the safe house rapp said remembering the four dead bodyguards it was an extremely precise takedown the kind of op wed be proud of he said looking at hurley a stateoftheart security system taken offline without our watchers at langley having any idea four bullets four dead bodyguards and not a shot more all suppressed the safe is opened not cracked and ricks laptop files cash and god only knows what else goes missing and not a witness to any of it im not sure i follow stofer said earnestly kennedy rubbed her forehead she had known mitch wasnt going to be able to accept this nothing could ever be this simple stofer for his part was too reverential toward rapp having come up on the analytical side he had seen many of his predecessors manage the clandestine side of the business with condescension stofer worked extra hard to make sure the operatives felt that they were being heard you agree kennedy said that rick is dead rapp took a moment and then said im not sure obrien moaned come on mitch its not that complicated he dies right on the tape you can see the panic on the faces of the two goons when they realize what theyve done the anger in the third guys voice when he cant find a pulse yeah i know rapp said almost sounding as if he doubted himself and then the third guy executes the other two we know that was real because you guys found the bodies in the exact same position as they were last seen on the video but we dont have ricks body doesnt surprise me one bit obrien said with total confidence theyre trying to act like hes still alive theyre going to do a slow drip releasing snippets of the interrogation only they dont know we have the entire thing because the idiots took the sd card and didnt know the camera had an internal flash drive rapp wasnt so sure but he stuck with what he knew someone or more likely several men hit the safe house and they were extremely precise in their shots rick is then taken only a few hundred yards to another house presumably by the same guys the interrogation begins and a few days into it rick dies the third guy who is obviously in charge gets upset and empties a fifteenround magazine into these two goons who screwed up and your point is obrien asked as if all of this made perfect sense were shooters rapp said waving his thumb back and forth between hurley and himself if we had hit that safe house it would have been no different one shot in each guys head if wed brought scott along with his guys would have been some double taps but my point is theres always a pattern good shooters are disciplined shooters it doesnt matter how mad we get we dont empty magazines into people just because were pissed off all eyes moved to hurley to assess what he thought he ran his finger along his dry lips and nodded he has a point i think this could be an exception obrien said going through what they went through to get rick and then having him die after theyd broken him but had only scratched the surface obrien thought of himself in the same situation i might lose my focus for a second or two let my try it this way the people who hit the safe house were pros the two goons who beat up rick were not pros you can see it in the way they move the third guy rapp shook his head hes a different story when i watch him the video i cant help but think hes putting on an act for the camera thats a bit of a stretch mitch kennedy said it might be but have you guys heard about the ballistics from the safe house they all shook their heads no so rapp continued three of the bodyguards were shot in the center of the forehead with ninemillimeter rounds all of them were on the first floor the fourth guard was shot in the back of the head with a caliber round he was on the second floor moving toward the stairs probably responding to the commotion downstairs ricks personal sidearm was a kimber i heard some rumblings about this obrien said in obvious disagreement i think the fourth guard was the inside guy and rick found out at the last minute and shot him and the security system getting bypassed the bodyguards had the codes to arm and disarm it but they didnt have the codes to take it offline to shut the whole thing down cameras and all only rick could have done something like that or marcus not a bunch of clowns from the taliban they lived with rick kennedy said it would be entirely plausible for one of them to pick up on the codes okay how about the safe rapp said it was opened without any coercion sid checked it out there was blood all over the hallway on the second floor but not a speck on the safe she makes a very strong point that the safe was opened by someone who had not been injured at first i assumed rick just wasnt very tough they put a gun to his head and he opened the safe well if you believe everything you see in that video we find out hes pretty damn tough they would have had to slap him silly to get him to open that safe and there would have been some blood i dont know mitch stofer said shaking his head its pretty thin i know it is but you guys come on think about this for a minute put your covert ops hats on and think about how we plan stuff the lengths we go to to lay down deceptions to make something look a certain way when our main objective is something entirely different kennedy was all for open discussion but this type of thinking was what led to the old puzzle palace mentality where every other person in the building was a mole are you trying to say rick was in on this that he orchestrated his own kidnapping and then endured that horrific beating and that hes still alive rapp knew how preposterous it sounded but he couldnt shake the feeling that there was some piece of information that he couldnt access that would explain his suspicions he stood and walked over to the window im not sure what i think mitch i think youre way out on a limb here obrien was shaking his head in disagreement rapp turned to face the big irishman have you read sids preliminary report no read it study the photos from the safe house look at the precision put yourself in the shoes of the people that were trying to get their hands on rick it was perfect im not saying it wasnt obrien said refusing to see thing in rapps way now look at the other part of this the same group of professionals fuck up kill rick and then kill each other thats what we saw on the tape its pretty hard to argue with it sure is the same cool customers that took down our safe house go completely mental just a few days later and manage to capture it on a camcorder and leave it behind for us to find heat of the moment not everyone thinks as clearly as you do in pressure situations and some people are devious as all hell rapp said were seeing what we were seeing because we want to the alternative is fucking horrible rick is still alive and hes spilling the family jewels rapp moved back to his chair and said can any of you honestly tell me that you werent relieved when you saw rick die in that clip they all shook their heads our lives got significantly easier mitch stofer said i kind of see your point but these terrorists arent always the sharpest tools in the shed that they screwed up and their failure benefited our larger strategic goals doesnt mean were being duped i know rapp said but i cant shake the feeling that were not out of the woods we need to take a toptobottom look at this we need to figure what happened to all of the money rick was spreading around where the hell is his laptop and do we have any idea what was on it and the whole time were looking wed better be asking ourselves one question whats that kennedy said what if they wanted us to find that camcorder oh come on it was obrien this is so thin kennedy had her eyes on hurley she could tell he was taking a trip down memory lane accessing his large database of reallife experiences stan what are you thinking hurley didnt hear the question right away his mind was elsewhere thinking about the way the game used to be played i think mitch might have a point then again he could be totally wrong but we cant afford not to explore it im not sure we can afford to explore it obrien said the harsh truth is that rick is dead and a lot of people want him to stay that way hurley started to grumble the way he did when he was about to get angry after saying a few things to himself he said so our new protocol on shit like this is to stick our heads in the sand thats one of the dumbest fucking things ive ever heard an outsider would be left to think that obrien would be wounded by hurleys harsh words but theyd all worked with him so long they didnt take the rebukes personally take this thing back to the beginning hurley said and it looks like we were being played i dont think the taliban are sophisticated enough to have done this they may have played a role provided some manpower they may have even taken down the safe house but they sure as hell didnt hire gould whoever was behind this moved pieces around the chessboard like the soviets used to do they knew mitch enough that they could dangle that information in front of him about the dog and hed jump on it they had to have been monitoring hubbard because minutes after he told mitch where the vets office was they put gould into play and called in their corrupt police general to clean up the mess thats not the taliban way too complicated stofer looked confused are you saying the russians are behind this hurley shrugged he hadnt thought that specifically but anything was possible i dont know whos behind it but whoever it is is one devious bastard they set this thing up and played us im inclined to agree with mitch anyone who goes to that much trouble doesnt leave the bodies and camera for us to find unless they want us to find them kennedy felt another headache coming and it wasnt because she was mad at hurley and rapp it was because she knew they were right they had been suckered into thinking they had dodged a bullet obrien started to argue with hurley and rapp kennedy stood and walked back to her desk none of them noticed she opened her top left drawer and grabbed bottle of tylenol she tapped out two little red pills into her hand and washed them down with a drink of water gentlemen she said they ignored her so she raised her voice until they all stopped talking and turned their heads in her direction we need his body until then we are going to work on the assumption that he is alive she saw obrien start to open his mouth and her hand shot out like a traffic cops our official stance is that hes dead but unofficially we are going to start digging if for no other reason than to find out which intelligence agency was behind this rapp stood feeling full of energy for the first time since hed woken up in the hospital he buttoned his suit coat and said and when we find out who was behind this we will send him a very personal message chapter fbi headquarters washington dc joel wilson didnt mind that his entire career was in the balance at least that was the conclusion hed come to while shaving this morning rather than crumble he took it as a challenge washington was a universally corrupt town and that corruption did not stop at the doors of the fbi wilson had been fighting it his entire career and although there were times like this when he felt as if he was the only noble person in the building that he took solace in the fact that there were men like senator cal ferris who understood what was at stake now the big question was when was ferris going to jump in and save him the senator was cautious to a point and then he came out with both guns blazingusually on tv ferriss strategy was growing on him director miller had made a tactical error when he recalled the team from afghanistan it was now documented that he had interfered in an important investigation and had plainly come down on the side of the cia this was the type of toehold that ferris could use to drag miller before the judicial committee when the time was right and wilson would be the star witness wilson didnt like playing down his relationship with ferris especially this morning when it seemed entirely possible that his career was about to suffer serious harm washington in general was sympathetic to kennedys plight but that would all change when the truth came out about rickman and rapp the misuse of government funds was a serious crime but the brazenness with which rickman and rapp had abused the trust congress afforded to the black side of intelligence was nothing short of a major breach in national security wilson speculated that they were the tip of the iceberg others in the clandestine service were likely involved wilsons next move if he stayed in his post was to look into john hubbard was it possible that mitch rapp had killed hubbard for fear that he was about to expose him could rapp have been behind rickmans abduction and executionagain to protect himself or to take all of the money they had been ferreting away anything was possible when discussing these clandestine warriors they were a bunch of degenerates if they werent working for the cia a good number of them would be criminals during wilsons fitful nights sleep he considered whistleblower status while the idea in a grand operatic sense was appealing it was also extremely risky martyrs in washington were always vilified by one side of the aisle and sanctified by the other it would be a tough slog probably three to four years in the end either he would be disgraced and unemployable with his pension gone or he would receive a gigantic eightfigure judgment and become a minicelebrity with the antimilitary intelligence establishment hed probably even have a movie made about his gutsy decision to speak truth to power the lure of hollywood a book deal and publicly exposing the corruption at langley was extremely tempting it wasnt that wilson lacked confidence in his abilities he truly believed he was better than any three people in this town but the cia was more than three people it was a building filled with individuals whose job it was to lie cheat and steal they couldnt be trusted to wage any kind of war in a fair honorable way no wilson feared he might be able to use the whistleblower statute to scare his bosses but it wouldnt intimidate the cia for a second they would find a way to win in the end if this got worse wilson would have to get the media involved it was his only hope for success it was nice to have ferris in his corner but the fbi was still an organization with rules and regulations and a very strong chain of command wilson had wandered off into dangerous territory in order to keep hargrave in the dark technically the old coot had him but wilson had a few surprises in store for him it was all going to come down to director miller and how much latitude he was willing to give him wilson was sitting in the directors outer office trying his best to ignore the hulking bodyguards and predict how his bosses would come after him hed been waiting for more than an hour which could not be a good sign director miller was militant when it came to punctuality hargrave with a stick up his ass was sure to have everything documented wilson could see him in there right now with his ridiculously bushy eyebrows pompously and meticulously going over every perceived transgression wilson was filled with hatred for the man and was putting the final brushstrokes on his plan to take him down when director millers personal assistant told him it was time to go in wilson stood and picked up his briefcase the secretary was a very attractive brunette with brown bedroom eyes wilson flashed her a smile and said so this must be what they felt like before they were led to the gallows the woman ignored his attempt at humor with a blank stare and then turned her attention to her computer screen wilson in a rare moment of insecurity wondered if she was privy to his transgressions and had already passed judgment he straightened his tie and prepared for the onslaught as he put his hand on the doorknob he told himself that there would come a day where this repugnant little woman and lot of other people would be apologizing to him wilson stepped into the office closed the door and tried to remain confident as he faced the people arrayed around the twentyperson conference table wilson had expected director miller and hargrave and maybe someone from the general counsels office but he didnt expect to see lisa williams the director of the intelligence division and jason smith who ran the office of congressional affairs perhaps the most ominous sign however was the presence of wilsons direct boss david taylor who was on medical leave after back surgery as he took a quick glance at the five faces he didnt find a welcoming or supportive expression among them wilson fought the urge to sit at the far end of the table and across from director miller the distance would have made things even more awkward so he picked his way down the right side of the long table and grabbed the seat next to david taylor wilson set his briefcase on the floor and looked at taylor who was wearing a white plastic clamshell that encased his upper body from his neck down to his torso the device was velcroed into place at the shoulders and on the sides taylor looked extremely uncomfortable how are you feeling wilson asked taylor looked at wilson but made no effort to speak lets get right to it started an impatient director miller he pointed his pen at wilson and said do have anything youd like to say in your defense before we get started wilson felt his throat tighten while he chided himself for not coming to see miller the second he landed it was a mistake to cede the discussion to hargrave it was obvious by the pissedoff look on millers face that the well had been poisoned with his options limited he started with the avenue that seemed most natural director i have no idea what ead hargrave has been telling you but i can assure you that there is another side to this extremely complicated and important investigation and i have some very good reasons for not keeping ead hargrave up to speed on every aspect of it wilson leaned back and took a deep breath hoping miller would slow things down and at least be openminded miller did not pause he instead forcefully stated how things were to proceed in light of the fact that he was a former federal judge that shouldnt have been surprising i dont want to hear innuendo i dont want to hear rumors do we understand each other yes good miller looked at his watch and said start sir with all due respect i think ead hargrave is not in the best position to judge me and the actions of my team taylor with his stiff back brace held up a hand and didnt bother to try to look at anyone as his neck couldnt move we are not here to discuss the men and women on your team this is solely about you and your behavior fine wilson said trying to sound reasonable ead hargrave is not in the best position to judge me and why is that director miller asked because of his extremely close relationship with director kennedy millers face twisted into a look of disapproval while he leaned forward and tapped the screen of an ipad several times wilson heard his voice emanate from the overhead speakers oh im reading you loud and clear are you still recording our conversation because i want to make sure you get this part i didnt tell you any of this because i cant trust you because the entire counterintelligence division knows that youre too close to director kennedy and based on what ive experienced the last few days im inclined to believe those rumors so you better get ready for your own board of inquiry wilson remembered the words all too well at the time he had spewed them at hargrave it felt good hearing them now in this setting they seemed foolish this is a fairly serious accusation miller picked up a pen and held it just above the surface of a yellow legal pad which employees of the counterintelligence division believe that sam is too close to dci kennedy sir im here to answer for myself im not comfortable involving other people in this but youre comfortable enough to throw around wild accusations miller stared at wilson waiting for a reply its not that sir its just that im willing to answer for my own opinions but im not going to get any of my people into trouble miller turned to taylor david you ran that division for three and half years at any point during that time did you hear anyone complain that sam was too cozy with dci kennedy not a single person how about anyone else at the cia nope well miller said setting down his pen thats a pretty short list your case doesnt look very strong at the moment we have protocols in place for a reason and it is not up to you to decide when you may or may not follow them so this is your last chance why did you think you couldnt trust ead hargrave wilson cleared his throat and drummed his fingers on the table for a minute this was a card hed hoped he wouldnt have to play but he really had no choice senator ferris told me that ead hargrave was not to be trusted in this matter and that i should try to run my investigation without his interference miller made a great show of taking notes as he scratched away he asked tell me joel im pretty familiar with the bureaus organizational chart but i must have missed something just where does senator ferriss name appear on that chart it doesnt sir jason miller said turning to the head of the fbis office of congressional affairs i assume joel followed protocol and reported his discussions with senator ferris to your office he did not were you aware in any way that joel was working with senator ferris no we had no idea wilson could see how bad this looked his only hope was to get to heart of the corruption sir i dont want peoples animosity toward the senator to cloud their judgment careful miller snapped like a judge warning a wayward attorney were not talking about feelings or opinions were sticking to the facts right now and so far the facts are looking an awful lot like you willfully withheld information from your superior and that you failed to inform congressional affairs that you were running an investigation based on information passed along to you by senator ferris thats not true sir i received independent information that employees of the cia were stealing millions of dollars in cash and placing the money in a private bank in switzerland wilson grabbed the file from his briefcase and slid it toward the director i have the accounts and the amounts and dates of the deposits along with a sworn affidavit from the private banker who handled the accounts in the affidavit the banker swears that both joe rickman and mitch rapp were the owners of these accounts and how did you come by this information miller asked the first batch in the mail and then i interviewed the banker myself hes a very credible witness miller looked at the file that affidavit is in this file yes it is sir miller flipped through the pages until he found what he was looking for the bankers name has been blacked out for security reasons sir miller picked up his pen again lets have it wilson squirmed sir i would rather not reveal that name until the investigation is on firmer ground you will either give me the name or you will give me your badge and your sidearm wilson saw no way out leo obrecht and this first batch of information you mentioned let me take a wild guess it was given to you by an anonymous source because of the nature of our work we receive a good number of anonymous tips are you familiar with swiss banking somewhat sir miller placed his hands on the file and how easy do you think it is to come by information like this i wouldnt know sir lisa miller said the head of the bureaus intelligence division said extremely difficult sir we spend months on end trying to just find out if a person of interest has an account at an institution like this getting our hands on detailed account records is extremely rare miller closed the file did it ever occur to you that this is disinformation it did until i was able to interview the banker lisa miller barked how difficult is it to get these bankers to talk about private accounts im unaware of it happening without an order from a swiss court did you have a court order no did it ever occur to you that these were legitimate accounts legitimate how you do understand that the cia has to move money around the world yes and that because theyre the cia they need to do a lot of it in a secretive manner wilson nodded all the more reason we need to keep an eye on them miller shook his head youre not getting this are you getting what sir that youve fucked this thing up so bad youll be lucky if you have a job by the time this is over with all due respect shut up miller barked lisa please explain to senator ferriss man whats going on it appears that a hostile foreign intelligence agency launched an operation against the cias clandestine service we believe that part of that operation involved sending disinformation to the fbis counterintelligence division wilson frowned says who the cia this is bullshit where did you get this information im afraid its classified williams looked from wilson to the director wilson wasnt going to go down so easily my clearance is as high as yours your clearance used to be as high as lisas director miller said what is going on here i dont get it the fact that a few of you dont like senator ferris doesnt mean this information is false you need to allow me to finish my investigation give me thirty minutes with rapp ill hook him up to a polly and well get some answers miller shook his head ive decided to pull your clearance until an official review can be completed but you have to let me take a shot at rapp lisa williams the only woman in the room looked at wilson like he was nuts and said do you have any idea who you are talking about you mean rapp yeah i know who im talking about hes dirty and hes corrupt and i dont understand why everyone is so afraid of taking him on miller shook his finger at wilson and said lets get something straight first off you could polly mitch rapp for the next year and you wouldnt get a thing out of him i disagree sir stop interrupting me you have no idea what youre talking about rapp would eat you for lunch beyond that you dont know jack shit about the man hes a damn national hero youve been played joel and youve made the fbi look like a bunch of fools miller hit the intercom button and said please send her in turning his attention back to wilson he said you are on indefinite administrative leave until i say otherwise if you are lucky enough to keep your badge i can promise you that you will be assigned to some benign post where you can do as little damage as possible wilson was reeling in his wildest dreams he hadnt imagined it could get this bad and then the door opened and it got worse director kennedy stopped directly across from wilson she placed a document on the wood surface and slid it across the table after wilson caught it she said i assume you recognize the legal document in your hands wilsons scanned the heading it was a national security non disclosure contract if you flip to the last page youll see your signature wilson went to the last page and noted his signature hed signed the document when he went to work for counterintelligence he began to slide the document back to kennedy i think we should be looking at your kennedy reached out and stopped him from moving the document another inch that copy is for you i suggest you read it and then you find a really good lawyer a private one who will more than likely be very expensive because the fbi will not be supplying you with counsel on this little screwup what are you talking about you dont decide what the fbi does or doesnt do wilson looked to miller no i dont but i do run the cia and we have a very good legal department and we happen to have a very good working relationship with some federal judges who take national security issues quite seriously we havent even begun to investigate you and weve already come across three instances in which you are in violation of your national security contract im no lawyer agent wilson but they tell me if we want to press the issue we could have your ass thrown in a highsecurity federal facility for months you screwed up here bigtime and if you want to avoid jail you had better start to show some serious cooperation or at a bare minimum shut your mouth and crawl under some rock but this is your only warning if you run to ferris or try to claim victimhood i will have your ass thrown in jail you cant intimidate me kennedy realized wilson didnt get it im not trying to intimidate you im telling you the facts you have screwed up like very few people in your position can screw up you signed that document in your hands and we happen to take it very seriously do yourself a favor and find a lawyer who has had some experience with this type of thing he will tell you that if i decide push this you will go to jail if you have everything all locked up then why dont you do it wilson asked kennedy in an overconfident tone kennedy looked to miller and said im done with him the mans a fool if you can talk some sense into him by this evening ill call the dogs off if not my people will be in federal court in the morning kennedy turned and left without saying another word wilson looked at his five colleagues and incredulously said cant you see whats going on she wants me to drop this because she knows im on to something when no one reacted wilson looked at david taylor whom hed worked closely with for the last three years david dont you see whats going on taylor spun his chair to his left with his back brace it was the only way he could look wilson in the eye do you know what your problem is joel you think youre the only noble person in this town come on im serious the rest of us are all corrupt or greedy our motives are suspect but not you youre above all of that youre a fucking martyr and you brought this all down on yourself because youre an arrogant knowitall even in the face of all of this you cant see that youve screwed up director miller looked at him with pure disgust maybe youd gain a little more perspective from our field office in bismarck north dakota chapter virginia the house was forty minutes northwest of langley just past dulles international airport a couple who had retired from the clandestine service after putting in thirtyplus years were listed as the owners of the sprawling property they were now consultants for the cia and continued to be paid a generous salary but they rarely made the commute to the george bush center for intelligence their job was to manage the fortysevenacre compound and its various buildings the place was lowkey concealed behind rows of trees a fence and nothing more than a single gate there were no guard dogs or men wandering the perimeter with machine guns even to the more discerning eye there was very little to see the perimeter security was all microwave trip wires and heat sensors and miniature cameras the system itself was automated with a software program that could distinguish a deer from a man to limit false alarms the bulk of the security was in the house all the windows were fixed bulletproof plexiglas and the interior had been demolished to the studs because of the lessons learned from overseas embassy attacks the walls were now reinforced with ballistic fabric and the doors were all titanium covered in wood veneer the basement contained two holding cells an interrogation room and a panic room as a last and unlikely resort should the security on the first floor be breached rapp was in the study on the main floor sitting in a black herman miller lounge chair a man in an identical chair sat six feet away on the other side of the fireplace hearth asking questions and taking notes the man dr lewis was the resident shrink for the cias clandestine service he had known rapp for a long time he adjusted his glasses at the corner and said your wife what about her how much do you remember rapp remembered all of it or at least he thought he did it was a strange process to relive it all for a second time and it wasnt all bad the good memories came back as well as the bad ones rapp recognized that might be a good thing to share with lewis to a certain extent you had to share with the man or he simply deemed you unfit for the field and the only thing more unnerving to a clandestine officer than a therapy session was being confined to a cubicle at langley there was also a feeling of trust with the doctor it was similar to way he had felt with kennedy when hed awakened in the hospital there was also a feeling that he was not typically a very trusting person at first it was just the pain the bad memories the loss the feeling that i would never be able to recover it all came flooding back and how did that feel rapp laughed defensively like shit how do you think it felt lewis nodded and scribbled a quick note no i would imagine that was not an enjoyable experience he stopped writing and then what happened the good memories came back meeting each other dating falling in love that didnt take long and then the wedding we were really happy i was really happy rapp looked into the fire for a moment and said i dont think i was ever happier lewis nodded i would say thats probably true rapp pulled his gaze away from the fire did you know her i only met her once but ive watched you grow up in this business i did your original psych evals twentysome years ago ive watched you through the good and the bad and you definitely had an extra bounce in your step during the time you just described rapps gaze fell back to the fireplace in a strange way i want that again what exactly do you mean what anna and i had i want to find that again how have i been since she was killed lewis did not like vague questions could you be more specific as a person did i change was i the same what was i like i would say your grieving process was not untypical youre holding something back rapp said putting a hard stare on lewis lewis thought of kennedy and the way she described how rapp could look right through her at times you were understandably angry violent yes lewis said with a nod although violence is a part of this business but i was more violent than before yes you lacked patience not that you ever had a great deal of it to begin with but after annas death you seemed to lose any tolerance for dissent did it interfere with my work lewis thought about that for a long moment and then said as far as i know it did not but i think you should ask irene youre holding back again there was some concern that you were growing a bit too reckless taking too many chances always pushing ahead even when it made more sense to pause and regroup that sounded familiar to rapp he remembered the rage he remembered killing certain people and feeling satisfaction that the person would never take another breath it was actually gratifying rapp had spent some time trying to remember all of the people hed killed it was like a photo album of assholes the whos who of terrorists assassins arms dealers corrupt financiers and intelligence operatives the trip down memory lane was devoid of guilt back to the good memories lewis said in an effort to steer the conversation back to a point of interest how did they make you feel good rapp shrugged thats why they call them good memories lewis laughed and scratched another note rapp frowned as a distant memory came back to him didnt i tell you once that i dont like you taking notes looking as if hed been caught lewis set his pen down and said yes you did and we came to some kind of an agreement lewis nodded if i would be more open then youd stop taking notes lewis coughed slightly and then said thats correct so what gives its a habit lewis said sheepishly were you trying to test my memory a little bit after pointing at the note pad rapp pointed at the fire lewis tore out the top three pages and tossed them into the fire now lewis said back to the good memories for the third time tell me about them i was happy rapp got a faroff gaze in his eyes i remembered how close we were how it was hard to be apart and when we were together we couldnt keep our hands off each other and you remember making love jeez doc rapp said fidgeting in his chair come on cant i keep some of this shit to myself lewis smiled yes you may i dont need to know everything its just good to know that youre no longer repressing those memories i did that yes i tried to get you to talk about her on several occasions but you became so enraged that i had to drop it did i threaten you the question caught lewis so offguard he began to laugh nervously what your mere presence is a threat to many people and to you no lewis shook his head ive known you a long time and youve never threatened me but you need to understand that you are very good at what you do and you have some anger issues after your wife was murdered there was a bit of fear that you had become more volatile rapp didnt like that sound of that like i couldnt control myself yes did i ever cross that line mmmm no but i came close yes this didnt sound good i think i need a drink why rapp grimaced i dont like hearing this lewis took this as a good sign progress with rapp was rare and should be celebrated i could use a drink as well come on follow me the two men left the study and moved down the hall to the open living room and kitchen rapp was surprised to find kennedy in the kitchen a series of files spread out on the table in front of her kennedy looked up and asked hows it going rapp shrugged not feeling that it was his place to judge his progress or lack thereof its going well lewis said kennedy could tell by the tone of lewiss voice that he was sincere which got her wondering how is his memory good a lot of things are coming back lewis grabbed a bottle of cabernet and started searching through drawers he found a corkscrew in the third drawer and opened the bottle he grabbed two glasses and held one up for kennedy please rapp had filled a tumbler with ice and was standing in front of a bar cart in the living room his right hand dancing over the tops of the bottles would one of you please remind me what it is that i like to drink a look of distress washed over kennedys face and she shared a look of concern with lewis im just kidding rapp announced vodka occasionally scotch or whiskey gin and tonic in the summer margaritas when i eat at a mexican restaurant a little highend tequila when im south of the border and i think i got sick on campari once rapp started pouring some grey goose into a glass that was years ago of course i think it was stans fault thats more than i knew lewis shot kennedy a raised eyebrow i do remember hearing something about you not being able to hold your liquor rapp came back to the kitchen table and pulled out a chair i think my problem was that i was dumb enough to think i could go for drink for drink with stan rapps entire body convulsed at the thought not a fun memory speaking of memories kennedy said as lewis handed her a glass of wine thank you speaking of memories how do you feel about switzerland rapp took a sip of vodka and said switzerland nice country could you be more specific banking bankers actually do you remember doing any business with swiss bankers over the years of course herr ohlmeyer and then his sons this isnt about his granddaughter greta is it rapp had had a relationship with the woman years ago no not that i know of is there something youd like to tell me about greta not very professional rapp said with a disappointing shake of the head hows that just because i had this little knock in the head that doesnt mean you guys get to go on a fishing expedition through my memories it was worth a try lewis said with a shrug ive never found him to be this cooperative i agree kennedy said as if rapp wasnt present is there a chance hell stay like this lewis made a great show of pondering the possibility and then shook his head i think hell be the same old combative illtempered man he always was his authority issues cant say for sure but it stands to reason that those will reemerge as he regresses to his old ways you two are hilarious why dont we ever spend any time talking about your issues kennedy and lewis looked at each other and at the same time said because we dont have any as they laughed at their own joke rapp looked on with a deep frown bankers we were talking about bankers sorry kennedy said as she took a sip of wine bankers she set down the wineglass grabbed a blue folder spun it toward rapp and opened it to reveal a photograph of a man who looked to be in his midfifties does this man look familiar to you rapp shook his head ive never seen him youre sure yes could it be a blind spot maybe itll come to you later thats not how its worked so far when you show me photos or tell me something it triggers something that helps me remember this guy rapp waved his hand over the photo theres nothing no sense that ive ever met him or know anything about him interesting kennedy pulled the file back and flipped through a few pages what about these photos kennedy laid out a photo of an office building and another one of a house nothing he works at a secondtier bank sparkasse schaffhausen located in district five gewerbeschule quarter i know where that is why do i know that place rapp asked himself his mind was filled with visions of a dark street and a gunfight i think i killed someone not far from there kennedy gave him a blank stare for a long moment and then said thats correct two people actually you killed them not far from there and then fled to the gewerbeschule quarter i remember rapp grabbed the file from kennedy and held up the photo of the banker tell me about him a herr obrecht we dont know much about him ive made a few discreet calls but our people dont seem to run in the same circles as he does is this the banker who claims im stealing money yes and rick as well thats right director miller showed me the affidavit the banker claims to have met you twice and rick on five separate occasions each time the man says the two of you converted cash into bearer bonds and placed them in a safety deposit box and how did this agent wilson come across herr obrecht an anonymous tip come on kennedy nodded i know its ridiculous this is bullshit after looking into his drink for a long moment rapp said hypothetically if i was going to steal money from langley wouldnt i be a little better at covering my tracks i mean we have five accounts in switzerland that we use to fund various operations right rapp asked not trusting his memory thats correct so why use some secondtier banker who i dont know and cant trust im afraid thats a question were going to have to ask herr obrecht the excitement on rapps face was obvious please tell me we have him we have him under surveillance and nothing so far other than some contacts with a few unsavory types in the world of swiss banking however thats hardly an indictment how about i go have a chat with him rapp raised and eyebrow in anticipation this was the old rapp extremely results oriented and rarely willing to sit back and let things unfold kennedy was torn between letting him do what he was so good at and the potential fallout if things didnt go well the fbi was firmly behind her at the moment but with senator ferris lurking about who knew what next week would bring if i send you what are you going to ask him rapp looked at her as if it were a trick question how about why did you lie to the fbi and say that i did business with you you piece of shit kennedy frowned not very subtle rapp looked at lewis was i known for being subtle before i hit my head lewis sighed and said im afraid subtlety has never been your thing chapter islamabad pakistan in the upper left corner of the fiftyinch flatscreen tv a single car passed through the main gate of bahria town general durrani took in a drag from his cigarette ignored the anchor on al jazeera and focused on the smaller picture the next part of his plan was so ingenious that he had kept it from rickman so he could see the mans shock and then admiration as the audacity of it sank in he couldnt wait to see the surprise on his accomplices face when everything was revealed dr bhutani had arrived the previous evening and after spending an hour with the patient bhutani informed durrani that his decision to call him had been the right one rickman had a degree temperature a ruptured testicle severely bruised kidneys four broken ribs and a shattered left orbital socket and those were just the most immediate concerns there were too many scrapes and bruises to count and bhutani had no idea if any other organs had been damaged the doctor was no fool he knew the importance of durranis job and he knew his comrade placed an extremely high premium on secrecy so after finishing his examination bhutani said to durrani that man needs to be in a hospital i dont suppose you will allow that no durrani offered brusquely and he doesnt want to go to a hospital either state secrets yes you may trust me as always bhutani then took a long moment to consider the care of this intriguing patient whom he had already identified as an american antibiotics will go a long way to making sure we nurse him back to health but there are some things we must keep an eye on if we cannot get the fever down with antibiotics then im afraid we really will have to move him to a hospital if you want him to survive would you like me to quietly explore some options durrani frowned and said it is imperative that you do not speak to anyone of this i understand bhutani placed a caring hand on the generals arm i will speak to no one but i will see where we can take him if we absolutely have to i have some ideas in the meantime you will need to come up with an official explanation a cover i think you call it i have already taken care of that durrani said with a wink may i send a nurse over someone we can trust when durrani hesitated the doctor said it is essential that we monitor his vitals every hour until we think he is out of danger seeing that durrani wasnt convinced he added i know who i can trust people who believe in what you are doing in what we are doing durrani weighed the need for secrecy against the possibility of rickmans dying he could always kill the nurse if he felt the need to but if rickman died there was no bringing him back the nurse might also help avoid having to bring him to a hospital which would be a very difficult environment to control fine but just one nurse she can train one of my men what to do when she needs to sleep she must never speak of any of this never i will make sure of it durrani then attempted to hand the doctor an envelope filled with cash bhutani vehemently refused and when durrani insisted the doctor was insulted telling durrani that everyone must do his part in the defense of pakistan and that this was his contribution the nurse had showed up within the hour she was an ugly fat thing and durrani decided almost immediately that the woman would have to die she had spent the night at rickmans side taking care of his every need and giving him the appropriate drugs and fluids as needed now durrani snatched the handset from his office phone and pressed the page button and then a second button for the guesthouse living room after a series of long beeps kassar answered in his disinterested voice the nurse durrani said send her to the other guesthouse tell her to take a twohour break and that you will come get her when you need her is your friend here durrani glanced at the security feed almost i dont want the nurse to see him what does it matter you are going to kill her anyway she doesnt need to see this and stop questioning my decisions just do what i say durrani replaced the handset and wondered if it was time to get rid of kassar the problem would be replacing the man he was so good at what he did durrani doubted he could find someone to fill his shoes any time soon durrani returned his attention to the flatscreen tv in time to see the black range rover pull up to his private gate his men did a quick inspection of the vehicle by running a mirror underneath and then checking the trunk cargo area when the vehicle was cleared durrani stabbed out his cigarette stood and walked down the long hallway stopping just short of the foyer after fifteen months of hard work the decisive moment was upon him he looked at his reflection in a fulllength mirror with a thick gold frame after adjusting the black beret on his head he adjusted his tan tunic to make sure all the buttons were centered his left breast was covered with four rows of ribbons and each collar had two gold stars in a sea of red pleased with his impressive image durrani moved to the front door and opened it in time to see his guest emerging from the range rover larry durrani yelled with a wave one of durranis bodyguards was waving a black magnetic wand over his guest more for show than anything durrani yelled at the guard no need for that hes fine larry come the general stood beaming with anticipation waving his right arm for his american friend to join him the american was wearing a khaki suit with a blue buttondown shirt he walked casually across the stone courtyard with a warm smile on his face general good to see you and you too larry larry lee was an american expatriate from wichita kansas he was an engineer who specialized in petroleum refineries i cant get over how beautiful your house turned out lee stopped and did a degree turn taking it all in and your house will be just as beautiful not quite but it is nice of you to say durrani had purchased a smaller lot next door for lee his business partner lee had started building at the same time as durrani but was still months away from finishing lee complained that the contractors took advantage of him but durrani had talked to the builder and found out that the engineer in lee made it very difficult because he wanted to inspect and sign off on every piece of work the two men shook hands and durrani said how long until your house is complete lee shrugged as if to say your guess is a good as anyones they tell me two months but ill believe it when i see it i will see if i can hurry them along durrani said with a wink as he grabbed lee by the elbow whispering in his ear he said there is something that i want to show you he led lee by the elbow into the house halfway down the hall to the study durrani stopped and pressed the button for the elevator lee looked surprised the basement yes did you put in a pistol range lee asked hopefully no i did not think of that durrani stroked his mustache and then laughed that is a wonderful idea i will have my architect look into it they stepped into the elevator and lee took the opportunity to lecture durrani about the engineering of an indoor pistol range durrani couldnt get off the elevator fast enough hed had about all he could take of this condescending american he showed him to the secure door and punched in his code i didnt know you had tunnels lee said as he walked along the cement floor i had them installed for security durrani continued the small talk until they reached the door that led to the smaller of the two guesthouses as they started up the stairs lee asked what did you want to show me these tunnels are very convenient i think we should think about putting another one in between our two properties yes i never thought of that by the time they got to the top of the stairs durrani was out of breath lee continued to talk and eventually got around to asking a question durrani held up a hand signaling that he was out of breath while his other hand searched for his pack of cigarettes you know those things are going to kill you right as your business partner i have every right to get on you about stopping if you die our partnership will go up in flames there were so many things that durrani wanted to say but instead he stuffed a cigarette between his two lips and nodded in agreement kassar appeared standing at the edge of the sunken living room vazir durrani said you remember larry of course kassar said with a nod of recognition durrani took in several deep drags which in a strange way seemed to settle his breathing after exhaling a big cloud of smoke he waved for lee to follow him as they walked down the hallway durrani began talking in a quiet voice what im about to show you is a real tragedy i have another american friend who was savagely beaten by a group of street thugs in rawalpindi i have arranged for him to recover here where he will be safe it is embarrassing the way my countrymen treat our greatest allies at times not everyone is so rude your behavior alone general helps a great deal why thank you durrani stopped outside the closed door and said give me a moment alone with him and then ill call for you of course durrani slid into the room and closed the door he approached the bed still not used to the ugly sight before him are you awake rickman was lying with three pillows beneath his back he let his head fall to his left and said yes good i see you can barely open one of your eyes the nurse has been making me ice every hour its torture but thats good isnt it rickman ignored the question and said youre going to kill her arent you why must you always assume the worst in me because you have a history of killing people when they no longer serve your plans oh that durrani said with a smile refusing to let rickmans sour mood spoil this special moment and you are such an angel my friend we both do what we must do that is why we work so well together the nurse durrani sighed what about her why do you have to kill her stop it we have more important things to discuss i need to show you something what you will see durrani was back at the door he opened it a foot and signaled for lee to join him he held his finger to his lips and said we must speak softly durrani walked back to the bed with lee at his side my god was all lee could manage to say i know its horrible kids did this i wouldnt exactly say that grown men really lees face was a combination of shock and revulsion who is he have i met him im fairly certain you have never met durrani looked at rickman joe have you ever met this man rickman craned his head back and through a narrow slit in his right eye he took in a blurry image of the man he gave his answer through his swollen vaselineladen lips no was he in a bad neighborhood the kansan asked you could say that that is why ive warned you that you must be very careful this is horrible have you contacted the police no durrani shook his head we dont need to get them involved my men will handle things and his family a devilish smile creased durranis lips ah like you he has no family where is he from denver i think is that right joe rickman sounded bored yes is there anything i can do to help lee asked with genuine concern as a matter of fact there is durrani said with a huge smile he glanced over his shoulder and gave the signal to kassar looking back at lee he made an apologetic face and said if you would die it would be a huge help lees face twisted into a confused frown kassar had put on his gloves while they were talking and had casually unfolded the plastic bag in one fell swoop he yanked the bag over lees head and yanked it tight around his neck kassar had learned this little trick many years ago the key was to wear gloves because the victim always scratched and clawed at your hands one time though a very uncooperative victim had been smart enough to shred the plastic covering his face it had turned out to be an ugly lessthanprofessional kill as they ended up rolling around on the floor kassar had used the remnants of the bag to strangle the man but had not walked away unscathed his slightly crooked nose was a constant reminder that he needed to continue to refine his craft the trashbag manufacturer glad solved his problem when they came out with their tearproof forceflex bags this particular american was easy to handle he was neither violent nor physical and all kassar had to do was keep him from breaking some of the furniture he kept a firm grip on the bag and danced the man around in the ample space between the bed and the door the script was nearly identical every time the wild arms swinging the body twisting both hands clutching to pry his hands loose and then one hand dropping as fatigue set in and then the other until the victim was spent and simply collapsed kassar lowered lee to the floor gently as if he was laying him down for a long nap he knelt beside the body and kept the bag tight for a ten count when he was confident that lee wasnt about to jerk back to life he yanked on the two red strings tied them off and stood well done durrani said with respect thank you kassar was pleased with his steady heart rate what do you think durrani said turning to rickman rickman was no stranger to murder but this little orchestrated event seemed particularly absurd to him he stifled a cough and said i have no idea what you are up to he is a gift to you he is your new identity look at him durrani pointed at the floor rickman didnt bother lifting his head he has a bag over his head hmm durrani rubbed his upper lip and then said never mind he is the same height as you and he has same hair color i found him over a year ago and made him a business partner on several very lucrative deals i am building him a house on the property next to this one it is beautiful it is where you will stay rickmans head hurt and he could sense that oxycontin hed taken four hours ago was beginning to wear off so i will assume this mans identity durrani clapped his hands together exactly you will have to hide you will have a life and you will be hiding in plain sight the americans will never figure it out the plastic surgeon he will be here in two days the scope of durranis new twist was starting to sink in you will make me look like him yes durrani said excitedly you will study his past i have compiled a detailed dossier for you with photographs and every imaginable detail his parents are dead and his only relative is a sister in hawaii whom he has no contact with he is what do you call a fellow american who leaves your country an expatriate yes that is it he is an expatriate for the few people who know him i will let them know that he was set upon by thieves in rawalpindi and suffered a savage beating it will explain your surgery and the swelling for the next few months but best of all you will now have a past a legend excuse me rickman was thinking in the business we call it a legend yes well whatever you call it this will give you more freedom and if your former employers ever digs into your new identity they wont find anything suspicious rickman had to admit that it was a very good tweak to their plan the plan had been for him to get a new face and take on a fake name they reasoned if he kept a lowenough profile the cia would never notice but this was even better i must applaud you general this is an improvement you are welcome durrani said with a short bow then directing his attention to kassar he said bring him through the tunnels to the garage and then when its dark out take him to the incinerator hold on a minute rickman said with a sinking feeling i thought vazir was supposed to be handling my problem in zurich he is he will leave first thing in the morning rickman was gripped with panic and began cursing himself for taking the pain pills i told you the banker had to be dealt with immediately calm down vazir needed to take care of this first and now he is going to rid you of your problem but i told you it had to happen immediately if rapp discovers him we are going to have some serious problems i have heard that mr rapp has some other problems he is dealing with durrani sounded very pleased that information you sent the fbi agent has worked the agent is running an investigation on rapp now when vazir kills the banker it will make rapp and the cia look that much more guilty i have instructed vazir to make the murder look sensational bad idea rickman suddenly felt as if he was dealing with an amateur if you want it to look like rapp put a single bullet in obrechts head front or back kassar asked doesnt matter just so long as obrecht is dead ninemillimeter sig kassar asked wondering what caliber gun was rapps preference for something close like this hed use a nine millimeter kassar nodded with confidence rickman was suddenly back in operation mode wishing he was healthy enough to go along and direct kassar and his men how many people are you bringing i was planning on handling it myself smaller footprint easier to move that was how rapp liked to operate and on the off chance you run into rapp while you are dealing with obrecht kassars expression remained unreadable it depends on where i see him but i assume i will have the advantage as i know what he looks like but he doesnt know me a small laugh passed through rickmans battered lips it doesnt matter he will sense you hell smell you from a mile away i cant explain how he does it must be some kind of genetic survival instinct going back to when his ancestors were running from dinosaurs and shit rickman wished he could use his old contacts to find out what rapp was up to durrani folded his arms across his chest and flexed his knees i think you give this mr rapp too much credit you have built him into some mythical character rickman knew where this was coming from general you are allowing your ego to interfere with reality as much as i would like to see rapp dead i do not want your talented friend tangling with him the general snorted nonsense turning to kassar he ordered if you run into mr rapp i want you to kill him kassar accepted the order with a nod even though he was fairly certain he would disregard it it was easy to kill a common fool like the one who was now lying at his feet but a man like mitch rapp was an entirely different matter a man like rapp would be aware and he would fight back kassar looked at rickman and said maybe i should bring some backup rickman thought about that for a moment while durrani stewed over the fact that his man was asking rickman how to run his operation rickman slowly lifted a hand and scratched his chin i think thats a good idea probably three men kassar turned to durrani may i choose the men yes durrani said even though he didnt want to and rickman added if you see rapp i want you to think seriously about aborting the operation especially if you have already taken care of obrecht nonsense durrani scoffed if you see rapp i want him dead do you understand me i am sick of this man rid me of this problem and i will reward you handsomely rickman was tired of all the bravado and being relegated to the role of cripple only made it worse not being able to stand and argue his point was extremely frustrating kassar all the money in the world wont mean a thing if youre dead use your judgment and dont underestimate rapp the mans at the top of the food chain if you have a clean shot and he doesnt see you go ahead and try your best but if he gets even the slightest whiff of you you need to run rickman looked at kassar through his slitted eyes you are a smart man vazir you know what im talking about dont you yes kassar replied in his standard dispassionate voice he did understand men like rapp were exceedingly dangerous not just because of their talent and instincts the most impressive thing about rapp was that he was still alive after everything that had been thrown at him what about the assassin gould rickman had been wondering how to handle that problem he knew a great deal about the man but gould had no idea that rickman had maneuvered him into the time and place where hed been certain the former legionnaire would settle his score with rapp somewhere rickman thought hed miscalculated or possibly he hadnt an idea suddenly occurred to him to durrani he said you told me you had general qayem and his men on standby in case my assassin failed that is correct rickman sighed i should have known you would meddle in my plans i have no idea what you are talking about yes you do you are so transparent you were going to kill gould when he was done with rapp werent you durrani sniffed and said i did not want any loose ends he was a loose end and what do you mean pushing with his elbows rickman managed to sit up against the pillows he was thankful that the pain was muted by the drugs that were still in his system if our partnership is going to work you must stop going behind my back do you understand what you did gould is a professional obviously he saw your men and knew that you were going to kill him so the only avenue of escape that was left to him was to cross over to rapp durrani scoffed at the idea nonsense no general the only thing that is nonsense is the way you keep ruining my well laid plans you need to stop interfering and there should be no more killing unless we absolutely have to i kill to protect us our secret is too valuable we must keep our circle very tight its a bad policy killing is not the solution to every problem what are you going to do about vazir when he gets back from switzerland are you going to kill him as well he is too valuable durrani shouted i would never kill someone so loyal rickman knew that durrani had killed plenty of loyal people but he didnt verbalize it kassar was listening to every word and he was no fool the man had no doubt wondered when durrani would tire of his services from now on general we need to consult with each other or we are doomed chapter rappahannock county virginia stan hurley arrived a few minutes before eight oclock the looming subject of his terminal diagnosis was not discussed for the simple reason that the old cuss had already told kennedy they werent going to make a big deal out of it he apparently mumbled something about the fact that were all dying some just a little sooner than others lewis made shrimp fettuccini and spinach salad for the group over dinner rapp continued to press kennedy hurley and lewis about rickman rapp remembered that rickman had an exwife and a daughter whom he rarely discussed in fact rapp remembered only one time where hed heard rickman mention them it was at an old soviet base in southern uzbekistan just after the taliban had had their asses handed to them by american airpower a couple of dozen us special operations warriors a few clandestine service guys and a ragtag army of mostly northern alliance types rickman had been key in putting the whole thing together and it was the first time since that they felt like they had really hit back so it was time to celebrate and with the taliban in full retreat and running for the pakistani border the booze began to flow even back then rapp knew rickman as a guy with a big brain who had a knack for putting together complicated operations while never losing sight of the various pitfalls and he did it all with a calm focus on the endgame something that was no easy thing with so many moving parts and an uncooperative enemy for reasons that rapp didnt fully understand that night a sloppy rickman decided to unload his personal problems on rapp rickman had a wife whom hed never really loved and he was pretty sure shed never really loved him either they had a daughter who had reached her teens and hated her father for being gone so much yet when he was home he couldnt get her to say as much as hello it was all going down the tubes and rickman vacillated between thinking he should save it and being pretty sure it wasnt worth saving it was a classic oneperson devils advocate argued by a single drunken man for the better part of an evening rapp succeeded in changing the discussion multiple times only to have rickman steer it right back into the muddy ditch the next day it was not brought up and it was never discussed again a few months later rapp heard that rickmans wife had filed for divorce it was not an unusual situation during the best of times the clandestine service was hard on families it took a unique spouse to be able to hold down the fort while you were off advancing americas policies in the gutters of the world the divorce rate was high before after the attacks they skyrocketed the cia never stopped deploying and the deployments lasted years families suffered and marriages fell apart now rapp wanted to know if theyd ever had any discussions with rickman about the divorce and the stress of his job kennedy looked at lewis and said we did have a discussion about bringing him back i remember lewis said it wasnt the divorce so much remember we were dealing with a lot of those we woke up one day and realized hed been over there for six straight years kennedy looked as if she was reliving a mistake i was in kabul on business and sat down with him to see how things were going he never complained not once never hurley said in a doubtful tone never he had completely immersed himself in the job he was a walking encyclopedia of information about who was fighting for whom it got to the point where jsoc wouldnt launch an operation without checking with him first theyd bring him a name sometimes a photo and a location and rick would say things like i think youve got the wrong mohammad the one youre looking for is in the next village over at any rate i sat down did a review and then offered him a promotion to come back to langley he didnt even consider it said his skills would be wasted at langley hurley shrugged he wouldnt be the first guy to think that kennedy took a sip of wine and agreed you could have forced him to come back rapp said i thought about it but when i checked with jsoc and some other incountry assets they almost had heart attacks to a person they said they couldnt manage without him so your solution lewis said was to bring him back for two weeks of briefings hurley scoffed let me guess you made him get on the couch with doc here kennedy shrugged standard procedure i make everyone do them even you two a lot of good it did me hurley said sarcastically turning to lewis he quickly added sorry doc not your fault im pretty fucked up lewis smiled no offense taken and youre not fucked up just complicated no rapp said im pretty sure hes fucked up hurley roared well if that isnt the pot calling the kettle black im not saying i dont have issues rapp grinned theyre just not as bad as yours easy junior give yourself another thirty years and well see how youre doing we all have issues kennedy held up her wineglass and said considering what the two of you have been through i think youre coping quite well hurley and rapp took the words with a silent thanks and then hurley ever impatient looked to lewis and asked so what did you find out when you got rick on the couch not much we had only had two sessions each one about two hours did you get a sense that he was holding on too tight rapp asked lewis shook his head i didnt get a sense of anything you guys lewis said pointing at rapp and hurley are two of my more difficult patients it took me years to earn your trust and you still will only crack that door a fraction rickman makes you two look like ideal patients have any of you read his jacket kennedy nodded while rapp and hurley shook their heads his iq lewis said is hurley scratched his cheek and said that doesnt mean jack shit to me the highest in the building kennedy said by a good margin the two of you combined lewis said pointing at hurley and then rapp might match him doc im sure hes smart as shit but my experience with guys like that is that they dont cope real well with life thats a fair point there were a few things i picked up during our session a potential sense of isolation difficulty in coping with people especially those outside his immediate circle as you said coping issues but kennedy quickly added coping issues are not unusual for our people when theyve been abroad for extended periods of time the two of you have experienced it many times you come back after enduring some pretty hard stuff and you have no patience for people who want to complain about the mundane actually hurley had a very low tolerance for people in general any chance he went native we dont have even close to enough information to say that but he definitely began to withdraw over the past year lewis was quick to add that he wasnt passing judgment on anyone looking back on things its much easier to see a pattern sickles lost all control of him its almost as if rickman had become darrens boss or at least stopped answering to him irene rapp said i really hope you hammer darren hes an incompetent ass and a damn embarrassment kennedy was getting a lot of advice from a wide range of people regarding what she had to do in the wake of the disaster in afghanistan were debriefing him right now i want to make sure i know everything he knows and then ill make the decision on his employment she didnt want the conversation to stray from the point so she said back to rick we dont have anything definitive and im not sure we will but ive got three of my best analysts going over everything if he made a mistake theyll find it rapp shook his head like he wasnt buying it they wont find anything he didnt make mistakes he always covered his tracks unless he wanted anyone looking to find something like the banker hurley said he took a gulp of jack daniels and added is that guy on your approved list and if he is what in the fuck is he doing talking to the fbi langley had a list of private bankers they used to handle funds for black operations the banks were spread around between switzerland cyprus gibraltar the caymans singapore and a few other places the banks and the bankers were thoroughly vetted before they were approved for business kennedy was the only person in the building who had possession of the complete list she shook her head no hes not on the list what about the bank rapp asked thinking that maybe obrecht had spied on one of his colleagues no weve never done business with this bank or anyone who works there and youve seen this affidavit hurley asked yes this afternoon if we can believe agent wilson and im not sure we can obrecht claims he did business with both mitch and rick helped them open several accounts and received deposits of several million dollars in cash theres also a safety deposit box contents hurley asked kennedy shook her head it doesnt say and mitch you swear youve never seen this guy never i have no idea who he is hurley looked at lewis could it be the head injury its too soon to say but his recall seems to be pretty good we have yet to find an instance where once hes reminded of something it doesnt trigger the recall ive never seen the guy and besides rapp said looking at kennedy ive disclosed all my financials youve seen how well my brothers done for me i dont need to steal money rapps brother was a brainiac on wall street and had taken rapps savings and turned them into a very nice portfolio you better not have disclosed all your financials hurley said in his typical gruff tone have you learned nothing from me stan kennedy said in a chiding tone stan nothing hurley shot back were out there putting our nuts on the chopping block we dont get any hazard pay you know the rule if we come across some illgotten gains along the way they go into our rainyday fund this was all oldschool kennedy hated it when they talked this way around her on a certain level she understood where they were coming from but it was something she could never condone this is the type of talk that gets a man like wilson all lathered up hurley slapped his hand through the air rejecting the complaint were not stupid the majority of the stuff we come across gets kicked into the various accounts were talking about to help fund these ops but you cant begrudge my boys taking a little commission along the way its the only insurance we have if we need to run well you shouldnt need to run thats bullshit and you know it hurley was getting angry try to tell that to this idiot wilson and that cock sucker ferris shit hurley set his drink down and grabbed a pack of unfiltered camels as he lit the cigarette he caught the look of concern on kennedys face hurley exhaled a cloud of smoke into the lights above the table and said listen here princess i have cancer im going to die a couple more of these arent going to matter hurley took another drag and then felt bad for the rebuke kennedy was like a niece to him ive had an amazing life no regrets at least none that im going to tell this group well maybe ill tell mitch before i croak but i dont want to see any long faces were all dying the fact that ive made it this long is amazing hurley held up his glass to a full life they all touched glasses kennedy wiped a single tear from her cheek and laughed it is pretty amazing that youve lived this long youve been smoking those things for as long as i can remember before you were born hurley added with a wink and a swig of jack daniels started at fourteen back in bowling green hurley got this faraway look on his face as he thought of his childhood stint in the military and then the glory years of working for the cia behind the iron curtain he had lived a blessed life he shook his head to clear his thoughts and said back to this banker i assume were digging deep i have marcus on it as well as a few other things so far nothing to go on but we do have something that ah is a little odd kennedy looked almost sheepish as she turned to rapp something we need to discuss actually she didnt know exactly how to do this so she just said it does the name louie gould ring a bell the glass of vodka was half full rapp looked into it and for a moment considered throwing the whole thing back instead he pushed it toward the center of the table and said i remember him you remember what he did rapp didnt flinch he killed my wife kennedy swallowed hard and asked do you remember what happened with him in kabul that parts a little fuzzy i remember seeing him right before all hell broke loose and then nothing kennedy had been trying to figure out the odds of this strange coincidence would you care to take a guess where gould does his banking in switzerland herr obrecht thats right he is mr goulds private banker youre shitting me hurley was out of his chair this whole fucking thing is really starting to stink kennedy was used to this kinetic behavior hurley like rapp was not good at sitting still for very long she likened it to sharks that never stop moving gould has other bankers that he uses but obrecht is one of his main ones hurley paced to the refrigerator exhaled a cloud of smoke took a drink and then came back to the table you know what this is starting to look like kennedy nodded shed thought it through a wellplanned multi pronged attack layered like the russians used to do confusing as all shit until you got rid of all the deceptions and the feints and focused on their objective and whats the objective this time kennedy asked the hell if i know i mean we know in a general sense that this was designed to cripple us but we dont know the specifics yet rapp frowned and shook his head a memory was coming back to him a conversation hed had with rickman a long time ago it was vague because rickman had been talking so fast and flying off on tangents and then circling back kennedy noticed the look on rapps face and asked what are you thinking something rick said to me years ago probably fifteenplus i dont remember all of it but it was about clandestine operations and how they should be set up and run on multiple levels it was about recruiting highplaced assets that it wasnt enough to just recruit them to increase our chances for success secondary and tertiary operations needed to be launched that would distract the watchers the guys who would be keeping an eye on our asset to make sure he wasnt spying for the other side he was very animated when he made the point that to increase our chances of success we needed to disrupt those people rapps face brightened as it started to come back to him he snapped his fingers his idea was to frame the watchers for example by making it look like they themselves were spies set up real accounts in their names and if our asset was uncovered make the information public so the watchers would be distracted defending themselves he advocated sleeping with the persons spouse and a slew of things anything that would trip the watchers up so youre saying thats what another intelligence agency was doing to us by using herr obrecht possibly they set up this bullshit story with this banker and they spoonfeed the info to the fbi to throw us off our game and it almost worked if wilson had gotten a toehold you and i and a lot of other people would be spending a shitload of time with the feds right now trying to prove our innocence if your theory is right kennedy said then whats their endgame what are they trying to distract us from and what does a theory rickman had fifteen years ago have to do with it rapp grabbed his glass of vodka and took a drink he thought about the last week and its rollercoaster of emotions the oh shit fear when theyd found out rick was gone the horror and panic over the release of the interrogation clip and the absolute relief many of them had felt when theyd found the camera and learned that rickman was dead and his secrets were safe that was the feint rapp realized youre not going to want to hear this rapp finally said looking at kennedy ricks not dead they just wanted us to think he was dead you have no proof its just your gut i told you already i didnt buy the idea that the same people who hit the safe house could have accidentally killed rick and then conveniently left behind that camera for us to find for kennedy it was a frightening proposition this is all conjecture you feel comfortable not acting on it she thought about that for a long time no i dont then id better get my butt to zurich asap are you up to it i feel fine kennedy looked at lewis for his opinion just dont hit your head the doctor warned rapp zurichs a safe city ill be fine looking back to kennedy he asked surveillance i have a team in place how aggressive not i dont want to spook him good kennedy glanced at hurley you up for the trip let me see i can either stay here and listen to my oncologist try to talk me into taking rat poison or i can go to switzerland and beat the shit out of some banker tough call stan kennedy said in a tone that showed she was not amused of course ill go good turning her attention back to rapp she said one more thing i want you to talk to gould before you leave rapp was caught off guard why he knows something about obrecht and i think hes holding back and you think hes going to open up to me rapp suddenly looked agitated i dont have time for this i need to get my team in the air asap your team is already assembled well mostly assembled scott is handling something for me but hell be there by the time youre ready to take off rapp frowned you spun up my team without talking to me i know this hard for you to grasp at times but im in charge rapp didnt want to be in the same room with gould so youre ordering me to talk to him thats right kennedy slid a file across the table read through this quickly and then go down stairs and find out what he knows about obrecht theres also a usb stick in there it has some surveillance footage gould took of the area by the veterinary clinic right before the assault i think you will find it interesting you and stan should watch it together rapp didnt care about the file or the footage how rough can i get kennedy inhaled sharply and thought about it use your judgment and if i decide to kill him rapps dark eyes gave kennedy an unsettling feeling he was her friend and at times it was easy to forget that at his core he was a killer she cleared her throat and said i dont want you to kill him why for reasons that i cant explain right now youll have to trust me reasons you wont explain you mean however youd like to take it but it is worth reminding you two kennedy said pointing at rapp and then hurley that youre not in charge im calling the shots and for now i say he lives are we clear rapp wasnt even sure he wanted to kill the man his emotions were all over the board when it came to gould and his wife and child thered been only a handful of times where hed castigated himself for not killing gould when he had the chance it was annas memory that had kept him from doing it and he had come to terms with that strange twist of fate that decision had been made with the naive assumption that gould would retire and take care of his family learning that the reckless idiot had squandered his chance at a second life had rapp secondguessing his decision kennedy might be his boss but gould owed rapp his life when the time is right rapp thought ill be the one to decide if he lives or dies rapp leaned back and crossed his legs for now ill do it your way good something thats not in the file i placed claudia and anna in protective custody rapp got that faraway look in his eyes where were they new zealand howd you find them she and i have stayed in touch rapp was surprised and then he realized he shouldnt have been kennedy was thorough how old is the girl anna is three the fact that the mother had named her after rapps deceased wife had screwed up rapps thinking in ways he could have never predicted he had spent months tracking gould and his wife down with the absolute conviction that when he found them he would kill both of them without hesitation and then when the moment finally came and he confronted the mother and the baby girl it all fell apart it was as if his wifes soul had seized him and told him killing them would serve no purpose other than to orphan the baby girl for a man who had spent more than fifteen years killing people it was the most foreign sensation imaginable gould had been hiding from claudia the fact that he was still in the game kennedy said hes trying to act like he doesnt care but deep down hes scared to death that shes going to leave him once she finds out it will be your best source of leverage with him rapp nodded but was thinking of his own ways to exert leverage a gun to the fools head just might be the simplest course of action the only problem with that tactic rapp knew was that once he got started he might not be able to control himself chapter aurora highlands virginia wilson wasnt wondering if he was depressed he knew he was depressed beyond any reasonable doubt for the first time in his career he actually thought about sticking his service pistol in his mouth and ending his misery it was a shortlived thought as wilson couldnt bear to think of the mess it would leave behind and if he somehow screwed it up which based on his current run of bad luck he would there was a better than ever chance that hed end up crippled in an institution for the rest of his life watching the world go by and not be able to communicate a single thought no wilson decided if he was going to commit suicide he would take pills ferris must have sensed his desperation because he had one of his aides call tell him that hed meet him on their street corner at pm sharp now wilson found himself in the front hall of his house for the second night in a row getting ready to do something he didnt like with a dog he didnt particularly care for he poked his head into the office and said im going to take rose out for a walk sally turned away from the computer screen are you sure id be more than happy to do it wilson hadnt told her about his monumentally horseshit day he couldnt bear the thought of her judging him there would be so many questions she had told him once not long ago that she loved him very much but that he couldnt be right all the time any conversation about todays events would eventually lead to that place and she would look right through him and ask how it was that director miller who had a reputation as a fair and honest person could be so wrong and then she would dig deeper and hed have to tell her that not a single person had stood up for him she would seize on that as proof that the majority had ruled and he was wrong wilson could not take having that conversation not tonight and probably never no he told her i need to clear my head youve been awfully quiet you dont want to talk about the meeting no i need to sort a few things out im always here if you want to talk she stood walked over and gave him a kiss on the cheek youre a good man joel thank you im lucky to have you yes you are she brushed his cheek with the back of her hand and then walked him to the door moving down the front walk took great effort it was if his feet were carrying him to a place he did not want to go as they turned up the block a gust of wind hit him the face and wilson shivered clutching at his jacket and turning his collar up he felt cold and vulnerable and he didnt like it rose led the way and wilson followed at a sluggish pace when he reached his corner he didnt even notice the lincoln town car until the driver flashed his lights lewis sighed and braced himself for what he assumed was going to be a lame pep talk from the blowhard senior senator from connecticut after opening the rear door he picked up rose under her belly and tossed her into the backseat she and ferris were welcome to have their little love affair ferris grabbed the dog and pulled her onto his lap he scratched her neck while saying i heard today didnt go so well wilson tugged at his jacket it was a complete fucking disaster must you be so vulgar you have to be shitting me you expect me to believe that you dont swear when youre angry ferris shook his head in a slow disapproving manner there was a time but ive learned it does no good well you have a day like i had today and then you can fucking lecture me about swearing wilson looked out the window at the passing brownstones do you know exactly how bad it was i dont have any details other than the fact that youve been placed on administrative leave do you know what that means it typically means that you continue to get paid while an independent panel decides if youve committed enough wrongdoing to be fired maybe in your normal government job but not at the fbi administrative leave is a mark so black you can kiss your entire career goodbye thats one way to look at it its the only way to look at it three of my direct bosses were in that meeting and in their eyes im done well theyre not the only people who matter in this town wilson balled his fists in frustration you dont get it theyve already determined that this bullshit with the swiss banker is an attempt by a hostile foreign intelligence agency to destabilize the cia i dont believe that ferris scoffed they sounded pretty convinced and to really make sure i understood they brought kennedy into the meeting do you know what she did no she pulled out a copy of my national security nondisclosure document and threw it in my face told me if i so much as talked to anyone about any of this shed make sure i went to jail shes bluffing theyre all bluffing because theyre scared and miller doesnt get scared hes been running the fbi for four years and he might be a lot of things but a shrinking violet is not one of them if he thought this stuff on rapp and rickman was legit he would go after them until they were behind bars hes seen something somebody showed him something that convinced him all of this information is bullshit probably falsified by kennedy shes not afraid to operate that way how do you think she holds on to power a thought slapped wilson in the face and he turned to ferris and asked where did you get your information about rapp and rickman from a very wellplaced source sure you did whos the source i dont like your tone ferris said with a steely stare a crazy laugh rumbled up from wilsons bowels thats the best you can do you get me all worked up and i jump on this for you and now my career is in the toilet and the best you can do is tell me you dont like my tone well fuck you very much senator the senators face flushed with anger he was clearly not used to anyone speaking to him in this way let alone a public servant joe i can help you but you need to trust me and you need to keep your calm good god man i thought you were a professional this is the first quarter of this little game and youre acting like its over well from where im sitting it pretty much is over it is not and get hold of yourself ferris tossed the dog back onto wilsons lap i have yet to hold a single hearing when i do kennedy is going to have to answer a lot of questions and you will be my star witness she will regret the day she threw that document in your face wilson wrestled with the dog how can you be so sure as ive told you i have my sources you need to trust me wilson shook his head youre going to have to do better than that im the one drowning here while youre sitting on the lido deck sucking down some fruity drink i need some reassurances part of my review is going to be a lot of questions about how i was pointed in this direction questions that will eventually lead to you at this point you want me to play ball i need some confidence that i will be proven right ferris rubbed his index finger along his lips while he thought about it after a few seconds he said i cannot tell you who my source is but he is a very highranking government official of one our staunchest allies someone of impeccable character will this person testify if called on god no dont be a fool thats not how this works so im the only person whos putting his career on the line this other person gets to make accusations and play it safe dont be naive this person would lose everything he brought the information to me as a favor thats not going to do me any good wilson was feeling more and more isolated rapp and rickman and who knew how many other scumbags and that bitch kennedy were all guilty as hell but ferris and this mystery informant werent exactly exuding courage this is bullshit joel i feel bad for you ferris recognized that he was in danger of losing wilson the same characteristics that had made him the right man to sic on langley were now isolating him from ferris but you need to hang in there very soon i will be in a position to put a great deal of pressure on ms kennedy until then though i need you to do something why does it always involve me doing something for you when are you going to do something for me ferris had had enough he stared angrily at wilson and said you need to snap out of it buddy youre acting like a baby stop feeling sorry for yourself this is washington its a tough place what did you expect that people like kennedy and rapp would quake at the sight of your badge and roll over no wilson said defensively then get your head in the game i told you this is early days and you are on the team that is going to win and when we do director miller and an awful lot of other people are going to have to kiss your ass and apologize wilson liked the sound of that okay okay what is it that you need me to do next youve heard of darren sickles cia station chief kabul i just met him well apparently hes been recalled and kennedy and rapp are making his life miserable and why should i care because apparently mr rapp made certain threats against mr sickless life wilson was suspicious where did you hear this arianna vinter from the state department i met her as well well you should interview her she said that mr rapp was extremely threatening a scowl washed over wilsons face stuff like that is not easy to prove in court im not talking about court im talking about a public hearing on capitol hill in my committee room with cameras and lots of press you need to stop thinking like an agent all the time we need to crucify rapp in public paint a picture of an outofcontrol sociopath who threatens lies and cheats to get what he wants once we do that your legal case will fall into place two blocks away scott coleman was sitting in the back of a black honda odyssey minivan the bug had been easy to plant a cable company uniform and a few dog treats were all it took the little pooch was not a guard dog even so coleman laced the treats with a mild sedative parked the van in the alley dropped the treats over the fence and pretended to check the cable lines after five minutes he entered the backyard and greeted the dog with a few more treats of the nonmedicated variety he dropped to a knee and while petting the dog fixed the bug to the collar a quick sound check with the men in the van verified that it was working coleman and his men then left the area knowing that wilson was at fbi headquarters when wilson left the building shortly after noon a second team followed him home and was able to listen in on the bug nothing of real interest was reported other than the fact that the team thought they heard wilson crying at one point having lost men in battle coleman had no respect for a man who cried over his own fuckups as the former seal listened to the dialogue between the senator and wilson he nodded with the confidence that he was going to be able to give kennedy some actionable intelligence if the senator was in fact getting his intel from a foreign intelligence asset he had recklessly placed himself in a very precarious position on top of that they now had his game plan the man wanted to hold public hearings coleman transferred the audio file of the conversation onto his smartphone and then placed it in an email marked urgent and sent it to kennedy he then asked the driver to pull over guys coleman said to his two men stay with them and email me any updates where are you going the wiry tech asked him zurich keep sending me stuff i should be back in a few days coleman closed the door and jogged off in the direction of his car chapter islamabad pakistan nadeem ashan had endured difficulties before but none of them compared to what he was now going through in the middle of dinner last night there had been a knock on the door he had feared such an event all day ever since a second video of joe rickman had been released in it he had clearly implied that ashan was an american agent ashan knew he needed to confront the lies so he had gone directly to the director generals office to state his innocence and to offer his assistance in any way that would help disprove what was an obvious attempt at disinformation ashan could tell by tajs tepid response that this was not a problem that would go away easily the rest of the day was businesslike his counterparts both stopped by his office to lend their support durrani was confident that the accusations would be proven baseless lieutenant general mahmud nassir the deputy director of the internal wing offered his apologies that an investigation was necessary ashan and nassir had never had a warm relationship so the chilly meeting did not seem out of character at the sound of the knock ashans heart sank his wife had already spent much of the night crying as she was friends with the foreign secretarys wife and had seen how he was dragged from his house it was not a big leap to think that the same thing could happen to her husband when he opened the door he was not surprised to see lieutenant general nassir but he was surprised to see his friend durrani before nassir could speak durrani stepped forward and said im here to make sure you are treated with the respect that you deserve nassir remained as impassive as ever and motioned for his men to proceed ashan and his wife were put in separate rooms and fortunately durrani went with ashans wife to comfort her as she was not prepared for a lengthy interrogation three men plus nassir accompanied ashan into his study and proceeded to interrogate him for six straight hours despite being asked multiple times to not smoke in his house the men ignored him ashan made a mental note that when this was all over he would make sure these three were punished for their brazen disrespect of his rank nassir on the other hand was hopeless if it werent for durrani ashan would have been a mess worrying about his wife shortly after ten oclock his friend informed him that his wife had been allowed to go to bed ashan felt a bit of relief that they were being civilized with her but that relief was shortlived durrani then informed him that ashans son and daughter had both been picked up for questioning his son was a doctor in karachi and his daughter an engineer in islamabad his son would be fine but his daughter was an extremely attractive young woman and the isi was not known for its restraint ashan looked daggers at nassir and said i am innocent of these charges and will be cleared if my daughter or son are harmed in any way i will make sure that your children experience the same degradation the threat probably had a fiftyfifty chance of working on its own but then durrani made sure it stuck after unleashing a string of obscenities he screamed a more vivid account of what he would do to nassirs children and then threw a few threats at his three men for good measure of the three deputy generals ashan was by far the most civilized and durrani was the least fearless in his attacks against pakistans enemies he had a reputation for being ruthless that was wellknown by the men of the internal wing nassir promptly excused himself so he could go in the other room and make it very clear to his men that he would execute anyone who did not treat ashans children with absolute respect a little less than an hour later nassir and his men called it a night after durranis graphic description of how he would have each of them sodomized repeatedly the men seemed to have lost their zeal ashan thanked his friend profusely for his support durrani stated that if things were reversed he knew that ashan would do the same for him ashan went to bed wondering if that was true he held his wife and nervously waited for his children to call his daughter called first and wanted to know what was going on he told her it was all a misunderstanding and was keenly aware that the conversation was being recorded it took almost two and a half hours for his son to call and neither ashan nor his wife slept while they waited finally after reassuring his son that everything would be fine ashan fell asleep with his wife in his arms at fourtwenty in the morning two hours later he woke shaved and dressed for work when he left the house he noted the cordon of military vehicles and wondered if he would be allowed to leave an army colonel approached and informed him that he would be escorting him to isi headquarters ashan was gripped with an ominous feeling as he climbed into the back of the unfamiliar vehicle in pakistan it was a national pastime to assassinate government officials in their cars the drive to the office was fortunately uneventful but the morning was not ashan arrived to find out that all three of his secretaries and two of his deputies had been arrested during the night his office was crawling with internal wing types who were pilfering confidential files this was more than the intelligence professional could take he left immediately for the director generals office three assistants tried to stop him from entering but ashan pushed past he opened the door to find director general taj and durrani and nassir the look on durranis face was not comforting whats wrong ashan asked please sit taj pointed to a spot on the couch next to durrani ashan remained standing there are men in my office men who are looking at classified files i am aware of that you need to sit taj pointed at the couch with his cigarette those men are not cleared to see those files ashan said as he sat it is a major breach of protocol he looked at the other three men for some sign that they understood the enormity of the problem taj looked at nassir and gave him a sign to proceed nassir opened a gold file and held up a sheaf of documents do you recognize these no are you sure give them to him so he can read them taj ordered ashan took the pages and felt his world slipping from him he had never seen these pages before but he was smart enough to recognize what they were these are not mine then why did my men find them taped to the underside of one of your desk drawers last night nassir asked they are not mine how do i know that your men didnt put them there nassir looked to taj and shook his head in disappointment director general you have to believe me i am not a spy for the americans or anyone else and that is not my swiss bank account i have never seen those documents but you do have a swiss bank account nassir asked durrani intervened before ashan could answer the question who doesnt have a swiss bank account lets cut through all the crap we are all intelligence professionals every single one of us has at least one swiss bank account those sheets mean nothing im afraid its not that simple taj announced the swiss bank account we can handle as akhtar said once you rise to this level swiss bank accounts are part of the job but the american clandestine officer saying that you are a cia agent that is something that is not easy to undo even if it is a lie it is a lie ashan protested vehemently i am not a cia agent looking from face to face ashan realized that none of them believed him even durrani wouldnt look at him akhtar surely you dont believe that i would sink so low youre a better man than the three of us and i think this all a complete fabrication but durrani said looking angrily at taj i have no say in the matter and apparently we arent going to take the time to find the truth it didnt sink in at first ashan looked at taj with confusion what is he saying taj leaned forward and stabbed out his cigarette the president called me just before you arrived im sorry theres no other way to say this he wants you sacked the words drifted over him as ashan attempted to process the finality of it all his jaw hung loose and he asked just like that after more than thirty years of honorable service this is bigger than you its bigger than us its bigger than the isi its my hope that you will be proven guiltless of all charges but the president wants action now we need to look strong we cannot afford to look like americas puppet at least let him step down on his own durrani said let him make a statement we could even spin it in our favor he could say that for the sake of clarity he is going to step down and then he can say something about an american plot to interfere with the sovereignty of pakistan ashan was having an outofbody experience he watched taj shake his head and say the president is adamant he wants him fired this morning im sorry it has to be this way nadeem for what its worth i think you are a good and honorable man im sorry but you and the rest of your family will be placed under house arrest until the investigation is over ashan stood without saying a word he suddenly felt as if he was going to be sick he left tajs office to find a half dozen men in uniform waiting arguing would be useless if the president were involved there would be no fighting his dismissal he did not understand how his life had been so thoroughly upended as he walked down the hall surrounded by the men he told himself to remain calm there would be time to figure out what had happened and he hoped to discover who was behind this chapter rappahannock county virginia rapp and hurley reviewed the file nash schneeman and coleman had done the bulk of the interrogations with lewis providing a brief psychological evaluation gould had been very uncooperative repeating the same things over and over and insisting that he was done talking to anyone other than rapp it was total bullshit the two veterans could smell it from a mile away gould was weaving partial truths with outright lies in an effort to hold on to some negotiating chip from rapps perspective none of it mattered the only negotiating chip that would work with rapp was the truth unlike the transcripts which were worthless the surveillance footage of rapp that had been shot by gould before the assassination proved rather interesting it took just two viewings for rapp and hurley to see what had spooked gould someone with less field experience would have missed it hurley and rapp were so attuned to the normal rhythms of a street that the two men jumped out at them rapp took the steps to the basement and hit the buzzer on the metal door they turned their heads skyward for the camera and then when he heard the buzz of the lock rapp opened the door the room was rectangular with two large viewing windows for each cell gould was in the cell on the left and the one on the right was unoccupied big joe maslick was sitting at the control desk hows it going joe rapp asked boring as shit whats with the zurich trip did i get bumped not my call joe sorry irenes running the show is it my shoulder maslick moved his arm around its fine just a little scratch rapp knew that wasnt true maslick had been shot at the veterinary clinic in kabul kennedy had told rapp the doctors were nervous that there might be some nerve damage but they wouldnt know until hed completed at least another month of physical therapy the bigger concern was that his best friend mick reavers had been killed in the same attack lewis wanted to make sure maslick was coping before they sent him back out in the field youll have to bring it up with kennedy rapp took the file in his hand and pointed at goulds cell whats he up to nothing maslick rocked back in his chair he keeps asking to see you itd drive me nuts if it wasnt for the fact that the prick probably saved our lives how do you mean for starters he could have plugged you the second you stepped out of the vehicle back in kabul after that once the shooting started maslick shook his head he kept those dogs at bay if he hadnt been up on the roof with me we would have been fucked you been talking to him rapp asked while he pointed at gould who was lying on his bed no not really keep it that way whats the status on the video and audio its on take em both offline maslick looked uncomfortable sorry but irene said she wants everything recorded rapp was pissed come on she was adamant mitch she told me youd want it turned off and that under no circumstances was i to allow that she also said you need to check your guns turning to hurley rapp said what the hell hurley offered a shrug and said who gives a shit so she and doc are going to want to slice and dice your performance thats nothing knew hurley drew his from his hip holster and set it on the desk lets go hurley motioned at rapp to do the same and said come on maslick disengaged the lock and rapp entered the cell hurley behind him the interrogation table was bolted to the concrete floor as were the chairs on each side the bed was also bolted to the floor and next to it was a toilet with no seat and a small sink the floor was coated with three inches of black rubber to cushion any falls and the walls and ceiling were covered in gray foam acoustic tiles that enabled the microphones to catch even the softest whisper rapp set the file on the table and pointed to the chair on the other side gould slowly unclasped his hands from behind his head and sat up whos that he asked looking past rapp rapp didnt bother looking over his shoulder this arrogant prick was still trying to act as if he was in a charge before rapp could say anything hurley answered who i am is none of your fucking business you need to be concerned about why im here gould rolled his eyes okay why are you here im here to make sure he kills you this time and if he doesnt ill gladly step in and snap your neck yeah right gould scoffed give it your best shot old man rapp felt hurley move past him gould was caught in a bad spot on the edge of the bed and underestimated hurleys quickness he was halfway up when hurley smacked him in the jaw with a quick right hook gould fell back to the bed and rapp saw hurley turn back to him with a pair of brass knuckles on his right hand gould was half sitting against the wall holding his jaw his eyes were closed tight as he fought through the pain youre not in charge rapp said so get your ass over here or ill let this old man beat the shit out of you gould slowly made his way over to the table working his jaw as he sat that was uncalled for addressing rapp he added thats the way you treat the man who saved your life say what when i got to that building across the street and found out you were the target i could have taken the shot it would have been easy but i owed you i could have run i could have done anything but instead i chose to walk across the street and save your ass and this is how you treat me gould said as he held out his arms and looked around the cell did you have backup for the operation excuse me backup were there people there to support you no gould shook his head i always work alone you know that rapp opened the folder and withdrew one photo and then another he laid them on the table side by side you recognize these guys gould did but he shook his head really that surprises me we got them off the memory card you had when we stripsearched you at bagram they were photos of two men both talking on cell phones while manning their posts at each end of the block where the attack had taken place rapp laid a third photo on the table one that had been provided by the afghan police it showed one of the men lying on the ground with a bullet hole in his chest rapp made an educated guess and said you recognized this guy from your surveillance run and then when you were on the roof you shot him gould did his best to show that he was unaffected you may think whatever you like this is really a treat rapp said smiling watching you sit here like you did the right thing when we all know youre a piece of shit you didnt cross the street to save my life you crossed the street to save your own ass you saw the police show up and you realized you were going to be doublecrossed your only chance of surviving was to come over and join forces with us you have no idea what youre talking about rapp picked up the three photos and replaced them with two new ones he had used this trick before fathers and husbands were uniquely vulnerable when it came to their wives and their children rapp watched gould the only sign that the photos affected him was that he looked away after a few seconds i gave you a second chance rapp started and i gave you your life in kabul gould quickly added were even anger in this line of work could be an asset as long as it was controlled rapp understood this as well as anyone but this was an exception this was more personal than anything he had ever dealt with he made no effort to slow or curb the rage that came rushing to the surface you piece of shit you think im that selfish that just because youre so in love with yourself i must be as well you dumbass i would have gladly given my life if it meant that my wife and child could have lived but i didnt get that choice because you killed them rapp leaned over the table and drilled gould square in the nose with his left fist goulds head snapped back and blood began cascading over his upper lip rapp walked around the table and punched him in the side of the head gould moved his arms and hands up to protect his face rapp grabbed him by the hair with his right hand and pounded away you selfish fuck i gave you a second chance at life i allowed you and your wife to live so you could raise that little girl do you know what id give to spend one more day with my wife rapp stopped punching and yanked goulds head back so he would have to look at him i never got to meet my kid you idiot i gave you life youve spent three years with your daughter i didnt get one fucking second rapps left fist came crashing down two more times the thin skin above goulds left eye bursting what are you some kind of a crack addict you need the fix you cant walk away you dont understand gould yelled back youre still in the game you dont know what its like all of these idiots wandering through life theres a fucking walmart in new zealand did you know that what in the hell are you talking about with the realization that gould might be nuts rapp let go you think were alike dont you more than you will ever want to admit gould took his shirtsleeve to wipe the blood from his mouth i dont get off on the kill i dont take bags of cash to do my job i kill bad guys like you because you not in it makes the world is a better place gould wasnt buying a word youre lying to yourself no one can be as good as you and not love it youre wrong its a job that i happen to be good at but i dont get off on it like you do i dont need the challenge all im trying to do is rid the world of assholes like you something i should have done when i found you on that beach do you realize the gift i gave you gould straightened himself and stared at the surface of the table refusing to answer rapps question you know what they dont deserve you rapp walked back around the table and pulled out the photos of goulds wife and daughter he placed them directly in front of gould and then while walking back around the table he drew a second smaller pistol from the small of his back this is your moment of truth rapp pressed the barrel into the back of goulds head maslicks voice came over the speakers mitch the interrogation is over hurley looked at the mirrored glass knowing maslick was on the other side ready to call kennedy put that fucking phone down right now joe now hurley had a gun in his hands as well were going to settle this right now either this piece of shit is going to tell us everything he knows or were going to execute his ass and if anyone tries to stop us im going to put a bullet in his head rapp forced gould to look at the photos no more games you either talk and prove to me that they matter to you or i blow your brains all over those photos and you never see them again its an easy choice whats it going to be i saved your life gould growled through gritted teeth you saved your own ass no i didnt gould shouted none of it matters louie theres no negotiating you either talk or youre dead i want assurances rapp let go of his hair for a second and slapped gould in the head the only promise youll get out of me is that ill let you see your wife and daughter if you tell me everything see them thats not good enough i want assurances that i will be able to return to my old life as an assassin are you fucking nuts rapp looked up at hurley and said can you believe this guy dont waste any more time just kill him well get obrecht to talk we dont need him youre right rapp jammed the gun into the back of goulds head gould wasnt sure if rapp was bluffing the man had proven to be difficult to predict all he needed to do was get through this and then he could negotiate with kennedy or one of the others guys later wait no more waiting i know what youre thinking right now rapp whispered is he bluffing or is he going to pull that trigger well all you have to do is ask yourself one question if someone killed claudia and your daughter what would you do you wouldnt hesitate would you the guy would already be dead so if you think you and i are so much alike then you know ill pull this trigger this is your last chance were all dying just some of us sooner than others chapter islamabad pakistan durrani took no joy in watching ashan fall he was a good man and a good friend but he was horribly misguided for the isi to forge a strong future for pakistan they could not afford to have someone so weak running the foreign wing durrani already had his replacement ready to go a man who shared his zeal for the future of pakistan ashan would survive after a few months this would blow over and durrani would do his best to make sure he and his family was treated with respect he might even be able to arrange for him to keep some of the money in the swiss bank account durrani shook off the feelings of sorrow over what hed done to his friend and turned his attention to rickman he was troubled by the mans discontent he had worked hard to make everything fall into place only a fool would think that every aspect of the operation should work to perfection now should be a time to celebrate not point fingers and blame each other for what had gone wrong he recognized now that he might have been a bit aggressive in telling general qayem that he wanted the assassin killed as soon as rapp was eliminated but his heart had been in the right place the frenchmans life meant nothing to any of them and besides his complicated history with rapp would serve to further confuse the cia durrani was prepared to make amends to rickman it would be a gesture that would make his coconspirator very happy and then durrani would make sure that rickman understood that he still had to fulfill his part of the bargain the dog was an absolute monster durrani had directed the head of his security detail to buy three new guard dogs to help patrol the property he specifically asked for rottweilers the head of his detail did not like dogs nor did the rest of his men so durrani had to pay for a professional trainer to be flown in from europe to teach them how to handle the dogs the cost had been exorbitant twentyseven thousand dollars and counting and one of his men had quit after hed been bitten durrani complained openly about the dogs but he had secretly grown to like them due to both the fear that brought out in people and the way they jockeyed for his affection they seemed to understand that of all the people who worked at the compound durrani was the one who was in charge one of the dogs a fourth one was not so cooperative he was much bigger than the others older and far smarter he ran the show and unlike the other three this one made him nervous durrani had him on a choke chain with a long leash but he did not use the choke chain for fear that the dog would turn on him and bite him in the groin as he had one of the guards for this one it was all treats no punishment the beast practically dragged him up the stairs of the guesthouse and when they reached the main floor the pudgy nurse took one look at the dog and recoiled in fear durrani ignored her as the dog sniffed his way down the hall toward the bedroom he didnt bother knocking on the door he pushed through into the room and set the dog free the beast leaped onto the bed and began licking rickmans bruised face jax rickman said in a happy voice he scratched the dogs neck and said did you miss me i sure did miss you durrani could not stop himself from smiling he hoped he could have the same special relationship with his dogs someday im sorry i didnt bring him by sooner but caution is still imperative that and i wasnt sure you could handle him handle him hes as gentle as a baby around me yes durrani approached the bed he is much more cooperative with you than with my staff the big dog lay down his head resting on rickmans lap durrani grabbed a chair pulled it over to the bedside and sat he makes you happy doesnt he very much thank you for arranging his disappearance and transportation when they were beating me i wondered if id ever see him again i am more than happy to reunite you durrani watched the dog and master for another moment this was the first time ajax had looked content in over a month the timing he decided was right he clapped his hands together and said now you have many stories to tell me keeping his focus on ajax rickman said not yet durranis anger flashed and then he got a grip on it you made a promise i have arranged everything you are safe in my country i have even gone so far as to arrange a new identity for you you must follow through on your side of the bargain i want the names of the american spies rickman stroked the large head of his rottweiler when vazir gets back from zurich we will see how things are and then i will decide when and how i will begin sharing that information that was not our deal durrani shouted the rottweilers eyes narrowed and he bared his teeth rickman calmed him and said the deal has changed you did that when you decided to interfere with my assassin now we will have to wait and see durrani was furious i could have you killed he hissed or better yet i will nurse you back to health and have you beaten to a pulp again how would you like that you stupid american you think you are so smart well you are not so smart i hold all of the cards here i am the one who decides if you will live or die the laughter hurt but even so rickman couldnt stop when he finally caught his breath he said you think you have me by the balls general durrani did not like rickmans tone but he was not about to back down i could have you killed right now yes you could and then in a month or so you would die as well what are you talking about you are so naive general do you think im foolish enough to put my life in your hands and not have an insurance policy you are bluffing no thats not my style i plan i dont bluff i have taken certain precautions ive hired multiple lawyers and gave them very specific instructions that if they dont hear from me at prearranged intervals they are to mail an encrypted file to director kennedy and a few other select people durrani wanted to think it was a lie but rickman was devious and untrustworthy what kind of information very detailed information that implicates you in all of this what could you possibly be thinking that is reckless what if these lawyers take a look at the information rickman knew this would drive durrani nuts the specter of an unknown number of people possessing information that could expose him ruin everything hed worked for and probably get him killed was too much to absorb for a control freak it would likely keep him up at nights for years to come if he lived that long the important thing for now was to keep him as levelheaded as possible while making him understand that he did not hold all the cards its encrypted and dont worry they are people i trust they have no desire to look at the files they know they contain information that could get them killed rickman scratched his dogs neck and said you have nothing to worry about as long as you honor our agreement you are the one who needs to honor our agreement the senator says he needs the information so he can move against rapp and kennedy that might have been true but until rickman was confident that rapp wasnt coming after him senator ferris would have to wait lets see how things go in zurich you are a fool really rickman answered in an amused tone i think it is actually very pragmatic of me im talking about giving such valuable information to people i cannot trust its foolish its actually very smart although probably not all that smart considering your history durrani shook his head and scowled what is that supposed to mean its pretty obvious that you have a habit of killing the people you work with that is an exaggeration not really so the fact that i took a few precautions is just common sense its not particularly smart if durrani thought it would solve his problems he would kill rickman and his crazy dog but he needed the american to complete his plan it was time to change gears and find common ground joe you must understand you are different we have discussed this you understand the stupidity of your countrys folly in afghanistan you knew it almost from the beginning but you did your job you saw the people you despised become rich beyond their wildest dreams all with american cash provided by you durrani pointed at him you fought valiantly and then you saw the light america should not be in afghanistan and they most certainly shouldnt be giving money and weapons to the very people who are already turning against them you saw the injustice and you took the money but you needed an ally to help you disappear i am that ally your dream could not have come true if it wasnt for me general i am not disagreeing with you rickman said wondering why durrani had to take everything so personally i am simply saying the timing isnt right im happy to hear that we have a special relationship and the best way to keep it that way is to make sure neither of us tries to bully the other into doing something that we do not want to do surely you must see that durrani was not used to sharing power he didnt like the lack of control but until he could find a way to dismantle rickmans network of lawyers he would have to play this game i see your point he said even though he didnt but surely you can see where i am coming from i have put a great deal into this yet so far i have seen no return for my effort and if we are to carry out the next phase of our plan and embroil the cia in scandal we need to begin passing your information on to senator ferris this was the one part of the plan that rickman had never fully embraced senator ferris was a windbag and although rickman felt strongly that america should not be involved in afghanistan the idea of senator ferris getting credit for america changing its policy turned his stomach now was not the time to discuss the senator though general i dont believe for a second that you have seen no return on your investment ive heard the enthusiasm in your voice you are very proud and you should be you have conducted one of the greatest intelligence operations of the modern era and i have no doubt that when the proper amount of time has passed you will let the world know and you will bask in the accolades of your countrymen but until then you may enjoy the knowledge the extreme satisfaction that you have outsmarted perhaps the greatest intelligence agency in the world chapter zurich switzerland rapps anxiety increased as the heavy sedan climbed its way up the mountain road europe had become a major pain in the ass gone were the days when you could slip in and out of a country or a town without being noticed now there were cameras everywhere even in the little hamlets that dotted the swiss countryside customs and law enforcement databases were linked and everybody was either online or texting or talking on an always available cell phone getting into a country like switzerland wasnt necessarily the problem even killing someone like obrecht was manageable the problem was what happened in the aftermath you left a digital footprint as you traveled and investigators had gotten really good at assembling the puzzle and coming up with a suspect the fear of getting caught after the fact was very real as the israelis had learned firsthand when theyd sent a team of agents into dubai to kill mahmoud almabhouh a senior hamas official customs computers and cameras as well as hotel security cameras had captured the entire team assembling for the operation and then leaving the lesson was simple sneaking into a country to snoop and steal was still fairly easy but once you started killing people you had better find a way to erase your digital footprint or you were going to have your photo plastered all over the bbc and every other twentyfourhour news channel as a result operations were increasingly complex instead of flying directly into zurich and having to clear customs the group landed at ramstein air base where the appropriate stamps were placed on their passports to make it look as if they had arrived in frankfurt germany two days earlier local assets then moved the group to a nearby private airstrip where they boarded a second jet for the short flight to zurich with eu customs already cleared the group of eight deplaned at the private jet terminal and loaded their gear into two waiting bmw series sedans among them they had six assault rifles twelve pistols a pound of plastic explosives and a wide variety of technical gear none of it would have made it through normal customs the only security camera they spotted was at the gate and the heavily tinted windows of their bmws rendered them useless it was saturday afternoon and the advance team had informed them after landing at ramstein that obrecht had left his townhouse in zurich and had traveled to his estate near lake constance they emailed aerial video of the place that had been taken by a small drone rapp hurley and coleman took a moment to review the footage and none of them liked what they saw hurley was surprised by the size of the estate while coleman was worried about the number of men who appeared to be guarding the place for close to seventy years elements within the cia had maintained a very good relationship with a swiss bank owned by the ohlmeyer family after watching the surveillance video rapp said to hurley i think you need to reach out to the ohlmeyers and find out what they know about this guy theres no way hes a simple private banker if he owns a place like this he must own the whole bank and if he owns the whole bank what in the hell is he doing managing someone like gould the interrogation with gould had been brief due to the fact that they had to catch a plane but they got what they needed in terms of obrecht or at least thats what rapp had thought at the time i told you we should have brought him along hurley said referring to gould the little shit lied to us gould had told them that obrecht had been more than his private banker he was also his handler setting up contracts and negotiating prices with his prospective employers so he knows who hired you to kill me rapp had asked back in the interrogation cell gould would not commit to that point as obrecht rarely met facetoface with prospective employers but he did handle the transfer of funds which could likely lead to the person who had put the price on rapps head rapp looked at the video of the massive estate it had to be worth at least million he got the pissedoff feeling that gould had played them theres no way this guy is just your average banker could be family money coleman suggested that was when rapp put marcus dumond on the problem of finding out who owned the estate dumond their resident computer expert was not having a good day hed spent the majority of the flight trying and failing to hack into obrechts banks computer system rapp had rarely seen dumond so frustrated rapp had come to the conclusion that gould had likely lied to them as to hurleys point that they should have brought gould along rapp couldnt bear to spend another second with the man he made him sick and if kennedy was serious about keeping him alive she needed to keep them apart because rapp wanted to kill him even though the prospects didnt look good they continued on the second leg of the journey they might not be able to get their hands on obrecht while he sat behind the walls of his estate but he couldnt stay there forever on sunday night more than likely he would have to make the return trip to zurich the winding mountain roads would provide the perfect opportunity for an ambush rapp sat behind the wheel and hurley was in the front passenger seat dumond and hayek were in back dumond still trying to hack into the bank while hayek tried to get a lead on obrechts mobile phone with a digitized scanner gould had given them a number but so far they werent getting a thing which meant that either the phone was turned off or gould had lied again they met the advance team on the outskirts of a small town called engwilen it was a malefemale team which rapp was happy to see as it was easier for them to blend in and look like a couple they had made one pass by the main gate to confirm what the drone had already shown four men in dark blue swat uniforms were at the main gate and at least one dog and his handler could be seen halfway up the driveway rapp watched the video they had taken and said it looks like a frickin g eight summit rapp and hurley stood around the trunk of the first bmw with coleman and the couple and asked questions for another ten minutes the entire thing looked hopeless the couple said they were fairly certain the place had an advanced security system around the perimeter of the property and that they assumed the house would have one as well beyond that theyd used the drone to count a total of eight bodyguards how many more were in the house was anybodys guess they all agreed that the smartest course was to wait for obrecht to leave the estate and take him on the way back to zurich in the meantime hayek would coordinate with langley to see if they could get signal interception on the house and dumond would continue to try to hack into the banks secure server coleman took his men into the town to scout things out and see if there was an inn without security cameras where they might be able to spend the night rapp and hurley stood at the rear of the car neither speaking for a long while they were both in dark suits with lightweight overcoats the temperature was in the midfifties but the afternoon sun was making things warm hurley lit a cigarette and exhaled he tilted his face skyward and took in the warmth of the sun do you know whats strange theres a lot of strange shit stan youre going to have to be more specific hurley opened one eye and squinted at rapp i feel good thats nice i mean im at peace with the whole thing they didnt talk for over a minute and then hurley asked you thinking what im thinking hurley asked yeah rapp replied but theyll have cameras at the gate hurley shrugged who gives a shit ill be dead in six months why do you keep talking like that because its true hurley said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world rapp thought about it for a moment and then said it might be but dont waste your breath hurley said cutting him off you and i dont bullshit each other lets not start now hurley was right theyd always been honest with each other at least after the first year or two now wasnt the time to start denying the truth besides it was his death he could choose to deal with it in whatever way worked for him all right lets go rapp pushed off the car you have your interpol creds never leave home without them good ill text scott and let him know the climbed into the car and rapp fired up the engine he slipped the car into gear and pulled out on the smooth country road where are we going hayek asked from the backseat stan wants to knock on obrechts door youre joking right hurley shook his head i dont joke about stuff like this princess but i thought we were going to wait for him to drive back to zurich tomorrow we could rapp said but it might get messy hurley added im going to knock on the front door instead you might be surprised how often it works and if it doesnt rapp said it still might how hayek didnt understand anything they were saying spook him hurley said right now hes comfortable thinking everything is fine we rattle his cage and he might turn that phone on that youre trying to get a line on he might fly the coop he might do anything that would be better for us than spending the night in some boring town and then finding out tomorrow that he doesnt travel by motorcade back to the city but takes a helicopter instead hayek didnt have a lot of time to consider the new plan as only a few minutes later they pulled off the road across the street from the main gate to obrechts estate hurley handed rapp a set of credentials and checked to make sure his fake interpol identification was in order rapp looked out the windshield at the four bodyguards what do you think rentacops or the real deal hurley watched the men for a moment and said they look like the real deal to me me too no sense in trying to bully my way then ill make some easy conversation and then leave them a calling card and with that hurley was out the door wish me luck rapp watched him cross the street no one knew hurleys exact age but rapp guessed he was in his early to mid seventies although he knew he could easily be off the man moved like someone twenty years younger but his face showed the wear of someone who had been through a lot of rough stuff dammit dumond barked from the backseat rapp looked in the rearview mirror to see what was wrong dumond had attended mit with rapps little brother steven the computer genius had run afoul of the feds for hacking into some of new yorks biggest banks rapp had kennedy intervene on dumonds behalf rather than go to jail the whiz kid decided to come to work for langley rapp had rarely if ever seen him so frustrated whats wrong marcus this is bullshit mitch you still cant get in i cant even get close why these guys are using heavyduty shit like the stuff the chinese use and our buddies out at fort meadeim talking cuttingedge stuff rapp didnt know a lot about what dumond did but he tried to help would it be better if you were back at langley on a bigger computer faster hookup speed dumond looked at rapps reflection in the mirror with a dont even try to act like you know what youre talking about look rapp threw up his hands just trying to help dumond went back to hammering away on his keyboard the point im trying to make is that this isnt normal the only people that pay for protection like this are people who are really paranoid and im not talking paranoid for the sake of being paranoid im talking paranoid because they need to hide some serious shit rapp watched hurley talk to the bodyguards but was still thinking about dumonds frustration herr obrecht was turning out to be a far more interesting person than he had first thought rapp watched hurley hand one of the men a card and jog back to the car howd it go nice chap hurley pushed back in his seat and straightened his jacket british no hes one of ours green beret the other two are british and i think the third one is polish special forces who do they work for obrecht directly not triple canopy or someone nope obrecht brought them on board a month ago rapp thought about the timing anything else yeah i wrote down my number on a card and told him to give it to his boss hurley pointed across the street look hes calling him right now the guard had a handset in one hand and hurleys business card in the other i told him to tell his boss that i needed to talk to him about louie gould rapp was surprised i like that if gould was telling us the truth that should freak him out you think hell call no rapp shook his head a guy like this will have his lawyers call interpol and ask about you and if you check out then he might call but its a saturday so the earliest wed hear from him would be monday yeah i bet youre right they watched the bodyguards for another minute and then rapp said ive been thinking marcus is having a hell of a time trying to get into the banks server he said they are using highend stuff doesnt surprise me these banks are security conscious now this is different dumond declared from the backseat not your normal stuff my point is this rapp continued obrecht seems awfully security conscious does he seem like the kind of guy who would sit down with someone from the fbi and willingly turn over private information pertaining to his clients financial transactions hurley frowned no he doesnt this doesnt smell right i think someone is jerking our chain rapp drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and was about to suggest they head back to hook up with coleman when he noticed a dark gray peugeot round the corner in front of them as the vehicle neared the gate it slowed to a crawl nothing too unusual when you thought of the big ornate gate and the armed men standing in front of it rapps window was down and he leaned over the steering wheel to get a good look at the driver and passengers there were four of them all with jetblack hair and dark skin the driver had a thick mustache but it was the man in the rear passenger seat who caught rapps eye when the cars were almost level with each other rapp and the man in the backseat locked on to each other and the expression on the mans face was one of both recognition and fear the other car was gone in an instant and before rapp could articulate what was on his mind hurley said what in the fuck are four rag heads doing sightseeing in the middle of switzerland on a saturday afternoon rapp wasnt sure the men were afghanis but he was sure the man in the backseat recognized him rapp pulled the gearshift into drive and checked his mirror did you see the guy in the backseat yeah he looked like he saw a ghost hurley snapped his head around and theyre not waiting around to talk youd better whip a uturn and step on it chapter rapp pushed the car past mph popped in his earpiece and called colemans cell as it started to ring he rounded a corner and caught his first glimpse of the gray sedan the sedan disappeared around the next corner faster than rapp would have thought possible they had to be going close to mph theyre in a hurry hurley announced you two have your seat belts on rapp asked hayek and dumond they both did rapp glanced over at hurley and saw that he was not wearing his belt big deal hurley said in his angry voice yeah i know youre going to be dead in six months but thats six months from now so put on your damn seat belt whats up colemans voice asked over rapps earpiece we are in pursuit of a gray fourdoor peugeot sedan headed your way theres four guys inside all late thirties or early forties looks like theyre afghanis or pakistanis theyre pakistanis hurley stated more forcefully i know my pakis rapp ignored him and focused on coleman are you at the inn standing on the sidewalk in front get back to the car and get out to the other side of town where we were stopped earlier the ditch on the south side has some good concealment put wicker in there and have him shoot out the tires on the peugeot when it clears the town rapp could hear coleman shouting orders to his men scott rapp said theyre coming fast you guys need to really haul ass were on it already in the car and moving do you want me to stay on the line no this road only goes to one place get in position and call me and if you guys get in a shootout dont kill all of them we need to talk to a few of these guys copy ill ring you back hurley pointed at the road you need to speed up scotts got things handled what if he doesnt god youre a pain in the ass sometimes rapp braked and turned the wheel the tires skidding on the pavement you want me to end up in the ditch i just think you could go a little faster thats all they were on a straightaway now and rapp pushed the bmw north of mph only to have a car pull out of a driveway rapp swerved into the oncoming lane and slowed another tight turn was up ahead and there was no sign of the peugeot with each turn he expected to see the car smoking and wrapped around a tree he didnt need to catch them only stay close enough to drive them to coleman three hundred yards on the other side of town right where the road began to curve north coleman pulled over and popped the trunk wicker jumped out and grabbed his shooting bag as soon as the trunk was closed the bmw took off and wicker ran across the road into the ditch and up the other side the mistake most people made with vehicle interdiction was that they set up too close to the road once you took the shot you then ended up with a fiveton vehicle careening toward you out of control wicker went to the edge of the trees turned checked out his spot and dropped his bag the former seal sniper didnt bother with his camouflage netting as the trees offered enough concealment he set up his position against the base of a big pine tree then marked two signs on the road and their approximate distance as wicker eased his eye into position behind the scope he focused on his breathing less than ten seconds later he heard the roar of an engine and popped his head up to see the gray sedan flying through the middle of town at an incredibly reckless speed wicker dropped his eye behind the scope and acquired the target the guy was going too fast to allow wider to get off an accurate shot but he knew he would have to slow down or hed never make the next turn almost on cue the vehicle braked hard wicker sighted in on the front drivers side tire and squeezed off a suppressed round a split second later he heard a pop and then sound of rubber shredding the front left corner of the peugeot dropped down and the back end began to swing around clockwise wicker grabbed his rifle and rolled behind the big pine it was going to be close kassar had been filled with a sense of dread for several days the only reason hed accepted the job to go to zurich was that it would provide him with the opportunity to run if he finally made the decision he no longer trusted durrani hed seen him kill one too many people to tie up his socalled loose ends sooner or later kassar was going to be one of those loose ends and durrani would replace him with one of his fanatical goons like the three men he was working with today kassar despised them durrani had found them in the tribal areas and trained them to carry out his radical plots they were thoughtless militants who wavered between amazing acts of bravery and stupidity there was not an ounce of finesse among the three of them after the first pass of obrechts estate the men unanimously wanted to wait until nightfall and storm the property kassar tried to explain to them that the odds of a successful outcome were close to zero but they would not listen to him it was on the second pass that they found a big surprise kassar had learned that they liked to question his authority unless he invoked general durrani so he had told them upon leaving the embassy that durrani had been very specific if they saw mitch rapp they were supposed to abort the mission and get back to the pakistani embassy as soon as possible when they made their second pass and he saw the bmw parked across the street kassar was curious then he saw rapp behind the steering wheel for once the men listened to him when he told them whom he had seen and that they needed go as fast as possible for the first half mile it worked and then mansur the selfappointed leader of the three started talking about setting up an ambush when kassar told him no mansur wanted to argue and began asking for input from the other two imbeciles that was when kassar lost it and pulled out his phone im calling the general you idiot he gave us specific orders and now you want to argue with him kassar made a great show of hitting send and then holding the phone to his ear mansur tried to apologize but kassar was not interested when durrani finally got on the phone kassar filled him on what was going on and then told him that the men he had sent were incompetent fools who should be reassigned to one of the suicide battalions that the taliban were so proud of when durrani started asking too many questions kassar cut him off and told him he would call him back he ended the call just as they raced into the small town going so fast that they were out of it by the time kassar could tell the driver to slow down he breathed a huge sigh of relief that they were back among the fields and trees kassar had just started to tell the driver to slow down when it happened the car lurched slowed suddenly and then began to spin out of control none of them were wearing their seat belts and when the car came out of its first full spin it flipped and kassar found himself floating between the seat and the ceiling then the vehicle hit something incredibly hard and helicoptered upside down into the forest until it came violently to a stop between two trees disoriented but conscious kassar began to feel his way out of the upsidedown car there was broken glass everywhere and he could already smell the petrol leaking and the burnt rubber of the tires there were other movements inside the car unfortunately the fool mansur was still alive the driver was motionless the thought of rapp in close pursuit drove kassar to ignore the pain and move faster he squirmed out of the vehicle onto his back and sat up he immediately noticed his balance was off but nothing appeared to be broken mansur and one of the other men got out of the car and wanted to know what to do kassar stood and looked down the road to his left he noticed another car and some men with rifles to his right he thought he glimpsed rapps bmw moving through the small town mansur clutched his arm we should make a stand here kassar shook his head and said i know what we need to do he pointed into the woods and when mansur and the other man turned to see what he was pointing at kassar shot them both in the back of the head he then dropped his gun put his hands above his head and walked back to the road chapter ramstein air base the gulfstream g touched down after dark the president had ordered kennedy to meet with her counterpart in pakistan to see if she could find a solution to the brewing controversy at the us embassy in islamabad where four pakistani nationals were seeking political asylum after having been exposed by rickman the crowds were growing each day the worst and most violent on friday when a group of radical imams had led a march on the embassy that had resulted in three deaths and pakistani security forces dispersing the crowd with tear gas and rubber bullets the imams had promised to return and storm the embassy kennedy was to try to find a backdoor solution if she failed the secretary of state would be making the next trip the g was capable of flying nonstop from dc to islamabad but kennedy had the plane diverted to ramstein after rapp told her what hed discovered kennedys plane came to a stop next to the other cia g and as soon as the stairs were lowered rapp bounded up the steps with hurley following rapp and hurley continued past the directors security detail and her staff to the back of the plane where they sat down with kennedy with help of hayek rapp had prepared a briefing folder for kennedy rapp handed it to her and said look at this on the flight its information that you can use to make durrani nervous but i dont want you letting him know that we know hes behind this kennedy took the file are you sure hes behind it yes this kassar is cooperating and there is no way he could be making this stuff up and he says rick is still alive kennedy asked alive and resting at durranis private compound hes slated for plastic surgery on monday kennedy grabbed her forehead i cant believe this looking at hurley she asked stan do you trust this man i dont trust anyone except maybe you two but he seems sincere i heard he executed two of his own men in switzerland he did rapp said but they werent his men they were durranis and he claims they were idiots so he just kills them and im supposed to think that makes everything fine hurley and rapp shared an awkward glance its hard to explain irene but i believe this guy rapp said kennedy thought of what rapp had said to her a few days earlier do you believe him because you want to believe him thats not it hurley jumped in this kassar tells a pretty convincing story irene rapp said leaning forward hes the guy in the tape the one who walks in and shoots the two guys he told you that kennedy asked in near total shock yes he told us how he gave rick a shot right before the final beating that would make it look like he was dead they staged the whole thing including leaving the camera behind for us to find and the beating was real yep it was ricks idea kassar said he tried to stop it repeatedly but rick would not listen he said the only way it would work was if they made it look real as kennedy thought of the remorse and recrimination shed felt over rickmans beating and death she was dumbstruck what kind of sick man would go to such lengths and hubbard was supposed to disappear as well hurley added it was part of the deal rick set up he had arranged for hubbard to stay behind and feed mitch the information about the dog and then they would sneak him out of the country but durrani thought bringing hubbard along was too big a risk so he had him killed and told rick mitch did it and gould rick hired him hurley said kassar said rick was obsessed with mitch said he kept telling durrani that the only way this would work was if mitch was killed i dont understand apparently rapp said with no joy he thinks im the only man who ever really got him who understood how he thought and hurley said he was scared shitless of mitch kept telling durrani that mitch was the last man at the agency that if he had even the slightest inkling that something was wrong he wouldnt stop until hed tracked both of them down and killed them which is exactly what im going to do kennedy took in a deep breath and leaned back she could tell by the look on both rapps and hurleys faces that it would be impossible to dissuade them from killing rickman and durrani at the moment she had no objection but this could be a very complicated operation one they might not survive why do i get the feeling that the two of you already have a plan were still working on it rapp said i dont want to rush into this kennedy declared we should get jsoc involved and do this the right way irene you know i love jsoc no one is better than those guys but that could take weeks to pull together rick can give away a lot of secrets in two weeks shit he can give away a lot of secrets in two days i dont like the idea of sending you two in to handle something like this if anything goes wrong i wont be able to help you durrani is a dangerous man irene look at the fallout after the bin laden raid and that was abbottabad sixty minutes north of the capital and bin laden was a fucking saudi and the most notorious terrorist in the world durrani is a decorated army officer and for all intents and purposes the secondmostpowerful man in the isi and his compound is on the outskirts of the capital you cant send the seals or delta force in there well have a fucking war on our hands as much as she hated to admit it he was right how are you going to do it there was another sheepish look between rapp and hurley and then rapp finally said like i said were still working on it thats fine but i want to hear the broad brushstrokes whens your meeting with taj and can you get durrani to attend tomorrow afternoon at three and i have requested that all three deputies attend including nadeem ashan who was fired yesterday good it would really help if you made sure durrani was in attendance he knows three of his men are dead we were listening when kassar told him he freaked out considering the importance of the meeting i think i can make that happen heres what were going to do were going to fly into jalalabad and then cross into pakistan via car the checkpoints are way more lax than the airports this way we can bring our equipment and if kassar makes one wrong move hes dead i cant hold that threat over him if we fly into islamabad international or bhutto how long is the drive kennedy asked four hours tops hurley answered ive done it many times i also have a few guys in peshawar who can facilitate the border crossing so things go smoothly its the wild west with enough guns and money you can get anything you want that doesnt comfort me irene rapp said this shits never easyyou know thatbut if theres ever a time where we need to act quickly this is it durrani still thinks hes safe we had kassar check in and tell him that everything is fine kennedy asked him to explain what they were going to do after they got to jalalabad and when rapp was done telling her kennedy said i need to meet this kassar before i sign off on it rapp had expected as much kennedy followed him from one plane to the other while hurley decided to stay outside and smoke a cigarette kassar was in the last seat on the starboard side of the plane with his wrists and ankles flexcuffed he had a bruise on his forehead and some cuts on his arms and hands knowing what his boss was thinking rapp said those are from the car accident we havent laid a hand on him one of colemans shooters bruno mcgraw was watching the prisoner rapp tapped him on the shoulder and told him to take a break kennedy sat down across from kassar and said do you know who i am yes maam how old are you thirtysix and youve worked for general durrani for how long five years why the sudden change of heart kassar took a moment to consider his answer the general has become a very reckless man and he does not treat his people very well kassar looked up at rapp go ahead rapp said tell her when he gets what he wants out of them he has a habit of killing them kassar stopped for a second and then added and lately ive been the one doing the killing for him i get the feeling hes running out of uses for me now that he has mr rickman i know too much so he is going to get rid of me black storks kennedy asked referring to the pakistani special forces nickname yes seven years and you were recruited to the isi yes kennedy looked at his haircut and his clothes his suit was torn and bloody but it was a nice cut where did you grow up karachi slums yes and the army gave you a new life correct religion islam kassar said without any passion not very serious no she wasnt sure if she could believe him even though he sounded sincere so what do you want out of this kassar looked nervously at rapp and said my life thats a good start but you surely have other hopes and aspirations i dont think pakistan is really an option for me anymore she understood what about america kassar got a faraway look in his eye america would be nice and what do you think of mitchs plan to go in and get mr rickman and general durrani get them you mean we are taking them with us rapp intervened she means kill rapp didnt want this any more complicated than it already was i think its a good plan all right kennedy stared at him for a long time and finally said vazir i dont treat my people like general durrani if you do a good job on this and everyone makes it out alive i will make sure you are taken care of i might even have a job for you but only if you want it if you dont well set you up with a new identity and some money and you can start your life over does that sound good yes kassar nodded it sounds very good okay kennedy pointed at the flex cuffs and nodded to rapp no more need for these after rapp had cut the plastic cuffs with his knife kennedy shook kassars hand and said good luck vazir i look forward to getting to know you better when you return rapp followed kennedy off the plane and walked her across the tarmac they stopped midway between the two planes where rapp asked whatd you think its impossible to know someones heart after talking to him for a few minutes yeah i know but whats your impression i think hes worth the risk kennedy looked back at rapps plane and then added but if he makes one wrong move if you get even the slightest whiff i want you to put him down are we clear crystal good kennedy kissed him on the cheek good luck and dont do anything stupid chapter interservices intelligence hq islamabad pakistan kennedy entered air force general ahmed tajs office with mike nash who had flown in from bagram she had briefed him on kassar back in the embassys secure conference room taj durrani and nassir were all decked out in their military uniforms while ashan was in a suit kennedy was pleased to see that ashan was there but noted that he did not look well the office was a grandiose affair left over from the brits no doubt it was easily four times bigger than kennedys the walls and ceiling were paneled in a dark wood and there were three large stone fireplaces bookcases dominated every wall and there were two flatscreen monitors one by the large conference table and the other one by tajs desk taj and his three deputies were standing near the fireplace to their right kennedy walked over and said hello to each man when she got to ashan she said nadeem i am sorry to hear of your difficulties one of the things i would like to clear up today is your situation its a travesty durrani announced passionately kennedy looked at the judas to her left she had had ample time on the plane to review the entire rickman affair and analyze the various motives of rickman and durrani as for rickman she had a few guesses about why hed decided to become a traitor but durrani was clearcut he wanted tajs job and he wanted ashan and every other moderate out of his way he would use rickmans information to bolster his status and within a year or two he would be running the isi and all of its clandestine operations taj stepped forward with a pained expression on his face director kennedy i must caution you nadeem is only here as a favor from our president to yours he no longer works at the isi and has no official capacity here today yes i find it all rather interesting i think your intelligence agency may have been played the same way as mine was but we will discuss that later yes taj said not having a clue what kennedy meant please sit taj directed her to a massive leather couch that could seat six adults it was centered on the fireplace with couches that ran perpendicular off each end durrani and ashan sat on the couch to the right and nassir and nash sat on the other couch taj asked kennedy if shed like some tea she declined and withdrew a briefing folder signaling to everyone that this was all about business this problem with your embassy taj winced is very bad for our relations i agree kennedy offered quickly then you should hand those four men over durrani said as if it was the only option kennedy ignored durrani and directed her remarks at general taj i dont like this strife between our two countries but something is afoot here and until we figure out what is going on those four men will be afforded the safety of the sovereign territory of the united states of america durrani laughed at the preposterous claim general kennedy said turning to durrani surely you dont dispute the fact that the american embassy is sovereign us territory no but i dont think the clerics will acknowledge you the same fact then why dont you explain it to them rather than use your political affairs officers to whip them into a frenzy durrani kept his cool im sorry director kennedy but you are misinformed i dont think so general but you and i will agree to disagree as we usually do kennedy opened her file and pulled out a series of photos like a card dealer she tossed three sets on the table one in front of durrani and ashan the second in front of taj and the third in front of nash and nassir you are all familiar with the abduction interrogation and murder of one of my men last week in afghanistan they all nodded and kennedy said a second attempt was made on the life of another one of my people this was the episode in which twentyone police officers were killed it turned out they had been ordered to attack my men by general qayem who has since disappeared kennedy pointed at the photos these two men one of them was killed in the attack and the other we are unable to locate do any of you recognize either of them no one answered so kennedy said according to afghan intelligence these two men are isi assets what are you trying to imply durrani asked angrily im not trying to imply anything im just trying to get some answers please by all means show these photos around and see if any of your assets have gone rogue on you this is preposterous durrani said you are merely trying to distract us from the fact that despite being our supposed ally you hold four pakistani citizens whom you have recruited to spy against us in your embassy im not arguing that point general im just trying to find out who launched a coordinated attack against my clandestine service last week durrani threw his hands up in frustration while taj said im sorry director kennedy but we have no knowledge of what you are talking about maybe maybe not i have another interesting piece of information for you kennedy retrieved the copies of special agent wilsons affidavits with herr obrecht she doled out three sets of copies and said have any of you heard of the swiss bank sparkasse schaffhausen ashans face lit up thats the bank where i supposedly have a million dollars deposited courtesy of your government i thought id heard that well apparently this same bank has accounts for the now deceased mr rickman and another one of my key people even though i know for a fact that my people never opened any accounts at this bank or should say i know mr rapp never opened an account at this bank but i cant say the same for mr rickman why is that durrani asked because hes dead i have no way to prove that he didnt kennedy turned her attention back to taj saying the point is we think this bank has been used to make certain people at the cia look corrupt when in fact they are not this disinformation was passed on to the fbi in an effort to jumpstart a criminal investigation against the cia fortunately other elements within the fbi believe this is part of the same plot that involved kidnapping mr rickman and the attempted murder of mr rapp i find it more than a little strange that this is the same bank that deputy general ashan was supposedly storing his illgotten gains in ive never heard of this bank taj said have any of you the three deputies all shook their heads it is a rather strange coincidence why would someone want to frame mr rickman mr rapp and ashan thats a very good question general have you been able to talk to the bank no we have not i sent some people to zurich late friday and they have had a very difficult time tracking down herr obrecht the man whose name is listed on all three accounts kennedy paused and then added there was one strange development however she opened her file for the third time and pulled out more photos my people were parked in front of herr obrechts country villa when a car with four men pulled up the details are a little sketchy but a chase ensued and then a gunfight kennedy tossed the photos of three dead men on the table a fourth man escaped and we were unable to track him down but we have a good description of him he had black hair was darkskinned with dark eyes and he well kennedy pointed at the photos he looked like these three men kennedy cocked her head to the side and asked what nationality would you say these men are general taj the director general of the isi scooped up the photos and stared at them while a layer of perspiration formed on his forehead after several painful moments he cleared his throat and said they look pakistani and why would they be in switzerland trying to talk to herr obrecht did you send men to talk to herr obrecht taj was embarrassed beyond anything he had ever experienced if you will excuse me director kennedy i think we will need to continue this tomorrow i need to speak in private with my deputies right now by all means general if you need me ill be at the embassy chapter bahria town pakistan as hurley had promised the border crossing had been uneventful the two dusty dented latemodel toyota runners made their way through the mountain pass and down the a through peshawar and into islamabad in three hours and fortyseven minutes rapp drove the lead vehicle with kassar in the front passenger seat and hurley and dumond in back coleman and three of his men followed in the second vehicle everyone was dressed in local garb they were traveling with several hundred thousand dollars in cash and if they were stopped they werent going to try to get cute and claim they were working for an international aid organization they were weapons merchants and they had plenty of samples to show any border agents or army personnel who were interested as it turned out they burned through just ten thousand dollars in cash using hurleys contacts at the borders after that they moved unmolested with all of the trucks that were busy carrying supplies back and forth between pakistan and afghanistan they arrived in the nations capital shortly after one in the afternoon they had worked on the plan while in flight from germany to jalalabad coleman and hurley had gotten into a heated argument with rapp over the plan but rapp had held his ground trying to get the entire team past the guards and into bahria town would raise too much attention kassar was adamant that this would not work hurley said that was bullshit and kassar spent the better part of a half hour trying to prove the unprovable rapp never known for his patience finally put an end to it the best chance for success was for him to be smuggled into the compound in the back of kassars range rover the guards never searched his car wicker could take up a sniper position a half mile from the compound in the foothills just outside bahrias fence line dumond could run aerial with one of the minidrones and the rest of the team would have to roll as a quick reaction force when they picked up kassars truck in humak hurley tried to state his case one more time let me be the one who goes in why as soon as rapp asked the question he knew what hurley would say im going to be dead in six months again with the six months it wont work this time i have a good handle on kassar and although youre no slouch im a little better at this stuff than you are bullshit and besides what happens if you have one of your coughing fits while hes talking to the guards youll probably need a smoke that would blow the whole thing the old spook held up a pack of nicorette gum funny look at you youre like a boy scout prepared for everything rapp grabbed his gun bag and tactical vest and transferred them from the toyota to the back of kassars truck why do you have to be so stubborn hurley asked as a last effort i think i got it from the dickhead who trained me rapp checked one of the pockets on his vest and then slid it on saying listen we dont need to make this complicated irene has people watching durrani shes going to text us updates and you are going to give me radio updates rapp tapped his headset in case im in a spot where i cant look at my phone there are two bodyguards at the compound when durranis not there i can handle a couple of bodyguards who are bored out of their minds but why not put another person in the backseat its not worth the risk they key is to get in without anyone knowing whats going on then its easy rapp could tell hurley was still not buying his plan just keep an eye on durrani if he comes back with more than the usual number of men then you guys might have to bust your way through the secondary gate otherwise ive got it handled rapp started to climb into the back of the range rover and remember its just like you said the other day were all dying rapp pulled up the tailgate and then reached up and started to close the back hatch hurley put his hand up and stopped him what if kassar turns on you ill keep an eye on him hurley still wouldnt let go of the hatch listen im a big boy i can handle myself the threecar convoy rolled out with kassar in the lead when they reached the spot in the foothills where wicker should deploy kassar called coleman and let him know the range rover continued while the other two trucks pulled over wicker jumped out of the last vehicle covered in camouflage netting and disappeared into the underbrush dumond grabbed a case from the back of the truck and popped the clasps the small drone was about the size of a crow dumond unfolded the wings snapping them into place and then started the prop the gray device hummed to life and dumond let it fly releasing it as if it were a paper airplane the uav dipped a few feet and then steadily began to gain altitude it was on a preset program to climb to feet and circle dumond stowed the gear and they all climbed back into the truck and moved out rapp was on his side curled up facing the back of the truck he had already warned kassar that with all due respect if anything went wrong at either the main gate or durranis private gate wicker would shoot him in the head rapp also showed him that the small drone would provide his phone with a birdseye view of what was going on rapp had his pistol in one hand and the phone in the other and watched as they pulled up to the main gate the black suv slowed and came to brief stop before rolling on rapp breathed a sigh of relief as they made it past the first obstacle it took another two minutes to make it to durranis private driveway the guards waved kassar through making no attempt to search the vehicle show me the courtyard rapp whispered to himself on cue dumond zoomed in on the common area between the main house the garage and the two guesthouses a gardener was tending to some plants but other than that no one was about as the vehicle pulled into the garage rapp slid the phone into his vest pocket gripped his gun with both hands and started his fivesecond count that was how much time he had given kassar from the time he parked the car to open the back hatch there was a click and the hatch popped up light spilled through the twoinch gap between the rear cargo cover and the tailgate rapp could see kassar and then he heard a voice kassar began talking to someone rapp couldnt see after about ten seconds the conversation ended and kassar lowered the tailgate rapp slid out of the vehicle but stayed in a crouch while kassar closed things up he then led him through the garage in the exact way he said he would he opened a metal door at the other end and checked things out before continuing down a flight of stairs rapp was right behind him as kassar punched a code into a door lock next they were in a long welllit tunnel and moving at a trot they stopped at a second door and after punching in a code moved up a flight of stairs kassar had rapp wait on the landing until he could get rid of the nurse rapp radioed hurley and told him he was in a few seconds later he heard the nurse moving down the hallway and the front door closing rapp came up the last flight of stairs where kassar was waiting for him he pointed down the hallway and with a nervous look said he has his dog with him the big rottweiler kassar nodded this wasnt rapps first time dealing with dogs his m rifle was slung around his neck and off to one side while he gripped his suppressed pistol with both hands rapp checked to make sure his radio was in transmit mode and said you stay out here let me know if anyone shows up rapp started down the hallway moving silently to the door at the far end kassar had described the layout of the room but rapp had no idea where the dog was he should have asked kassar and thought about going back for a brief second but was too eager to push on he opened the door with his right hand and stepped into the room sweeping his gun right to left and back again he heard the dog growl and placed his front sight on the beasts massive head that dog fucking moves and hes dead a pale hand grabbed the dogs collar rapp looked at the pulped face and if it werent for the fact that hed seen the interrogation video he would have never believed it was rickman you okay rick yes thank god youre here shut the fuck up rick its just that i cant believe you found me rapps eyes continued to dart around the room making sure he didnt miss anything i bet youre shocked as hell since you hired louie gould to kill me and you used your fucking dog as bait mitch i swear to you this is all general durrani he abducted me tortured me and made it look like i was dead so you guys would stop looking for me and then he gave you your dog back to keep you company you are so full of shit rick and too smart for your own good rapp kept coming back to the dog there was no away around it he had nothing against the pooch but he had to go efficient as always rapp squeezed the trigger and sent a single bullet into the rottweilers head the dog didnt make a sound but rickman did he was absolutely beside himself what have you done ajax hasnt done a thing rickman screamed as he wrestled with dogs lifeless body youre a fucking animal god dammit and youre one sick fuck rapp said calmly as he approached the bed your four bodyguards all dead one of them by your own hand mick reavers twentyone cops and hubbard and you dont shed a tear but someone kills your dog and you finally show some emotion rickman couldnt respond he was too devastated by the loss of his dog any final words dont do this mitch i can help you i can still help langley you can debrief me i know things very important things rapp guessed that he probably did but there was this little trust thing rickman and his big brain would be a nightmare for interrogators add to it the fact that his betrayal had gotten some good men killed and the decision was easy fuck you rick rapp squeezed the trigger once chapter durrani was temped to call the mullahs and the imams and order them to storm the american embassy hed even gone so far as to wonder if he dare provide them with a photo of that bitch kennedy so they could kill her for him ultimately though he knew he could not move taj was furious and he was bound to be keeping a close eye on him after kennedy and her man had left the meeting taj demanded answers durrani knew that the photos provided by kennedy would be checked against isi personnel records and eventually all five men would turn up as positive matches that little fact wouldnt necessarily incriminate durrani but the fact that they were assigned to the external wing would sink his career and it would only get worse as they began to interview his deputies durrani was extremely handson and his fingerprints were all over this mess so he did the only thing he could do and admitted to sending the men to switzerland what were you thinking taj asked that my friend had been framed durrani answered with all the sincerity he could muster i knew no one else was going to lift a finger so i sent some men to talk to this banker the photos were still on the table and taj said how did they get into a gunfight with the americans i dont know what type of men are these what were they planning to do to the banker the implication was obvious durrani had sent some knuckle draggers to rough up the banker they were good men i only sent them to get answers durrani could tell that taj didnt believe him and nassir seemed unaffected by the entire disaster durrani supposed he was enjoying the fact that his chief competitor had just shot himself in the foot and ruined his chances of replacing taj go ahead durrani thought to himself continue underestimate me and i will make you pay for it ashan for his part seemed unusually cool toward him durrani would have thought that hed appreciate the fact that he was trying to help him the fact that he wasnt meant ashan was beginning to suspect durranis real motives durrani couldnt get out of the director generals office fast enough he needed to talk to rickman the two of them needed to figure out what to do now as his convoy reached the gates of bahria town durrani wondered if it might not be best to move rickman to another location there was a manpower issue at the moment so security would be a problem though even worse it might further delay the moment when rick shared everything he knew about the cia that was the part that infuriated durrani the most he could replace the men hed lost in switzerland but he could not get the information out of rickman fast enough the cars pulled into the courtyard and durrani was out like a shot raza was waiting for him at the main door and as durrani walked past him he heard his butler say kassar is back durrani spun where is he raza pointed to the smaller of the two guesthouses durrani started back into the house and then decided he did not want to bother with the tunnels besides it was time he took care of something he marched back into the courtyard and yelled for his men to follow him rapp was standing in the kitchen watching the feed from the drone in addition to the video hurley was on the radio acting as playbyplay announcer when durrani exited his car and started for the main house kassar explained that he usually entered the house and then came over through the tunnel when durrani came back into the courtyard and started gathering his men the coms exploded with chatter everyone calm down rapp barked into his lip mike he swung his rifle around and handed kassar his suppressed glock fourteen rounds left hes on his way over with a half dozen men kassar hustled across the foyer to the living room where a magazine and ashtray were waiting for him he sat on the couch and placed the gun close against his right thigh rapp retreated to the pantry on the far side of the kitchen and left the door cracked everyone hold your positions were blind hurley announced im fine ill call if i need help it might be too late by then rapp couldnt reply because he heard the front door open and then the scuffle of shoes and boots on the marble floor with his rifle gripped in both hands he took a look through the crack he counted six men plus durrani what in the hell are you doing here durrani demanded rapp could see a pistol in his hand i told you not to come back here i had no problem getting out of switzerland in fact the only problem i had was with those amateurs you made me bring along they were good men and you got them killed they got themselves killed do you understand the problem you have caused i just left a meeting with the director of the cia she has photos of my men and she gave them to taj i told you not to send them i could have handled it by myself rapp watched durrani raise his pistol i no longer have a need for you rapps right hand pulled the door open his rifle came up as he moved to the left the red dot found the back of the first mans head and rapp squeezed the trigger the spit of the round leaving the barrel was followed by the mans head exploding across the foyer before anyone could react two more men were down rapp skipped durrani and shot the next man the last two men were reacting to the shock of their comrades heads exploding before their very eyes their rifles were swinging in rapps direction but not fast enough rapp shot the fifth man in the face and just before he could take out the sixth man a bullet whistled past rapps left shoulder he pulled the trigger a sixth time and the man collapsed to the floor blood flowing from the back of his head rapp aimed his rifle at a shocked durrani and said im clear six tangos down slick rapp said to wicker anyone with a gun moves toward my position take them out how dare you durrani stood shaking in the middle of the foyer six dead bodyguards at his feet this is an rapp had no desire to listen to any empty threats so he lowered his riples muzzle and shot durrani in the left knee the general looked as if a puppeteer had cut his strings he collapsed to the floor landing in an everexpanding pool of blood i am the last man you should have fucked with you stupid prick you dont understand rapp stopped listening to durrani as his team started chattering over his earpiece it sounded wicker was engaging at least one target they needed to get moving and rapp didnt really care to listen to durrani so he raised his rifles muzzle and was about to squeeze the trigger when kassar said wait kassar stepped over the bodies and looked down at durrani i always knew it would come to this one day i was good to you durrani said clutching his knee you were just about to kill me but was all durrani could manage to say with calm in his eyes and a steady hand kassar said i no longer have any use for you he then sent a single bullet into his employers head rapp took note of the clean shot kassar turned the pistol around in his hand and offered it to rapp rapp shook his head and started moving toward the staircase you keep it chapter aurora highlands virginia wilson was feeling a little better it was monday night and his redskins were up by seventeen points against their hated rival the eagles with less than five minutes to go in wilsons opinion there was no worse fan on the planet than a philadelphia eagles fan they even managed to make yankees fans seem like model citizens wilson took the redskins advantage as a sign that things were looking up he checked his watch and finished his beer it was time for another one of his latenight meetings he grabbed the leash and found the dog waiting at the front door which he didnt like as he didnt want the damn mutt getting used to this his wife pushed her chair away from the desk but didnt bother standing isnt this nice i love the fact that you two are bonding lets not go overboard here she stood and gave him a kiss placing her hand on his stomach youre going to lose this little belly if you keep this up wilson wasnt aware that he had a belly he patted himself i have a gut just a teeny one she said holding her thumb and forefinger an inch apart she kissed him again im going to take a shower and then climb into bed with nothing on and wait for you to get back she started up the stairs and said dont be too long wilson decided things were definitely looking up the temperature had already dropped into the forties and wilson decided that he and ferris were going to have to come up with a different way to meet he was getting sick of walking this stupid dog in the cold night air he took his usual route wishing they could meet in an office on capitol hill he stopped at the prescribed corner and checked his watch he was on time thirty seconds later he said where the fuck are you guys im freezing my ass off at the far end of the street he saw a man standing under a streetlight a few seconds later the man made his way down the block when he was within speaking distance wilson said youre late darren sickles looked over both shoulders and said i wanted to make sure i wasnt followed wilson wanted to tell him that no one gave enough of a shit to have him followed but he got the impression that sickles had a very fragile ego so he kept that thought to himself the town car pulled up a minute later and wilson had sickles get in first it was a little snug with the three of them in back instead of waiting for ferris to ask for the dog wilson simply handed him over again mr sickles ferris started joel tells me youre not very happy with your current employer no sir wilson looked out the window at the passing houses he said rapp threatened to kill him id prefer to hear it from mr sickles if you dont mind im just trying to speed things along wilson thought ive got a naked woman waiting for me yes he threatened my life among other things sickles said what else pretty much every nasty thing in the book when was this after joe rickman was kidnapped do you know who he is most certainly well rapp blamed me for that said i was drinking the administrations koolaid on reintegration ferris smiled he couldnt wait to get sickles to give this answer under oath in front of all the cameras but most important he threatened your life yes and what are your feelings about the missing funds with rapp and rickman you mean yesand anyone else at the cia the clandestine service in my opinion is rife with corruption and rapp and rickman are the poster boys for what is wrong with the place thats why rickman was taken but no one wants to talk about how corrupt he was ferris nodded as if he understood all of sickless frustrations im about to announce hearings into this mess probably wednesday i might have to compel you to testify can you assure me that you will give these same answers when i put you under oath sickles thought about it for a long moment my career is basically over why not this is about doing the right thing ferris searched sickless eyes for a sense of commitment i can protect you from them as chairman of the judiciary committee i can help clean out the rats nest sickles liked the sound of that okay ill testify good now before i announce things on wednesday i want you to reach out to arianna vinter and colonel poole and see if they will corroborate your statements i understand rapp was very rude to them during his most recent visit to ferris stopped speaking when he heard the sirens flashing red and blue lights were bouncing off the windows the town car lurched to a sudden stop and then the doors were opened wilson was ripped from the car and thrown to the pavement as was sickles both men had their arms wrenched behind their backs and cuffed sickles was silent but not wilson he was arguing like a madman about his rights a man in a dark suit and a dark trench coat approached ferriss open door senator please get out of the car and if i dont want to rapp bent over and showed his face then ill gladly drag your ass from the vehicle and cuff you ferris sighed and got out of the car i know who you are he said to rapp you have no right to arrest me youre right but he does rapp pointed at fbi director miller who was standing next to a black suburban keeping a close eye on things if youd like you can deal with him but then everything gets real official and the press will get involved and based on what ive seen you really dont want to go that route coleman stepped in and took the dog from the senator as he walked away he removed the bug hed placed there the previous week this way senator rapp said as he led the man toward kennedys waiting suburban ferris joined kennedy in the backseat and rapp got into the front passenger seat i dont want you to speak senator said kennedy we have recordings of your little meetings with agent wilson hardly a crime i said dont speak earlier this evening we confiscated your maids laptop which contains some very incriminating emails between you and general durrani of the pakistani isi by the way did you know he was shot and killed in his house yesterday kennedy could tell by the surprised look on the senators face that he had not heard do you know what else they found in his house no well its not good the body of one of my clandestine service officers joe rickman i think youve heard of him apparently general durrani was behind kidnapping and torturing him for information that he was going to use against the united states now as this starts to sink in senator i want you to think of two paths one will involve a great deal of embarrassment and an extremely public trial for treason none of your colleagues will support you because i will show them the information i have and you will be completely toxic to them you will probably be spared execution since we no longer have the stomach for that anymore but you will most certainly go to jail and i will make sure it is the kind of jail that a scumbag like you deserves the second path you may choose is to show up in my office tomorrow morning at am sharp where you will be debriefed you may keep your job and your chairmanship and despite your hatred of the cia you will become one of our most valuable allies of the cia on the capitol hill do you understand your two options ferris swallowed hard and said i do kennedy looked at her watch and said all right you have ten seconds to decide there was only one valid option for a man like ferris ill take option number two maybe later he could figure out a way to undo this mess good kennedy said ill see you at nine tomorrow morning rapp opened the door for ferris and when they were a few feet away from the suburban rapp grabbed him by the arm and said there is a third option whats that i sneak into your house in the middle of the night and i snap your neck rapp stared at ferris for an uncomfortably long moment and then said good night senator rapp walked back to the suv and climbed into the backseat as they were driving away kennedy asked you still dont like it do you rapp rubbed his eyes i would prefer to kill him i know thats your default switch for every problem but sometimes its a little more complicated than that i know we avoid all the publicity and we now own the chairman of one of the most powerful committees in town they drove in silence for a few blocks and then kennedy said we have one problem rapp was staring at his iphone checking emails we have lots of problems what do you want to do with gould i didnt think my opinion mattered dont get all sensitive on me it doesnt suit you well you know your opinion matters rapp thought about it for a second and said you know what im tired and i dont give a shit what you do with him as long as you keep him away from me if we let him go do you think hell quit no rapp answered without hesitation he wont quit until hes crippled or dead kennedy had to be careful with this next part rapp was likely to come unglued she cleared her throat and said what if we put him on retainer she watched as rapp slowly turned his head toward her waiting for the explosion rapps jaw was locked in a grimace and then it slowly started to relax id say we give him a trial run he screws up hes dead he finishes the job well sit down and talk that was unexpected kennedy didnt bother hiding her surprise and i know who were going to send him after rapp thought about all of the tight security around the man and how difficult it would be to kill obrecht just maybe rapp would get lucky and obrecht would put gould out of his misery and save rapp from the guilt of doing it himself who kennedy asked a bit nervous i think our newest swiss banker would be a nice place to start herr obrecht exactly
