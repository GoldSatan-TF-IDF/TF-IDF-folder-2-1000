of a closing hymn there was music the who love reign oer me rebus recognized it the moment it started thunderclaps and teeming rain filling the chapel he was in the front pew chrissie had insisted hed rather have been further back his usual place at funerals chrissies son and daughter sat next to her lesley was comforting her mother an arm around her as the tears fell kenny stared straight ahead storing up emotion for later earlier that morning back at the house rebus had asked him his age he would be thirty next month lesley was two years younger brother and sister looked like their mother reminding rebus that people had said the same about michael and him the pair of you the spitting image of your mum michaelmickey if you preferred rebuss younger brother dead in a shinyhandled box at the age of fiftyfour scotland s mortality rate that of a third world nation lifestyle diet genesplenty of theories the full postmortem hadnt come through yet massive stroke was what chrissie had told rebus on the phone assuring him that it was suddenas if that made a difference sudden meant rebus hadnt been able to say goodbye it meant his last words to michael had been a joke about his beloved raith rovers soccer team in a phone call three months back a raith scarf navy and white had been draped over the coffin alongside the wreaths kenny was wearing a tie that had been his dads raiths shield on itsome kind of animal holding a belt buckle rebus had asked the significance but kenny had just shrugged looking along the pew rebus saw the usher make a gesture everyone rose to their feet chrissie started walking up the aisle flanked by her children the usher looked to rebus but he stayed where he was sat down again so the others would know they didnt have to wait for him the song was only a little more than halfway through it was the closing track on quadrophenia michael had been the big who fan rebus himself preferring the stones had to admit though albums like tommy and quadrophenia did things the stones never could daltrey was whooping now that he could use a drink rebus had to agree but there was the drive back to edinburgh to consider the function room of a local hotel had been booked all were welcome as the minister had reminded them from the pulpit whiskey and tea would be poured sandwiches served there would be anecdotes and reminiscences smiles dabs at the eyes hushed tones the staff would move quietly out of respect rebus was trying to form sentences in his head words that would act as his apology i need to get back chrissie pressure of work he could lie and blame the g that morning in the house lesley had said he must be busy with the buildup he could have told her im the only cop they dont seem to need officers were being drafted in from all over fifteen hundred were coming from london alone yet detective inspector john rebus seemed surplus to requirements someone had to man the shipthe very words dci james macrae had used with his acolyte smirking by his shoulder di derek starr reckoned himself the heir apparent to macraes throne one day hed be running gayfield square police station john rebus posed no threat whatsoever not much more than a year away from retirement starr himself had said as much nobodyd blame you for coasting john its what anyone your age would do maybe so but the stones were older than rebus daltrey and townshend were older than him too still playing still touring the song was ending now and rebus rose to his feet again he was alone in the chapel took a final look at the purple velvet screen maybe the coffin was still behind it maybe it had already been moved to another part of the crematorium he thought back to adolescence two brothers in their shared bedroom playing s bought down kirkcaldy high street my generation and substitute mickey asking about daltreys stutter on the former rebus saying hed read somewhere that it had to do with drugs the only drug the brothers had indulged in was alcohol mouthfuls stolen from the bottles in the pantry a can of sickly stout broken open and shared after lightsout standing on kirkcaldy promenade staring out to sea and mickey singing the words to i can see for miles but could that really have happened the record came out in or by which time rebus was in the army must have been on a trip back yes mickey with his shoulderlength hair trying to copy daltreys look and rebus with his military crew cut inventing stories to make army life seem exciting northern ireland still ahead of him theyd been close back then rebus always sending letters and postcards his father proud of him proud of both the boys the spitting image of your mum he stepped outside the cigarette packet was already open in his hand there were other smokers around him they offered nods shuffling their feet the various wreaths and cards had been lined up next to the door and were being studied by the mourners the usual words would crop up condolence and loss and sorrow the family would be in our thoughts michael wouldnt be mentioned by name death brought its own set of protocols the younger mourners were checking for text messages on their phones rebus dug his own out of his pocket and switched it on five missed calls all from the same number rebus knew it from memory pushed the buttons and raised the phone to his ear detective sergeant siobhan clarke was quick to answer ive been trying you all morning she complained i had it switched off where are you anyway still in kirkcaldy there was an intake of breath hell john i completely forgot dont worry about it he watched kenny open the car door for chrissie lesley was motioning to rebus letting him know they were headed for the hotel the car was a bmw kenny doing all right for himself as a mechanical engineer he wasnt married had a girlfriend but she hadnt been able to make it to the funeral lesley was divorced her own son and daughter off on holiday with their dad rebus nodded at her as she got into the back of the car i thought it was next week siobhan was saying i take it youre phoning for a gloat rebus started walking toward his saab siobhan had been in perthshire the past two days accompanying macrae on a recon of g security macrae was old pals with taysides assistant chief constable all macrae wanted was a look around his friend happy to oblige the g leaders would meet at gleneagles hotel on the outskirts of auchterarder nothing around them but acres of wilderness and miles of security fence there had been plenty of scare stories in the media reports of three thousand us marines landing in scotland to protect their president anarchist plots to block roads and bridges with hijacked trucks bob geldof had demanded that a million demonstrators besiege edinburgh they would be housed he said in peoples spare rooms garages and gardens boats would be sent to france to pick up protesters groups with names like ya basta and the black bloc would aim for chaos while the peoples golfing association wanted to break the cordon to play a few holes of gleneagless renowned course im spending two days with dci macrae siobhan was saying whats to gloat about rebus unlocked his car and leaned in to slide the key into the ignition he straightened again took a last drag on his cigarette and flicked the butt onto the roadway siobhan was saying something about a scene of crime team hold on rebus told her i didnt catch that look youve got enough on your plate without this without what remember cyril colliar despite my advancing years the memorys not quite packed in something really strange has happened what i think ive found the missing piece of what the jacket rebus found that hed lowered himself onto the drivers seat i dont understand siobhan gave a nervous laugh me neither so where are you now auchterarder and thats where the jackets turned up sort of rebus swung his legs into the car and pulled the door shut then im coming to take a look is macrae with you he went to glenrothes thats where the g control center is she paused are you sure you should be doing this rebus had started the engine i need to make my apologies first but i can be there inside the hour will i have any trouble getting into auchterarder its the calm before the storm when youre driving through town look for the sign to the clootie well the what easier if you just come and see for yourself then thats what ill do scene of crime on their way yes which means word will get around should i tell the dci ill let you decide rebus had wedged the phone between his shoulder and his cheek so he could steer the mazelike course to the gates of the crematorium youre breaking up siobhan said not if i can help it rebus thought to himself cyril colliar had been murdered six weeks before age twenty hed been locked away on a fixed tenyear stretch for a vicious rape at the end of the sentence hed been released despite the reservations of prison warders police and social services they figured he was as big a threat as ever having shown no remorse denying his guilt despite dna evidence colliar had returned to his native edinburgh all the bodybuilding hed done in prison paid off he worked as a nighttime bouncer and daytime muscle his employer on both counts was morris gerald cafferty big ger was a villain of long standing in had been rebuss job to confront him about his latest employee what do i care had been the retort hes dangerous way youre hassling him would try the patience of a saint cafferty swinging from side to side on his leather swivel chair behind his desk at mgc lettings anyone was slow with the weekly rent on one of caffertys flats rebus guessed that was where colliar would take over cafferty owned minicabs too and at least three raucous bars in the less salubrious parts of town plenty of work for cyril colliar right up until the night hed turned up dead skull caved in the blow coming from behind pathologist figured hed have died from that alone but just to make sure someone had added a syringe of very pure heroin no indication that the deceased had been a user deceased was the word most of the cops on the case had usedand grudgingly at that nobody bothered with the term victim nobody could say the words out loudbastard got what he deservedthat wasnt the done thing these days didnt stop them from thinking it sharing it through eye contact and slow nods rebus and siobhan had worked the case but it had been one among many few leads and too many suspects the rape victim had been interviewed along with her family and her boyfriend from the time one word kept coming up in discussing colliars fate good his body had been found near his car down a side street next to the bar where hed been working no witnesses no sceneofcrime evidence just the one curiosity a sharp blade had been used to slice away part of his distinctive jacket a black nylon bomber emblazoned with the phrase cc rider on the back this was what had been removed so that the white inner lining was revealed theories were in short supply it was either a clumsy attempt to disguise the deceaseds identity or there had been something hidden in the lining tests had proved negative for traces of drugs leaving the police to shrug and scratch their heads to rebus it looked like a hit either colliar had made an enemy or a message was being sent to cafferty not that their several interviews with colliars employer had been enlightening bad for my reputation was caffertys main reaction means either you catch whoever did it or but cafferty hadnt needed to answer and if cafferty got to the culprit first it would be the last that was ever heard of them none of which had helped the inquiry had hit a wall around the same time g preparations started focusing mindsmost of them driven by images of overtime payelsewhere other cases had intruded too with victimsreal victims the colliar murder team had been wound down rebus lowered his driversside window welcoming the cool breeze he didnt know the quickest route to auchterarder he knew gleneagles could be reached from kinross so had headed that way a couple of months back hed bought a gps for the car but he hadnt got round to reading the instructions yet it lay on the passenger seat screen blank one of these days hed take it to the garage that installed the cars cd player an inspection of the backseat floors and trunk had failed to turn up anything by the who so rebus was listening to elbow insteadsiobhans recommendation he liked the title track leaders of the free world stuck it on repeat the singer seemed to think something had gone wrong since the s rebus tended to agree even coming at it from a different direction he guessed the singer would have liked more change a world run by greenpeace and the campaign for nuclear disarmament poverty made history rebus had been on a few marches himself in the s before and after joining the army it was a way to meet girls if nothing else usually there was a party somewhere afterward these days though he saw the s as the end of something a fan had been stabbed to death at a stones concert in and the decade had petered out the s had given youth a taste for revolt they didnt trust the old order certainly didnt respect it he wondered about the thousands who would descend on gleneagles confrontation a certainty hard to imagine it in this landscape of farms and hillsides rivers and glens he knew that gleneagless very isolation would have been a factor in its choice as venue the leaders of the free world would be safe there safe to sign their names to decisions that had already been made elsewhere on the stereo the band was singing about climbing a landslide the image stuck with rebus all the way to the outskirts of auchterarder he didnt think hed been there before all the same he seemed to know the place typical small scottish town a single welldefined main street with narrow side roads leading off built with the notion that people would walk to their local shops small independently owned shops at that he didnt see much that would inflame the antiglobalization campaigners the baker was even selling limitededition g pies the good folk of auchterarder rebus seemed to recall had been vetted under the guise of providing them with id badges these would be necessary so they could cross the eventual barricades yet as siobhan had pointed out there was an eerie tranquillity to the place only a few shoppers and one carpenter who seemed to be measuring windows for protective boards the cars were muddy xs which had probably spent more time on farm tracks than motorways one woman driver was even wearing a head scarf something rebus hadnt seen in a while within a couple of minutes he was at the far end of town and heading toward the a he did a threepoint turn and this time kept his eyes open for signposts the one he wanted was next to a pub pointing down a lane he signaled following the road past hedges and driveways then a newer housing estate the landscape opened before him showing distant hills in moments he was out of town again flanked by neat hedgerows that would leave their mark on his car if he had to make way for a tractor or delivery van there were some woods to his left and another sign told him this was home to the clootie well he knew the word from clootie dumpling a sticky steamed dessert his mother had sometimes made he remembered the taste and texture as being similar to christmas pudding dark and cloying and sugary his stomach gave a small protest reminding him that he hadnt eaten in hours his stop at the hotel had been brief a few quiet words with chrissie shed hugged him just as she had back at the house earlier that morning all the years hed known her there hadnt been many hugs in the early days hed actually fancied her awkward under the circumstances shed seemed to sense this then hed been best man at the wedding and during one dance shed blown mischievously in his ear later on the few occasions when she and mickey had been separated rebus had taken his brothers side he supposed he could have called her said something but he hadnt and when mickey had gotten into that spot of bother ended up in jail rebus hadnt visited chrissie and the kids mind you he hadnt visited mickey that often either in jail or since there was more history when rebus and his own wife had separated chrissie had blamed him entirely shed always gotten on well with rhona kept in touch with her after the divorce that was family for you tactics campaigning and diplomacy the politicians had it easy by comparison back at the hotel lesley had mimicked her mother giving him a hug too kenny had thought for a second before rebus put the lad out of his misery by extending a hand to be squeezed he wondered if there would be any fallingsout there usually were at funerals with grief came blame and resentment just as well he hadnt stayed when it came to the potential for confrontation john rebus punched well above his already substantial weight there was a parking area just off the road it looked newly built trees having been cleared chippings of tree bark strewn across the ground room enough for four cars but only one was waiting siobhan clarke was leaning against it arms folded rebus pulled on the brake and got out nice spot he said been here over a hundred years she told him didnt think i drove that slowly she offered only a twist of the mouth leading him into the woods arms still folded she was dressed more formally than usual kneelength black skirt and black stockings her shoes were smudged from having walked this same trail earlier i saw the sign yesterday she was saying the one leading off the main drag decided id take a look well if the choice was that or glenrothes theres a bulletin board back at the clearing tells you a bit about the place all sorts of witchy goingson over the years they were ascending a slope rounding a thick twisted oak the townspeople decided there must be sprites living here shrieks in the dark that sort of thing local farmhands more like rebus offered she nodded agreement all the same they started leaving little offerings hence the name clootie she glanced around at him youll know what it means you being the only native scot around here he had a sudden image of his mother lifting the pudding out of its pan the pudding wrapped in cloth he told her and clothing she added as they entered another clearing they stopped and rebus breathed deeply damp clothdamp rotting cloth hed been smelling it for the past half minute the smell clothes gave off in his old house the one hed grown up in when they werent aired when the damp and the mildew got to them the trees around him were strung with rags and remnants pieces had fallen to the ground where they were decomposing to a mulch tradition has it siobhan said quietly they were left here for good luck keep the sprites warm and theyd see no harm came to you another theory when kids died young their parents left something here by way of remembrance her voice caught and she cleared her throat im not made of glass rebus assured her you can use words like remembranceim not going to start blubbing she nodded again rebus was walking around the clearing leaves and soft moss underfoot and the sound of a stream just a thin trickle of water pushing up from the ground candles and coins had been left by its edges not much of a well he commented she just shrugged i was here a few minutesdidnt really warm to the atmosphere but then i noticed some of the newer clothing rebus saw it too strung from the branches a shawl overalls a red polkadot handkerchief a nearly new sneaker its laces dangling even underwear and what looked like childrens stockings christ siobhan rebus muttered not really knowing what else to say the smell seemed to be growing stronger he had another flashback to a tenday bender many years before coming out of it to find that a load of laundry had been sitting in the machine waiting to be hung when hed opened the door this same smell had hit him hed washed everything again but still had to throw it all away afterward and the jacket all she did was point rebus walked slowly toward the tree in question the piece of nylon had been pierced by a short branch it swayed just a little in the breeze threads straggling from it but no mistaking the logo cc rider rebus said in confirmation siobhan was running her hands through her hair he knew she had questions knew she would have been turning them over in her mind all the time shed been waiting for him so what do we do he prompted its a crime scene she began a team is on the way from stirling we need to secure the site comb the area for evidence we need to reassemble the original murder squad start going door to door locally including gleneagles rebus interrupted youre the expert so you tell me how many times has the hotel staff been vetted and how do we go about knocking on doors in the middle of a weeklong demonstration securing the site wont be a problem mind you not with all the secret service teams were about to welcome naturally she had considered all these points he knew as much and his voice trailed off we keep it quiet till the summits over she suggested tempting he admitted she smiled only because it gives you a head start he admitted as much with a wink she sighed macrae needs to be told which means hell tell tayside police but the socos are coming from stirling rebus added and stirling belongs to central region so thats just the three police forces who need to knowshouldnt have any trouble keeping it under wraps rebus was looking around if we can at least get the scene checked and photographedtake the cloth back to the lab before the fun and games start rebus puffed out his cheeks kicks off on wednesday right the g does yes but theres the poverty march tomorrow and another planned for monday in edinburgh though not auchterarder then he saw what she was getting at even with the evidence at the lab the whole place could be under siege getting from gayfield square to the lab at howdenhall meant crossing the city always supposing the technicians had managed to force their way into work why leave it here siobhan asked studying the patch again some sort of trophy if so why here specifically could be local any family connections with the area i think colliars solid edinburgh she looked at him i meant the rape victim rebus formed his mouth into an o something to consider she added then she paused whats that sound rebus patted his stomach been a while since ive eaten dont suppose gleneagles is open for afternoon tea depends on your credit card limit there are places in town one of us should stay for the socos better be you then dont want accusations that im hogging the limelight in fact you probably deserve a complimentary cup of aucherarders finest tea he turned to go but she stopped him why me why now her arms stretching from her sides why not he answered just call it kismet thats not what i mean he turned toward her again what i mean she said quietly is that im not sure i want them caught if they are and its because of me if they are shiv itll be due to their screwup he stabbed a finger in the direction of the patch that and maybe even a bit of teamwork the scene of crime unit hadnt been thrilled by news that rebus and siobhan had entered the crime site prints of their shoes had been taken for purposes of elimination along with hair samples go easy rebus had warned i cant afford to be generous the socoscene of crime officerhad apologized got to get the root else we cant get the dna on the third try with the tweezers hed been successful one of his colleagues had almost finished videoing the scene another was taking photographs and yet another was in conversation with siobhan about how much of the other clothing they should take to the lab just the most recent she told him her eyes on rebus he nodded his agreement sharing her train of thought even if colliar was a message to cafferty it didnt mean there werent other messages here sports shirt seems to have a company logo on it the soco commented your job could hardly be easier siobhan said with a smile my jobs collection the rest is up to you speaking of which rebus interrupted any chance this could all go to edinburgh rather than stirling the soco stiffened his shoulders rebus didnt know him but he knew the type late forties half a lifetimes experience there was plenty of rivalry between the various police regions as it was rebus held up his hands in mock surrender all i mean is its an edinburgh case makes sense if they dont have to keep traipsing through to stirling every time theres something you need to show them siobhan was smiling again amused by his use of they and them but she gave a slight nod too recognizing a useful ploy when she saw one especially now rebus was arguing with the demonstrations and everything he looked up to where a helicopter was circling gleneagles surveillance it had to be someone up there wondering at the sudden appearance of two cars and two unmarked white vans at the clootie well returning his gaze to the soco rebus realized the chopper had sealed the deal a time like this cooperation was paramount it had been hammered home in memorandum after memorandum macrae himself had said as much at the past dozen or so briefings at gayfield square be nice work together help each other because for these few short days the world would be watching maybe the soco had been at similar briefings he was nodding slowly turning away to continue his work rebus and siobhan shared another look then rebus reached into his pocket for his cigarettes no traces please one of the other socos warned him so rebus moved away back toward the parking lot he was just lighting up when another car appeared the more the merrier he thought to himself as dci macrae leaped out he was dressed in what looked like a new suit new tie too and a crisp white shirt his hair was gray and sparse face saggy nose bulbous and red veined hes the same age as me rebus thought why does he seem so much older afternoon sir rebus said thought you were supposed to be at a funeral the tone was accusatory as though rebus might have fabricated a death in the family to secure a friday sleepin ds clarke interrupted proceedings rebus explained thought id show my face making it sound like a sacrifice the words worked too macraes tightened jaw relaxed a little im on a roll rebus thought first the soco now the boss macrae had been pretty good actually greenlighting a day off for rebus as soon as news broke of mickeys death hed told rebus to go get smashed and rebus had obligedthe scotsmans way of dealing with death hed found himself in a part of town he didnt know no idea how he got there he walked into a drugstore and asked where he was answer colinton village pharmacy hed thanked them by making the purchase of some aspirin sorry john macrae said now taking a deep breath how did it go trying to sound concerned it went was all rebus said he watched the helicopter bank steeply as it turned for home hope to christ that wasnt tv macrae commented not much to see even supposing it was shame to tear you away from glenrothes sir hows sorbus looking operation sorbus the policing plan for g week to rebus it sounded like something a dieter would use in his tea instead of sugar siobhan had set him straight told him it was a kind of tree were prepared for any eventuality macrae stated briskly except maybe one rebus felt it his duty to add back burner till next week john his boss muttered rebus nodded his agreement always assuming they agree macrae followed rebuss sight line and saw the car approaching it was a silver merc with tinted rear windows probably means the chopper wasnt tv rebus added for macraes benefit he reached into his own cars passenger seat and brought out what remained of a sandwich ham salad the first had slipped down without touching the sides the hells this macrae was asking through gritted teeth the merc had pulled to an abrupt stop beside one of the scene of crime vans the drivers door opened and a man got out he walked around the car and tugged open the rear passengerside door it took several moments for the man inside to emerge he was tall and narrow his eyes hidden behind sunglasses as he secured all three buttons of his suit coat he seemed to be studying the two white vans and the three unmarked police cars eventually he peered up at the sky mouthed something to his driver and stepped away from the vehicle instead of approaching rebus and macrae he walked over to the signpost the one informing tourists of the clootie wells history the driver was back behind his steering wheel eyes on rebus and macrae rebus blew him a little kiss content to stand there until the new arrival consented to make introductions again he thought he knew the type cold and calculating making a show of being the real power had to be security of some kind following up the choppers call macrae took only seconds to crack strode over to the man and asked him who he was im so who the hell are you the man replied in a measured voice maybe hed missed the briefings on friendly cooperation english accent rebus noted stood to reason so was special branch based in london one step away from the spooks i mean the man went on his interest still apparently concentrated on the signpost i know what you are youre cid and those are scene of crime vans and in a clearing just ahead of us there are men in white protective overalls making a detailed examination of the trees and ground finally he turned toward macrae and reached a slow hand to his own face to remove the sunglasses how am i doing so far macraes face had reddened in anger all day hed been treated with the dignity that was his due now this care to show some id macrae snapped the man stared at him then gave a wry smile is that all youve got the smile seemed to say as he reached into his jacket not bothering to unbutton it his eyes shifted from macrae to rebus the smile stayed inviting rebus to share its message a small black leather wallet was held open for macraes inspection there the man said snapping it shut again now you know all there is to know about me youre steelforth macrae said clearing his throat between words rebus could see his boss had been thrown macrae turned toward him commander steelforth is in charge of g security he explained but rebus had already guessed as much macrae turned back to steelforth i was in glenrothes this morning being given a tour courtesy of acc finnigan and gleneagles yesterday macraes voice faltered steelforth was already moving away from him toward rebus not interrupting your coronary am i he asked glancing at the sandwich rebus gave the belch he felt the query demanded steelforths eyes narrowed we cant all be dining courtesy of the taxpayer rebus said how is the food at gleneagles by the way i doubt youll get the chance to find out detective sergeant not a bad guess sir but your eyes deceive you this is di rebus macrae was explaining im dci macrae lothian and borders based where steelforth asked gayfield square macrae answered in edinburgh rebus added youre a long way from home gentlemen steelforth was heading down the path a man was murdered in edinburgh rebus explained some of his clothing has turned up here do we know why i intend keeping a lid on it commander macrae stated once the socos are finished thats us done and dusted macrae was at steelforths heels rebus bringing up the rear no plans for any premiers or presidents to come leave a wee offering rebus asked instead of answering steelforth marched into the clearing the senior soco stuck a hand against his chest more fucking footprints he growled steelforth glared at the hand do you know who i am dont give a bollocks pal fuck up my crime scene youll answer for it the special branch man considered for a moment then relented retracing his steps to the edge of the clearing content to watch the operation his cell sounded and he answered it moving farther away to prevent being overheard siobhan gave a questioning look rebus mouthed the word later and dug into his pocket bringing out a tenpound note here he said offering it to the soco whats that for rebus just winked and the man pocketed the money adding the word cheers i always tip for service beyond the norm rebus told macrae nodding macrae dug into his own pocket and found a fiver for rebus halfers the dci said steelforth was returning to the clearing i need to get back to more important matters when will you be finished here half an hour one of the other socos answered longer if need be steelforths nemesis added a crime scenes a crime scene no matter what other wee sideshows there are like rebus before him he hadnt been slow to work out steelforths role the special branch man turned to macrae ill inform acc finnigan shall i let him know we have your full understanding and cooperation as you wish sir steelforths face softened a little his hand made contact with macraes arm im willing to bet you didnt see everything there is to see when youre finished here come see me at gleneagles ill give you the proper tour macrae melted a kid on christmas morning but he recovered well stiffening his spine thank you commander call me david crouched as if for evidence gathering some way behind steelforths back the senior soco made a show of sticking a finger down his throat three cars would be making their way separately to edinburgh rebus shuddered to think what the ecologists would say to that macrae peeled off first heading for gleneagles rebus had driven past the hotel earlier when you approached auchterarder from kinross you saw the hotel and its grounds a long time before you reached the town thousands of acres but few signs of security he had caught just the one glimpse of fencing alerted by a temporary structure which he took to be a watchtower rebus shadowed macrae on the way back his boss sounding the horn as he turned into the hotels driveway siobhan had guessed perth as the quickest road rebus opting to retrace his crosscountry route pick up the m eventually still plenty of blue in the sky scottish summers were a blessing a reward for the long winters twilight rebus turned down the music and called siobhans cell handsfree i hope she told him dont be smart otherwise youre setting a bad example first time for everything what did you make of our friend from london unlike you i dont have those hangups what hangups with authoritywith the englishwith she paused want me to go on last time i looked i still outrank you so so i could cite you for insubordination and give the chiefs a good laugh his silence conceded the point either shed gotten lippier down the years or he was getting rusty both probably think we can talk the lab techs into a saturday shift he asked depends what about ray duff one word from you and hed do it and all id have to do in return is spend a whole day with him touring in that smelly old car its a design classic something he wont begin to tire of telling me rebuilt it from scratch her sigh was audible what is it with forensics they all have these hobbies so youll ask him ill ask him are you carousing this evening night shift same day as a funeral someones got to do it im betting you insisted he didnt answer instead asked what her own plans were getting my head down want to be up bright and early for the march what have they got you doing she laughed im not working johnim going because i want to bloody hell you should come too aye right thats going to make all the difference in the world id rather stay at home to make my protest what protest against bob bloody geldof she was laughing in his ear again because if as many turn up as he wants itll look like its all because of him cant have that siobhan think about it before you sign your name to the cause im going john if nothing else i need to look out for my mum and dad your theyre up from london and not because of anything geldof said theyre going on the march yes do i get to meet them no why not because youre just the sort of cop theyre afraid ill become he was supposed to laugh at this but knew she was only half joking fair point was all he said have you shaken off the boss a conscious change of subject left him at valet parking dont jokethey actually have that at gleneagles did he toot the horn at you what do you think i knew he would this whole trip its shaken years off him kept him out of the station too so everybody wins she paused you think youve got a crack at this dont you what do you mean cyril colliar the next week or so nobodys going to be holding your leash i didnt realize i was up there in your estimation john youre a couple of years away from retirement i know you want one last go at cafferty and it seems im transparent too look im just trying to i know and im touched you really think cafferty could be responsible if hes not hell want whoever was look if it all gets a bit fraught with your parents now who was changing the subject send me a text and well meet for a drink all right i will you can turn the elbow cd up now well spotted talk to you later rebus cut the connection and did as he was told the barriers were going up down george iv bridge and all along princes street workmen were busy putting them in place road repairs and building projects had been put on hold scaffolding removed so it couldnt be taken apart and used as missiles mailboxes had been sealed shut and some shops boarded up financial institutions had been warned staff advised not to wear formal clothingit would make them easy targets for a friday evening the town was quiet police vans cruised the central streets metal grilles fixed to their windshields more vans were parked out of sight in unlit side roads the cops on board wore riot gear and laughed among themselves swapping stories from previous engagements a few veterans had seen action during the last wave of miners strikes others tried to match these memories with stories of soccer battles polltax demonstrations the newbury bypass they exchanged rumors about the expected size of the italian anarchist contingent genoa toughened them up just the way we like it eh lads bravado and nerves and camaraderie the talk faltering whenever a radio crackled to life the uniformed police working the train station wore bright yellow jackets here too barriers were being erected they were blocking exits so there remained a single route in and out some officers carried cameras with which to record the faces of arrivals from the london trains special cars had been added on for the protesters which made them easy to identify not that such skills were really needed they sang songs carried backpacks wore badges and tshirts and wristbands they carried flags and banners were dressed in baggy pants camouflage jackets hiking boots intelligence reports said busloads had already left from the south of england first estimates had stated fifty thousand the latest guess was north of a hundred thousand which added to the summer tourists would swell edinburgh s population nicely somewhere in the city there was a rally signaling the start of g alternatives a weeklong series of marches and meetings more police would be there if needed some of these would be on horseback plenty of dog handlers too including four on waverley stations concourse the plan was simple visible strength let any potential troublemakers know what theyd be dealing with visors and billly clubs and handcuffs horses and dogs and patrol vans force of numbers tools of the trade tactics earlier in its history edinburgh was prone to invasion its inhabitants hid behind walls and gates and when those were breached they retreated to the warrenlike tunnels below the castle and the high street leaving the city empty and the victory hollow it was a talent the denizens continued to bring to the annual august festival as the population swelled the locals became less visible blending in to the background it might also explain edinburgh s reliance on invisible industries such as banking and insurance until lately it was said that st andrew square was the richest in europe boasting several corporate hqs but with space at a premium new building projects had prospered on lothian road and farther west toward the airport the royal banks hq at gogarburn recently completed was seen as a target so too buildings owned and staffed by standard life and scottish widows driving through the streets killing some time siobhan figured the city would be tested in the coming days as never before a police convoy sirens blaring pulled out to pass her no mistaking the schoolboy grin on the drivers face he was loving every minute edinburgh provided his own personal racetrack a purple nissan filled with local youths was riding the slipstream siobhan gave it ten seconds then signaled to move back out into the flow of traffic she was on her way to a temporary campsite in niddrie one of edinburgh s less genteel areas instead of pitching their tents in peoples gardens marchers were being told to go there niddrie the council had chosen the grasslands around the jack kane center they were planning for ten thousand visitors maybe even fifteen portable toilets and showers had been provided and a private security firm put in charge probably siobhan couldnt help thinking to keep the neighborhood gangs out rather than the marchers in the local joke was that thered be a lot of tents and camping gear for sale around the pubs in the next few weeks siobhan had offered to let her parents stay at her place of course she had theyd helped her buy it they could have her bed shed crash on the sofa but theyd been adamant they would be traveling by bus and camping with the others theyd been students in the s and had never quite shaken themselves free of the period though now nearing sixtyrebuss generationher dad still kept his hair tied back in a sort of ponytail her mum still wore dresses that were mostly caftans she thought of her words to rebus earlier youre just the sort of cop theyre afraid ill become thing was part of her felt now that shed joined the police mostly because shed thought they wouldnt approve after all the care and affection theyd doled out shed needed to rebel payback for the times their teaching jobs had led to yet another move another new school payback simply because it was in her power when shed told them their looks had almost made her recant but that would have been weak theyd been supportive of course while hinting that police work might not be the most fulfilling use of her skills that was enough to make her dig in her heels so shed become a cop not in london where her parents lived but in scotland which she hadnt really known at all until attending college there one final heartfelt plea from her mum and dad anywhere but glasgow glasgow with its hardman image and knife culture its sectarian divide yet as siobhan had found a great place to shop a place she sometimes went with friendsallgirl parties which led to them staying the night at some boutique hotel or other sampling the nightlife steering clear of any bars with bouncers at the doora point of drinking protocol on which she and john rebus agreed while edinburgh meantime had proved more deadly than her parents could ever have imagined not that she would ever tell them that during sunday phone calls she tended to brush off her mums inquiries asking her own questions instead shed offered to meet them at the bus but theyd said they would need time to get the tent ready stopped at traffic lights she pictured this and the image made her smile nearly sixty the pair of them and messing around with a tent theyd taken early retirement the previous year from their teaching jobs owned a fairsized house in forest hill the mortgage paid off always asking her if she needed money ill pay for a hotel room shed told them on the phone but theyd remained resolute pulling away from the lights she wondered if it might be some form of dementia she parked on the wisp ignoring the orange traffic cones and stuck a police business notice on her windshield at the sound of her idling engine a yellowjacketed security guard had come for a look he shook his head and pointed at the notice then he drew a hand across his throat and nodded toward the nearest housing development siobhan removed the sign but left the car where it was local gangs the guard was saying sign like thats a red rag to a bull he slid his hands into his pockets puffing up his already substantial chest so what brings you here officer his head was shaved but he sported a full dark beard and a tangle of eyebrows social call actually siobhan said showing him her id a couple by the name of clarke need a word with them in you come then he led her to a gate in the perimeter fence in miniature it was a bit like the gleneagles security there was even a sort of watchtower every ten yards or so along the fence stood another guard here put this on her new friend was saying handing her a wristband makes you less conspicuous its how we keep tabs on our band of happy campers quite literally she said taking it from him hows everything going so far local youth dont like it much theyve tried coming in but thats about it he shrugged they were walking along a metal walkway stepping off it for a moment as a young girl rollerskated past her mother watching crosslegged from the ground next to her tent how many are here siobhan found it hard to judge maybe a thousand therell be more tomorrow youre not keeping count not taking names eitherso im not sure where youre going to find your friends only thing were allowed to take from them is the fee for their site siobhan looked around the summer had been dry and the earth underfoot was solid beyond the skyline of apartment buildings and houses she could make out other more ancient shapes holyrood park and arthurs seat she could hear some low chanting and a few guitars and pennywhistles childrens laughter and a baby ready for its next feeding hand claps and chatter silenced suddenly by a megaphone carried by a man with his hair crammed into an outsize woolly hat patchwork trousers lopped off at the knees and flipflops on his feet big white tent peoplethats where its happening vegetable curry at four quid thanks to the local mosque only four quid maybe thats where youll find them siobhans guide said she thanked him and he headed back to his post the big white tent seemed to serve as a general meeting place someone else was calling out that a group would be heading into town for a drink meet in five minutes by the red flag siobhan had passed a row of portable toilets and some standpipes and showers all that was left for her to explore now were tents the line for curry was orderly someone tried to hand her a plastic spoon and she shook her head before remembering that it was a while since shed eaten her styrofoam plate heaped high she decided to take a slow walk through the camp people were cooking their own food on camp stoves one pointed at her remember me from glastonbury he called siobhan just shook her head and then she saw her parents and broke into a smile they were doing the camping thing with style a big red tent with windows and a covered porch foldaway table and chairs and an open bottle of wine with real glasses next to it they got up when they saw her exchanged hugs and kisses apologized that theyd only brought two chairs i can sit on the grass siobhan assured them there was another young woman already doing just that she hadnt moved at siobhans approach we were just telling santal about you siobhans mum said eve clarke looked young for her years only the laugh lines giving the game away the same could not be said for siobhans dad teddy hed grown paunchy and the skin drooped from his face his hairline had receded the ponytail sparser and grayer than ever he refilled the wineglasses with gusto his gaze never leaving the bottle im sure santals been riveted siobhan said accepting the glass the young woman gave the beginnings of a smile her hair was neck length and dirty blond gelled or mistreated so that it emerged in clumps and braids from her scalp no makeup but multiple piercings to her ears and one to the side of her nose her dark green sleeveless tshirt showed celtic tattoos on either shoulder and her bare midriff showed another piercing to her navel plenty of jewelry strung around her neck and hanging lower still what looked like a digital video camera youre siobhan she said with a trace of a lisp afraid so siobhan toasted the company with her glass another had been produced from a picnic basket along with another bottle of wine steady on teddy eve clarke said santal needs a refill he explained though siobhan couldnt help noticing that santals glass was actually almost as full as her own did the three of you travel up together she asked santal hitched from aylesbury teddy clarke said after the bus ride weve just endured i think next time id do the same he rolled his eyes and fidgeted in his seat then unscrewed the wine bottle screwtop wine santal dont say the modern world doesnt have its pluses in fact she didnt reply at all siobhan couldnt say why shed taken such an immediate dislike to this stranger except that santal was just that a stranger siobhan had wanted some time with her mum and dad just the three of them santals got the campsite next to us eve was explaining we needed a bit of help with the tent her husband laughed suddenly and loudly filling his own glass been a while since we camped he said tent looks new siobhan commented borrowed from neighbors her mother said quietly santal was rising to her feet i should go not on our account teddy clarke protested theres a bunch of us heading to a pub i like your camera siobhan said santal looked down at it any of the cops take my picture i want theirs in return fairs fair isnt it her unblinking look demanded agreement siobhan turned toward her father youve told her what i do she stated quietly not ashamed are you santal all but spat the words out just the opposite to be honest siobhans eyes shifted from father to mother suddenly both her parents seemed intent on the wine in front of them when she looked back at santal she saw that the young woman was pointing the camera at her one for the family album santal said ill send you a jpeg thanks siobhan replied coldly odd name isnt it santal means sandalwood eve clarke answered at least people can spell it santal herself added teddy clarke laughed i was telling santal about how we burdened you with a name nobody down south could pronounce shared any more family history siobhan said bristling any embarrassing stories i need to be aware of touchy isnt she santal commented to siobhans mother you know eve clarke admitted we never really wanted her to become mum for christs sake siobhan broke in but her further complaint was cut short by sounds from the direction of the fence she saw guards jogging toward the scene there were kids on the outside making nazi salutes they wore regulation dark hooded tops and wanted the guards to send out all the hippie scum the revolution starts here one of them yelled up against the wall wankers pathetic siobhans mother said but now there were objects sailing through the darkening sky get down siobhan warned all but pushing her mother into the tent unsure what protection it would offer from the volley of rocks and bottles her father had taken a couple of steps toward the trouble but she hauled him back too santal was standing her ground pointing her camera toward the melee youre just a bunch of tourists one of the locals was yelling piss off home on the rickshaws that brought you here raucous laughter jeers and gestures if the campers wouldnt come outside they wanted the guards but the guards werent that stupid instead siobhans friend was on his radio for reinforcements situation like this it could die down in moments or flare into allout war the guard found her standing by his shoulder dont worry he said im sure youre insured it took her a second to get his meaning my car she shouted heading for the gate had to elbow her way past two more guards ran out onto the road her hood was dented and scratched back window fractured nyt sprayed on one door niddrie young team they stood there in a line laughing at her one of them held up his camera phone to get a picture take all the photos you want she told him makes you even easier to trace fuckin police another of them spat he was in the center a lieutenant behind either shoulder the leader police is right she said ten minutes in craigmillar copshop and ill know more about you than your own mother she was pointing for emphasis but all he did was sneer only a third of his face was visible but she would file it away a car was drawing up three men inside siobhan recognized the one in the back local councilman away you go he was yelling as he emerged waving both arms as if putting sheep back in a pen the gangs leader pretended to tremble but could see that his fellow soldiers were wavering half a dozen of the security had come from behind the fence the bearded guard at their head sirens in the distance growing closer go on bugger off with you the councilman persisted camp full of lezzies and fags the gangs leader snarled in reply and whos paying for it eh i very much doubt you are son the councilman said the other two men from the car were flanking him now they were big men probably hadnt backed down from a fight in their lives just the sort of pollsters a niddrie politician would need the gang leader spat on the ground then turned and walked off thanks for that siobhan said holding out a hand for the councilman to shake not a problem he replied seeming to dismiss the whole incident siobhan included from his mind he was shaking the bearded guards hand now the two obviously known to each other quiet night otherwise the councilman asked the guard chuckled a response was there something we could do for you mr tench councilman tench looked around him just thought id drop by let all these lovely people know that my district stands firmly behind them in the fight to end poverty and injustice in the world he had an audience now fifty or so campers standing just on the other side of the fence we know something about both in this part of edinburgh he bellowed but that doesnt mean weve no time for those worse off than us bighearted i like to think we are he saw that siobhan was examining the damage to her car few wild ones in our midst naturally but then what community hasnt smiling tench opened his arms again this time like a brimstone preacher welcome to niddrie he told his congregation welcome one and all rebus was alone in the cid suite it had taken him half an hour to find the notes for the murder inquiry four boxes and a series of folders floppy disks and a single cdrom hed left these latter items on their shelf in the storeroom and now had some of the paperwork spread out in front of him hed made use of the half dozen desks available pushing inboxes and computer keyboards aside by walking through the room he could shift between the different stages of the inquiry crime scene to initial interviews victim profile to further interviews prison record connection with cafferty autopsy and toxicology reportsthe phone in the dis little booth had rung a few times but rebus had ignored it he wasnt the senior di here derek starr was and the smarmy little bastard was out on the town somewhere it being a friday night rebus knew starrs routine because starr himself shared it with all and sundry each monday morning couple of drinks at the hallion club then maybe home for a shower and change of clothes before coming back into town back to the hallion if it was lively but always heading to george street afterwardopal lounge candy bar living room nightcap at indigo yard if he hadnt gotten lucky before then there was a new jazz place opening on queen street owned by jools holland starr had already made inquiries about membership the phone rang again rebus ignored it if it was urgent theyd try starrs cell if it was being transferred from the front deskwell they knew rebus was up here hed wait till they tried his extension rather than starrs could be they were winding him up hoping hed answer so they could apologize and say it was di starr they were after rebus knew his place in the food chain somewhere down among the plankton the price for years of insubordination and reckless conduct never mind that thered been results along the way too far as the bigwigs were concerned these days it was all about how you got the result about efficiency and accountability public perceptions strict rules and protocols rebuss translation covering your own ass he stopped by a folder of photographs some he had already removed and spread out across the surface of the desk but now he sifted through the others cyril colliars public history newspaper clippings polaroids offered by family and friends the official photos from his arrest and trial someone had even snapped a grainy shot of him during his time in prison reclining on his bed arms behind his head as he watched tv it had made the front page of the tabloids could life be any cushier for rape beast not any longer next desk details of the rape victims family name kept secret from the public she was victoria jensen eighteen at the time of the attack vicky to those closest to her followed from a nightclubfollowed as she walked with two pals to the bus stop night bus colliar had found himself a seat a couple of rows behind the three vicky got off the bus alone not much more than five hundred yards from home when hed struck hand over her mouth hauling her into an alley surveillance videos showed him leaving the club straight after her showed him boarding the bus and taking his seat dna from the attack sealed his fate some of his associates had attended the trial made threats toward the victims family no charges brought vickys father was a vet his wife worked for standard life rebus himself had delivered the news of cyril colliars demise to the family home in leith thanks for telling us the father had said ill break it to vicky you dont understand sir rebus had responded there are questions i need to ask you did you do it hire someone to do it for you know anyone who mightve been compelled vets had access to drugs maybe not heroin but other drugs which could be exchanged for heroin dealers sold ketamine to clubbersstarr himself had made the point it was used by vets to treat horses vicky had been raped in an alley colliar killed in one thomas jensen had appeared outraged by the insinuations you mean youve really never thought of it sir never planned any sort of revenge of course he had images of colliar rotting in a cell or burning in hell but that doesnt happen does it inspector not in this world vickys friends had been questioned too none of them ready to own up rebus moved to the next table morris gerald cafferty stared back at him from photographs and interview transcripts rebus had needed to argue his case before macrae would let him anywhere near feeling was their shared history ran too deep some knew them for enemies others thought them too similarand way too familiar with each other starr for one had voiced his concerns in front of both rebus and dci macrae rebuss snarled attempt to grab his fellow di by the shirtfront had been in macraes later words just another goal for the other team john cafferty was dexterous fingers in every imaginable criminal pie saunas and protection muscle and intimidation drugs too which would give him access to heroin and if not him personally colliars fellow bouncers for sure it wasnt unknown for clubs to be shut down when it emerged that the socalled doormen were controlling the flow of dope into the premises any one of them could have decided to get rid of the rape beast might even have been personal a disrespectful remark a slight against a girlfriend the many and varied possible motives had been explored at length and in detail on the surface then a bythebook investigation nobody could say otherwise exceptrebus could see the teams heart hadnt been in it a few questions missed here and there avenues left unexplored notes typed up sloppily it was the sort of thing only someone close to the case would spot effort had been spared throughout just enough to show what the officers really thought of their victim the autopsy however had been scrupulous professor gates had said it before it didnt bother him who was lying on his slab they were human beings and somebodys daughter or son nobodys born bad john hed muttered leaning over his scalpel well nobody makes them do bad things either rebus had retorted ah gates had conceded a conundrum pored over by wiser heads than ours through the centuries what makes us keep doing these terrible things to each other gates hadnt offered an answer but something else hed pointed out resonated with rebus now as he moved to siobhans desk and picked up one of the postmortem photographs of colliar in death we all return to innocence johnit was true that colliars face seemed at peace as though nothing had ever troubled it the phone was ringing again in starrs office rebus let it ring picked up siobhans extension instead there was a postit note affixed to the side of her hard disk rows of names and phone numbers he knew better than to try the lab punched in the cell number instead picked up almost immediately by ray duff ray its di rebus inviting me to join him on a fridaynight pub crawl rebuss silence was answered with a sigh why am i not surprised im surprised at you though ray shirking your duties i dont sleep in the lab you know except we both know thats a lie okay i work the odd night and thats what i like about you ray see were both driven by that passion for the job a passion im jeopardizing by showing my face at my local pubs trivia night not my place to judge you ray just wondering how this new colliar evidence is shaping up rebus heard a tired chuckle at the other end of the phone you never let up do you its not for me ray im just helping out siobhan this could mean a big promotion for her if she nails it shes the one who found the patch the evidence only came in three hours ago ever heard of striking while the iron is hot but the beer in front of me is cold john it would mean a lot to siobhan ray shes looking forward to you claiming that prize what prize the chance to show off that car of yours a day out in the country just the two of you on those winding roadswho knows maybe even a hotel room at the end of it if you play your cards right rebus paused whats that music one of the trivia questions sounds like steely dan reelin in the years but how did the band get their name a dildo in a william burroughs novel now tell me youre heading to the lab straight after well satisfied with the outcome rebus treated himself to a mug of coffee and a stretch of the legs the building was quiet the desk sergeant had been replaced by one of his juniors rebus didnt know the face but nodded anyway been trying to get cid to take a call the young officer said he ran a finger along his shirt collar his neck was pitted with acne or some species of rash thatll be me then rebus told him whats the emergency trouble at the castle sir have the protests started early the uniform shook his head reports of a scream and a body landing in the gardens looks like someone fell from the ramparts castles not open this time of night rebus stated brow creasing dinner for some of the bigwigs so who ended up going over the edge the constable just shrugged shall i tell them theres no one available dont be crazy son rebus announced heading off to fetch his jacket as well as being a major tourist attraction edinburgh castle acted as a working barracks something commander david steelforth stressed to rebus when he intercepted him just inside the portcullis you get about a bit rebus said by way of response the special branch man was dressed formally bow tie and cummerbund dinner jacket patent shoes thing is that means it is quite properly under the aegis of the armed forces im not sure what aegis means commander it means steelforth hissed losing patience military police will be looking into the whys and wherefores of what occurred here good dinner was it rebus was still walking the path wound uphill fierce gusts whipping around both men there are important people here di rebus as if on cue a car appeared from some sort of tunnel ahead it was making for the gates forcing rebus and steelforth to stand aside rebus caught a glimpse of the face in the back a glint from metalrimmed glasses long pale worriedlooking face but then the foreign secretary often seemed to look worried as rebus pointed out to steelforth the special branch man frowned disappointed at the recognition hope i dont need to interview him rebus added look inspector but rebus was moving again heres the thing commander he said over his shoulder victim may have fallenor jumped or any other why or whereforeand im not disputing he was on army turf when he did but he landed a few hundred feet farther south in princes street gardensrebus proffered a smileand that makes him mine rebus started walking again trying to remember the last time hed been inside the castle walls hed brought his daughter here of course but twentyodd years ago the castle dominated the edinburgh skyline you could see it from bruntsfield and inverleith on the drive in from the airport it took on the aspect of a lowering transylvanian lair and made you wonder if youd lost your color vision from princes street lothian road and johnston terrace its volcanic sides seemed sheer and impregnableand so they had proved over the years yet approaching from the lawnmarket you climbed a gentle slope to its entrance with little hint of its enormous presence the drive from gayfield square had almost stymied rebus uniformed cops hadnt wanted to let him use waverley bridge a great grinding and clanking of metal as the barriers were dragged into position for tomorrows march hed sounded his horn ignoring gestures that he should find another route when one officer had approached rebus had rolled down the window and shown his id this routes closed the man stated english accent maybe lancashire im cid rebus told him and behind me theres going to be maybe an ambulance a pathologist and a scene of crime van want to tell them the same story whats happened someones just landed in the gardens rebus nodded toward the castle bloody protestersone got stuck on the rocks earlier fire brigade had to winch him down well much as id like nothing better than a chat the officer scowled but moved the barrier aside now another barrier had placed itself in front of rebus commander david steelforth this is a dangerous game inspector better left to those of us specializing in intelligence rebuss eyes narrowed you calling me thick a short barked laugh not at all good rebus moved past him again he saw where he was supposed to go military guards peering over the edge of the battlements a cluster of elderly and distinguishedlooking men dressed for dinner lurked nearby smoking cigars this where he fell rebus asked the guards he had his id open but had decided not to identify himself as civilian police must be about the spot someone answered anyone see it there were shakes of the head there was an incident earlier the same soldier said some idiot got stuck we were warned more of them might try and and private andrews thought he saw something round the other side i said i wasnt sure andrews said defending himself so you all skedaddled to the other side of the castle rebus made a show of sucking in breath that used to be called deserting your post detective inspector rebus has no jurisdiction here steelforth was telling the group and that would have counted as treason rebus warned him do we know whos unaccounted for one of the older men was asking rebus heard another car making for the portcullis headlights threw wild shadows across the wall ahead hard to say with everyone running off he said quietly no ones running off steelforth snapped just a bunch of prior engagements rebus guessed these are hellish busy people inspector decisions are being made that may change the world wont change whatever happened to the poor guy down there rebus nodded toward the wall then turned to face steelforth so what was going on here tonight commander discussions over dinner moves toward ratification good news for all rats what about the guests g representativesforeign ministers security personnel senior civil servants probably rules out pizza and a case or two of beer a lot gets done at these gettogethers rebus was peering over the edge hed never much liked heights and didnt linger cant see a damned thing he said we heard him one of the soldiers said heard what exactly rebus asked the scream as he fell he looked around at his comrades for support one of them nodded seemed to scream all the way down he added with a shiver wonder if that rules out suicide rebus speculated what do you think commander i think theres nothing for you to learn here inspector i also think it odd that you seem to pop up like this whenever theres bad news to find funny i was just thinking the same thing rebus said eyes boring into steelforths about you the search party had comprised yellowjacketed officers from barricade duty outfitted with flashlights they hadnt taken long paramedics declared the man dead though anyone could have done the job neck twisted at an unnatural angle one leg folded in half from the impact blood seeping from the skull he had lost a shoe on the way down and his shirt had been ripped open probably by an overhang police hq had spared a single soco who was photographing the body want to place a small wager on cause of death the soco asked rebus not a chance tam tam the soco had not lost a bet like that in fifty or sixty cases did he jump or was he pushed thats what youre asking yourself youre a mind reader tam do you do palms as well no but i take photos of them and to prove his point he got close up to one of the victims hands nicks and scratches can be very useful john know why impress me if hes been pushed hell have scrabbled for purchase clawed at the sides of the rock tell me something i dont know the soco let off another flash his names ben webster he turned to gauge rebuss reaction seemed satisfied with the result i recognize his facewhats left of it anyway you know him i know who he is member of parliament from up dundee way the scottish parliament tam shook his head the one in london hes something to do with international developmentleastways he was last time i looked tam rebus sounded exasperated how the hell do you know all this got to keep up with politics john its what makes the wheels turn and besides our young friend here shares a name with my favorite tenor saxophone player rebus was already tottering back down the grassy slope the body had come to rest against a shelf of rock fifteen feet above one of the narrow paths that snaked around the base of the ancient volcanic plug steelforth was on the path itself taking a call on his cell he flipped the phone shut as rebus neared remember rebus reminded him how we saw the foreign secretary leaving in his chauffeured car funny that hed go without one of his men ben webster steelforth stated that was the castle on the phone seems hes the only one missing international development youre well informed inspector steelforth made a show of looking rebus up and down maybe ive misjudged you but international development is a separate department from the fo webster was ppsparliamentary private secretary meaning what the ministers righthand man excuse my ignorance dont worry about it im still impressed is this where you make an offer to keep me off your back steelforth smiled thats usually not necessary might be in my case but steelforth was shaking his head i doubt you can be bought in that particular way nevertheless we both know this will be wrenched from your hands in the next few hours so why waste energy battlers like yourself usually know when its time to rest and refuel are you inviting me to the great hall for port and cigars im telling you the truth as i see it rebus was watching another van arrive on the road below them it would be from the morgue here to collect the body another job for professor gates and his staff you know what i think really bothers you inspector steelforth had taken a step closer his phone was ringing but he chose to ignore it you see all this as an incursion edinburgh is your town and you wish wed all just fuck off and go back home does that about sum it up just about rebus was prepared to admit it a few days itll all be over like a bad dream youll wake up from but in the meantime his lips were almost touching rebuss ear get used to it he whispered and moved away seems a nice sort tam commented rebus turned toward him how longve you been there not long any news for me pathologists the one with the answers rebus nodded slowly all the same though nothing points to him doing anything but jumping he screamed all the way down think a suicide would do that i know i would but then im scared of heights rebus was rubbing the side of his jaw he stared up at the castle so either he fell or he jumped or was given a sudden push tam added no time to even think about clawing his way to safety thanks for that could be there was bagpipe music between courses mightve broken his will to live youre a jazz snob tam wouldnt have it any other way no note tucked away inside his jacket tam shook his head but i did have half a mind to give you this he held up a small cardboard folder seems he was staying at the balmoral thats nice rebus opened the folder and saw the plastic key card he removed it closing the folder he examined ben websters signature and room number might be a goodbyecruelworld waiting for you there tam said only one way to find out rebus slipped the key into his own pocket thanks tam just remember it was you that found it i dont want any grief understood the two men stood in silence for a moment a pair of old pros whod seen everything the job could throw at them the morgue attendants were approaching one of them carrying a body bag nice night for it he commented all done and dusted tam doctors not arrived yet the attendant checked his watch think hell be long tam just shrugged depends whos drawn the short straw the attendant puffed air out from his cheeks going to be a long night he said long night his partner echoed know theyve had us move some of the bodies out of the morgue whys that rebus asked in case any of these rallies and marches turns nasty courts and cells are empty and waiting too tam added ers on standby the attendant countered you make it sound like apocalypse now rebus said his cell sounded and he moved away a little caller id siobhan what can i do for you he said into the phone i need a drink her voice explained trouble with the folks my cars been vandalized catch them in the act in a manner of speaking so how about the oxford bar tempting but im on something tell you what though what we could rendezvous at the balmoral spending your overtime ill let you be the judge of that twenty minutes fine he snapped shut the phone tragedy runs in that family tam was musing which one the soco nodded in the direction of the corpse mum was attacked a few years back died as a result he paused think something could prey on your mind all that time just needs the right trigger one of the morgue attendants added everyone rebus decided was a bloody psychologist these days he decided to leave the car and walk quicker than trying to negotiate the barriers again he was at waverley in minutes had to clamber over a couple of obstacles some unlucky tourists had just arrived by train no taxis to be had so they stood behind the railings bemused and abandoned he gave them a body swerve turned the corner into princes street and was outside the balmoral hotel some locals still called it the north british though it had changed its name years back its large illuminated clock tower still ran a few minutes fast so passengers would be sure to catch their train a uniformed doorman ushered rebus inside where a keeneyed concierge immediately marked him as trouble of some kind how can i be of assistance this evening sir rebus held out his id in one hand key card in the other i need to take a look at this room and whys that inspector seems the guest checked out early thats unfortunate i daresay someone else is picking up his tab actually thats something you could look into for me ill need to clear it with the manager fine meantime ill be upstairs he waved the key card i need to clear that too im afraid rebus took a step back the better to size up his opponent how long will it take just need to track down the managercouple of minutes is all rebus followed him to the reception desk sara is angela about think she went upstairs ill page her and ill check the office the concierge told rebus moving off again rebus waited and watched as the receptionist punched numbers into her phone before putting down the receiver she looked up at him and smiled she knew something was up and wanted to know more guest just dropped dead rebus obliged her eyes widened thats terrible mr webster room two fourteen was he here on his own her fingers busied themselves on her keyboard double room but just the one key issued i dont think i remember him is there a home address london she stated rebus guessed this would be a weekday piedàterre he was leaning across the reception desk trying to seem casual unsure how many questions hed get away with was he paying by credit card sara she studied her screen all charges to she broke off aware that the concierge was approaching all charges to rebus nudged inspector the concierge was calling sensing something was going on saras phone was ringing she lifted the receiver reception she trilled oh hello angela theres another policeman here another will you come down or shall i send him up the concierge was behind rebus now ill take the inspector up he told sara another policemanuprebus was getting a bad feeling when the elevator doors signaled that they were opening he turned toward the sound watched david steelforth step out the special branch man gave the beginnings of a smile as he shook his head slowly his meaning couldnt have been clearer buddy youre not getting anywhere near room rebus turned round and grabbed the computer monitor swiveling it toward him the concierge locked on to his arm sara gave a little shriek into the telephone probably deafening the manager steelforth bounded forward to join the fray thats definitely out of order the concierge hissed his grip was viselike rebus decided the man had seen some action in his time decided not to make an issue of it he lifted his hand from the monitor sara swung it back toward her you can let go now rebus said the concierge released his grip sara was staring at him in shock the phone still held in one hand rebus turned to steelforth youre going to tell me i cant see room two fourteen not at all steelforths smile broadened but the manager is thats her prerogative after all as if on command sara put the phone to her ear shes on her way she said ill bet she is rebuss eyes were still on steelforth but there was another figure a little way behind him siobhan bar still open is it rebus asked the concierge the man desperately wanted to say no but the lie would have been blatant he gave a little nod instead i wont ask you to join me rebus said to steelforth he brushed past both men and climbed the steps to the palm court stood at the bar and waited for siobhan to catch up he took a deep breath and reached into his jacket for a cigarette little problem with the management siobhan asked you saw our friend from so nice perks they get in special branch i dont know if hes staying here but a guy called ben webster was the labor mp thats the one i feel theres a story behind this her shoulders seemed to slump a little and rebus remembered that she too had had adventures this evening you go first he insisted the barman had placed bowls of nibbles in front of them highland park for me rebus told him vodka tonic for the lady siobhan nodded her agreement as the barman turned away rebus reached for one of the paper napkins took a pen from his pocket and jotted something down siobhan angled her head to get a better look who or what is pennen industries whoever they are theyve got deep pockets and a london postal code from the corner of his eye rebus could see steelforth watching from the doorway he made a show of waving the napkin at him before folding and pocketing it so who was it that attacked your carcnd greenpeace stop the war niddrie siobhan stated more specifically the niddrie young team think we can persuade the g to list them as a terror cell few thousand marines would sort things nicely sadly however niddrie has yet to strike oil rebus reached a hand out toward the tumbler of whiskey slightest of tremors that was all toasted his drinking partner the g and the marinesand would have toasted steelforth too had the doorway not been empty saturday july rebus awoke to daylight and realized he hadnt closed the curtains the previous night the tv was showing earlymorning news seemed mostly to be about the concert in hyde park they were talking to the organizers no mention of edinburgh he switched it off and went into the bedroom changed out of the previous days clothes and into a shortsleeved shirt and chinos splashed some water on his face studied the results and knew he needed something more grabbed his keys and phonehed left it charging overnight couldnt have been that drunkand left his apartment down two flights of stairs to the tenements main door his area of town marchmont was a student enclave the upside of which was that it was quiet during the summer hed watched them pour out at the end of june loading cars belonging to them or their parents stuffing duvets into the chinks of spare space there had been parties to celebrate the end of exams meaning rebus had twice had to remove traffic cones from the roof of his car he stood now on the pavement and sucked in what was left of the overnight chill then headed for marchmont road where the local market was just opening a couple of singledecker buses trundled past rebus thought they must be lost until he remembered and now he could hear it workmens hammers a pa system being tested he paid the shopkeeper and unscrewed the top from the irnbru bottle downed it in one which was fine hed added a backup of the soda to his purchases unpeeled and ate the banana as he walkednot straight back home but down to the bottom of marchmont road where it connected with the meadows the meadows had been just that several centuries back meadowland on the outskirts of the city marchmont itself not much more than a farm with surrounding fields nowadays the meadows was used for games of soccer and cricket for jogging or picnics but not today melville drive had already been cordoned off turning an important traffic artery into a bus lot there were dozens of them stretching to the curve of the road and beyond three abreast in some places they were from derby and macclesfield and hull swansea and ripon carlisle and epping people dressed in white were getting off white rebus remembered that everyone had been asked to wear the same color it meant that when they marched around the city they would create a vast and visible ribbon he checked his own clothes the chinos were fawn the shirt pale blue thank christ for that a lot of the bus people looked elderly some quite frail but they all sported their wristbands and their sloganed shirts some carried homemade banners they looked delighted to be there farther along marquees had been constructed vans were arriving ready to sell fries and meatfree burgers to the hungry masses stages had been erected and there was a display of huge wooden jigsaw pieces laid out next to a series of cranes it took rebus only a matter of seconds to spell out the words make poverty history there were uniformed cops in the vicinity but nobody rebus knew probably not even local he looked at his watch it was just after nine another three hours till kickoff hardly a cloud in the sky a police van had decided that its quickest route would entail mounting the curb forcing rebus to backtrack onto the grass he scowled at the driver who returned the look the side window opened whats your problem granddad rebus made a rude gesture willing the driver to stop the pair of them could have a nice little chat but the van had other ideas it kept moving rebus finished his banana thought about dropping the skin but figured hed be pounced on by the recycling police headed over to a trash can instead here you go a young woman said smiling and holding out a plastic bag rebus looked inside a couple of stickers and a help the aged tshirt hell do i want this for he growled she took it back trying hard to retain the traces of her original smile he moved away opening the reserve bottle of irnbru his head felt less gummy but there was sweat on his back a memory had been trying to force its way through and now he grasped it mickey and himself church outings to burntisland links buses took them there trailing streamers from their windows lines of buses waiting to take them home after the picnic and the organized races across the grassmickey always able to beat him from a standing start so that rebus had stopped trying eventuallyhis only weapon against his kid brothers sinewy determination white cardboard boxes containing their lunch jam sandwich iced cake maybe a hardboiled egg they always left the egg summer weekends appearing endless and unchangeable nowadays rebus hated them hated that so little would happen to him monday mornings were his true release a break from the sofa and the bar stool the supermarket and curry house his colleagues returned to work with stories of shopping exploits soccer games bike rides with the family siobhan would have been to glasgow or dundee seeing friends catching up cinema trips and walks by the water of leith nobody asked rebus anymore how he spent the weekend they knew hed just shrug nobodyd blame you for coasting except that coasting was the one thing he had no time for without the job he almost ceased to exist which was why he punched a number into his phone and waited listened to the voicemail message good morning ray he said when prompted this is your wakeup call every hour on the hour till i start to get some answers speak to you soon he ended the call immediately make another leaving the same message on ray duffs home machine cell and landline taken care of there wasnt much he could do but wait the live concert started around two but he didnt think either the who or pink floyd would appear until evening plenty of time for him to go over the colliar case notes plenty of time for followup on ben webster pushing saturday along until it turned into sunday rebus figured he would survive the only things information could give him on pennen industries were a phone number and an address in central london rebus called but got a message telling him the switchboard would open again on monday morning he knew he could do better than that so he placed a call to operation sorbus hq in glenrothes its cid here b division in edinburgh he crossed the floor of his living room and peered out the window a family kids with their faces painted was making its way down the street toward the meadows weve been hearing rumors about the clown army seems they might have their sights trained on something calledhe paused for effect as though consulting a documentpennen industries were in the dark wondered if your techs could shed some light pennen rebus spelled it and you are di starrderek starr rebus lied blithely no way of knowing what would get back to steelforth give me ten minutes rebus was about to offer thanks but the line was dead it had been a male voice noises off the sounds of a busy hub he realized the officer hadnt needed to ask for his phone numbermustve come up on some sort of display making it a matter of record and traceable oops he said quietly heading for the kitchen and some coffee he recalled that siobhan had left the balmoral after two drinks rebus had added a third before crossing the road to the café royal for a nightcap vinegar on his fingers this morning which meant hed eaten fries on the way home yes taxi driver dropping him at the end of the meadows rebus saying hed walk from there he thought of calling siobhan make sure she got home all right but it always annoyed her when he did that shed probably be out already meeting her parents at the march she was looking forward to seeing eddie izzard and gael garcía bernal others were making speeches too bianca jagger sharleen spiterished made it sound like a carnival he hoped she was right had to get her car to the garage too see about fixing the damage rebus knew councilman tench knew of him at least some sort of lay preacher used to have a spot at the foot of the mound calling out for the weekend shoppers to repent rebus used to see him when he was on his way to the ox for a lunchtime session had a good rep in niddrie harvesting development grants from local government charities even the eu rebus had told siobhan as much then given her a number for a mechanic off buccleuch street guy specialized in vws but owed rebus a favor his phone was ringing he took the coffee through to the living room and picked up youre not at the station the same voice in glenrothes said warily im at home he could hear a helicopter somewhere overhead outside his window maybe surveillance maybe news or could it be bono parachuting in with a sermon pennen doesnt have any offices in scotland the voice was saying then we dont have a problem rebus replied trying to sound casual time like this the rumor mills on overtime same as the rest of us he laughed and was about to add a fresh question but the voice made it unnecessary theyre a defense contractor so the rumors might still have force defense used to belong to the mod sold off a few years back i think i remember rebus made a show of saying londonbased right right thing is thoughtheir managing director is up here just now rebus whistled potential target we had him redflagged anyway hes secure the words didnt sound right in the young officers mouth rebus figured hed learned the phrases only recently maybe from steelforth hes not based at the balmoral is he rebus asked how do you know that rumors again but hes got protection yes his own or ours the caller paused why do you want to know just looking out for the taxpayer rebus laughed again think we should talk to him asking adviceas if the caller were the boss i can pass the message along longer hes in town tougher it is rebus stopped i dont even know his name he admitted suddenly another voice broke into the call di starr is that detective inspector starr speaking steelforth rebus sucked in air hello steelforth was saying gone shy all of a sudden rebus cut off the call cursed under his breath punched in more numbers and was connected to the switchboard at the local news paper features please he said im not sure anyones in the operator told him what about the news desk bit of a ghost ship for obvious reasons she sounded as if she too would rather be elsewhere but put him through anyway it took a while for someone to pick up my names di rebus gayfield cid always happy to talk to an officer of the law the reporter said brightly both on and off the record im not giving you business son i just need to speak to mairie henderson shes gone freelance and shes features not news didnt stop you putting her and big ger

asked firstfor mairie hendersons number why give me her number and ill tell you something im not going to tell her the reporter thought for a moment then asked rebus to hang on he was back half a minute later meantime the receiver had been making a noise letting him know someone else was trying to reach him he ignored it jotted down the number the reporter gave him thanks he said now do i get my little treat ask yourself this straight suicide why is a special branch slimeball called steelforth clamping down on it steelforth how do you spell but rebus had cut off the connection his phone began ringing immediately he didnt answer he had more than half an idea who it would beoperation sorbus had his number would have taken about a minute for steelforth to work out whose home address it belonged to another minute to call derek starr and ascertain he didnt know anything about anything brreeepbrreeepbrreeeppp rebus put the tv on again pressed the mute button on the remote no news just kids programs and pop videos the chopper was circling again he made sure it wasnt his tenement just because youre paranoid john he muttered to himself his phone had stopped ringing he made the call to

rebus for an interview but hed refused asked again later way big ger talks about you shed cajoled i really think you need to give your side rebus hadnt felt that need at all which hadnt stopped the book being a roaring success not just in scotland but farther afield us canada australia translations into sixteen languages for a time he couldnt pick up the paper without reading about it couple of prizes tv talk shows for journalist and subject wasnt enough that cafferty had spent his life ruining people and their communities terrorizing them now he was a fullscale celebrity shed sent rebus a copy of the book hed sent it back by return mail then hed gone out two weeks later and bought himself a copyhalf price on princes street flicked through it but hadnt had the stomach for the whole

hell do you want john the words cold but the voice thawing a little i want some info on an outfit called pennen industries used to be ministry of defense i think theyre in town right now and why am i interested youre not but i am he paused to light a cigarette exhaled smoke as he spoke did you hear about caffertys chum which one trying not to sound interested cyril colliar that missing scrap from his jacket has turned up with caffertys confession written on it he told me you wouldnt give up just thought id let you knowits not exactly common knowledge she was silent for a moment and pennen industries something else entirely you heard about ben webster it was on the news pennen was paying for his stay at the balmoral so so id like to know a bit more about them their managing directors

in theory he confessed but hey i play a mean game of minesweeper she laughed again and he knew it was going to be all right between them he heard something hissing in the background the clinking of cups which café are you in he asked montpelier s there are people outside all dressed in white montpelier s was in bruntsfield five minutes by car i could come buy you that coffee you can show me how to use my laptop im just leaving want to meet later at the meadows not especially how about a drink maybe ill see what i can find about pennen call you when im finished youre a star mairie and a best seller to boot she paused caffertys share went to charity you know he can afford to be generous talk to you later rebus finished the call decided to check for messages there was only the one steelforths voice had gotten just a dozen words out before rebus cut it off the unfinished threat echoed in his head as he crossed to the stereo and filled the room with the groundhogs dont ever try to outsmart me rebus or ill break most of the major bones professor gates was saying he gave a shrug fall like that what else can you expect he was at work because ben webster was news rush job everyone wanted the case closed as soon as possible a nice suicide verdict was how gates had put it earlier he was joined in the autopsy suite by dr curt in scots law two pathologists were needed corroboration was the result kept things tidy in court gates was the heavier of the two men face red veined nose misshapen by early abuse on the rugby field his version or an illjudged student fight curt his junior by only four or five years was slightly taller and a good deal thinner both men had tenure at the university of edinburgh with the term finished they could have been sunning themselves elsewhere but rebus had never known them to take holidayseither would have regarded it as a sign of weakness in the other not on the march john curt asked the three men were gathered around a steel slab in the morgue on cowgate just behind them an assistant was moving pans and instruments with a series of metallic scrapes and clatterings too tame for me rebus answered monday thats when ill be out with all the other anarchists gates added slicing into the body there was an area for spectators and rebus would usually have stayed there shielded by plexiglas distanced from this ritual but this being the weekend gates had said they could rise to a certain informality rebus had seen the insides of a human before but he averted his gaze nonetheless what was hethirtyfour thirtyfive gates asked thirtyfour the assistant confirmed in pretty good shapeconsidering sister says he kept fit jogging swimming gym is that who did the formal id rebus asked happy to turn his head in the assistants direction parents are dead it was in the papers wasnt it curt drawled keeping a beady eye on his colleagues work scalpel sharp enough sandy gates ignored this mother was killed during a breakin tragic really father couldnt go on without her just wasted away didnt he curt added want me to take over sandy cant blame you for feeling tired the week weve had stop fussing curt offered a sigh and a shrug both for rebuss benefit did the sister come down from dundee rebus asked the assistant works in london shes a cop nicerlooking than most no valentine for you next year rebus retorted present company excepted obviously poor girl curt commented to lose your family were they close rebus couldnt help asking gates thought it an odd question he glanced up from his work rebus ignored him dont think shed seen much of him lately the assistant was saying like me and michael pretty cut up about it all the same she didnt travel up on her own did she rebus asked wasnt anyone with her at the id the assistant said matteroffactly i left her in the waiting area after gave her a mug of tea shes not still there is she gates snapped the assistant looked around him unsure what rule hed broken i had to get the cutters ready place is deserted apart from us gates barked go see shes all right ill do it rebus stated gates turned toward him hands cradling a pile of glistening innards whats the matter john lost the stomach there was no one in the waiting area an empty mug decorated with the logo of a soccer team the glasgow rangers sat on the floor beside a chair rebus touched it still warm he walked toward the main door members of the public entered the building from an alley off the cowgate rebus looked up and down the road but saw no one walked around the corner into cowgate itself and saw the figure seated on the low wall that fronted the morgue she was staring at the childrens nursery across the street rebus stopped in front of her got a cigarette she asked you want one seems as good a time as any meaning you dont smoke so so im not about to corrupt you she looked at him for the first time she had short fair hair and a round face with prominent chin her skirt was knee length an inch of leg showing above brown boots with fur edging on the wall next to her sat an oversize bag probably everything shepackedhurriedly haphazardlybefore rushing north im di rebus he told her im sorry about your brother she nodded slowly eyes returning to the nursery school is that working she asked gesturing in its direction as far as i know its not open today of course but it is a nursery she turned to examine the building behind her and right across the road from this short journey isnt it di rebus i suppose youre right im sorry i wasnt there when you idd the body why did you know ben noi just thoughthow come nobodys with you such as from his constituencythe party think labor gives two hoots about him now she gave a short laugh theyll all be lining up at the head of that bloody march ready for the photo op ben kept saying how close he was getting to what he called the power little good it did him careful there rebus warned her you sound like youd fit right in with the marchers she gave a snort but didnt say anything any idea why he would rebus broke off you know i need to ask im a cop same as you she watched him bring out the packet just one she begged how could he refuse he lit both their cigarettes and leaned against the wall next to her no cars she stated towns locked down he explained youll have trouble getting a taxi but my cars parked i can walk she told him he didnt leave a note if thats what you wanted to know seemed fine last night very relaxed etcetera colleagues cant explainno problems at work she paused raising her eyes skyward except he always had problems at work sounds like the two of you were close he was in london most weekdays we hadnt seen each other for maybe a monthactually probably more like twobut there were texts emails she took a drag on the cigarette he had problems at work rebus prompted ben worked on foreign aid deciding which decrepit african dictatorships deserved our help explains what he was doing here rebus said almost to himself she gave a slow sad nod getting closer to the powera bangup dinner at edinburgh castle while you discuss the worlds poor and hungry hed be aware of the irony rebus guessed oh yes and the futility she fixed her eyes on his never she said quietly wasnt in bens nature she blinked back tears sniffed and sighed and flipped most of the cigarette onto the road i need to go she brought a wallet from her shoulder bag handed rebus a business card nothing on it but her namestacey websterand a cell number how long have you been in the police stacey eight years the last three at scotland yard her eyes fixed on his youll have questions for me did ben have any enemies money problems relationships gone bad maybe later eh a day or so give me a call okay nothing in the she had trouble getting the next word out sucked in some air and tried again nothing to suggest he didnt just fall hed had a glass or two of winemightve made him woozy nobody saw anything rebus offered a shrug sure i cant give you a lift she shook her head i need to walk word of advice steer clear of the parade route maybe ill see you againand i really am sorry about ben her eyes bored into his you actually sound as if you mean that he almost opened up to heri left my own brother in a box only yesterdaybut gave a twitch of the mouth instead she might have started asking questions were you close are you okay questions he didnt really know the answers to he watched her start her long and lonely walk along cowgate then went back inside for the autopsys closing act by the time siobhan arrived at the meadows the line of waiting marchers stretched all the way down the side of the old infirmary and across the playing fields to where the rows of buses sat someone with a megaphone was warning that it might be two hours before those at the back of the line actually started moving its the pigs someone explained only letting us go in batches of forty or fifty siobhan had been about to defend the tactic but knew it would give her away she moved down the patient line wondering how she was expected to meet her parents there had to be a hundred thousand people here maybe even double that shed never known a crowd like it t in the park only got sixty thousand the local soccer derby might attract eighteen on a good day new years eve in and around princes street you could get close to a hundred this was bigger and everyone was smiling hardly a uniform to be seen not many security guys either families streaming down from morningside and tollcross and newington shed bumped into half a dozen acquaintances and neighbors the lord provost was leading the procession some said gordon brown was there too later hed be addressing a rally the police protection squad in attendance though operation sorbus had graded him low risk due to his active pronouncements on aid and fair trade shed been shown a list of celebrities who were expected to hit the city geldof and bono of course maybe ewan mcgregor who was due at an event in dunblane anyway julie christie claudia schiffer george clooney susan sarandonhaving worked her way down the line siobhan headed for the main stage a band was playing a few people were dancing enthusiastically most just sat on the grass and watched the small tented village nearby offered activities for children first aid petitions and exhibits crafts were being sold flyers handed out one of the tabloids seemed to have been distributing make poverty history placards recipients were now tearing off the top section of each placard removing the tabloids masthead heliumfilled balloons rose into the sky a makeshift brass band was circumnavigating the field followed by an african steel band more dancing more smiles she knew then knew that it was going to be all right thered be no riots today not on this march she looked at her cell no messages shed tried her parents twice but they werent answering so she commenced another tour of the site a smaller stage had been erected in front of a stationary opentopped bus there were tv cameras here and people were being interviewed she recognized pete postlethwaite and billy boyd caught a glimpse of billy bragg the actor she really wanted to see was gael garcía bernal just in case he really did look as good in the flesh the lines at the vegetarian food vans were longer than the one for burgers shed been vegetarian herself at one time but had lapsed several years back blaming rebus and the bacon rolls hed kept wafting in her face she thought of texting him dragging him down here what else would he be doing either slumped on the sofa or resting on a stool at the oxford bar but she sent a text to her parents instead then headed toward the waiting lines again banners had been hoisted high whistles were being blown drums beaten all that energy in the airrebus would say it was being wasted hed say the political deals had already been done and hed be right the guys at sorbus hq had told her as much gleneagles was for private confabs and public photo ops the real business had been thrashed out in advance by lesser mortals chief among them the chancellor of the exchequer all of it done on the quiet and ratified by eight signatures on the final day of the g and how much is it all costing siobhan had wondered a hundred and fifty mil give or take the answer had produced a sharp intake of breath from dci macrae siobhan had pursed her lips saying nothing i know what youre thinking her informant had continued same sort of money buys a lot of vaccine every path across the meadows was now fourdeep with waiting marchers a new line had formed stretching back to the tennis courts and buccleuch street as siobhan squeezed her way past still no sign of her parents she caught a blur of color at the edge of her vision bright yellow jackets hurrying down meadow lane she followed them rounding the corner into buccleuch place and was stopped dead sixty or so blackclad demonstrators had been encircled by double that number of police the protesters had air horns which rasped a deafening complaint they wore sunglasses black scarves muffling their faces some wore hooded tops black combat pants and boots a few bandannas they didnt carry signs and none of them were smiling riot shields were all that separated them from the police lines someone had spraypainted the anarchist symbol on at least one translucent shield the mass of demonstrators pressed forward demanding access to the meadows but police tactics said different containment above all else a demonstration contained was a demonstration controlled siobhan was impressed her colleagues had to have known the protesters were on their way theyd taken up position fast and werent about to let the situation develop any further than here and now there were a few other bystanders torn between this spectacle and a need to join the march some of them had their camera phones out siobhan looked around making sure no fresh intake of riot officers tried corralling her the voices from within the cordon seemed foreign maybe spanish or italian she knew some of the names ya basta black bloc no sign of anything as outlandish as the wombles or rebel clown army her hand went into her pocket clutching her id wanted to be ready to show it if things got heated helicopter hovering overhead and a uniformed officer videotaping proceedings from the steps of one of the university buildings he scanned the street with his camera pausing on her for a moment before moving on to the other bystanders but siobhan was suddenly aware of another camera focused on him santal was inside the cordon recording everything with her own digital video she was dressed like the others backpack slung over one shoulder concentrating on her task rather than joining in with the chants and slogans the demonstrators wanted their own record to watch later and enjoy so they could learn police tactics and how to counter them and just in case ofmaybe even in the hope ofheavyhandedness they were media savvy counted lawyers among their activist friends film from genoa had been beamed around the world no reason fresh film of violent policing wouldnt be just as efficacious siobhan realized santal had seen her the camera was pointed her way and the mouth below the viewfinder broke into a scowl siobhan didnt think it the right time to wander over and ask for her parents whereabouts her phone started to vibrate telling her she had an incoming call she checked the number but didnt recognize it siobhan clarke she said holding the slim little box to her ear shiv its ray duff im bloody well earning that day out what day out the one you owe me he paused except thats not the deal you made with rebus is it siobhan smiled all depends are you at the lab working my ass off on your behalf the stuff from clootie well might have something for you though im not sure youre going to like it how soon can you get here half an hour she turned away from the sudden blare of the air horn no prizes for guessing where you are duffs voice said ive got it on the news channel here the march or the demonstration demo naturally happy lawabiding marchers hardly make for a story even when they number quarter of a million quarter of a million thats what theyre saying see you in half an hour bye ray she ended the call a figure like thatmore than half the population of edinburgh it was like three million on the streets of london and sixty blackclad figures hogging the news cycle for the next hour or two because after that all eyes would turn to the live concert in london no no no she thought too cynical siobhan youre thinking like john bloody rebus nobody could ignore a human chain encircling the city a ribbon of white all that passion and hope minus one had she ever planned to stick around add her own small self to the statistics no chance of that now she could apologize later to her parents for now she was on the move walking away from the meadows her best bet st leonard s the nearest police station hitch a lift in a patrol car hijack one if need be her own car was sitting in the garage rebus had recommended mechanic had said to call him on monday she remembered how one owner of a x had apparently moved her car out of town for the duration lest rioters should target it just one more scare story or so shed thought at the time santal didnt appear to notice her leave cant even mail a letter ray duff was saying theyve locked up all the mailboxes in case someone decides to put a bomb in one some of the shop fronts on princes street are boarded up siobhan added what do you reckon it is ann summers is afraid of basque separatists rebus guessed any chance of us getting to the point duff snorted hes afraid hell miss the big reunion reunion siobhan looked at rebus pink floyd rebus answered but if its anything like mccartney and u im well shut of it the three were standing in one of the labs belonging to the lothian and borders forensic science unit on howdenhall road duff midthirties with short brown hair and a pronounced widows peak was polishing his glasses on a corner of his white lab coat the rise of televisions csi franchise had had to rebuss mind a detrimental effect on all the howdenhall techs despite their lack of resources glamour and pounding sound track they all seemed to think they were actors moreover some of the cid had started to agree and would ask them to replicate the tv shows most farfetched forensic techniques duff had apparently decided that his own role would be that of eccentric genius as a result he had dispensed with his contact lenses and reverted to nhsstyle specs with thick black frames the better to complement the row of multicolored pens in his top pocket additionally a line of alligator clips was attached to one lapel as rebus had pointed out on arrival he looked like hed walked out of a devo video and now he was stringing them along in your own time rebus encouraged him they were standing in front of a workbench on which various pieces of cloth had been laid out duff had placed numbered squares beside each one and smaller squaresapparently colorcodednext to any stains or blemishes on each article sooner were done sooner you can get back to polishing the chrome on your mg that reminds me siobhan said thanks for offering me to ray you should have seen first prize rebus muttered what are we looking at prof mud and bird shit mostly duff rested his hands on his hips brown for the former gray for the latter he nodded at the colored squares leaving blue and pink blue is for stuff that needs further analysis tell me pink is for lipstick siobhan said quietly blood actually duff spoke with a flourish oh good rebus responded eyes fixing on siobhan how many two so far numbered one and two one is a pair of brown cord trousers blood can be a bugger to make out against a brown backgroundresembles rust two belongs to a sports shirt pale yellow as you can see not really rebus said leaning over for a closer look the shirt was caked with dirt whats that on the left breast badge of some kind what it actually says is keoghs garage the blood spatter is on the back spatter duff nodded consistent with a blow to the head something like a hammer you make contact break the skin and when you draw the hammer away the blood flies off in all directions keoghs garage siobhans question was directed at rebus who merely shrugged duff however cleared his throat nothing in the perthshire phone book or edinburgh come to that fast work ray siobhan said approvingly another brownie point there ray rebus added with a wink how about contestant number one duff nodded not spatter this timedollops on the right leg around the level of the knee whack someone on the head youll get some drips like that youre saying weve got three victims one attacker duff shrugged no way to prove it of course but ask yourself what are the chances of three victims having three different attackers all ending up in the same obscure location youve got a point ray rebus conceded and weve got a serial killer siobhan said into the silence different blood types i take it she watched duff nod any idea which order they might have died in cc rider is the freshest id guess the sports shirt is the oldest and no other clues from the cords duff shook his head slowly then dug into his labcoat pocket and produced a clear plastic envelope unless you count this of course what is that siobhan asked cashmachine card duff told her relishing the moment name of trevor guest so never let me hear you say i dont earn my little rewards back in the fresh air rebus lit a cigarette siobhan paced the length of a parking bay arms folded one killer she stated yep two named victims the other a mechanic or a car salesman rebus mused or just someone who had access to a shirt advertising a garage thanks for refusing to narrow the search he shrugged if wed found a scarf with a soccer teams logo on it would we be homing in on the team all right point taken she stopped in her tracks do you need to get back to the autopsy he shook his head one of us is going to have to break the news to macrae she nodded ill do it not a hell of a lot more to be done today back to live then he gave another shrug and the meadows for yourself he guessed she nodded her mind elsewhere can you think of a worse week for this to happen why they pay us the big bucks rebus told her drawing the nicotine deep a fat parcel was waiting for rebus at the door of his apartment siobhan was heading back down to the meadows rebus had told her to drop by later for a drink he realized his living room was stuffy so forced open the window he could hear sounds from the march echoey amplified voices drums and whistles live was on tv but not a band he recognized he kept the sound down opened the parcel there was a note inside from mairieyou dont deserve itfollowed by pages and pages of printout news stories about pennen industries dating right back to its separation from the mod snippets from the business pages detailing rising profits profiles praising richard pennen accompanied by photos of him every inch the successful businessman wellgroomed pinstriped coiffed saltandpepper hair even though he was still in his midforties steelrimmed glasses and a squareset jaw below perfectlooking teeth richard pennen had been an mod employee something of a whiz with microchips and software programs he stressed that his company didnt sell arms as such just the components to make them as efficient as possible which has to be better than the alternative for all concerned he was quoted as saying rebus flicked quickly though interviews and background features nothing to link pennen to ben webster except that both dealt with aspects of trade no reason why the company wouldnt treat mps to fivestar hotel rooms rebus turned to the next set of stapled sheets and gave a silent thankyou to mairie shed added a list of stuff about ben webster himself not that there was much about his career as an mp but five years back the media had shown sudden interest in the family following the shocking attack on websters mother she and her husband had been vacationing in the borders renting a cottage in the countryside outside kelso hed gone into town one afternoon for supplies and had returned to find the cottage ransacked and his wife dead strangled with a cord from the window blinds she had been beaten but not sexually assaulted money was missing from her bag as was her cell phone nothing else had been taken just some loose cash and a phone and a womans life the inquiry had dragged on for weeks rebus looked at photos of the isolated cottage the victim her grieving husband the two childrenben and stacey he lifted from his pocket the card stacey had given him rubbed its edges with his fingers as he continued to read ben the mp for dundee north stacey the cop from the met whom colleagues described as diligent and well liked the cottage was placed on the edge of woodland amid rolling hills no other habitation visible husband and wife had liked to take long walks and were regularly seen in kelsos bars and eateries the region had been their destination of choice for many holidays councillors for the area were quick to point out that the borders remains largely crimefree and a haven of peace didnt want the tourists scared off the killer was never caught the story drifted to the inside pages then deeper into the paper reappearing sporadically as a paragraph or two when ben webster was being profiled there was one indepth interview with him dating back to when hed been made pps he hadnt wanted to talk about the tragedy tragediesplural actually the father hadnt lasted long after his wifes murder his death came from natural causes the will to live just left him was how one neighbor in broughty ferry had put it and now hes at peace with the love of his life rebus looked again at the photograph of stacey taken on the day of her mothers funeral shed gone on tv apparently appealing for information stronger than her brother whod decided not to join her at the press conference rebus really hoped she would stay strong suicide seemed the obvious conclusion grief finally catching up with the orphaned son except that ben webster had screamed as he fell and the guards had been alerted to an intruder besides why that particular night that location the worlds media hitting town a very public gesture and steelforthwell steelforth wanted it all swept away nothing must deflect attention from the g nothing must be allowed to perturb the various delegations rebus had to admit the reason he was holding on to the case was simply to piss off the special branch man he got up from the table and went into the kitchen made himself another mug of coffee and brought it back through to the living room he changed channels on the tv but couldnt find any feeds from the march the hyde park crowd looked to be enjoying themselves though there was some sort of enclosure directly in front of the stage sparsely filled security maybe either that or media geldof wasnt asking for money this time around what live wanted was to focus hearts and minds rebus wondered how many concertgoers would afterward heed the call and trek the four hundred miles north to scotland he lit a cigarette to go with his coffee sat down in an armchair and stared at the screen he thought again of the clootie well of the ritual played out there if ray duff was right they had at least three victims and a killer who had made a shrine of sorts did that mean someone local how well known was the clootie well outside auchterarder did it appear in travel books tourist brochures had it been chosen for its proximity to the g summit the killer guessing that all those extra police patrols were bound to mean his grim little offering was found in which case was his spree now finished three victimsno way they were going to keep that away from the media cc riderkeoghs garagea cash cardthe killer was making it easy for them he wanted them to know he was out there worlds press gathered in scotland as never before giving him an international stage and macrae would relish the opportunity hed be out there in front of them chest puffed up as he answered their questions derek starr right beside him siobhan had said she would call macrae from the march let him know the labs findings ray duff meantime would be doing more tests trying for dna fingerprints from the blood seeing if any hairs or fibers could be isolated and identified rebus thought about cyril colliar again hardly a typical victim serial killers tended to prey on the weak and the marginalized a case of wrong place wrong time killed in edinburgh but the scrap from his jacket ends up in the woods in auchterarder just as operation sorbus is getting started sorbus a kind of treethe cc riders patch left in a wooded gladeif there was any hint of a connection with the g rebus knew the spooks would wrench the case out of siobhans hands and out of his steelforth wouldnt have it any other way the killer taunting them leaving calling cards there was a knock at his door had to be siobhan he stubbed out the cigarette stood up and took a look around the room it wasnt too bad no empty beer cans or pizza boxes whiskey bottle by the chair he picked it up put it on the mantelpiece switched the tv to a news channel and headed for the door swung it open and recognized the face felt his stomach clench thats your conscience salved then is it he asked feigning indifference pure as the driven fuckin snow rebus but can you say the same not siobhan morris gerald cafferty dressed in a white tshirt bearing the slogan make poverty history hands in trouser pockets slid them out slowly and held them up to show rebus they were empty a head the size of a bowling ball shiny and all but hairless small deepset eyes glistening lips no neck rebus made to shut the door on him but cafferty pressed a hand to it that any way to treat an old pal go to hell you look like youve beat me to itdid that shirt come off a scarecrow and who dresses youthe girls from what not to wear cafferty snorted i did meet them on breakfast tv actually see isnt this better were having a nice wee chat rebus had stopped trying to close the door hell are you doing here cafferty cafferty was examining his palms brushing imaginary grime from them how long have you been living here rebus got to be thirty years so ever hear of moving up in the world christ now its location location location youve never tried to improve your situation thats what i cant understand maybe i should write a book about it cafferty grinned im thinking of a followup charting a few more of our little disagreements is that why youre here memory needs refreshing does it caffertys face darkened im here about my boy cyril what about him i hear theres been some progress i want to know how much who told you its true then think id tell you even if it was cafferty gave a snarl hands shooting forward propelling rebus backward into the hall where he collided with the wall cafferty grabbed at him again teeth bared but rebus was ready managed to get a handful of the tshirt the two men wrestled twisting and turning moving farther down the hall until they were in the doorway to the living room neither had said a word eyes and limbs doing their talking but cafferty glanced into the room and seemed to freeze rebus was able to free himself from his grasp jesus christ cafferty was staring at the two boxes on the sofapart of the colliar case notes brought home from gayfield the previous night lying on the top was one of the autopsy photos and just visible beneath an older photograph of cafferty himself whats all this stuff doing here cafferty asked breathing heavily none of your damned business youre still trying to pin this on me not as much as i was rebus admitted he walked over to the mantelpiece and grabbed the whiskey lifted his glass from the floor and poured itll be public knowledge soon enough he said pausing to drink we think colliars not the only victim caffertys eyes narrowed as he tried to take this in who else rebus shook his head slowly now get the hell out i can help cafferty said i know people oh yeah trevor guest ring a bell cafferty thought for a moment before conceding defeat what about a garage called keoghs cafferty stiffened his shoulders i can find things out rebus ive got contacts in places that would frighten you everything about you frightens me cafferty fear of contamination i suppose how come youre so het up about colliar caffertys eyes strayed to the whiskey bottle got a spare glass he asked rebus fetched one from the kitchen when he returned cafferty was reading mairies covering note i see ms hendersons been lending a hand cafferty gave a cold smile i recognize her handwriting rebus said nothing poured a small measure into the glass i prefer malt cafferty complained wafting the contents under his nose whats your interest in pennen industries rebus ignored this you were going to tell me about cyril colliar cafferty made to sit down stay on your feet rebus commanded youre not going to be here that long cafferty knocked back the drink and placed the empty glass on the table its not cyril im interested in as such he admitted but when something like that happenswell rumors get started rumors that someones out there with a grudge never very good for business as you well know rebus ive had enemies in the past funny how i never see them anymore plenty of jackals out there whod like a share of the spoilsmy spoils he stabbed a finger into his own chest youre getting old cafferty same as you but theres no retirement package in my line of business and meantime the jackals get younger and hungrier rebus guessed and you need to keep proving yourself ive never backed down rebus never will itll come out soon enough cafferty if theres no connection between you and the other victims then theres no reason for anyone to see it as a vendetta but meantime meantime what cafferty gave a wink keoghs garage and trevor guest leave them to us cafferty who knows rebus maybe ill see what i can turn up about pennen industries too cafferty started to walk out of the room thanks for the drink and the wee bit of exercise think ill go join the tail end of the march povertys always been a great concern of mine he paused in the hall taking in his surroundings never seen it as bad as this though he added heading for the stairwell the right honorable gordon brown mp chancellor of the exchequer had already started to speak when siobhan entered the room an audience of nine hundred had gathered in the assembly hall at the top of the mound the last time siobhan had been there the place was acting as temporary home to the scottish parliament but the parliament now had lavish premises of its own opposite the queens residence at holyrood leaving the assembly hall once again the exclusive property of the church of scotland who along with christian aid had organized the evenings event siobhan was there for a meeting with edinburgh s chief constable james corbyn corbyn had been in charge just over a year having replaced sir david strathern there had been mutters of dissent over the appointment corbyn was english a bean counterand too bloody young but corbyn had proved himself a handson copper who made regular visits to the front line he was seated a few rows back in full dress uniform cap resting on his lap siobhan knew she was expected so found a space by the doors content to listen to the chancellors vows and pledges when he announced that africa s poorest thirtyeight countries would see a debt writeoff there was spontaneous applause but when the clapping died down siobhan was aware of a voice of dissent a lone protester had stood up he was wearing a kilt and he lifted it to reveal a cutout picture of tony blairs face on the front of his underpants security moved in quickly and those around the man helped with the process as he was dragged to the doors the fresh applause was for security the chancellor who had busied himself tidying his notes continued where hed left off the commotion however provided useful cover for james corbyn to make his move siobhan followed him out of the hall and introduced herself there was no sign of the protester or his captors just a few civil servants pacing the floor waiting for their master to finish they carried document files and cell phones and seemed exhausted by the days events dci macrae says we have a problem corbyn stated no niceties straight to the heart of the matter he was in his early forties with black hair parted to the right solidly built just over six feet in height there was a large mole on his right cheek which siobhan had been warned not to stare at bloody hard to keep eye contact macrae had told her with that thing in your sight line we may have three victims she said now and a murder site on the gs doorstep corbyn snapped not exactly sir i dont think well find bodies there just trace evidence theyll be out of gleneagles by friday we can stall the investigation till then on the other hand siobhan offered the leaders dont start arriving till wednesday three full days away what are you proposing we keep things lowkey but do as much as we can forensics can make a full sweep by then the one definite victim we have is an edinburgh guy no need to go disturbing the bigwigs corbyn studied her youre a ds am i right siobhan nodded bit junior to be heading something like this it didnt sound like criticism he was simply stating a fact a di from my station was with me sir we both worked the original inquiry how much help will you need im not sure much can be spared corbyn smiled its a sensitive time ds clarke i appreciate that im sure you do and this di of yourshes reliable siobhan nodded maintaining eye contact not blinking thinking maybe hes too new to have heard of john rebus happy to work a sunday he asked absolutely not so sure about the socos a word from me should help he grew thoughtful the march passed off without incidentperhaps well have it easier than we feared yes sir his eyes regained their focus your accents english he remarked yes sir ever given you problems a few gibes along the way he nodded slowly all right straightening his back see what you can get done before wednesday any problems let me know but do try not to step on any toes he glanced in the direction of the civil servants theres an so officer called steelforth sir he may raise a few objections corbyn looked at his watch direct him to my office he fixed his braided cap to his head time i was elsewhereyou do realize the enormous responsibility yes sir make sure your colleague gets the message hell understand sir he held out his hand very well lets shake on it ds clarke they shook on the radio news there was a report from the march and in a postscript mention that the death of international development minister ben webster was being treated as a tragic accident the chief story however was the hyde park concert siobhan had heard plenty of complaints from the hordes gathered at the meadows they felt the pop stars would upstage them limelight and album sales thats what theyre after one man said egotripping bastards the latest estimate of numbers on the march was siobhan didnt know how many were at the london concert but she doubted it was even half that the nighttime streets were busy with cars and pedestrians plenty of buses too heading south out of the city some of the shops and restaurants she passed had put signs in their windows we support make poverty history we only use fair trade produce small local retailer marchers welcome there was graffiti too anarchy symbols and messages exhorting the passersby activ agit demonstr another statement stated simply rome wasnt sacked in one day she hoped the chief constable would be proved right but there was a long way to go buses were parked outside the niddrie campsite the tented village had grown the same guard as the previous night was in charge she asked him his name bobby greig bobby im siobhan looks busy tonight he shrugged maybe a couple of thousand i guess thats as busy as itll get you sound disappointed councils spent a million on this placecould have given them all a hotel room for that never mind a spot in the wilderness he nodded toward the car shed just locked i see youve got a replacement borrowed from the garage at st leonard s had any more trouble from the natives nice and quiet he told her dark now mindthats when they come out to play know what it feels like in here he scanned the compound one of those zombie films siobhan offered a smile that makes you mankinds last great hope bobby you should be flattered my shift ends at midnight he called after her as she made her way to her parents tent there was no one home she unzipped the opening and looked in the table and stools had been folded away sleeping bags rolled tight she tore a sheet of paper from her notebook and left a message no sign of life in the surrounding tents either siobhan began to wonder if her mum and dad had maybe gone out drinking with santal santal last seen at the demonstration in buccleuch place which meant she might be troublemight get into trouble listen to yourself girl afraid your trendy leftist parents will be led astray she tutted to herself and decided to kill some time walking around the camp it was little changed from the previous night a strummed guitar a crosslegged circle of singers kids playing barefoot on the grass cheap food doled out at the big tent new arrivals weary after the march were being handed their wristbands and shown where to pitch camp there was still some light left in the sky making a startling silhouette of arthurs seat she thought maybe she would climb it tomorrow take an hour to herself the view from the top was a thrill always supposing she could afford an hour to herself she knew she should call rebus let him know the score he was probably still at home in front of the box time enough yet to give him the news saturday night eh bobby greig said he was standing just behind her holding a flashlight and his twoway you should be out enjoying yourself seems to be what my friends are up to she nodded in the direction of her parents tent ill be having a drink myself when i finish he hinted ive got work tomorrow hope youre on overtime thanks for the offer thoughmaybe another night he gave a huge shrug im trying not to feel rejected here his radio burst into life with a jolt of static he raised it to his mouth say again tower here they come again came the distorted voice siobhan looked toward the fence couldnt make anything out she followed bobby greig toward the gate yes a dozen of them hooded tops drawn tight around their heads eyes shaded by baseball caps no sign of weapons other than a quart of cheap booze being passed among them half a dozen guards had gathered inside the gate waiting for greig to give the word the gang outside was gesturing come and have a go greig stared back seeming bored with the performance should we call it in one of the other security men asked no sign of missiles greig replied nothing we cant handle the gang had steadily been approaching the fence siobhan recognized the one in the middle as the leader from friday night the mechanic at rebuss recommended workshop had said it might end up costing six hundred to fix her car insurance might do some of it had been his only crumb of comfort in reply shed asked him if hed ever heard of keoghs garage but hed shaken his head can you ask around hed said he would do that then had asked for a deposit a hundred gone from her bank account just like that five hundred still to go and here were the culprits not twenty feet from her she wished she had santals camerafire off a few shots and see if anyone at craigmillar cid could put names to faces had to be security cameras around here somewheremaybe she could sure she could but she knew she wouldnt off you go now bobby greig was calling out in a firm voice niddries ours the leader spat its youse should fuck off point taken but we cant do that makes you feel big eh playing babysitter to a bunch of scum happyclappy hippie shit one of his followers concurred thanks for sharing was all bobby greig said the leader barked out a laugh one of the gang spat at the fence another joined him we can take them bobby one of the security men said softly no need to fat bastard the gangs leader goaded fatass bastard one of his lieutenants added alky popeyed baldy asslicking greigs eyes were on siobhan he seemed to be making up his mind she shook her head slowly dont let them win thieving bastard asshole bloated schmuck bobby greig turned his head toward the guard next to him gave a brief nod count of three he said in an undertone save your breath bobby the guard leaped for the gate his comrades right behind him the gang scattered but regrouped at the other side of the road come on then any time you like you want us here we are siobhan knew what they wanted they wanted the security men to chase them into the labyrinth of streets jungle warfare where local knowledge could defeat firepower weaponsreadymade or improvisedcould be waiting there a larger army could be hidden behind hedges and down shadowy alleys and meantime the camp was left unguarded she didnt hesitate called it in on her cell officer requiring assistance brief details of where she was two three minutes theyd start arriving craigmillar copshop wasnt farther away than that the gangs leader was bending over making a show of offering his backside to bobby greig one of greigs men accepted the insult on his behalf and ran at the leader who did what siobhan had feared appeared to retreat farther down the walkway into the heart of the housing project careful she warned but no one was listening turning she saw that some of the campers were watching the action police will be here in a minute she assured them pigs one of the campers said in evident disgust siobhan jogged out into the road the gang really had scattered now at least that was what it looked like she traced bobby greigs route down the path and into a culdesac lowrise blocks all around some of the last and worst of the old streets the skeleton of a bike lay on the pavement a supermarket carts carcass sat curbside shadows and scuffles and yells the sound of breaking glass if there was fighting she couldnt see it back gardens were the battleground stairwells too faces at some of the windows but they withdrew quickly leaving only the cold blue glare of tv sets siobhan kept walking checking to left and right she was wondering how greig would have acted had she not been there to witness the taunts bloody men and their bloody machismo end of the street still nothing she took a left then a right in one front garden a car sat on bricks a lamppost had had its cover removed its wiring ripped out the place was a bloody maze and how come she couldnt hear sirens she couldnt hear any yells now either apart from an argument in one of the houses a kid on a skateboard came toward her maybe ten or eleven at most staring hard at her until he was past she reckoned she could take a left and be back at the main road but she entered another culdesac and cursed under her breathnot even a footpath to be seen knew the quickest route might be to skirt around the end terrace and climb the fence next block over and shed be back where she started maybe in for a pound she said heading down the cracked paving slabs there wasnt much of anything behind the row of houses weeds and anklehigh grass and the twisted remains of a rotary clothesline the fence was brokenbacked easy to cross into the next set of back gardens thats my flower bed a voice called in mock complaint siobhan looked around stared into the milky blue eyes of the gangs leader tasty he said eyeing her from top to toe dont you think youre in enough trouble she asked what troubles that then it was my car you got at last night dont know what youre talking about hed taken a step closer two shapes behind him to the left and right your best bet right nows to start walking she warned them the response low laughter im cid she said hoping her voice would hold up anything happens here were talking a lifetimes payback so how come youre quaking in your boots siobhan hadnt moved hadnt retreated an inch he was nose to nose with her now kneeinthegroin close she felt some of her confidence return walk away she said quietly maybe i dont want to then again came a deep booming voice maybe you do siobhan looked behind her it was councilman tench he had his hands clasped in front of him legs slightly apart he seemed to fill siobhans vision nothing to do with you the gang leader complained stabbing a finger in tenchs direction everything around heres got something to do with me those that know me know that now scamper back to your rabbit holes and well say no more thinks hes the big man one of the gang sneered only one big man in my universe son and hes up there tench gestured skyward dream on preacher the leader said but he turned and walked into the encroaching darkness his men following tench unclasped his hands and let his shoulders relax could have turned nasty he said could have siobhan agreed she introduced herself and he nodded thought to myself last nightthat lassie looks like a copper seems youre on regular peacekeeping duties she told him he made a face as if to play down his role quiet around here most nights you just picked a bad week for a visit his ears picked out a single siren growing closer your idea of the cavalry tench offered leading the way back to the camp the carher loaner from st leonard shad been sprayed with the letters nyt beyond a damned joke siobhan told herself through gritted teeth she asked tench if he had names for her no names he stated but you know who they are what difference does that make she turned instead to the uniforms from craigmillar gave them her description of the leaders build clothes eyes they shook their heads slowly camps in one piece one of them said thats what matters his tone said it allshe was the one whod summoned them here and there was nothing for them to see or do some namecalling and a few alleged thrown punches none of the security men had any injuries to report they looked exhilarated brothers in arms no real threat against the camp and no damage to reportother than siobhans car in other words a wildgoose chase tench was moving among the tents introducing himself all over again and shaking hands rubbing the kids heads and accepting a cup of herbal tea bobby greig was nursing bruised knuckles though all hed connected with according to one of his team was a wall livens things up eh he said to siobhan she didnt reply walked to the big tent and someone poured her a cup of chamomile she was outside again blowing on it when she saw that tench had been joined by someone with a handheld tape machine she recognized the journalist used to be pals with rebusmairie henderson that was the name siobhan moved closer and heard tench talking about the area gs all fine and well but the executive should be looking a damn sight closer to home kids here they cant see any sort of a future investment infrastructure industrywhat we need here is the rebuilding of a shattered community blights destroyed this place but blight is reversible an injection of aid and these kids will have something to be proud of something to keep them busy and productive like the slogan says its fine and dandy to think globalbut we shouldnt forget to act local thank you very much and he was moving again shaking another hand rubbing another childs head the reporter had spotted siobhan and came bounding over to her holding out the tape machine care to add a police perspective ds clarke no i hear thats two nights running youve been here whats the attraction im not in the mood mairie siobhan paused youre really going to write a story about this eyes of the world are on us she shut off the machine tell john i hope he got the package what package the stuff about pennen industries and ben webster still not sure what he thinks he can make of it hell come up with something mairie nodded just hope he remembers me when he does she was studying siobhans cup is that tea im gasping from the tent siobhan said nodding in that direction its a bit weak though tell them you want it strong thanks the reporter said moving away dont mention it siobhan said quietly pouring the contents of her cup onto the ground the live concert was on the latenight news not just london but philadelphia and the eden project and elsewhere viewing figures in the hundreds of millions and worries that with the concert running over the crowds would be forced to sleep outside for a night tuttut rebus said draining the dregs from a last can of beer the make poverty history march was on the screen now a noisy celeb stating that he just felt the need to be here on this day making history by helping make poverty a thing of the past rebus flipped to channel law and order special victims unit he didnt understand the title wasnt every victim special but then he thought of cyril colliar and realized the answer was no cyril colliar muscle for big ger cafferty looking like a targeted hit at first but now almost certainly not wrong place wrong time trevor guestso far only a piece of plastic but all those coded numbers would yield an identity rebus had been through the phone book for guests found almost twenty called half of those with only four answeringand none of them knew a trevor keoghs garagethere were a dozen keoghs in the edinburgh phone book but by then rebus had given up on the notion that all three victims would be from the city draw a wide enough circumference around auchterarder and you would take in dundee and stirling as easily as edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen too at a push the victims could have come from anywhere nothing to be done about it till monday nothing except sit and brood drinking beers and making a sortie to the corner shop for an ovenready dinner of lincolnshire sausage with onion gravy and parmesan mash plus four more beers the people lining up at the register had smiled at him they were still dressed in their white tshirts they were talking about the whole amazing afternoon rebus had nodded his agreement one autopsy on a member of parliament three victims of some anonymous killer somehow amazing didnt quite do it justice side two dance with the devil sunday july so how was the who siobhan asked it was late morning on sunday and shed invited rebus over for brunch his contribution a packet of sausages and four floury rolls shed put them to one side and made scrambled eggs instead topping each helping with slices of smoked salmon and a few capers the who was good rebus said using his fork to maneuver the capers to the side of his plate you should try one she admonished him he wrinkled his nose and ignored the advice floyd was good too he told her no major fallingsout they were facing each other across the small foldaway table in her living room she lived in a tenement just off broughton street five minutes walk from gayfield square what about you he asked looking around the room no signs of saturdaynight debauchery chance would be a fine thing her smile grew thoughtful and she told him about niddrie lucky to get out in one piece rebus commented your friend mairie was there writing a piece on councilman tench she said something about some notes shed sent you richard pennen and ben webster he confirmed so are you getting anywhere onward and upward shiv i also tried phoning a few guests and keoghswith nothing to show for it might as well have been chasing a few hoods around the houses hed cleared his platecapers asideand was leaning back in his chair wanted a cigarette but knew he should wait till shed finished eating oh and i had an interesting encounter myself as it happens so he told her about cafferty and by the time he was done her plate was empty hes the last thing we need she said rising to her feet rebus made the beginnings of an offer to clear the table but she nodded toward the window instead smiling he made his way over and eased it open cool air wafted in and he crouched down lighting up made sure to direct the smoke through the gap held the cigarette out of the window between puffs siobhans rules more coffee she called keep it coming he answered she came in from the kitchen carrying a fresh pot theres another march later on she said stop the war coalition bit late for all that id have thought and the g alternativesgeorge galloways going to be speaking rebus gave a snort stubbed out his cigarette on the windowsill siobhan had wiped clean the table lifted one of the boxes onto it the boxes shed asked rebus to bring the cyril colliar case the offer of double paysanctioned by james corbynhad persuaded the scene of crime unit to put a team together they were on their way to the clootie well siobhan had warned them to keep a low profile dont want local cid getting sniffy advised that socos from stirling had covered the same area two days before one of the edinburgh team had given a chuckle time we let the grownups try it then was all hed said siobhan wasnt hopeful all the same on friday all theyd been doing was bagging evidence of one crime now the signs pointed to two more it was worth a bit of sifting and lifting she started unloading files and folders from the boxes youve been through this lot already she asked rebus slid the window closed and all i learned was that colliar was a big bad bastard chances are he had more enemies than friends and the odds of him falling prey to a random killing slimwe both know that and yet that appears to be what happened rebus held up a finger were reading a lot into a couple of items of clothing owners unknown i tried trevor guest with missing persons and she shook her head not on any local register she tossed an emptied box onto the sofa its a sunday morning in july johnnot a hell of a lot we can do before tomorrow he nodded guests bank card its hsbc theyve only one branch in edinburgh precious few in scotland as a whole is that good or bad she gave a sigh i got through to one of their call centers they told me to try the branch on monday morning isnt there some sort of branch code on the card siobhan nodded not the sort of information they give out over the phone rebus sat down at the table keoghs garage information did what they could no listing on the web the names irish there are a dozen keoghs in the phone book he looked at her and smiled so you checked too soon as id sent the socos off youve been busy rebus opened one of the folders nothing in it he hadnt seen before ray duffs promised me hell go to the lab today he has his eyes on the prize she gave him a hard look before emptying the final box the amount of paperwork caused her shoulders to slump day of rest eh rebus said a phone started ringing yours siobhan said he went over to the sofa lifted the cell from his jackets inside pocket rebus he announced listened for a moment face darkening thats because im not there listening again no ill meet you where is it you need to be glancing at his watch forty minutes eyes on siobhan ill be there he snapped the phone shut cafferty she guessed how did you know he does something to youyour voice your face what does he want he went to my flat says theres something i need to see no way i was letting him come here much appreciated hes got some land deal going on needs to get to the site im coming with you rebus knew there was no way to refuse queen street charlotte square lothian road rebuss saab siobhan the wary passenger gripping the doorsill with her left hand theyd been stopped at barriers made to show id to various uniforms reinforcements were on their way into the city sunday was when the big exodus of officers north was due to happen siobhan had learned as much during her two days with macrae passed the info along to rebus as they waited at lights on lothian road they saw people standing outside the usher hall the alternative summit siobhan said thats where bianca jaggers due to speak rebus just rolled his eyes in return she smacked a fist into the side of his thigh did you see the march on tv two hundred thousand nice day out for all

a dozen of them john against two thousand in the camp i know which side my moneyd be on after which they sat in silence until reaching fountainbridge once an area of breweries and factories where sean connery had spent his early years fountainbridge was changing the old industries had all but vanished the citys financial district was encroaching style bars were opening one of rebuss favorite old watering holes had already been demolished and he reckoned the bingo hall next doorthe palais de danse as waswould soon follow the canal not much more than an open sewer at one time had been cleaned up families would go there for bike rides or to feed the swans not far from the cineworld complex stood the locked gates of one mothballed brewery rebus stopped the car and sounded his horn a young man in a suit appeared from behind the wall and released the padlock swinging one half of the gate open just enough to squeeze the saab through youre mr rebus he asked through the driversside window thats right the young man waited to see if rebus was about to introduce siobhan then he gave a nervous smile and handed over a brochure rebus glanced at it before passing it on youre a real estate agent i work for bishops solicitors mr rebus commercial property let me give you my card he was reaching into his jacket wheres cafferty the tone of voice made the young man more nervous still parked around the side rebus didnt wait to hear more he obviously thinks youre one of caffertys team siobhan said and from the line of sweat on his top lip id say he knows who cafferty is whatever he thinks its good news hes here why rebus turned to her makes it less likely were walking into a trap caffertys car was a dark blue bentley gt he was standing over it pressing a plan of the site against the hood so it wouldnt blow away here take a corner will you he said siobhan obliged cafferty gave her a smile ds clarke a pleasure as ever promotion cant be too far off eh especially when the chief constables trusting you with something this big siobhan glanced toward rebus who shook his head letting her know he wasnt caffertys source cid leaks like a sieve was caffertys explanation always has always will what do you want with this place siobhan couldnt help asking cafferty slapped a hand against the unruly sheet of paper land ds clarke we dont always realize how precious it is in edinburgh youve got the firth of forth to the north north sea to the east and the pentland hills to the south developers are scrabbling about for projects putting pressure on the council to free up the green belt and heres a twentyacre plot only five minutes walk from the financial district so what would you do with it apart rebus interrupted from burying a few bodies in the foundations cafferty decided to laugh at this that book made me a bit of money need to invest it somehow mairie henderson thinks your share went to charity rebus said cafferty ignored him did you read it ds clarke she hesitated giving cafferty his answer like it he asked dont really remember theyre thinking of turning it into a film the early chapters at any rate he lifted the plan and folded it tossed it onto the bentleys backseat im not sure about this place he turned his attention to rebus you mentioned bodies and thats what i get a sense of all the people who used to work here all of them gone and scottish industry along with them a lot of my family were minersill bet you didnt know that he paused youre from fife rebus im betting you grew up surrounded by coal he paused i was sorry to hear about your brother sympathy from the devil rebus said thats all i need a killer with a social conscience siobhan added in an undertone i wouldnt be the first caffertys voice drifted off he rubbed a finger along the underside of his nose in fact maybe thats whats landed on your plate he reached into the car again opening the glove box this time drew out some rolledup sheets of paper and made to hand them to siobhan tell me what they are she asked hands on hips theyre your case ds clarke proof that were dealing with a bad bastard a bad bastard who likes other bad bastards she took the papers but didnt look at them were dealing with quoting his own words back at him caffertys attention turned to rebus doesnt she know thats the deal there was never a deal rebus stated like it or not im on your side in this one caffertys eyes were on siobhan again these papers cost me some substantial favors if they help you catch him ill accept that but ill be hunting him toowith you or without you then why help us caffertys mouth twitched makes the race that bit more exciting he held open the back door of the bentley bags of space in the rearmake yourselves at home rebus joined siobhan on the backseat while cafferty sat in the front both detectives were aware of caffertys gaze he wanted them to be impressed rebus for one was finding it hard not to give anything away he wasnt just impressed he was amazed keoghs garage was in carlisle one of the mechanics edward isley had been found murdered three months back his body dumped on waste ground just outside the city a blow to the head and a toxic injection of heroin the body had been naked from the waist up no witnesses no clues no suspects siobhan met rebuss eyes does he have a brother rebus asked some obscure musical reference she guessed read on macduff cafferty said the notes were just that culled from police records those same police records went on to report that isley had been in employment only a little over a month having been released from a sixyear prison stretch for rape and sexual assault both isleys victims had been prostitutes one picked up in penrith and the other farther south in lancaster they worked the m motorway catering to truck drivers it was believed there might be other victims out there scared either of testifying or of being identified how did you get these the question burst from rebus it caused cafferty to chuckle networks are wonderful things rebusyou should know that plenty of palms greased along the way no doubt christ john siobhan was hissing look at this rebus started reading again trevor guest the notes started with bank details and a home addressin newcastle guest had been unemployed ever since being released from a threeyear term for aggravated burglary and an assault on a man outside a pub during one breakin hed attempted to sexually assault a teenage babysitter another piece of work rebus muttered who went the same way as the others siobhan traced the relevant words with her index finger body found dumped by the shore at tynemouth just east of newcastle head smashed in lethal dose of heroin the killing had happened two months back hed only been out of jail for two weeks edward isley three months past trevor guest two cyril colliar six weeks looks like maybe guest put up a fight siobhan commented yes four broken fingers lacerations to the face and chest body pummeled so weve got a killer whos only after scumbags rebus summed up and youre thinking more power to him cafferty guessed a vigilante siobhan said tidying up all the rapists our burglar friend didnt rape anyone rebus felt it necessary to point out but he tried to cafferty said tell me does all of this make your job easier or harder siobhan just shrugged hes working at pretty regular intervals she said to rebus twelve weeks eight and six he agreed means we should have had another one by now maybe we just havent looked why auchterarder cafferty asked it was a good question sometimes they take trophies and hang them on public display caffertys brow furrowed the clootie well doesnt get that many visitors siobhan grew thoughtful turned back to the top of the first sheet and started reading again rebus got out of the car the leather smell was beginning to get to him he tried to light a cigarette but the breeze kept extinguishing the flame heard the door of the bentley open and close here cafferty said handing him the cars chromeplated lighter rebus took it got the cigarette going gave it back with the briefest of nods it was always business with me rebus back in the old days thats a myth all you butchers use you forget cafferty ive seen what you did to people cafferty gave a slow shrug a different world rebus exhaled smoke anyway looks like you can rest easy your man was picked out all right but not because of any connection to you whoever did it he carries a grudge a big one rebus conceded and he knows about convicts knows release dates and what happens to them after rebus nodded scraping the heel of one shoe over the rutted tarmac and youll go on trying to catch him cafferty guessed its what im paid for but its never been about the money to you rebus never just been a job you dont know that actually i do cafferty was nodding now otherwise id have tempted you onto my payroll like dozens of your colleagues over the years rebus flicked the remains of his cigarette onto the ground flecks of ash blew back dotting caffertys coat you really going to buy this shit hole rebus asked probably not but i could if i wanted to and that gives you a buzz most things are within reach rebus were just scared what well find when we get there siobhan was out of the car finger stabbing the bottom of the final sheet whats this she was asking as she walked around the bentley toward them cafferty narrowed his eyes in concentration im guessing a web site he said of course its a web site she snapped thats where half this stuff comes from she shook the sheets in his face you mean its a clue he asked archly shed turned her back making for rebuss saab signaling to him with her arm that it was time to go shes really shaping up isnt she cafferty told rebus in an undertone it didnt just sound like praise either to rebuss mind it was as if the gangster was taking at least a portion of the credit on the way back into town rebus found a local news station an alternative childrens summit was being held in dunblane i cant hear the name of that place without shivering siobhan admitted ill let you in on a secret professor gates was one of the pathologists hes never said wont talk about it rebus told her he turned up the radio volume a little bianca jagger was speaking to the audience at the usher hall they have been brilliant at hijacking our campaign to make poverty history she means bono and company siobhan said rebus nodded agreement bob geldof has not just danced with the devil but slept with the enemy as applause broke out rebus turned the volume down again the reporter was saying that there was little evidence the hyde park audience was making its way north indeed many of saturdays marchers had already returned home from edinburgh dance with the devil rebus mused cozy powell song i seem to remember he broke off slamming his feet on brake and clutch a convoy of white vans was racing toward the saab on the wrong side of the road headlights flashing but no sirens the windshield of each van was covered with a mesh grille theyd streamed into the saabs lane to get past a couple of other vehicles cops in riot gear could be seen through the side windows the first van careered back into its own lane missing the saabs front wing by an inch the others followed bloody hell siobhan gasped welcome to the police state rebus added the engine had stalled so he turned the ignition again not a bad emergency stop though were they some of our lot siobhan had turned in her seat to examine the disappearing convoy no markings that i could see think theres been trouble somewhere she was thinking of niddrie rebus shook his head if you ask me theyre scooting back to pollock halls for tea and biscuits and they pulled that little stunt just because they could you say they as if were not on the same side remains to be seen siobhan want a coffee i need something to get the old heart pumping there was a starbucks on the corner of lothian road and bread street hard to find a parking space rebus speculated that they were too close to the usher hall he opted for a double yellow line stuck a police notice on the dashboard inside the café siobhan asked the teenager behind the register if he wasnt scared of protesters he just shrugged weve got our orders siobhan dropped a pound coin into the tips box shed brought her shoulder bag with her at the table she slid her laptop out and switched it on this me getting my tutorial rebus asked blowing across the surface of his coffee hed gone for regular complaining that he could buy a whole jar for the price of one of the costlier options siobhan scooped whipped cream from her hot chocolate with a finger can you see the screen all right she asked rebus nodded then watch this within seconds she was online and typing names into a search engine edward isley trevor guest cyril colliar plenty of hits she commented scrolling down a page but only one with all three her cursor ran back up to the first entry she tapped the touch pad twice and waited wed have checked this of course she said of course wellsome of us would but first wed have needed isleys name her eyes met rebuss cafferty has saved us a long days slog doesnt mean im about to join his fan club the welcome screen from a web site had appeared siobhan studied it rebus moved a little closer for a better view the site seemed to be called beastwatch there were grainy headandshoulder shots of half a dozen men with chunks of text to the right listen to this siobhan said tracing the words on the screen with her finger as the parents of a rape victim we feel it is our right to know the whereabouts of her attacker after his release from prison the aim of this site is to allow families and friendsand victims themselvesto post details of release dates along with photos and descriptions the better to prepare society for the beasts in our midst her voice died away lips moving silently as she read the rest to herself there were links to a photo gallery called beast in view and a discussion group as well as an online petition siobhan moved the cursor to edward isleys photo and tapped the pad a page of details came up showing isleys expected release date from prison nicknamefast eddieand areas he would most likely frequent it says expected release date siobhan pointed out rebus nodded and nothing more up to dateno sign they knew where he was working but it does say he was trained as a car mechanicmentions carlisle too posted by siobhan sought out the relevant details it just says concerned she tried trevor guest next same setup rebus commented and posted anonymously she returned to the home page and clicked on cyril colliar that same photos in our files she said its from one of the tabloids rebus explained watching more photos of colliar pop up siobhan swore under her breath what is it listen this is the animal who put our beloved daughter through hell and who has blighted our lives ever since hes up for release soon having shown no remorse or even admitting his guilt despite all the evidence we were so shocked that he will soon be back in our midst that we had to do something and this site is the result we want to thank all of you for your support we believe this may be the first site of its kind in britain though others like it exist elsewhere and our friends in the usa in particular have given us such help in getting started vicky jensens parents did all this rebus said looks like how come we didnt know siobhan shrugged concentrated on finishing the page hes picking them off rebus went on thats what hes doing right he or she siobhan corrected him so we need to know whos been accessing this site eric bain at fettes might help rebus looked at her you mean brains is he still talking to you i havent seen him in a while not since you gave him the brushoff she glowered at rebus who held up his hands in surrender got to be worth a try all the same he admitted i can do the asking if you like she sat back in her chair folded her arms bugs you doesnt it what im the ds youre the di yet corbyns put me in charge no skin off my nose he tried to sound slighted by the accusation sure about that because if were going to work together on this i only asked if you wanted me to speak to brains his irritation showed now siobhan unfolded her arms bowed her head sorry john just as well you didnt have espresso was all he said in reply a day off would have been nice siobhan stated with a smile well you could always go home and put your feet up or or we could go talk to mr and mrs jensen he wafted a hand toward the laptop see what they can tell us about their little contribution to the world wide web siobhan nodded slowly dipped her finger back into the whipped cream then thats what we should probably do she said the jensens lived in a rambling fourstory house overlooking leith links the basement level was daughter vickys domain it had its own separate entrance reached by a short flight of stone steps the gate at the top of the steps boasted a lock and there were bars on the windows on either side of the door plus a sticker warning potential intruders of an alarm system none of this had been deemed necessary before cyril colliars attack back then vicky had been a bright eighteenyearold studying at napier college now ten years later she still lived at home as far as rebus was aware he stood on the doorstep hesitated a moment diplomacys never been my strong point he advised siobhan then let me do the talking she reached past him and pushed the bell thomas jensen was removing his reading glasses as he opened the door he recognized rebus and his eyes widened whats happened nothing to worry about mr jensen siobhan assured him showing her id just need to ask a few questions youre still trying to find his killer jensen guessed he was medium height and in his early fifties hair graying at the temples the red vneck sweater looked new and expensive cashmere maybe why the hell do you think id want to help you were interested in your web site jensen frowned pretty standard practice these days if youre a vet not your clinic sir rebus explained beastwatch siobhan added oh that jensen looked down at the floor gave a sigh dollys pet project dolly being your wife dorothy yes is she at home mr jensen he shook his head looked past them as if scanning the outside world for a sign of her she was going to usher hall rebus nodded as if this explained everything thing is sir weve got a bit of a problem oh its to do with the web site rebus gestured in the direction of the hallway if we could come in and tell you about it jensen seemed reluctant but good manners prevailed he led them into the living room there was a dining room off its table spread with newspapers seem to spend all of sunday reading them jensen explained tucking his spectacles into his pocket he motioned for them to sit down siobhan settled herself on the sofa while jensen himself took an armchair rebus however stayed standing by the glass doors to the dining room peering through them toward the array of newsprint nothing out of the ordinary no particular stories or paragraphs marked the problem is this mr jensen siobhan was saying in mea sured tones cyril colliar is dead and so are two other men i dont understand and we think were looking at a single culprit but a culprit who may have plucked the names of all three victims from your web site all three edward isley and trevor guest rebus recited plenty more names in your hall of shamei wonder wholl be next there must be some mistake the blood had drained from jensens face do you know auchterarder at all sir rebus asked no not really gleneagles we did go there once a veterinarians conference was there maybe a bus trip to the clootie well jensen shook his head just some seminars and a dinner dance he sounded befuddled look i dont think i can help you the web site was your wifes idea siobhan asked quietly it was a way of dealing withshed gone online looking for help help victims families she wanted to know how to help vicky along the way the idea came to her she had help to construct the site we paid a firm of designers and the other sites in america oh yes they helped with layout once it was up and running jensen shrugged i think it almost manages itself do people subscribe jensen nodded if they want the newsletter its supposed to be every quarter but again im not sure dollys kept it up so you have a list of subscribers rebus asked siobhan looked at him not that you need to be a subscriber to look at the site therell be a list somewhere jensen was saying how long has the site been active siobhan asked eight or nine months it was when his release date started to come closerdolly was getting more and more anxious he paused glanced at his watch for vicky i mean as if on cue the front door opened and closed an excited breathless voice came from the hallway i did it dad the shore and back the woman who filled the door frame was redfaced and overweight she shrieked when she saw that her father was not alone its all right vicky but shed turned on her heels and fled another door opened and slammed shut they heard her footsteps as she padded down to her basement refuge thomas jensens shoulders slumped thats as far as shes managed on her own he explained rebus nodded the shore was barely half a mile away he knew now why jensen had been so anxious at their arrival and why he had scanned the world outside we pay someone to stay with her weekdays jensen went on hands in his lap means we can both keep working you told her colliars dead rebus asked yes jensen confirmed she was interviewed about it now jensen shook his head the officer who came to ask us questionshe was very understanding when we explained about vicky rebus and siobhan shared a look going through the motionsnot trying too hardwe didnt kill him you know even if hed been standing there in front of me jensens eyes grew unfocused im not sure i could bring myself to do it they all died of injections mr jensen siobhan stated the vet blinked a couple of times raised a hand slowly and squeezed the skin either side of his nose just below the eyes if youre going to accuse me of anything id like my lawyer to hear it we just need your help sir he stared at her and thats the one thing im determined not to give you well need to talk to your wife and daughter siobhan said but jensen was on his feet i want you to leave now i have to look after vicky of course sir rebus said but well be back siobhan added lawyer or no lawyer and remember mr jensen tampering with evidence can get you locked up she strode toward the door rebus following in her wake outside he lit a cigarette staring toward a makeshift game of soccer on the links see when i said diplomacy wasnt my strong point what five more minutes in there youdve been roughing him up dont be stupid but the blood had risen to her face she puffed out her cheeks and made an exasperated sound what did you mean about evidence rebus asked web sites can be wound down she explained subscriber lists can be lost which means the sooner we speak to brains the better eric bain was watching the live concert on his computerat least that was what it looked like to rebus but bain soon corrected him editing it actually a download siobhan guessed but bain shook his head burned it onto dvdrom now im taking out anything i dont need that would take some time in my case rebus said it easy enough once you get the hang of the tools i think siobhan broke in di rebus means hed be deleting a lot of stuff bain smiled at this he hadnt gotten up since theyd arrived hadnt so much as glanced up from the screen it was his girlfriend molly whod opened the door for them molly whod asked if theyd like a cup of tea she was in the kitchen now boiling the kettle while bain stuck to his task in the living room it was a topfloor apartment in a warehouse conversion off slateford road the brochure had probably referred to it as the penthouse there were expansive views from the small windows mostly of chimneys and abandoned factories the top of corstorphine hill was just visible in the distance the room was neater than rebus had expected no lengths of wiring cardboard boxes soldering irons or game consoles hardly the typical residence of a selfconfessed gadget geek how long you been here eric rebus asked couple of months pair of you decided to move in together thats about the size of it ill be finished here in a minute rebus nodded went over to the sofa and made himself comfortable molly shuffled in with the tea tray fizzing with energy she was wearing mules on her feet tight blue jeans that only reached as far as her calves a red tshirt with che guevara on it great figure and long blond hairdyed that color but still suiting her rebus had to admit he was impressed hed risked several glances toward siobhan who on each occasion had been studying molly the way a scientist would a lab rat clearly she too thought bain had done well for himself and molly had made her mark on brains the boy had been housebroken what was that elton john line you nearly had me roped and tiedbernie taupin actually the original brown dirt cowboy to regs captain fantastic place looks great rebus said to molly as she handed him a mug his reward her pink lips and perfect white teeth breaking into a smile didnt catch your last name clark she said same as siobhan here rebus informed her molly looked to siobhan for confirmation ive an e at the end siobhan offered not me molly replied shed settled on the sofa next to rebus but kept moving her bottom as if unable to get comfortable still it gives you something else in common rebus added teasingly receiving a scowl from siobhan for his effort how long have you two been an item then fifteen weeks she said breathlessly doesnt seem long does it but sometimes you just know rebus nodded agreement im always saying siobhan here should settle down it can be the making of you cant it molly molly didnt look convinced but still looked at siobhan with something like sympathy it really can she stressed siobhan gave rebus a hard stare and accepted her own mug actually rebus went on for a wee while back there siobhan and eric looked like becoming an item we were just friends siobhan said forcing out a laugh bain seemed frozen in front of the computer screen hand unmoving on the mouse is that right eric rebus called to him johns just teasing siobhan was assuring molly take no notice of him rebus offered molly a wink lovely spot of tea he said she was still fidgeting and were really sorry to disturb your sunday siobhan added if it wasnt an emergency bains chair creaked as he rose from it rebus noticed he had lost a good bit of weight maybe as much as fifteen pounds his pale face was still fleshy but the gut had shrunk still based at the forensic computer branch siobhan asked him thats right he accepted some tea and sat down next to molly she slid an arm protectively around him stretching the material of her tshirt further accentuating her breasts rebus concentrated all the harder on bain been busy with g he was saying sifting intelligence reports what sort of stuff rebus asked getting up as if to stretch his legs with bain on the sofa it was getting crowded there he began sauntering toward the computer the secret sort bain replied come across anyone called steelforth should i have hes soseems to be running the show but bain just shook his head slowly and asked them what they wanted siobhan handed him the sheet of paper its a web site she explained might suddenly disappear we need everything you can get subscription lists anyone whos been looking at it maybe downloading stuff thats a big ask i know it is eric the way she said his name seemed to hit a nerve he got up and walked to the window perhaps to hide from molly the flush of color that had risen up his neck rebus had picked up a piece of paper from beside the computer it was a letter headed axios systems signed by someone called tasos symeonides sounds greek he said eric bain seemed relieved to be changing the subject based right here he said an it outfit rebus wafted the letter in front of him sorry to be nosy eric its a job offer molly explained eric gets them all the time she had risen to her feet and crossed to the window sliding an arm around bain i have to keep persuading him that his police work is crucial rebus put the letter back and returned to the sofa any chance of a refill he asked molly was happy to pour bain seized the moment fixed siobhan with a stare dozens of unspoken words transmitted in a few seconds lovely rebus said accepting a bit of milk molly was seated next to him again how soon could it be shut down bain asked i dont know siobhan admitted tonight more likely tomorrow bain studied the piece of paper all right he said isnt this nice rebus seemed to be asking the question of the whole room but molly wasnt listening shed slapped both of her hands to her face mouth falling open i forgot the biscuits she jumped back to her feet how could i have done that and nobody said she turned to bain you could have said color was flushing her cheeks as she flew from the room and for the first time rebus realized that the place wasnt just tidy it was neurotically so siobhan had watched the procession with its antiwar chants and banners the route was lined with police waiting for trouble siobhan caught the sweet smell of cannabis in her nostrils but doubted anyone would be arrested for it the sorbus briefings had said as much if theyre shooting up as they pass you take them in otherwise let it go whoever was targeting the beastwatch web site had access to highgrade heroin she thought again of the mildseeming thomas jensen vets might not have access to h but they could always trade for something access to heroin and a grudge vickys two pals the ones whod been with her at the club and on the busmaybe they needed to be questioned the blow to the head always from behind someone less physically strong than those being attacked wanting them down before the injection lashing out at trevor guest because hed not been kod or did it show the killer becoming more unhinged more brazen starting to enjoy the process but guest had been the second victim the third cyril colliar hadnt been dealt with so harshly meaning someone had stumbled on the scene perhaps the killer fleeing before hed had a chance to get his jollies had he killed again if sosiobhan gave a little cluck he or she she reminded herself bush blair cia how many kids did you kill today the chant was taken up by the crowd they were streaming up calton hill siobhan following a few thousand of them heading for their rally the wind was biting the hilltop exposed to the elements views toward fife and across the city to the west views south to holyrood and the parliament cordoned day and night by police calton hill siobhan seemed to recall was another of edinburgh s extinct volcanoes the castle sat on one arthurs seat was another there was an observatory at the top and a series of public monuments best of all was the folly a single side of what had been meant as a fullscale replica of the parthenon in athens the mad donor had died leaving the thing unfinished some marchers were clambering onto it others were gathering around to hear the speeches one young woman in a world of her own danced around the periphery singing to herself didnt expect to see you here dear no but i thought i might see you siobhan gave her parents a hug couldnt find you at the meadows yesterday wasnt it fantastic siobhans father gave a laugh your mum was in tears throughout so emotional his wife agreed i came looking for you last night we went out for a drink with santal siobhan tried to make the question sound casual she ran a hand over her head as if trying to erase the voice within im your bloody daughter not her she was there for a little whiledidnt seem to appeal to her the crowd was clapping and cheering the first speaker billy braggs on later teddy clarke said i thought we could get something to eat siobhan was saying theres a restaurant on waterloo place are you hungry dear eve clarke asked her husband not really me neither siobhan shrugged her shoulders maybe later eh her father put a finger to his lips theyre starting he whispered starting what siobhan asked the naming of the dead and so they were reading out the names of a thousand victims of the warfare in iraq people from all sides of the conflict a thousand names the speakers taking it in turn their audience silent even the young woman stopped dancing she stood staring into space instead siobhan retreated a little at one point realizing her cell was still on didnt want eric bain calling with news she took it from her pocket and switched it to vibrate drifted a little farther away still in earshot of the roll call she could see the hibernian stadium below empty now that the season was over the north sea looked calm berwick law to the east looking like yet another extinct volcano and still the names continued forcing a secret rueful smile from her because this was what she did her whole working life she named the dead she recorded their last details and tried to find out who theyd been why theyd died she gave a voice to the forgotten and the missing a world filled with victims waiting for her and other detectives like her detectives like rebus too who gnawed away at every case or let it gnaw at them never letting go because that would have been the final insult to those names her phone was buzzing she lifted it to her ear they were quick eric bain told her the sites gone yep she cursed under her breath did you get anything bits and pieces i couldnt burrow far enough in not with the gear at home no subscriber list afraid not another speaker had taken over at the microphone the names kept coming anything else you can try she asked from the office yes maybe one or two little tricks tomorrow then if our g masters can spare me he paused it was good to see you siobhan sorry you had to meet eric she warned dont dont what all of itnone of it lets just not okay there was a long silence on the line still friends he eventually asked absolutely call me again tomorrow she ended the call had to otherwise shed have been telling him stick to your nervous pouting bosomy girlfriendyou might end up having a future stranger things had happened she studied her parents from behind they were holding hands her mother leaning her head against her fathers shoulder tears threatened to well up in siobhans eyes but she forced them back down she remembered vicky jensen running from the room and molly doing the same thing both of them scared of life itself in her teens siobhan had run from plenty of rooms rooms her parents had been in tantrums bustups battles of wits power plays and all she wanted now was to be standing right there between them wanted it but couldnt do it instead she stood fifty feet behind them willing them to turn their heads instead of which they listened to the namesthe names of people theyd never known i appreciate this steelforth said rising to shake rebuss hand hed been waiting in the lobby of the balmoral hotel sitting with one leg crossed over the other rebus had kept him waiting quarter of an hour using that time to walk past the doors of the balmoral several times glancing inside to see what traps might await the stop the war march had been and gone but hed spotted its rump moving slowly up waterloo place siobhan had told him she was headed there thought she might catch up with her parents youve not had much time for them rebus had sympathized and vice versa shed muttered there was security at the door of the hotel not just the liveried doorman and conciergea different one from saturday nightbut what rebus assumed were plainclothes officers probably under steelforths control the special branch man was looking more dapper than ever in a doublebreasted pinstripe having shaken hands he was gesturing toward the palm court a small whiskey perhaps depends whos paying allow me in which case rebus advised i might manage a large one steelforths laugh was loud enough but empty at its core they found a corner table a cocktail waitress appeared as if conjured into being by their very arrival carla steelforth informed her wed like a couple of whiskeys doubles he turned his attention to rebus laphroaig rebus obliged the older the better carla bowed her head and moved off steelforth was adjusting the line of his jacket waiting for her to leave before he spoke rebus decided not to give him the chance managing to hush up our dead mp he inquired loudly whats to hush up you tell me as far as i can establish di rebus your own investigation so far has consisted of one unofficial interview with the deceaseds sister having finished toying with his jacket steelforth clasped his hands in front of him an interview conducted moreover lamentably soon after she had made formal identification he paused theatrically no offense intended inspector none taken commander of course it may be that youve been busy in other ways ive had no fewer than two local journalists raking over the coals rebus tried to look surprised mairie henderson plus whoever it was hed spoken to on the scotsman news desk favors now owed to both well rebus said since theres nothing to hush up i dont suppose the press will get very far he paused you said at the time that the investigation would be taken out of my handsthat doesnt seem to have happened steelforth shrugged because theres nothing to investigate verdict accidental death he unclasped his hands as the drinks arrived and with them a small jug of water and a bowl brimming with ice cubes do you want to leave the bill open carla asked steelforth looked at rebus then shook his head well just be having the one he signed for the drinks with his room number is it the taxpayer picking up the tab rebus inquired or do we have mr pennen to thank richard pennen is a credit to this country steelforth stated adding too much water to his drink the scottish economy in particular would be the poorer without him i didnt realize the balmoral was so expensive steelforths eyes narrowed i mean defense jobs as you well know and if i interview him about ben websters demise hell suddenly send the work elsewhere steelforth leaned forward we need to keep him happy surely you can see that rebus savored the aroma of the malt then lifted it to his mouth cheers steelforth said grudgingly slainte rebus replied ive heard you enjoy a drop of the hard stuff steelforth added maybe even more than a drop youve been talking to the right people i dont mind a man who drinksjust so long as it doesnt interfere with his work but then i also hear its been known to affect your judgment not my judgment of character rebus said putting the glass down sober or drunk id know you for a prick of the first order steelforth made a mock toast with his glass i was going to offer you something he said to make up for your disappointment do i look disappointed youre not going to get anywhere with ben webster suicide or not suddenly youre ruling in suicide again does that mean theres a note steelforth lost patience theres no bloody note he spat theres nothing at all makes it an odd suicide wouldnt you say accidental death the official line rebus lifted his glass again what were you going to offer me steelforth studied him for a moment before answering my own men he said this murder case youve goti hear tell the count is now three victims id imagine youre stretched right now its just you and ds clarke isnt it more or less ive plenty of men up here rebusvery good men all sorts of skills and specialties among them and youd let us borrow them that was the intention so wed be able to focus on the murders and give up on the mp rebus made a show of thinking the proposal over went so far as to press his hands together and rest his chin on his fingertips sentries at the castle said there was an intruder he said quietly as if thinking aloud no evidence of that steelforth was quick to reply why was webster on the rampartsthats never really been answered a breath of air he excused himself from the dinner it was winding downport and cigars he said he was going outside rebuss eyes were on steelforth now not as such people were getting up to stretch their legs youve interviewed all of them rebus guessed most of them the special branch man qualified the foreign secretary rebus waited for a response which didnt come no i didnt think so the foreign delegations then some of them yes ive done pretty much everything youd have done inspector you dont know what id have done steelforth accepted this with a slight bow of the head he had yet to touch his drink youve no qualms rebus added no questions none and yet you dont know why it happened rebus shook his head slowly youre not much of a cop are you steelforth you might be a whiz at the handshakes and the briefings but when it comes to policing id say you havent a fucking clue youre window dressing thats all rebus rose to his feet and what are you exactly di rebus me rebus considered for a moment im the janitor i supposethe one who sweeps up after you he paused found his punch line after you and around you if it comes to that exit stage right before leaving the balmoral hed wandered downstairs to the restaurant breezing through the anteroom despite the best efforts of the staff the place was busy but there was no sign of richard pennen rebus climbed the steps to princes street and decided he might as well drop into the café royal the pub was surprisingly quiet trades been lousy the manager confided lot of locals keeping their heads down the next few days after two drinks rebus headed along george street the workmen had stopped digging the roadscouncil orders a new oneway system was being introduced and with it confusion for motorists even the traffic cops thought it hamfisted and werent going out of their way to enforce the new no entry signs again the street was quiet no sign of geldofs army the bouncers outside the dome told him the place was three quarters empty on young street the narrow lanes oneway routing had been switched from one direction to the other rebus pushed open the door to the oxford bar smiling at something hed been told about the new system theyre doing it in easy stages you can go in either direction for a while pint of ipa harry rebus said reaching for his cigarettes eight months and counting harry muttered pulling the pump dont remind me harry was counting the days till scotland s smoking ban took effect anything happening out there one of the regulars asked rebus shook his head knowing that in the drinkers sealedoff world news of a serial killer wouldnt quite qualify for the category of anything happening isnt there some march on harry added calton hill one of the other drinkers confirmed money this is costing we couldve sent every kid in africa a picnic basket putting scotland on the world stage harry reminded him nodding in the direction of charlotte square home to the first minister a price jack says is worth every penny its not his money though the drinker grumbled my wife works at that new shoe shop on frederick street says they might as well have shut down for the week royal banks going to be closed all tomorrow harry stated aye tomorrows going to be the bad one the drinker muttered and to think rebus complained i came in here to cheer myself up harry stared at him in mock disbelief should know better than that by now john ready for another rebus wasnt sure but he nodded anyway a couple of pints later and having demolished the last sandwich on display he decided he might as well head home hed read the evening news watched the tour de france highlights on tv and listened to further opposition to the new road layout if they dont change it back my wife says they might as well pull down the shutters where she works did i tell you shes in that new shoe shop on frederick street harry was rolling his eyes as rebus made for the door he considered walking home or calling gayfield to see if anyone was out in a patrol car and could maybe pick him up a lot of the taxis were steering clear of the center but he knew he could take a chance outside the roxburghe hotel try to look like a wealthy tourist he heard the doors opening but was slow to turn around hands grabbed at his arms pulling them behind his back had a bit too much to drink a voice barked night in the cells will do you good pal get off me rebus twisted his body to no effect he felt the plastic restraints going around his wrists pulled tight enough to cut off circulation no way to loosen them once they were on you had to slice them off hells going on rebus was hissing im bloody cid dont look like cid the voice was telling him stink of beer and cigarettes clothes like rags it was an english accent london maybe rebus saw a uniform then two more the faces shadowymaybe tannedbut chiseled and stern the van was small and unmarked its back doors were open and they pushed him in ive got id in my pocket he said there was a bench for him to sit on the windows were blacked out and covered on the outside by a metal grille there was a faint smell of sick another grille separated the back of the van from the front with a sheet of plywood blocking any access this is a big mistake rebus yelled tell it to the marines a voice called back the van started moving rebus saw headlights through the back window stood to reason three of them couldnt fit in the front had to be another vehicle didnt matter where they took him gayfield square west end or st leonard shed be a known face nothing to worry about except the swelling of his fingers as the blood failed to circulate his shoulders were in agony too drawn back by the tightness of the cuffs he had to slide his legs apart to stop himself careering around the enclosure they were doing maybe fifty not stopping for lights he heard two pedestrians squeal at a near miss no siren but the roof light was flashing car behind seemed to have neither siren nor flasher not a patrol car thenand this wasnt exactly a regulation vehicle either rebus thought they were heading east meaning gayfield but then they took a sharp left toward the new town barreling downhill so that rebuss head thumped the roof as they went where the hell if hed been drunk before he was sober now only destination he could think of was fettes but that was hq you didnt take drunks there to sleep off their binge it was where the brass hung out james corbyn and his cronies sure enough they took a left into ferry road but didnt make the turn to fettes which left only drylaw police station a lonely outpost in the north of the cityprecinct thirteen some called it a gloomy shed of a place and they were pulling to a halt at its door rebus was hauled out and taken inside his eyes adjusting to the sudden glare of the strip lighting there was no one on the desk place seemed deserted they marched him into the back where two holding cells waited both with their doors wide open he felt the pressure on one hand ease the blood tingling its way back down the fingers a push in the back sent him stumbling into one of the cells the door slammed shut hey rebus called out is this some sick kind of joke do we look like clowns pal think youve wandered into an episode of jackass there was laughter from behind the door get a good nights sleep another voice added and dont go giving us any trouble else we might have to come in there and administer one of our special sedatives mightnt we jacko rebus thought he could hear a hiss everything went quiet and he knew why theyd made a mistake given him a name jacko he tried to remember their faces the better to exact his eventual revenge all that came to him was that theyd been either tanned or weatherbeaten but there was no way he was going to forget those voices nothing unusual about the uniforms theyd been wearingexcept the badges on the epaulets had been removed no badges meant no easy means to id them rebus kicked the door a few times then reached into his pocket for his phone and realized it wasnt there theyd taken it from him or hed dropped it still had his wallet and id cigarettes and lighter he sat on the cold concrete shelf which served as a bed and looked at his wrists the plastic cuff was still encircling his left hand theyd sliced open the one around his right he tried to run his free hand up and down the arm massaging the wrist the palm and fingers trying to get some blood going maybe the lighter could burn its way through but not without searing his flesh in the process he lit a cigarette instead and tried to slow his heartbeat walked over to the door again and banged on it with his fist turned his back to it and hammered his heel into it all the times hed visited the cells in gayfield and st leonard shearing these selfsame tattoos thumthumthumthumthum making jokes with the jailer about it thumthumthumthumthum the sound of hope over experience rebus sat down again there was neither toilet nor basin just a metal pail in one corner ancient feces smeared on the wall next to it messages gouged into the plaster big malky rules wardie young team hearts ya bass hard to believe but someone with a bit of latin had even been holed up here nemo me impune lacessit in the scots whau daur meddle wi me modern equivalent screw me and ill screw you right back rebus got to his feet again knew now what was going on should have realized from the word go steelforth easy for him to get his hands on some spare uniforms and dispatch three of his men on a mission the same men hed offered to rebus earlier theyd probably been watching as hed left the hotel followed him from pub to pub until they picked their spot the lane outside the oxford bar was perfect steelforth rebus yelled at the door come in here and talk to me are you a coward as well as a bully he pressed his ear to the door but heard nothing the spy hole was closed the hatch which would be opened at mealtimes was locked shut he paced the cell opened his cigarette packet but decided he needed to conserve supplies changed his mind and lit one anyway the lighter splutterednot much lighter fluid lefta tossup which would run out first ten oclock his watch said a long time till morning monday july the turning of the lock woke him the door creaked open first off he saw a young uniform mouth agape in amazement and to his left detective chief inspector james macrae looking irate and with his hair uncombed rebus checked his watch just shy of four which meant monday was dawning got a blade he asked mouth dry he showed them his wrist it was swollen the palm and knuckles discolored the constable produced a penknife from his pocket how did you get in here he asked voice shaking ten oclock last night who was holding the fort we had a callout the constable said locked the place before we left rebus had no reason to disbelieve the story how did the callout go false alarm im really sorrywhy didnt you shout or something i assume theres nothing in the log the cuffs fell to the floor rebus started rubbing life back into his fingers nothing and we dont check the cells when theyre empty you knew they were empty kept that way so we can stick any rioters in them macrae was studying rebuss left hand need to get that seen to ill be fine rebus grimaced how did you find me text message id left the phone to charge in my study the beeping woke my wife can i see it macrae handed over the phone at the top of the screen was the callers number and below it a capitalized message rebus in drylaw cells rebus punched the return call option but when connected all he got was a machine telling him the number was not in use he handed the phone back to macrae screen says the call was sent at midnight macrae failed to meet rebuss gaze it was a while before we heard it he said quietly but then he remembered who he was and stiffened his spine care to tell me what happened here some of the lads having a laugh rebus improvised he kept flexing his left wrist trying not to show how much it was flaring with pain names asked macrae no names no one gets in trouble sir said rebus so if i were to return their little text message numbers already been canceled sir macrae studied rebus few drinks last night eh a few he turned his attention back to the uniform nobodys left a cell at the front desk by any chance the young officer shook his head rebus leaned in toward him something like this gets outwell therell be a few laughs at my expense but youll be the ones the jokes really on cells unchecked station left unmanned front door unlocked the door was locked the constable argued still doesnt look good for you does it macrae patted the officers shoulder so lets keep this to ourselves eh now come on di rebus ill drop you home before the barricades go up again outside macrae paused before unlocking his rover i can see why youd want this kept quiet but rest assuredif i find the culprits therell be hell to pay yes sir rebus agreed sorry to have been the cause not your fault john now hop in they drove southward in silence through the city dawn breaking to the east a few delivery vans and bleary pedestrians but little clue as to what the day might bring monday meant the carnival of full enjoyment the police knew it was a euphemism for trouble this was when the clown army the wombles and the black bloc were expected to make their move they would try to shut the city down macrae had switched the radio to a local station just in time to catch a news flashan attempt to padlock the pumps at a gas station on queensferry road the weekend was just for starters macrae commented as he drew to a halt on arden street so i hope you enjoyed it nice and relaxing sir rebus said opening his door thanks for the lift he patted the roof of the car and watched it drive off then climbed the two flights searching his pockets for his keys no keys of course not they were hanging from the lock on his door he swore and opened up withdrew the keys and held them in a bunch in his right fist walked into the hall on tiptoe no noises or lights padded past the kitchen and bedroom doorways into the living room the colliar case notes werent there of course hed taken them to siobhans but the stuff mairie henderson had found for himabout pennen industries and ben webster mpwas strewn about the place he picked his cell phone up from the table nice of them to bring it back he wondered how thoroughly they had scoured it for calls in and out messages and texts didnt really bother him he deleted stuff at the end of each day didnt mean it wasnt still hidden on the chip somewhereand theyd have the authority to ask his phone company for records when you were so you could do most things he went into the bathroom and ran the tap it always took a while for the water to run hot he was going to spend a good fifteen or twenty minutes under the shower he checked the kitchen and both bedrooms nothing seemed out of place which in itself also meant nothing filled the kettle and switched it on might the place be bugged hed no way of telling didnt think it was as easy these days as unscrewing the base from the telephone to find out the paperwork on pennen had been tossed about but not taken why because they knew it would be easy for him to get the same information again it was all in the public domain after all only a mouse click or two away theyd left it because it was meaningless because rebus wasnt anywhere near getting to whatever it was steelforth was trying to protect and theyd left his keys in the lock his phone in plain view to add insult to injury he flexed his left hand again wondering how you could tell if you had a blood clot or thrombosis he took the tea through to the bathroom turned off the tap at the sink shed his clothes and climbed into the shower he tried to empty his mind of the previous seventytwo hours started listing his desert island disks instead couldnt decide which track off argus to choose he was still busy debating with himself as he got out and toweled himself dry found himself humming throw down the sword not on your life he declared to the mirror he was determined to get some sleep five restless hours curled up on a slab hardly counted but first he had to charge his phone plugged it in and decided to see what messages there were one textsame anonymous caller as macrae lets call a truce sent barely half an hour before which meant two things they knew he was home and the outofservice number was somehow back in play rebus could think of a dozen replies but decided to switch the phone off again instead another mug of tea and he made for the bedroom panic on the streets of edinburgh siobhan had never known the place so tense not during the local soccer championship not even during republican and orange marches the air was somehow heightened as if an electric current ran through it not just edinburgh either a peace camp had been established in stirling there had been short sharp outbursts of violence still two days to go before the g opened but the protesters knew that a number of delegations had already arrived a lot of the americans were based at dunblane hydro a short drive from gleneagles some foreign journalists had found themselves much farther away in hotels in glasgow japanese officials had taken over many of the rooms in the edinburgh sheraton just across the road from the financial district siobhans instinct had been to use the hotels lot but there was a chain across its entrance a uniformed officer approached as she wound down her window she showed him her id sorry maam he apologized in a polite english voice no can do orders from on high your best bet is to do a uturn he pointed farther down the western approach road theres some idiots on the roadwere trying to herd most of them into canning street bunch of clowns by all accounts she did as instructed finally finding a space on a yellow line outside the lyceum theater crossed at the lights but instead of going into the standard life hq decided to walk past it down the concrete lanes which ran mazily through the whole area turned a corner into canning street and found herself stopped by a cordon of police on the other side of which blackclad demonstrators mixed with figures from the big top a bunch of clowns quite literally this was siobhans first real sighting of the rebel clown army they wore red and purple wigs faces painted white some brandished feather dusters others waved carnations a smiley face had been drawn on one of the riot shields the cops were in black too protected by knee and elbow pads stabproof vests visored helmets one of the demonstrators had somehow scrambled up a high wall and was shaking his bared buttocks at the police below there were windows all around office workers peering out plenty of noise but no real fury as yet as more officers jogged into view siobhan retreated as far as the pedestrian bridge which crossed over the western approach road again the protesters were heavily outnumbered one of them was in a wheelchair a lion rampant attached to the back fluttering in the breeze traffic heading into town was at a standstill whistles were being blown but the police horses looked unfazed as a line of officers marched beneath the footbridge they held their shields above their heads to protect themselves the situation seemed under control and unlikely to change so siobhan headed for her final destination the revolving door which led to the standard life reception area was locked a guard stared out at her before buzzing her in can i see your pass miss i dont work here siobhan showed her id instead he took it from her to study it handed it back and nodded toward the reception desk any problems she asked couple of goons tried to get in ones scaled the west side of the building seems to be stuck three floors up fun for all concerned it pays the bills miss he gestured once more toward the desk gina there will sort you out gina did indeed sort siobhan out first a visitors passto be kept in view at all times pleaseand then a call upstairs the waiting area was plush with sofas and magazines coffee and a flatscreen tv showing some midmorning design show a woman came striding toward siobhan detective sergeant clarke ill take you upstairs mrs jensen but the woman shook her head sorry tove kept you waiting as you can imagine things are a bit fraught thats okay ive been learning which floor lamp to buy the woman smiled without really comprehending and led siobhan to the elevator as they waited she studied her own clothes were all in civilian clothes today she said explaining the slacks and blouse good idea its funny seeing some of the men in jeans and tshirts hardly recognizable some of them she paused is it the riots youre here about no mrs jensen seemed in the dark up to me to shed some light then isnt it siobhan replied with a smile as the elevator doors opened the nameplate on dolly jensens office stated that she was dorothy jensen but gave no indication of her job title had to be quite highpowered siobhan figured jensens assistant had knocked on the door then retreated to her own desk the main floor was open plan plenty of faces peering up from their computers to study the new arrival a few stood by the available windows coffee mugs in hand watching the outside world come in a voice called siobhan opened the door and closed it behind her shook dorothy jensens hand and was invited to take a seat you know why im here siobhan asked jensen leaned back in her chair tom told me all about it youve been busy since havent you jensen scanned her desk she was the same age as her husband broadshouldered and with a masculine face thick black hairthe gray dyed out of it siobhan guessedfell in immaculate waves to her shoulders around her neck hung a simple pearl necklace i dont mean here mrs jensen siobhan explained allowing the irritation to show i mean at home wiping all trace of your web site is that a crime its called impeding an investigation ive seen people go to court for it sometimes we can up the ante to criminal conspiracy if were of a mind jensen took hold of a pen from her desk twisted its barrel opening and closing it siobhan was satisfied that she had breached the womans defenses i need everything youve got mrs jensenany paperwork email addresses names we need to clear all those peopleyou and your husband includedif were going to catch this killer she paused i know what youre thinkingyour husband told us pretty much the sameand i can appreciate youd feel that way but youve got to understandwhoever did this theyre not going to stop they could have downloaded everyone listed on your site and that turns those men into victimsnot so very different from vicky at mention of her daughters name jensens eyes burned into siobhans but they soon grew liquid she dropped the pen and opened a drawer bringing out a handkerchief and blowing her nose i tried you knowtried to forgive its supposed to make us divine after all isnt it she forced a nervous laugh these men they go to jail to be punished but we hope theyll change too the ones who dontwhat use are they they come back to us and do the same things over and over again siobhan knew the argument well and had found herself many times on both sides of it but she stayed silent he showed no remorse no sense of guilt no sympathywhat kind of creature is that is it even human at the trial the defense kept on about the broken home he came from the drugs he took they called it a chaotic lifestyle but it was his choice to destroy vicky his little power trip nothing chaotic about that let me tell you jensens voice had grown tremulous she took a deep breath adjusting her posture calming by degrees i work in insurance we deal with choice and risk i do know a little of what im talking about is there any paperwork mrs jensen siobhan asked quietly some jensen admitted not very much what about emails you must have corresponded with the sites users jensen nodded slowly the families of victims yes are they all suspects too how soon can you get everything to me do i need to talk to my lawyer might be an idea meantime id like to send someone to your home he knows about computers if he comes to you it saves us having to take your hard drive elsewhere all right his names bain eric bain of the pneumatic girlfriendsiobhan shifted in her chair and cleared her throat hes a detective sergeant like me what time this evening would suit you look rough mairie henderson said as rebus tried to squeeze himself into the passenger seat of her sports car restless night he told her what he didnt add was that her am call had woken him does this thing go back any farther she bent down and tugged at a lever sending rebuss seat flying backward rebus turned to examine what space was left behind him thanks for the invite by the way in that case you can pay for the drinks what drinks are those our excuse for being there in the first place she was heading for the top of arden street left right and left would put her on grange road and only five minutes away from prestonfield house prestonfield house hotel was one of the citys betterkept secrets surrounded by s bungalows and with views across to the projects of craigmillar and niddrie it seemed an unpromising location for a grand house in the baronial style its substantial groundsincluding an adjacent golf coursegave plenty of privacy the only time the place had been in the news to rebuss knowledge was when a member of the scottish parliament had tried setting fire to the curtains after a party i meant to ask on the phone rebus said to mairie what how do you know about this contacts john no journalist should ever leave home without them tell you something youve left at home thoughthe brakes on this bloody death trap its a road racer she told him doesnt sound right when you dawdle but she eased her foot back a little thanks he said so whats the occasion exactly morning coffee then he gives his pitch and then lunch where exactly she shrugged a meeting room i suppose maybe the restaurant for the actual lunch she signaled left into the hotel driveway and we are looking for some peace and quiet amid the madness plus a pot of tea for two staff were awaiting them at the front door mairie explained the situation there was a room off to the left where their needs could be met or another to the right just past a closed door something on in there mairie asked pointing business meeting the employee revealed well just so long as theyre not kicking up a fuss well be fine in here she entered the adjoining room rebus heard peacocks squawking outside on the lawn is it tea youre wanting the young man asked coffee for me rebus told him teapeppermint if youve got it otherwise chamomile the employee disappeared and mairie pressed her ear to the wall i thought eavesdropping had gone electronic rebus commented if you can afford it mairie whispered she lifted her ear away all i can hear is muttering stop the presses she ignored him pulled a chair over toward the doorway making sure shed have a view of anyone entering or leaving the meeting lunch sharpish at twelve thats my guess get them feeling good about their host she checked her watch i brought a woman here for dinner once rebus mused had coffee in the library after its upstairs walls a sort of curdled red i think someone told me they were leather leather wallpaper kinky mairie said with a smile by the way i never did thank you for going straight to cafferty with news of cyril colliar his eyes drilled into hers and she had the good grace to allow some red to creep up her neck youre welcome she said nice to know that when i come to you with confidential information youll feed it to the citys biggest villain just that once john once too often the colliar killing has been gnawing away at him just the way i like it she gave a tired smile just the once she repeated and please bear in mind the huge favor im currently doing you rebus decided not to answer walked back out into the hall instead the reception desk was at the far end past the restaurant it had changed a bit in the years since rebus had spent half his paycheck on that meal the drapes were heavy the furniture exotic tassels everywhere a darkskinned man in a blue silk suit tried to pass rebus giving a little bow morning rebus said good morning he said crisply coming to a stop is the meeting already closing i wouldnt know the man bowed his head again my apologies i thought perhaps but he left the sentence unfinished and walked the rest of the way to the door tapping once before disappearing inside mairie had come out for a look not much of a secret knock rebus informed her its not the masons rebus wasnt so sure about that what was the g after all if not a very private club the door was opening again two more men stepping out they made for the driveway stopping to light their cigarettes breaking up for lunch rebus guessed he followed mairie back to the doorway of their own little room and watched the men filter out maybe twenty of them some looked african others asian and middle eastern a few wore what rebus took to be their national dress maybe kenya sierra leone niger mairie was whispering meaning that really youve got no idea whatsoever rebus whispered back geography was never my strong point she broke off and clutched his arm a tall imposing figure was now mingling with the others shaking hands and exchanging some words rebus recognized him from mairies press pack his elongated face was tanned and lined and some brown had been added to his hair pinstripe suit with an inch of crisp white shirt cuff he had a smile for everyone seemed to know them personally mairie had retreated a few steps farther into the room but rebus stayed in the doorway richard pennen took a good photograph in the flesh the face was slightly scrawnier the eyes heavylidded but he did look disgustingly healthy as though he had spent the previous weekend on a tropical beach assistants stood on either side of him whispering information into his ear making sure this part of the day like those before and after was without a hitch of any kind suddenly a member of the staff was blocking rebuss view he bore a tray with the tea and coffee as rebus moved to let him pass he saw that hed come to pennens notice your treat i believe mairie was saying rebus turned into the room and paid for the drinks would it be detective inspector rebus the deep voice came from richard pennen he was standing just a few feet away still flanked by his assistants mairie took a couple of steps toward him and held out her hand mairie henderson mr pennen terrible tragedy at the castle the other night terrible pennen agreed i believe you were there i was shes a journalist sir one of the assistants said id never have guessed pennen answered with a smile just wondering mairie plowed on why you were paying for mr websters hotel room i wasntmy company was whats your interest in debt relief sir but pennens focus was on rebus i was told i might be seeing you nice to have commander steelforth on your team pennen looked rebus up and down his description didnt do you justice inspector still its nice that he took the trouble rebus could have added because it means ive got him rattled youre aware of course of how much flak you might get if i were to report this intrusion were just enjoying a cup of tea sir rebus said far as im aware youre the one doing the intruding pennen smiled again nicely put he turned to mairie ben webster was a fine mp and pps miss henderson and scrupulous with it as you know any gifts in kind received from my company would be listed in members interests doesnt answer my question pennens jawline twitched he took a deep breath pennen industries does most of its business overseasget your economics editor to fill you in youll see what a major exporter weve become of arms mairie stated of technology pennen countered whats more we put money back into some of the poorest nations thats why ben webster was involved he turned his gaze back to rebus no coverup inspector just david steelforth doing his job a lot of contracts could get signed during these next few dayshuge projects greenlighted contacts made and jobs saved as a result not the sort of feelgood story our media seem to be interested in now if youll excuse me he turned away and rebus was gratified to see that there was a blob of something on the heel of one black leather brogue no expert rebus would still have bet heavily on it being peacock shit mairie slumped onto a sofa which creaked beneath her as if unused to such mistreatment bloody hell she said pouring out some tea rebus could smell the peppermint he poured himself some coffee from the small carafe remind me he said how much is this whole thing costing the g she waited till hed nodded puffed out her cheeks as she tried to remember a hundred and fifty as in millions as in millions and all so businessmen like mr pennen can keep plying their trade there might be a bit more to it than that mairie was smiling but youre right in a sense the decisions have already been made so whats gleneagles all about but a few nice dinners and some handshakes for the cameras putting scotland on the map she offered aye right rebus finished his coffee maybe we should stay for lunch see if we can rile pennen more than we already have sure you can afford it rebus looked around him which reminds me that flunkys not come back with my change change mairie gave a laugh rebus caught her meaning and decided he was going to drain the carafe to its last drop according to the tv news central edinburgh was a war zone half past two on a monday afternoon normally there would have been shoppers in princes street laden with purchases people in the adjacent gardens enjoying a promenade or resting on one of the commemorative benches but not today the newsroom cut to protests at the faslane naval base home to britain s four tridentclass submarines the place was under siege from about two thousand demonstrators police in fife had been handed control of the forth road bridge for the first time in its history cars heading north were being stopped and searched roads out of the capital had been blocked by sitdown protests there had been scuffles near the peace camp in stirling and a riot was kicking off in princes street batonwielding police making their presence felt they carried circular shields of a kind siobhan hadnt seen before the area around canning street was still causing trouble marchers still bringing traffic to a halt on the western approach the studio cut back to princes street the protesters seemed to be outnumbered not only by police but by cameras too a lot of pushing on both sides theyre trying to start a fight eric bain said hed come to gayfield to show her what little hed been able to find so far it could have waited till after youd seen mrs jensen shed told him to which all hed done was shrug they were alone in the cid office see what theyre doing bain asked pointing at the screen a rioter wades in then backs off the nearest cop raises his billy club and the papers get a photo of him striking out at some poor guy whos first in line meantime the real troublemaker is tucked away somewhere behind ready to do the same thing again siobhan nodded makes it look like were being heavyhanded which is what the rioters want he folded his arms theyve learned a few tricks since genoa but so have we siobhan said containment for one thing thats four hours now the group in canning street have been corralled back in the studio one of the presenters had a live feed to midge ure he was telling the troublemakers to go home shame none of them are watching bain commented are you going to speak with mrs jensen siobhan hinted yes boss how hard should i push her ive already warned we could set her for obstruction remind her of that siobhan wrote the jensens address on a sheet of her notebook ripped it out and handed it over bains attention was back on the tv screen more live pictures from princes street some protesters had climbed onto the scott monument others scrambled over the railings into the gardens kicks were aimed at shields divots of earth were being thrown benches and trash cans were next this is getting bad bain muttered the screen flickered a new location torphichen street site of the citys west end police station sticks and bottles were being hurled glad were not stuck there was all bain said no were stuck here instead he looked at her youd rather be in the thick of things she shrugged stared at the screen someone was calling into the studio by cell phone a shopper trapped like so many others in the branch of british home stores on princes street were just bystanders the woman was shrieking all we want to do is get out but the police are treating us all the same mothers with babies old folk youre saying the police are overreacting the journalist in the studio asked siobhan used the remote to change channels columbo on one side diagnosis murder on another and a film on channel thats kidnapped bain said brilliant sorry to disappoint you she said finding another of the news channels same riots different angles the same protester shed seen in canning street was still on top of his wall he sat swinging his feet only his eyes showing through the gap in his ski mask he was holding a cell phone to his ear that reminds me bain said i had rebus on the phone asking how an outofservice number could still be active siobhan looked at him did he say why bain shook his head so what did you tell him you can clone the sim card or specify outgoing calls only he gave a shrug all kinds of ways to do it siobhan nodded eyes back on the tv screen bain ran a hand across the back of his neck so what did you think of molly he asked youre a lucky man eric he gave a huge grin pretty much my thinking but tell me siobhan asked hating herself for being led down this route does she always twitch so much bains grin melted away sorry eric that was out of order she said she likes you he confided shes not got a bad bone in her body shes great siobhan agreed even to her own ears the sentiment sounded hollow so how did you two meet bain froze for a moment a club he said recovering never took you for a dancer eric siobhan glanced in his direction mollys a great dancer shes got the body for it relief washed over her as her own cell sounded she hoped to hell it would offer the excuse to be anywhere but here it was her parents number hello at first she mistook the noise on the line for static then she realized yells and catcalls and whistles same noises shed just been hearing on the report from princes street mum she said dad and now a voice her fathers siobhan can you hear me dad what the hell are you doing down there your mum what dad put her on will you your mums has something she was bleedingambulance dad youre breaking up where are you exactly kioskgardens the line went dead she looked at its small rectangular screen connection lost connection lost she echoed whats going on bain asked my mum and dadthats where they are she nodded toward the tv can you give me a lift where there she stabbed a finger at the screen there there they didnt get any farther than george street siobhan got out of the car and told bain not to forget the jensens he was telling her to be careful as she slammed shut the door there were protesters here too spilling down frederick street staff watched in fascinated horror from behind the doors and windows of their shops bystanders pressed themselves to walls in the hope of blending in there was debris underfoot the protesters were being pushed back down into princes street nobody tried to stop siobhan crossing the police line in that direction easy enough to get in getting out was the problem there was only one kiosk she knew ofjust down from the scott monument the gates to the gardens had been closed so she made for the fence the skirmishes had moved from the street into the gardens themselves trash flew through the air along with stones and other missiles a hand grabbed at her jacket no you dont she turned to face a policeman just above his visor were the letters xs for a brief moment she read it as excessjust perfect she had her id ready im cid she yelled then you must be crazy he released his grip it has been said she told him clambering over the spikes looking around she saw that the rioters had been reinforced by what looked like local hooligans any excuse for a fight wasnt every day they could lash out at the cops and have a good chance of getting away with it they were disguising their identities with scarves around their mouths jackets zipped all the way to the chin at least these days they all wore sneakers rather than doc martens boots the kiosk it sold ice cream and cold drinks shards of glass lay strewn around it and it was closed she circled it in a crouch no sign of her father spots of blood on the ground and she followed them with her eyes they stopped short of the gates circled the kiosk again banged on the serving hatch tried again heard a muffled voice from inside siobhan dad you in there the door to the side was yanked open her father was standing inside and next to him the kiosks terrified owner wheres mum siobhan asked voice shaking they took her in the ambulance i couldntthey wouldnt let me past the cordon siobhan couldnt remember ever seeing her father in tears but he was crying now crying and obviously in shock we need to get you out not me his companion said with a shake of her head im guarding the fort but i saw what happenedbloody police she was only standing there it was one of their sticks siobhans father added right across her head blood was gushing out siobhan silenced the woman with a look whats your name she asked francesfrances neagley well frances neagley my advice is to get out then to her shivering father come on lets get going what we need to go see mum but what about itll be all right now come on she tugged at his arm felt she would have hauled him out of there bodily if need be frances neagley closed the door on them and locked it another divot flew past siobhan knew that tomorrow this being edinburgh the major complaint would be of destruction to the famed flower beds the gates had been forced open by the demonstrators from frederick street a man dressed as a pictish warrior was being dragged by his arms behind the police lines directly in front of the cordon a young mother was calmly changing the diaper on her pinkclad baby a placard was being waved no gods no masters the letters x and sthe baby in pinkthe message on the placardthey all seemed incredibly vivid to her snapshots bright with a significance she couldnt quite determine theres a pattern here some meaning of sorts something to ask dad later fifteen years ago hed tried explaining semiotics to her supposedly helping with a school essay but just getting her more confused then in class shed called it semenotics and her teacher laughed out loud siobhan sought out faces she might know she saw none but one officers vest bore the words police medic she pulled her father toward him id held open in front of her cid she explained this mans wifes been taken to hospital i need to get him there the officer nodded and guided them through the police line which hospital the medic asked whats your guess he looked at her dunno he admitted im down here from aberdeen western generals closest siobhan said any transport available he pointed up frederick street the road that crosses at the top george street he shook his head next one queen street she watched him nod thanks she said you better get back there suppose so he said with no real enthusiasm some of them are going in a bit strongnot our lotthe ones from the met siobhan turned to face her father any chance you can id him who the one who hit mum he rubbed a hand across his eyes i dont think so she made a small angry sound and led him up the hill toward queen street there was a line of parked patrol cars unbelievably there was also traffic all the cars and trucks diverted from the main drag crawling past as if it were just another day another commute siobhan explained to one police driver what she wanted he seemed relieved at the thought of being elsewhere she got into the back with her dad blues and twos she ordered the driver cue flashing lights and siren they pulled past the line of traffic and got going is this the right way the driver shouted where are you from peterborough straight ahead ill tell you when to turn she squeezed her fathers hand youre not hurt he shook his head fixed her with his eyes how about you what about me youre amazing teddy clarke gave a tired smile way you acted back there taking control not just a pretty face eh i never realized there were tears in his eyes again he bit his bottom lip blinked them back she gave his hand a tighter squeeze i never really appreciated he said how good you might be at this just be thankful im not in uniform or it mightve been me wielding one of those batons you wouldnt have hit an innocent woman her father stated straight across at the lights she told the driver before turning her attention back to her father hard to say isnt it we dont know what well do till were there you wouldnt he said determinedly probably not she conceded what the hell were you doing there anyway did santal take you he shook his head i suppose we werewe thought wed be spectators the police didnt see it that way if i find whoever i didnt really see his face plenty of cameras therehard to hide under that sort of coverage photographs she nodded plus security the media and us of course she looked at him the police will have filmed everything but surely what you cant sift through the whole lot want to bet on it he studied her for a moment no im not sure i do almost a hundred arrests the courts would be busy on tuesday by evening the standoff had moved from princes street gardens to rose street cobbles were torn from the road surface becoming missiles instead there were skirmishes on waverley bridge cockburn street and infirmary street by nine thirty things were calming the final bit of trouble had been outside mcdonalds on south st andrew street the uniforms were back at gayfield square now and had brought burgers with them the aroma making its way into the cid suite rebus had the tv playinga documentary about an abattoir eric bain had just forwarded a list of email addresses regular users of beastwatch his email had ended with the words shiv let me know how you got on rebus had tried calling her cell but no one was answering bains email had stipulated that the jensens had given him no grief but had been only grudgingly cooperative rebus had the evening news open beside him on its cover a picture of saturdays march and the headline voting with their feet theyd be able to use the headline again tomorrow with a photo of a rioter kicking at a police shield the tv page gave him the title of the abattoir filmslaughterhouse the task of blood rebus stood up and walked to one of the free desks the colliar notes stared up at him siobhan had been busy theyd been joined by police and prison reports on fast eddie isley and trevor guest guest burglar thug sexual predator isley rapist colliar rapist rebus turned to the beastwatch notes details of twentyeight further rapists and child molesters had been posted there was a long and angry article from someone calling herself tornupinsidefelt to rebus as if the author was female she railed against the court system and its ironclad ruling on rape versus sexual assault hard enough to get a conviction for rape anywaybut sexual assault could be every bit as ugly violent and degrading yet with lesser penalties attached she seemed to know her law hard to tell if she was from north or south of the border he skimmed through the text again looking for burglar or burglarythe term in scotland was housebreaking but all shed used were assault and assailant still rebus decided a reply was merited he logged on to siobhans terminal and accessed her hotmail accountshe used the same password for everything hibsgirl ran a finger down eric bains list until he found an address for tornupinside started typing ive just finished reading your piece at beastwatch it really interested me and i would like to talk to you about it i have some information that you may find interesting please call me on he thought for a moment no way of knowing how long siobhans cell would be out of commission so he typed in his own number instead but signed off as siobhan clarke more chance he felt of the writer replying to another woman he read the message through decided it looked as if it had been written by a cop gave it another go i saw what you said on beastwatch did you know theyve shut the site down id like to talk to you maybe by phone added his number and siobhans namejust her first name this time less formal clicked on send when his phone started trilling only a few minutes later he knew it was too good to be trueand so it proved strawman the voice drawled cafferty think youll ever get fed up of that nickname cafferty chuckled coldly how long has it been maybe sixteen yearsrebus giving evidence cafferty in the dock one of the lawyers confusing rebus for a previous witness called stroman anything to report cafferty was asking why should i tell you another chuckle even colder than the first say you catch him and it goes to courthow would it look if i suddenly piped up that id helped you out lot of explaining to docould even lead to a mistrial i thought you wanted him caught cafferty stayed silent rebus weighed up what to say were making progress how much progress its slow only natural with the city in chaos that chuckle again rebus wondered if cafferty had been drinking i could have pulled off any size heist today and you lot would have been too stretched to notice so why didnt you changed man rebus on your side now remember so if theres anything i can do to help not right now but if you needed me youd ask you said it yourself caffertymore youre involved harder it might be to get a conviction i know how the games played rebus then youll know when its best to miss a turn rebus turned away from the tv a machine was flaying the skin from a carcass keep in touch rebus actually yes there are some cops i could do with talking to theyre english but theyre here for the g so talk to them not so easy they dont wear any insignia run around town in an unmarked car and van why do you want them ill tell you later descriptions i think they might be the met work in a team of three tanned faces meaning theyll stand out from the crowd up here cafferty interrupted leaders called jacko could be working for a special branch guy called david steelforth i know steelforth rebus leaned back against one of the desks how hes put away a number of my acquaintances over the years rebus remembered cafferty had links to the oldschool london mob is he here too staying at the balmoral rebus paused i wouldnt mind knowing whos picking up his room tab just when you think youve seen it all cafferty said john rebus comes asking you to go sniffing around special branchi get the feeling this has got nothing to do with cyril colliar like i said ill tell you later so what are you up to just now working want to meet for a drink im not that desperate me neither just thought id offer rebus considered for a moment almost tempted but the line had gone dead he sat down and drew a pad of paper toward him the sum total of his evenings efforts was listed there grudge against poss victim access to h auchterarderlocal connection whos next he narrowed his eyes at this last line interesting wordingit was the title of a who album another of michaels favorites home to wont get fooled again which they were using these days as the theme on one of those csi showshe felt the sudden urge to talk to someone maybe his daughter or his exwife the tug of family he thought of siobhan and her parents tried not to feel slighted that she hadnt wanted him to meet them she never spoke about them he didnt really know how much family she had because you never ask he chided himself his phone beeped telling him he had a message sender shiv he opened it cn u meet me wgh wgh meant the western general hospital he hadnt heard reports of any police injuriesno reason shed have been in princes street or anywhere near let me know how you got on he tried her number again on his way out to the lot nothing but the busy signal jumped into his car tossing the phone onto the passenger seat it rang before hed gone fifty yards he grabbed at it flipped it open siobhan he asked what a female voice hello gritting his teeth as he tried to steer with one hand is thisi was looking forno never mind the phone died in his hand and he threw it toward the seat next to him it bounced once and hit the floor he wrapped both fists around the steering wheel and hit the accelerator hard there were lines of cars at the forth road bridge neither of them really minded there was plenty to talk about plenty of thinking to be done too siobhan had told rebus all about it teddy clarke would not be budged from his wifes bedside staff had said they could make up a temporary bed for him they were planning to give eve a scan first thing in the morning checking for brain damage the baton had caught her across the top half of her face both eyes swollen and bruised one of them closed altogether her nose covered with gauze not broken rebus had asked was there any danger she could lose her sight maybe in one eye siobhan had admitted after the scan theyll take her to the eye pavilion know what the hardest thing was though john realizing your mums only human hed guessed siobhan had shaken her head slowly they came and questioned her who police well thats something at which shed laughed harshly they werent looking to find out whod hit her they were asking what shed done yes of course because hadnt she been one of the rioters hadnt she been in the vanguard christ rebus had muttered were you there if i had been theredve been hell to pay and a little later just above a whisper i saw it down there john looked hairy judging by the tv police overreacted staring hard at him willing him to contradict her youre angry was all hed said winding down his window for the security check by the time they reached glenrothes hed told her about his own evening warning her that she might get an email from tornupinside she hardly seemed to be listening at the fife police hq they had to show id three times before they could gain entry to operation sorbus rebus had decided not to mention his night in the cellsnot her problem his left hand was back to something like normal at last it had only taken a box of ibuprofen it was a control room much like any other securitycamera pictures civilian staff at computers headsets on maps of central scotland there was a live feed from the security fence at gleneagles cameras posted at each watchtower other feeds from edinburgh stirling the forth bridge and traffic video from the m the highway passing alongside auchterarder night shift had kicked in which meant voices were lowered the atmosphere muted quiet concentration and a lack of hurry no brass that rebus could see and no steelforth siobhan knew one or two faces from her visit of the week before she went to ask her favor leaving rebus to cross the room at his own pace then he too spotted someone bobby hogan had been promoted to dci after a result in a south queensferry shooting but with the promotion had come a move to tayside rebus hadnt seen him for a year or so but recognized the wiry silver hair the way the head sunk into the shoulders bobby he said holding out a hand hogans eyes widened christ john tell me were not that desperate he returned rebuss grip dont worry bobby im only acting as chauffeur hows life treating you cant complain is that siobhan over there rebus nodded why is she talking to one of my officers shes after some surveillance footage thats one thing weve no shortage of what does she want it for a case were working bobbysuspect might have been at that riot today needle in a haystack hogan commented creasing his forehead he was a couple of years younger than rebus but had more lines on his face enjoying being dci rebus asked trying to deflect his friends attention you should try it sometime rebus shook his head too late for me bobby hows dundee treating you ive got quite the bachelor pad i thought you and cora were getting back together hogans face creased further he shook his head vigorously letting rebus know it was a subject best avoided this is quite an ops room he said instead command post hogan said puffing out his chest were in contact with edinburgh stirling gleneagles and if the shit really does hit the fan the g moves to our old stomping groundtulliallan meaning the scottish police college rebus nodded to show he was impressed direct line to special branch bobby hogan just shrugged end of the day john its us in charge not them rebus nodded again this time feigning agreement bumped into some of them all the same steelforth hes strutting around edinburgh like he owns the place hes a piece of work hogan admitted i could put it another way rebus confided but i better notyou two might be bestest pals hogan hooted fat chance see its not just him rebus lowered his voice i had a runin with some of his men theyre in uniform but no badges unmarked car plus a van with lights but no siren what happened i was trying to be nice bobby and lets just say i hit a wall hogan looked at him literally as good as hogan nodded his understanding youd like a few names to go with their faces i cant offer much of a description rebus said apologetically theyd been in the sun and one of thems called jacko i think theyre from the southeast hogan thought for a moment let me see what i can do only if it means you staying under the radar bobby relax john i told you this is my show he placed a hand on rebuss arm as if by way of reassurance rebus nodded his thanks decided it wasnt his job to pierce his friends bubble siobhan had narrowed her search she was only interested in footage from the gardens after all and only within a thirtyminute period even so there would be over a thousand photographs to look at and film from a dozen different viewpoints which still left any securitycamera evidence plus video and stills shot by protesters and onlookers then theres the media shed been told bbc news itv channels and plus sky and cnn not to mention photographers working for the main scottish newspapers lets start with what weve got shed said theres a booth you can use shed thanked rebus for the lift and told him hed best get home shed find a ride back to edinburgh somehow youre staying here all night maybe it wont come to that both knowing it might cafeterias open twentyfourseven and your parents ill head there first thing shed paused if you can spare me well just have to see wont we thanks and shed hugged him not exactly sure why maybe just to feel human the night stretching in front of her siobhanalways supposing you find him what then hell say he was doing his job ill have proof that he wasnt if you push it too hard shed nodded given him a wink and a smile gestures shed learned from him used whenever he was planning on crossing the line a wink and a smile and then she was gone someone had painted a large anarchy symbol on the doors of the c division police hq in torphichen place it was an old crumbling building with twice the atmosphere of gayfield square street sweepers were gathering debris and overtime outside broken glass bricks and stones fastfood cartons the desk sergeant buzzed rebus in some of the canning street protesters had been brought here for processing theyd spent the night in cells cleared for the purpose rebus didnt like to think how many junkies and muggers were roaming the edinburgh streets having been ejected from their rightful lockups the cid room was long and narrow and always had about it the faint musk of human odor something rebus put down to the regular presence of dc ray ratass reynolds he was slouched there now with his feet crossed on the desk in front of him tie undone and a can of beer in his fist at another desk sat his boss di shug davidson davidsons tie was all the way off but he appeared to be still working pounding with two fingers at his computer keyboard the can of beer next to him had yet to be opened reynolds didnt bother to stifle a belch as rebus walked into the room its the specter at the feast he called out in recognition i hear youre about as welcome near the g as the rebel clown army but he raised his can in a toast anyway that cuts to the quick ray been hectic has it we should be on bonuses reynolds held up a fresh beer but rebus shook his head come to see where the action is davidson added just need a word with ellen rebus explained nodding in the direction of the rooms only other occupant ds ellen wylie looked up from the report she was hiding behind her blond hair was cut short with a center parting shed put on some weight since the days when rebus had worked a couple of cases with her her cheeks had filled out and were now flushed something reynolds could not resist referring to by rubbing his hands together and then holding them out in her direction as though warming them at an open fire she was rising to her feet but without making eye contact with the intruder davidson asked if it was anything he should know about rebus just shrugged wylie had lifted her jacket from the back of her chair picked up her shoulder bag i was calling it a night anyway she announced to the room reynolds gave a whistle and nudged the air with his elbow what do you reckon shug nice when love blossoms between colleagues laughter followed her out of the room in the corridor she leaned against the wall and let her head drop long day rebus guessed you ever tried questioning a german anarchosyndicalist not recently all had to be processed tonight so the courts could have them tomorrow today rebus corrected her tapping his watch she checked her own is that really the time she sounded exhausted ill be back here in six hours id offer to buy you a drink if the pubs were still open i dont need a drink a lift home my cars outside she thought for a moment no its notdidnt bring it in today good move considering we were warned not to foresight is a wonderful thing and it means i can give you that lift home after all rebus waited until her eyes met his he was smiling you still havent asked what i want i know what you want she bristled slightly and he raised his hands in surrender easy now he told her dont want you getting all all what walking straight into his punch line torn up inside he obliged ellen wylie shared a house with her divorced sister it was a terrace in cramond the back garden ended in a sheer drop to the river almond the night being mild and rebus needing to smoke they sat at a table outside wylie kept her voice lowdidnt want the neighbors complaining and besides her sisters bedroom window was open she brought out mugs of milky tea nice spot rebus told her i like that you can hear the water theres a stream just over there she pointed into the darkness masks the noise of the planes rebus nodded his understanding they were directly under the flight path into turnhouse airport this time of night it had only taken them fifteen minutes from torphichen place on the way shed told him her story so i wrote something for the web sitenot against the law is it i was just so pissed off at the system we bust a gut to get these animals to court and then the lawyers do their damnedest to get their sentences whittled away to nothing is that all it was shed shifted in the passenger seat what else tornupinsidesounds like it was more personal shed stared through the windshield no john just angrytoo many hours spent on rape cases sexual assault domestic abusemaybe it takes a woman to understand which is why you phoned siobhan back i recognized your voice straight off yes that was particularly devious of you my middle name now seated in her garden with a cold breeze blowing rebus buttoned his jacket and asked about the web site how did she find it did she know the jensens had she ever met with them i remember the case was all she said vicky jensen she nodded slowly did you work on it a shake of the head but im glad hes dead show me where hes buried and ill dance a little jig edward isley and trevor guest are dead too look john all i did was write a bit of a blogi was letting off steam and now three of the men listed on the site are dead a blow to the head and a smack overdose youve worked murders ellenwhat does that mo tell you someone with access to hard drugs anything else she thought for a moment you tell me killer didnt want a facetoface with the victims maybe because they were bigger and stronger didnt really want them to suffer eithera straight ko and then the injection doesnt that sound like a woman to you hows your tea john ellen she slapped a palm against the tabletop if they were listed on beastwatch they were gradea scumbagsdont expect me to feel sorry for them what about catching the killer what about it you want them to get away with it she was staring into the darkness again the wind was rustling the trees nearby know what we had today john we had a war cutanddriedgood guys and bad rebuss thought tell that to siobhan but it isnt always like that is it she went on sometimes the line blurs she turned her gaze on him you should know that better than most number of corners ive seen you cut i make a lousy role model ellen maybe so but youre planning to find him arent you him or her thats why i need to get a statement from you she opened her mouth to complain but he held up a hand youre the only person i know who used the site the jensens have closed it down so i cant be sure what might have been on there you want me to help by answering a few questions she gave a harsh quiet laugh you know ive got court later today rebus was lighting another cigarette why cramond he asked she seemed surprised by the change of subject its a village she explained a village inside a citybest of both worlds she paused has the interview already started is this you getting me to drop my guard rebus shook his head just wondered whose idea it was its my house john denise came to live with me after she she cleared her throat think i swallowed a bug she apologized i was going to say after her divorce rebus nodded at the explanation well its a peaceful spot ill give you that easy out here to forget all about the job the light from the kitchen caught her smile i get the feeling it wouldnt work for you im not sure anything short of a sledgehammer would or a few of those rebus countered nodding toward the row of empty wine bottles lined up beneath the kitchen window he took it slow driving back into town loved the city at night the taxicabs and lolling pedestrians warm sodium glare from the streetlamps darkened shops curtained tenements there were places he could goa bakery a night watchmans desk a casinoplaces where he was known and where tea would be brewed gossip exchanged years back he could have stopped for a chat with the working girls on coburg street but most of them had either moved on or died and after he too was gone edinburgh would remain these same scenes would be enacted a play whose run was never ending killers would be caught and punished others would remain at large the world and the underworld coexisting down the generations by weeks end the g circus would have trundled elsewhere geldof and bono would have found new causes richard pennen would be in his boardroom david steelforth back at scotland yard sometimes it felt to rebus that he was close to seeing the mechanism that connected everything closebut never quite close enough the meadows seemed deserted as he turned up marchmont road parked at the top of arden street and walked back downhill to his tenement two or three times a week he got flyers through his mailbox firms eager to sell his apartment for him the one upstairs had gone for two hundred k add that sort of money to his cid pension and he was as siobhan herself had said on easy street problem was it wasnt a destination that appealed he stooped to pick up the mail from inside the door there was a menu from a new indian takeout hed pin it up in the kitchen next to the others meantime he made himself a ham sandwich ate it standing in the kitchen staring at the array of empty cans on the work surface how many bottles had there been in ellen wylies garden fifteen maybe twenty a lot of wine hed seen an empty tescos bag in the kitchen she probably did a regular recycling run same time she did the shopping say every two weeks twenty bottles in two weeks ten a weekdenise came to stay with me after sheafter her divorce rebus hadnt seen any nighttime insects illuminated against the kitchen window ellen had looked washed out easy to blame it on the days events but rebus knew it went deeper the lines under her bloodshot eyes had taken weeks to accumulate her figure had been thickening for some time he knew that siobhan had once seen ellen as a rivaltwo dses whod have to fight tooth and nail for promotion but lately siobhan had stopped saying as much maybe because ellen didnt look quite so dangerous to her these days he poured a glass of water and took it into the living room gulped it down until only half an inch was left then added a slug of malt to the remainder tipped it back and felt the heat work its way down his throat topped it up and settled into his chair too late now to put any music on he rested the glass against his forehead closed his eyes slept tuesday july the best glenrothes could offer was a lift to the railway station at markinch siobhan sat on the traintoo early yet for the commuter rushand looked out at the passing countryside not that she saw any of it her mind was replaying footage of the riot the same hours of footage she had just walked away from sound and fury swearing and swinging the clatter of hurled objects and the grunts of exertion her thumb was numb from pressure on the remote control pauseslow backslow forwardplay fast forwardrewindpauseplay in some of the still photographs faces had been circledpeople the force would want to question the eyes burned with hatred of course some of them werent demonstrators at alljust local troublemakers ready to rumble smothered in burberry scarves and baseball caps in the us theyd probably be called juvenile delinquents but up here they were neds one of the team bringing her coffee and a chocolate bar had said as much as he stood behind her shoulder neddy the ned from nedtown the woman across from siobhan on the train had the morning paper open the riot had made the front page but so too had tony blair he was in singapore pitching for london to win the olympic bid the year seemed a long way off so did singapore siobhan couldnt believe he was going to make it back to gleneagles in time to shake all those handsbush and putin schröder and chirac the paper also said there was little sign of saturdays hyde park crowd heading north sorry is this seat taken siobhan shook her head and the man squeezed in beside her wasnt yesterday terrible he said siobhan grunted a reply but the woman across the table said shed been shopping in rose street and had only just escaped being caught up in it the two then started trading war stories while siobhan stared out the window again the skirmishes had been just that police tactics had been unchanged go in hard let them know the citys ours not theirs from the footage thered been obvious provocation but theyd been forewarnedno point in joining a demonstration if it didnt make the news anarchists couldnt afford ad campaigns baton charges were their equivalent of free publicity the photos in the paper proved it cops with gritted teeth swinging their clubs rioters defenseless on the ground being dragged away by faceless uniforms all very george orwell none of it got siobhan any closer to finding out who had attacked her mother or why but she wasnt about to give up her eyes stung when she blinked and every few blinks the world seemed to swim out of focus she needed sleep but was wired on caffeine and sugar sorry but are you all right it was her neighbor again his hand was brushing her arm when she blinked her eyes open she could feel the single tear running down her cheek she wiped it away im fine she said just a bit tired thought maybe wed upset you the woman across the table was saying going on about yesterday siobhan shook her head saw that the woman had finished with her paper mind if i no pet you go ahead siobhan managed a smile and opened the tabloid studying the pictures looking for the photographers name at haymarket she lined up for a cab got out at the western general and went straight to the ward her father was slurping tea in the reception area hed slept in his clothes and hadnt managed a shave the bristles gray on his cheeks and chin he looked old to her old and suddenly mortal how is she siobhan asked not too bad due to get the scan just before lunch how about you still havent found the bastard i meant how are you feeling im all right you were up half the night werent you maybe a bit more than half she conceded with a smile her phone beeped not a message just warning her its battery was low she switched it off can i see her theyre getting her ready said theyd tell me when theyd finished hows the outside world ready to face another day can i buy you a coffee she shook her head im swimming in the stuff i think you should get some rest love come see her this afternoon after the tests ill just say hello first she nodded toward the ward doors then youll go home promise the morning news yesterdays arrests were being sent to the sheriff court on chambers street the court itself

suggesting the summit could have been held on one of the north seas many decommissioned oil platforms saving a small fortune in security and making protest marches an interesting proposition rebus finished his coffee and turned down the sound vans were arriving in the police station lot ready to transport prisoners to the court ellen wylie was due in around ninety minutes to make her statement hed tried siobhans cell a couple of times but it went straight to messaging meaning shed switched it off hed called sorbus hq only to be told shed left for edinburgh tried the western general but learned only that mrs clarke has had a comfortable night number of times hed heard that in his lifea comfortable night meaning shes still alive if thats whats worrying you he looked up and saw that a man had entered the cid room help you rebus asked then he recognized the uniform sorry sir weve not met the chief constable said holding out his hand im james corbyn rebus returned the handshake noting that corbyn wasnt a freemason di rebus he said are you working with ds clarke on the auchterarder case thats right sir ive been trying to reach her she owes me an update some interesting developments sir theres a web site set up by a local couple might be how the killer chose his victims youve got names for all three yes sir same mo each time could there be others no way of knowing will he stop at three again sir hard to tell the chief constable was patrolling the room inspecting wall charts desks computer monitors i told clarke she had until tomorrow after that we shut the case down till the g is done and dusted im not sure thats a good idea media havent got hold of it yet no reason we cant sit on it for a few days trails have a way of going cold sir if we give suspects that bit of extra time to get their stories straight youve got suspects corbyn had turned toward rebus not as such sir but there are people were talking to g has to take priority rebus mind if i ask why sir corbyn glared at him because the worlds eight most powerful men are going to be in scotland staying at the countrys best hotel thats the story everyone wants the fact that a serial killer is stalking the central belt might just get in the way dont you think actually sir only one of the victims is from scotland the chief constable walked to within a few inches of rebus dont try to be smart di rebus and dont think i havent dealt with your kind before what kind is that sir the kind that thinks because hes been around awhile he knows better than anyone else you know what they say about carsmore miles on the clock closer they are to being scrapped thing is sir i prefer vintage cars to the stuff theyre churning out today shall i pass your message along to ds clarke i expect youve got better things to be doing with your time off to gleneagles yourself at any point none of your bloody business message received rebus gave the chief constable something that could have been construed as a salute youll shut this thing down corbyn slapped a hand against some of the paperwork on rebuss desk and rememberds clarke is in charge not you inspector his eyes narrowed a little then seeing that rebus wasnt about to reply he stalked out of the room rebus waited the best part of a minute before exhaling then made a phone call mairie any news for me he listened to her apology well never mind ive got a wee bonus here for you if you can manage the price of a cup of coffee multrees walk took him less than ten minutes on foot it was a new development adjacent to the harvey nichols department store and some of the shops were still unrented but the vin caffe was open for snacks and italian coffee and rebus ordered a double espresso and shes paying he added as mairie henderson arrived guess whos covering the sheriff court this afternoon she slid into her seat and thats your excuse for treading water on richard pennen she glared at him john what does it matter if pennen paid for an mps hotel room theres nothing to prove it was cashforcontracts if websters area was arms procurement i might have the beginnings of a story she made an exasperated sound and gave a theatrical shrug of the shoulders anyway im not giving up yet let me talk to a few more people about richard pennen rebus ran a hand across his face its just the way theyre going about protecting him not just pennen actuallyeveryone who was there that night no way were going to get near them you really think webster was given a shove over that wall its a possibility one of the guards thought there was an intruder well if it was an intruder reason dictates it wasnt anyone at the actual dinner she angled her face seeking his agreement when he failed to concede she straightened again know what i think i think all of this is because theres a bit of the anarchist in you youre on their side and it annoys you that youve somehow ended up working for the man rebus snorted a laugh where did you get that from she laughed with him im right though arent i youve always seen yourself as being on the outside she broke off as their coffees arrived dug her spoon into her cappuccino and scooped foam into her mouth i do my best work on the margins rebus said thoughtfully she nodded thats why we used to get along so well until you chose cafferty instead she gave another shrug hes more like you than you care to admit and i was just about to do you this huge favor okay she narrowed her eyes the pair of you are like apples and oranges thats better he handed her an envelope typed by my own fair hands so the spelling might not be up to your own high journalistic standard what is it she was unfolding the single sheet of paper something we were keeping the lid on two more victims same killer as cyril colliar i cant give you everything weve got but thisll get you started christ john she looked up at him what why are you giving me this my latent anarchic streak he pretended to guess it might not even make the front page not this week so any week of the year except this are you checking my gift horses mouth this stuff about the web site she was scanning the sheet for a second time its all kosher mairie if you dont have a use for it he held out his hand to take it back whats a serial kilter is that someone who cant stop making kilts give it back who is it thats pissed you off she asked with a smile you wouldnt be doing this otherwise just hand it over and well say no more but she slid the page back into the envelope and folded it into her pocket if things stay calm for the rest of the day maybe my editor can be persuaded stress the link with the web site rebus advised might help the others on the list be a bit more cautious theyve not been told havent got around to it and if the chief constable gets his way they wont find out till next week by which time the killer could strike again rebus nodded so really youre doing this to save these scuzzballs lives to protect and serve rebus said trying another salute and not because youve had a fallingout with the chief constable rebus shook his head slowly as if disappointed in her and i thought i was the one with the cynical streakyoull really keep looking at richard pennen for a little while longer she waved the sheet of paper at him got to retype all of this first though didnt realize english wasnt your first language siobhan had headed home and run a bath closing her eyes after getting in then waking with a jolt chin touching the surface of the tepid water shed gotten out and changed her clothes ordered a taxi and headed for the garage where her car was ready shed driven to niddrie trusting that lightning wouldnt strike twiceactually three times though shed managed to get the st leonards loaner back to its berth without anyone spotting her if anyone came asking she could always say the damage must have been done in the car lot there was a singledecker bus idling next to the pavement its driver busy with his newspaper a few campers passed siobhan on their way out to it knapsacks bulging they gave sleepy smiles bobby greig was watching them leave siobhan looked around and saw that others were busy dismantling their tents saturday was our busiest night greig explained each day since has been a bit quieter you didnt have to turn people away then his mouth twitched facilities for fifteen thousand and only two could be bothered to show he paused your friends didnt come home last night the way he said it let her know hed worked something out my parents she confirmed and why didnt you want me to know that im not sure bobby maybe i didnt think a cops mum and dad would be safe here so theyre staying with you she shook her head one of the riot police cracked my mum across her face she spent the night in a hospital bed sorry to hear that anything i can do she shook her head again any more trouble with the locals another standoff last night persistent little jerks arent they councilman happened by again and made the truce tench greig nodded he was showing a bigwig around some urban regeneration thing area could use it what sort of bigwig greig shrugged government he ran his fingers over his shaved head this placell be dead soon good riddance to it siobhan didnt ask if he meant the camp or niddrie itself she turned and made for her parents tent unzipped the flap and looked inside everything was intact but with a few additions it looked as if those who were moving out had decided to leave gifts of leftover food candles and water where are they siobhan recognized santals voice she backed out of the tent and straightened up santal too was toting a knapsack and holding a bottle of water heading out siobhan asked bus to stirling i wanted to say goodbye youre off to the peace camp siobhan watched santals braids flex as she nodded were you at princes street yesterday last time i saw your parents whats happened to them someone belted my mum shes in the hospital christ thats hellishwas it she paused one of your lot one of my lot siobhan echoed and i want him caught lucky youre still here why did you get any film i thought maybe i could look at it but santal was shaking her head dont worry siobhan assured her im not looking toits the uniforms im interested in not the demonstration itself but santal kept shaking her head i didnt have my camera a bald lie come on santal surely you want to help plenty of others taking photos she gestured around the camp with an outstretched arm ask them im asking you the bus is leaving she pushed her way past siobhan any message for my mum siobhan called after her shall i bring them to see you at the peace camp but the figure kept moving siobhan cursed under her breath should have known better to santal she was still a pig the filth the cops still the enemy she found herself standing beside bobby greig as the bus filled its door closing with a hiss of air the sound of communal singing came from inside a few of the passengers waved out at greig he waved back not a bad bunch he observed to siobhan offering her a piece of gum for hippies i mean then he slid his hands into his pockets got a ticket for tomorrow night failed in the attempt she admitted my firms doing security she stared at him youve got a spare not exactly but ill be there meaning you could be plus one youre joking right not a date or anythingoffers there if you want it its very generous bobby up to you he was looking everywhere but at her can i take your number let you know tomorrow thinking something better might come up she shook her head work might come up she corrected him everyones allowed a night off ds clarke call me siobhan she insisted where are you rebus asked into the cell on my way to the scotsman whats at the scotsman more photos your phones been switched off i needed to charge it well ive just been taking a statement from tornupinside who i told you yesterday but then he remembered that shed had other things on her mind so he explained again about the blog and how hed sent a message and ellen wylie had called back whoa back up siobhan said our ellen wylie wrote a long and angry piece for beastwatch but why because the systems letting the sisterhood down rebus answered are those her exact words ive got them on tape of course the one thing i dont have is corroboration since there was no one around to assist with the interview sorry about that so is ellen a suspect listen to the tape then you can tell me rebus looked around the cid room the windows needed a clean but what was the point when all they looked down on was the rear parking lot a lick of paint would cheer up the walls but soon be covered by sceneofcrime photos and victim details maybe its because of her sister siobhan was saying what ellens sister denise what about her she moved in with ellen a year or so backmaybe a bit less actually left her partner so her abusive partner that was the story i heard they lived in glasgow police were called in a few times but never got a charge to stick had to get a restraint order on him i think came to live with me after sheafter the divorce suddenly the bug ellen had swallowed made sense i didnt know rebus said quietly no well well what its the sort of thing women talk to other women about but not to men is that what youre saying and were the ones whore supposed to be sexist rebus rubbed his free hand over the back of his neck the skin felt tight so denise goes to live with ellen and next thing ellens on the net looking for sites like beastwatch and staying in at night with her sister overeating drinking too much maybe i could talk to them siobhan suggested havent you enough on your plate how is your mum anyway shes having a scan i was planning to go see her next then do it im assuming you didnt get anything from glenrothes nothing but a sore back theres another call coming in i better go can we meet up later sure thing because the chief constable stopped by sounds ominous but it can wait rebus pushed the button to pick up the next caller di rebus he stated im at the courts mairie henderson said come see what ive got for you there were hoots and cheers in the background got to go she said rebus headed downstairs and hitched a lift in a patrol car neither uniform had been involved in yesterdays running battles backup they explained gloomily sat on a bus for four hours listening to it on the radio you giving evidence inspector rebus said nothing until the car turned into chambers street drop me here he ordered youre welcome the driver informed him in a growl but only after rebus had climbed out the patrol car did a screeching uturn drawing the attention of the media positioned outside the sheriff court rebus stood across the street lighting a cigarette next to the steps of the royal scottish museum another protester was leaving the court building to cheers and whoops from his comrades his fist punched the air as they slapped him on the back press photographers capturing the moment how many rebus asked aware that mairie henderson was standing next to him notebook and tape recorder in hand about twenty so far some of them have been farmed out to other courts any quotes i should be looking out for tomorrow how about smash the system she glanced at her notes or show me a capitalist and ill show you a bloodsucker seems like a fair swap its malcolm x apparently she flipped her notebook shut theyre all being issued restraining orders cant go anywhere near gleneagles auchterarder stirling central edinburgh she paused nice touch though one guy said he had a ticket for t in the park this weekend so the judge said he could go to kinross siobhans going to that rebus said be nice to have the colliar inquiry wrapped up in time in which case this may not be good news what is it mairie the clootie well i got a friend at the paper to do some background and and there are others how many at least one in scotland its on the black isle north of inverness she nodded follow me she said turning and heading for the museums main door inside she took a right into the museum of scotland the place was busy with familiesschool holidays kids with too much energy the smaller ones were squealing and bouncing on their toes what are we doing here rebus asked but mairie was already at the elevators they got off and climbed some stairs through the windows rebus had a great view down onto the sheriff court but mairie was leading him into the farthest corner of the building ive been here before rebus told her the section on death and belief she explained there are some wee coffins with dolls inside this was the very display she stopped at and rebus realized there was an old blackandwhite photograph behind the glass a photo of the black isles clootie well locals have been hanging bits of cloth there for centuries ive got my friend widening the search to england and wales on the offchance think its worth a look black isles got to be a twohour drive rebus mused eyes still on the photo the scraps of material looked almost batlike clinging to thin bare branches next to the photo sat witches casting sticks bits of bone protruding from hollowed pebbles death and belief more like three this time of year mairie was telling him all those rvs to get past rebus nodded the a north of perth was notoriously slow might just get the locals to take a look thanks mairie i got these from the net she handed over a few sheets detailing the history of the clootie well near fortrose there were grainy photographsincluding a copy of the one on displaywhich showed it to be almost identical to its namesake in auchterarder thanks again he rolled the sheets up and put them in his jacket pocket did your editor take the bait they started retracing their steps to the elevator depends a riot tonight might see us relegated to page five a gamble worth taking is there anything else you can tell me john ive given you a scoopwhat else do you want i want to know youre not just using me she pushed the elevator button would i do a thing like that of course you bloody well would they were quiet all the way back out to the steps mairie watched the action across the street another protester another clenchedfist salute youve kept the lid on this since friday arent you scared the killer will go deep cover once he sees it in the paper cant get any deeper than he is right now he looked at her besides all we had on friday was cyril colliar it was cafferty gave us the rest her face hardened cafferty you told him the patch from colliars jacket had turned up he paid me a visit went away with the other two names and came back with the news they were dead youve been using cafferty she sounded incredulous without him telling you mairiethats what im getting at try trading with him youll find its all oneway traffic everything ive given you on the killings he had it first but he wasnt going to tell you you seem to be under some sort of misapprehension that the two of us are close close enough for you to go straight to him with the news about colliar that was a promise of long standingany new developments he wanted to know dont think im about to apologize her eyes narrowed and she pointed across the street whats gareth tench doing here the councilman you mean rebus followed the path of her finger preaching to the heathen maybe he offered watching as tench shuffled along crablike behind the line of photographers maybe he wants you to do another interview how did you know about i suppose siobhan told you no secrets between siobhan and me rebus gave a wink so where is she now shes down at the scotsman my eyes must be deceiving me then mairie was pointing again sure enough it was siobhan and tench had stopped right in front of her the two of them exchanging a handshake no secrets between you two eh but rebus was already on his way this end of the street had been closed to traffic easy enough to cross hiya he said sudden change of mind siobhan gave a little smile and introduced him to tench inspector the councilman said with a bow of his head youre a fan of street theater councilman tench i dont mind it at festival time tench said with a chuckle used to do a bit yourself didnt you tench turned to siobhan the inspector means my little sundaymorning sermons at the foot of the mound doubtless he paused a moment on his way to communion dont seem to see you there anymore rebus added did you lose your faith far from it inspector but there are ways of getting a point across besides preaching his face composed itself into a more serious professionalism im here because a couple of my constituents got caught up in all that trouble yesterday innocent bystanders i dont doubt rebus commented tenchs eyes flitted to him then back to siobhan the inspector must be a joy to work with nonstop laughs siobhan agreed ah and the fourth estate too tench exclaimed holding out a hand toward mairie whod finally decided to join them when is our article running ill assume you know these two guardians of truth he gestured toward rebus and siobhan you did promise me a wee peek at the contents before publishing he reminded mairie did i she was trying to look surprised tench wasnt falling for it he turned to the two detectives i think i need to have a word in private dont mind us rebus told him siobhan and i need a minute too we do but rebus had already turned away leaving her little option but to follow sandy bells will be open he told her once they were out of earshot but she was checking the crowd someone i need to see she explained photographer i knowapparently hes here somewhere she stood on tiptoe ahh pushed her way into the scrum of journalists the photographers were checking the backs of each others cameras examining the digital screens to see what theyd got rebus waited impatiently while siobhan talked to a wiry figure with cropped saltandpepper hair at least he had an explanation now shed gone to the scotsman only to be told that the person she needed to see was right here the photographer took a bit of persuading but eventually followed her back to where rebus was standing with arms folded this is mungo siobhan said would mungo like a drink rebus asked id like that very much the photographer decided wiping a sheen of sweat from his forehead the gray in his hair was prematureprobably wasnt much older than siobhan herself he had a chiseled weatherbeaten face and an accent to match western isles rebus guessed lewis mungo confirmed as rebus led the way to sandy bells there was another cheer from behind them and they turned to see a young man exiting the gates of the sheriff court i think i know him siobhan said quietly hes the one whos been tormenting the campsite bit of respite last night then rebus stated hell have been in the cells as he spoke he realized he was rubbing his left hand with his right when the young man gave a salute to the spectators it was returned by several of the crowd including as a bemused mairie henderson watched councilman gareth tench sandy bells had only been open ten minutes but a couple of regulars had already settled themselves at the bar just a half of best mungo said when asked what he was drinking siobhan wanted orange juice rebus decided he could tackle a pint they sat around a table the bars narrow and shadowy interior smelled of brass polish and bleach siobhan explained to mungo what she wanted and he opened his camera bag lifting out a small white box an ipod siobhan guessed useful for storing pictures mungo explained he showed her how to work it and then apologized that he hadnt captured the whole day so how many photos are on there rebus asked as siobhan demonstrated the small color screen to him using the flywheel to flip to and fro among stills a couple of hundred mungo said ive weeded out the nohopers is it all right if i look at them now siobhan asked mungo just shrugged rebus offered him the pack of cigarettes actually im allergic the photographer warned so rebus took his addiction to the other end of the bar next to the window as he stood there staring out onto forrest road he saw councilman tench walking toward the meadows busy talking with the young man from the court tench was giving his constituents back a pat of reassurance no sign of mairie rebus finished his cigarette and returned to the table siobhan turned the ipod around so he could see its screen my mum she said rebus took the device from her and peered at it second row back he said siobhan nodded excitedly looks like shes trying to get out exactly before she was hit rebus was studying the faces behind the riot shields cops with their visors down teeth bared it seems i failed to capture that particular moment mungo admitted shes definitely trying to push her way back through the crowd siobhan stressed she wanted to get away so why give her a whack across the face rebus asked the way it worked mungo offered enunciating each syllable the leaders would lash out at the police line then retreat chances are anyone left at the front would suffer the consequences picture desks then have to choose what to publish and its usually the riot cops retaliating rebus guessed he held the screen a little farther from his face cant really identify any of the police no id on their epaulets either siobhan pointed out all nice and anonymous cant even tell which force theyre from some of them have letters stenciled above their visorsxs for example could that be a code rebus shrugged he was remembering jacko and his palsno insignia on display there either siobhan seemed to remember something and gave her watch a quick check i need to call the hospital she rose from her seat and headed outdoors another rebus asked pointing at mungos glass the photographer shook his head tell me what else are you covering this week mungo puffed out his cheeks bits and pieces the vips given the chance dont suppose you were working friday night as a matter of fact i was that big dinner at the castle mungo nodded editor fancied a pic of the foreign secretary the ones i got were pretty feeblethats what happens when you aim a flash at a windshield what about ben webster mungo shook his head didnt even know who he was mores the pityit would have been the lastever photo of him we took a few at the morgue if that makes you feel any better rebus said then as mungo smiled a soulful smile i wouldnt mind a look at the ones you did get ill see what i can do theyre not on your little machine then the photographer shook his head that lot are on my laptop its mostly just cars whizzing up castle hillwe werent allowed as far as the esplanade he had a thought you know theyll have taken an official portrait at the dinner itself you could always ask to see that if youre really interested i doubt theyd just hand it over mungo gave a wink leave it to me he said then as he watched rebus drain his glass funny to think itll be back to old clothes and porridge next week rebus smiled and wiped his thumb across his mouth my dad used to say that when we came back from vacation dont suppose edinburgh will ever see anything like this again not in my lifetime rebus conceded think any of it will make a difference rebus just shook his head my girlfriend gave me this book all about the prague spring and the paris riots think we dropped the baton rebus thought to himself i lived through son didnt mean anything at the time he paused or since come to that you didnt tune in and drop out i was in the armyshort hair and an attitude siobhan was returning to the table any news he asked her theyve not found anything shes off to the eye pavilion for some tests and thats that westerns discharged her rebus watched siobhan nod she picked up the ipod again something else i wanted to show you rebus heard the wheel click she turned the screen toward him see the woman at the far right the one with the braids rebus saw mungos camera was focused on the line of riot shields but at the top of the picture hed caught some onlookers most holding camera phones in front of their faces the woman with the braids however was toting some sort of video thats santal siobhan stated and whos santal when shes at home didnt i tell you she was camping next door to my mum and dad funny sort of namereckon she was born with it means sandalwood siobhan told him lovelysmelling soap mungo added siobhan ignored him see what shes doing she asked rebus holding the ipod close to him same as everyone else not exactly siobhan turned the machine toward mungo theyre all pointing their phones toward the police he answered nodding all except santal siobhan angled the screen toward rebus again and rubbed the flywheel with her thumb accessing the next photo see rebus saw but wasnt sure what to make of it mostly mungo obliged they want photos of the policeuseful propaganda but santals photographing the protesters meaning she might have caught your mum rebus offered i asked her at the campsite she wouldnt show me whats more i saw her at that demonstration on saturdayshe was taking pictures then too im not sure i get it rebus admitted me neither but it could mean a trip to stirling she looked at rebus why he asked because thats where she was headed this morning she paused think my absence will be noted chief constable wants the clootie well put on ice anyway he reached into his pocket i meant to say handing her the scrolled sheets weve another clootie well on the black isle its not really an island you know mungo piped up the black isle i mean youll be telling us next its not black either rebus scolded him the soils supposed to be black mungo conceded but not so youd notice i know the spot youre talking about thoughwe had a vacation up there last summer bits of rags hanging from the trees he screwed up his face in distaste siobhan had finished reading you want to take a look she asked rebus shook his head but someone should even when the case is supposed to be on ice not until tomorrow rebus said thats what the chief constable specified but youre the one he put in chargeup to you how we play it he leaned back in his seat the wood creaking in protest eye pavilions five minutes walk siobhan mused i was thinking i might head over there and a wee drive to stirling thereafter think ill pass for a hippie chick might be problematic mungo chipped in ive got a pair of combats in the wardrobe siobhan argued her eyes fixed on rebus means im leaving you in charge john any disturbance you cause ill be the one with the bruises understood boss rebus said now whose round is it but mungo had to get to his next job and siobhan was heading for the hospital leaving rebus alone in the pub one for the road he muttered to himself standing at the bar waiting for his drink to be poured staring at the optics he thought again of that photothe woman with the braidssiobhan called her santal but she reminded rebus of someone screen had been too small for him really to get a good look should have asked mungo for a print day off the barman asked as he placed the pint in front of rebus man of leisure thats me rebus confirmed lifting the glass to his mouth thanks for coming back in rebus said how was court i wasnt needed ellen wylie placed her shoulder bag and attaché case on the floor of the cid room can i fix you a coffee got an espresso machine in here we call it by its proper italian name and whats that a kettle that jokes as weak as i suspect the coffee will be how can i help you john she eased her jacket off rebus was already in shirt sleeves summer and the stations heating was on no apparent means of adjusting the radiators come october theyd be lukewarm wylie was looking at the case notes spread across three desks am i in there she asked not yet but i will be she picked up one of the cyril colliar mug shots held it by its corner as if fearing contamination of some kind you didnt tell me about denise rebus commented i dont remember you asking she had an abusive partner wylies face twisted he was a piece of work was she stared at him all i mean is hes out of our lives youre not going to find bits of him at clootie well a photo of the site was pinned to the wall she studied it angling her head then she turned and cast her gaze around the room got your work cut out john she stated some help wouldnt go amiss wheres siobhan other business he was looking at her meaningfully why the hell should i help you rebus shrugged only one reason i can think ofyoure curious just like you you mean he nodded two killings in england one in scotland im finding it hard to work out how hes choosing them they werent listed together on the sitedidnt know each othercrimes they committed are similar but not identical they chose all sorts of victims all three served time right different jails though all the same word travels excons might talk to other excons pass along the name of a particular sleazeball sex offenders arent liked by other inmates its a point rebus pretended to consider it really he didnt see it but he wanted her thinking youve spoken to the other police forces she asked not yet i think siobhan sent written requests dont you need the personal touch see what they can tell you about isley and guest im a bit swamped ellen their eyes met he could see she was hookedfor the moment you really want me helping she asked youre not a suspect ellen he said trying for sincerity and you know more about all of this than siobhan and me hows she going to feel about me coming on board shell be fine im not so sure about that she thought for a moment then gave a sigh i posted one message on the site john i never met the jensens rebus merely shrugged she took a minute to make the decision they arrested him you knowdenises swallowed back the next word couldnt bring herself to say partner lover man nothing ever came of it what you mean is he was never jailed shes still terrified of him she said quietly and hes still out there she unbuttoned the sleeves of her blouse and started rolling them up okay tell me who i should be calling he gave her numbers for tyneside and lancashire then got on the phone himself inverness sounded disbelieving at first you want us to what rebus could hear a hand unsuccessfully smothering the mouthpiece at the other end edinburgh want us taking snaps o the clootie well we used to go there for picnics when i was a lad the receiver changed hands this is ds johnson who am i speaking to di rebus b division in edinburgh thought you lot had your hands full with all the trots and chairman maos there was laughter in the background that may be so but we also have three murders evidence from all three was found in auchterarder at a local spot known as the clootie well theres only one clootie well inspector apparently not might be that the one youve got up there also has bits of evidence draped over its branches bait the detective sergeant could not refuse few enough moments of excitement in the northern constabulary lets start with photos of the scene rebus went on plenty of closeups and check for anything intactjeans jackets we found a cash card in a pocket best if you can send me the photos as an email if i cant open it somebody here will be able to he looked across to ellen wylie she sat on the corner of a desk skirt straining at the thigh she was playing with a pen as she talked into her receiver your name again ds johnson was asking di rebus im based at gayfield square rebus gave a contact number and his email he could hear johnson writing the information down and if we do have anything up here means our guy has been busy all right with you if i call this in just want to be sure youre not winding me up be my guest my chief constables called james corbynhe knows all about it but dont waste more time than you have to theres a constable here his dad does portraits and graduations doesnt mean to say the constable knows one end of a camera from the other i wasnt thinking of himi was thinking of his dad whatever works rebus said putting down the phone just as ellen wylie was doing the same any luck she asked theyre going to send a photographer if hes not too busy at a wedding or kids birthday how about you the officer in charge of the guest investigation i couldnt speak to him personally but one of his colleagues filled me in theres some additional paperwork on its way to us reading between the lines they werent busting a gut on the case its what they always tell you in trainingthe perfect murder is where nobodys looking for the victim wylie nodded or in this case where no ones grieving they thought maybe it was a drug deal gone wrong now thats original any evidence that mr guest was a user apparently so could have been dealing too owed money for goods and couldnt she saw the look on rebuss face lazy thinking ellen same thing might explain why no one thought to connect the three killings because nobody was trying very hard she guessed rebus nodded slowly well she said you can ask him yourself ask who reason i couldnt talk to the boss is that hes right here here sent to lothian and borders cid she glanced down at her notes hes a detective sergeant name of stan hackman so where can i find him his pal suggested the student residences pollock halls she shrugged picked up the notepad and turned it toward him ive got his cell if that helps as rebus stalked toward her she tore off the sheet and held it out to him he snatched at it get on to whoever led the isley inquiry he said see what you can get from them ill go have a word with hackman you forgot to say thank you then watching him shrug his arms back into the sleeves of his jacket remember brian holmes i used to work with him she nodded he told me once you had a nickname for him used to call him shoeleather because he did all the donkey work donkeys dont wear shoes do they you know what i mean john youre swanning off and leaving me hereits not even my office what does that make me she had picked up the telephone receiver and was waving it as she spoke switchboard maybe he pretended to guess heading for the exit siobhan wouldnt take no for an answer i think teddy clarke said to his wife maybe we should listen to her this time siobhans mother wore a gauze patch over one eye her other eye was bruised and there was a cut to the side of her nose the painkillers seemed to have dulled her resolve she just nodded when her husband spoke what about clothes mr clarke said as they got into the taxi you can go to the camp later siobhan told him bring back what you need wed booked places on the bus for tomorrow he mused as siobhan gave the driver directions to her place she knew he meant one of the protest buses a convoy heading to the g his wife said something he didnt quite catch he leaned closer squeezing her hand and she repeated it for him were still going her husband looked hesitant doctor doesnt see a problem eve clarke went on clearly enough for siobhan to hear you can decide in the morning siobhan said lets concentrate on today first eh teddy clarke smiled at his wife told you shed changed he reminded her when they reached the apartment siobhan paid for the taxi waving aside her fathers offer of money then headed upstairs ahead of her parents checking the living room and bedroom no underwear on the floor or empty smirnoff bottles lying around in you come she told them ill get the kettle on make yourselves at home must be ten years since weve been here her father commented making a little tour of the living room i couldnt have bought the place without your help siobhan called from the kitchen she knew what her mother would be looking for signs of male occupation whole point of giving her money toward the deposit had been to help her get settled that great euphemism steady boyfriend then marriage then kids not a route siobhan had ever managed to start on she took in the teapot and mugs her father rising to help you can pour she told him i just need to sort some things in the bedroom she opened the wardrobe and hauled out her overnight bag tugged open drawers as she considered what she would need with a bit of luck she might not need any of it but it was best to be safe change of clothes toothbrush shampooshe delved to the bottom of a couple of drawers finding the scruffiest leastironed items overalls shed painted the hall in one shoulder strap held on with a safety pin a gauzy cotton shirt that had been left behind by a threenight stand were driving you out her father said he was in the doorway holding a mug of tea toward her theres a trip i have to make nothing to do with the two of you being here i might not be back till tomorrow we could be gone to gleneagles by then might see you there she answered with a wink the pair of you will be all right tonight plenty of shops and places to eat ill leave you a key well be fine he paused this trip is it to do with what happened to your mother might be because ive been thinking what she looked up from her packing youre a cop too siobhan if you keep on with this chances are youll just make enemies its not a popularity contest dad all the same she zipped the bag shut left it on the bed and took the mug from him i just want to hear him say he was wrong she took a sip of the lukewarm tea is that likely to happen she shrugged maybe her father had settled himself on a corner of the bed shes determined to go to gleneagles you know siobhan nodded ill drive you to the camp bring your things back here before i leave she crouched down in front of him pressing her free hand to his knee youre sure youll be all right well be fine what about you nothings going to happen to me dad ive got a force field around me or hadnt you noticed i think i might have caught a glimpse of it in princes street he placed his own hand over hers all the same take care eh she smiled and stood up saw that her mother was watching from the hallway and shared the smile with her too rebus had been to the cafeteria before in term time it was crowded with students many of them just starting at the university looking wary and even downright scared a few years back a secondyear undergraduate had been dealing drugs rebus arrested him over breakfast the students who used the cafeteria brought laptops and ipods with them so that even when busy the place was never noisy except for the trilling of cell phones but today the cafeteria rang with the sounds of harsh raised voices rebus could sense the crackle of testosterone in the air two tables had been put together to form a temporary bar from which small bottles of french lager were being sold the no smoking signs were being disregarded as uniformed officers slapped each other on the back and shared awkward approximations of the american high five stab vests had been removed lined up against one wall and the busy female staff were dishing out plates of fried food redfaced either from exertion or the exaggerated compliments of the visitors rebus was on the hunt for visual clues for some sort of newcastle insignia at the gatehouse hed been directed to an old baronialstyle building behind it where a civilian assistant had found a room number for hackman but rebus had knocked on the door without answer so he had come herethe assistants next suggestion of course he could still be in the field shed cautioned relishing the chance to use the phrase message received and understood rebus had replied helping to make her day even more satisfying there wasnt a single scottish accent in the cafeteria rebus saw uniforms from the met and the london transport police south wales and yorkshirehe decided to buy a mug of tea only to be told there was no charge having heard which he added a sausage roll and mars bar to his purchases asked a table if he could sit with them they shifted to make some room cid one of them guessed sweat had matted the mans hair and his face was flushed rebus nodded realizing he was the only bloke in the place not wearing a white shirt open at the neck there was a smattering of female uniforms too but they were seated together ignoring the various remarks launched in their direction looking for one of my number rebus remarked casually a ds called hackman you from round here then one of the other uniforms asked placing rebuss accent bloody beautiful city youve got shame we had to mess it up a bit his laughter was shared by his colleagues dont know any hackman though hes from newcastle rebus added that lot over there are from newcastle the officer was pointing to a table farther toward the window theyre from liverpool his neighbor corrected him all look the bloody same to me there was more laughter at this where are you from then rebus asked nottingham the first officer replied guess that makes us the sheriffs foods shit though isnt it he was nodding toward rebuss halfeaten sausage roll ive had worseat least its free thats a proper jock talking and no mistake the man laughed again sorry we cant help you find your friend rebus just shrugged were you in princes street yesterday he asked as if making conversation half the bloody day nice bit of overtime his neighbor added we had the same thing a few years back rebus added commonwealth heads of government meeting choggum we called it few of the lads chipped a lump off their mortgages that week mines going toward a vacation the uniform said wife fancies barcelona and while shes there his neighbor said where will you be taking the girlfriend more laughter elbows digging into ribs you earned it yesterday though rebus stated getting them back on track some did came the reply most of us sat on the bus waiting for things to really kick off his neighbor nodded compared to what wed been warned might happen it was a walk in the park photos in the paper this morning at least some of you drew a bit of blood the met boys probably they train against millwall fans so yesterday was nothing special can i try another name on you rebus asked guy called jacko might be with the met they shook their heads rebus decided he wasnt going to get much more so tucked his mars bar into his pocket and rose to his feet told them to take care and went for a wander there were plenty of other uniforms milling about outside if rain hadnt been threatening he suspected theyd be lying on the lawns he overheard nothing approximating a newcastle accent and nothing about giving innocent protesters a good beating he tried hackmans cell but it was still switched off on the verge of giving up he decided to try hackmans room one last time and the door was opened from within ds hackman who the hell wants to know di rebus rebus showed his id can i have a word not in here theres barely room to swing a cat place could do with a bit of fumigating too hang on a sec as hackman retreated into his room rebus made a quick examination clothes strewn everywhere empty cigarette packs girlie mags a personal stereo can of cider sitting on the floor by the bed sound of horse racing from the tv hackman had picked up a phone and lighter patted his pockets till he found his key back out into the hall again outside yeah he suggested leading the way whether rebus liked it or not he was stocky huge neck and closecropped fair hair maybe early thirties the face pitted and pockmarked nose squashed to one side by a brawl too many his white tshirt had suffered too many washes it rode up at the back revealing the top of its owners underpants he wore jeans and sneakers been working rebus asked just back undercover hackman nodded ordinary man in the street any trouble getting in character hackmans mouth twitched local cop thats right i could do with a few tips hackman glanced around at rebus lap bars are on lothian road right there and thereabouts which one should i grace with my hardearned cash im not an expert hackman looked him up and down sure about that he asked they were outside now hackman offered rebus a cigarettereadily receivedand flicked his lighter open leiths got its share of whorehouses too right right and its legalized here we tend to turn a blind eye so long as its kept indoors rebus paused to inhale im glad to see its not all work and no play hackman gave a rasping laugh weve got betterlooking women at home and thats the truth of it your accents not newcastle though grew up near brighton been in the northeast eight years see any action yesterday rebus was making a show of studying the view before themarthurs seat rising skyward is this my debriefing just wondering hackman narrowed his eyes what can i do for you di rebus you worked the trevor guest murder that was two months back plenty more in my inbox since its guest im interested in his trousers have turned up near gleneagles cash card in the pocket hackman stared at him he wasnt wearing any when we found him now you know why killers been taking trophies hackman wasnt slow how many three victims so far two weeks after guest he struck again identical mo and a little souvenir left at the same location bloody hell hackman drew hard on his cigarette we had it down aswell lowlife like guest makes plenty enemies he was a druggie too hence the heroinsending a message it went to the bottom of your inbox rebus watched the big man shrug any leads at all interviewed those who owned up to knowing him traced his last night on earth but didnt come up with any startling conclusions i can have all the paperwork sent already in hand guest was two months back you say he struck again a couple of weeks later hackman watched rebus nod agreement and the other vic three months ago hackman thought it through twelve weeks eight then six what you expect of killers once they get a taste for itthey speed up each new fix satisfies them that bit less than the one before so whats happened between then and now six weeks without another killing sounds unlikely rebus agreed unless weve caught him for something else or hes moved his business elsewhere i like the way you think rebus admitted hackman looked at him youve already figured out everything ive just said havent you thats why i like your thinking hackman gave a scratch to his crotch all ive been thinking about the past few days is pussynow you go and do this to me sorry about that rebus stubbed the remains of his cigarette i wanted to ask if there was anything you could tell me about trevor guestanything that sticks in your mind for the price of a cold beer my head is your oyster problem with oysters rebus considered as they walked to the cafeteria was that you were more likely to get a load of old grit than a pearl the place had quieted a little and they found a table to themselvesthough not before hackman had made an effort to introduce himself to the female officers formally taking each one by the hand lovely he announced as he returned to rebuss table he clapped his palms together and was rubbing them as he sat down bottoms up he said raising his bottle then he gave a little chuckle should be the name of a lapdancing club rebus refrained from revealing that it already was instead he repeated trevor guests name hackman drank half his lager straight off like i said lowlife in and out of jailburglaries selling the stuff hed stolen some other petty stuff and a bit of grievous bodily he was up here for a time few years back kept his nose clean far as we could tell by here you mean edinburgh hackman stifled a belch jockland generallyno offense none taken rebus lied i wonder if theres any way he could have met the third victimclub bouncer called cyril colliar got out of jail three months back name doesnt register want another of these ill get them rebus was halfway out of his chair but hackman waved him back rebus watched as he first approached the womens table asking if they were all right for drinks he made one of them laugh which probably counted as a result in his book he carried four bottles back to the table pissy little things he explained sliding two across toward rebus besides got to spend the loot somehow eh i notice no ones paying for bed and board no one except the local taxpayer hackmans eyes widened i suppose thats you so thanks very much he toasted rebus with a fresh bottle dont suppose youre free tonight to act as the tour guide sorry rebus shook his head id be buyinghard offer for a jock to turn down im turning it down anyway suit yourself hackman said with a shrug this killer youre looking forgot any leads he targets scum maybe gets them from a victimsupport web site vigilante eh meaning someone with a grudge thats the theory clever money would say the connections to the first victim should have been the beginning and end but he caught the bug rebus nodded slowly having considered the same conclusion fast eddie isley attacker of prostitutes isleys killer maybe a pimp or boyfriendtracked isley using beastwatch then asked himself a questionwhy stop with just one how hard do you really want to find this guy hackman asked thats what id be wrestling withsounds like hes on our side you dont believe people can change all three victims had served their sentences no sign of reoffending youre talking about redemption hackman mimed the act of spitting could never stand that goodygood bullshit he paused what are you smiling at its a line from a pink floyd song is it i could never stand them either a bit of tamla or stax songs to seduce the chicks by our trev was a bit of a ladies man trevor guest liked them a bit on the young side judging by the girlfriends we dug up hackman snorted believe me if theyd been any younger wedve been using a nursery school and not an interview room he enjoyed this joke so much he found it hard to take his next slug of lager i like my meat a bit more mature he said finally smacking his lips seeming lost in thought a lot of the escorts in the back of your local paper they call themselves mature too how old do you figure that makes them i mean im not one for geriatrics guest attacked a babysitter didnt he rebus asked broke into a house happened to find her there on the couch far as i remember all he wanted was a blow job she hollered and he scampered he offered a shrug rebuss chair scraped against the floor as he stood up i need to be going he said finish your drink im driving something tells me you might get away with a misdemeanor or two this week still waste not want not hackman slid the untouched bottle toward himself what about a pint later on i need a sherpa to show me the way rebus ignored him kept walking back in the fresh air he risked a glance through the window saw hackman doing a little improvised shuffle as he headed toward the women the socalled camp horizon on the edge of stirling sandwiched between a soccer field and a trading estate reminded siobhan of some of the temporary encampments shed seen around the greenham common air base in the s when shed hitched there as a teenager to protest about nuclear missiles there werent just tents here but elaborate wigwams and structures made of osiers resembling willow igloos canvases had been strung between the trees daubed with rainbows and peace signs smoke was rising from campfires and there was the pungent scent of cannabis in the air solar panels and a small wind turbine seemed to be providing electricity for strings of multicolored lightbulbs a trailer was supplying legal advice and free condoms while discarded leaflets provided additional information on everything from hiv to third world debt she had been stopped at five separate checkpoints on the route from edinburgh despite her showing id one security man had even insisted she open the trunk of her car these people have all kinds of sympathizers hed explained theyre well on their way to getting another siobhan had muttered in response the inhabitants of the camp seemed to have split into distinct tribes with the antipoverty contingent remaining separate from the hardcore anarchists red flags seemed to be acting as a border between the two oldtime hippies formed another subgroup one of the wigwams their epicenter beans were cooking on a stove while a makeshift sign announced reiki and holistic healing between the hours of five and eight with special rates for unwagedstudents siobhan had asked one of the guards at the entrance about santal hed shaken his head no names no problems hed looked her up and down mind a word of warning what you look like a cop working undercover shed followed his eyes is it the overalls hed shaken his head again the clean hair so shed ruffled it a bit without seeming to convince him anyone else in there undercover bound to be hed said with a smile but im not going to spot the good ones am i her car was parked in the city center if worse came to the worst shed sleep in the car rather than under the stars the site was a lot bigger than the one in edinburgh the tents more densely grouped as dusk encroached she had to watch out for tent pegs and guy ropes twice she passed a young man with a straggly beard who was trying to interest people in herbal relaxation third time their eyes met lost somebody he asked friend of mine called santal he shook his head not a great one for names so she gave a brief description he shook his head again if you just sit and chill maybe shell come to you he held out a readyrolled joint on the house only available to new customers she guessed even the forces of law and order need to relax at days end she stared at him for a moment im impressed is it the hair the bag doesnt help he commented what you really want is a muddy backpack that thingindicating the guilty itemmakes you look like youre off to the gym thanks for the advice you werent scared i might want to bust you he shrugged you want a riot go right ahead she gave a brief smile maybe another time this friend of yours any chance she might have been part of the advance guard depends what you mean he had paused to light the joint inhaling deeply then exhaling and speaking at the same time stands to reason therell be blockades from first light your lot trying to stop us getting near the hotel he offered her a hit but she shook her head youll never know till you try he teased believe it or not i was a teenager onceso the advance guard headed out of here earlier ordnance survey maps in hand only the ochil hills between us and victory crosscountry in the dark isnt that a bit risky he offered a shrug then drew on the joint again a young woman was hovering nearby get you anything he asked her the transaction took half a minute a tiny shrinkwrapped package for three tenpound notes cheers the woman said then to siobhan evening officer she was giggling as she left them the dealer was looking at siobhans overalls i know when im beaten she admitted so take my advice sit and chill for a while you might find something you didnt know you were looking for he stroked his beard as he spoke thatsdeep siobhan told him her tone letting him know she was thinking the exact opposite youll see he retorted moving past her into the gloom she walked back to the fence and decided to phone rebus he didnt pick up so she left a message hi its me im in stirling no sign of santal ill see you tomorrow but if you need me in the meantime feel free to call an exhausted but excitedlooking group was entering the compound siobhan snapped shut her phone and moved to within earshot of them as they were met by some of their comrades heatseeking radardogs armed to the teeth man american accentsmarines if you ask meno id chopperssearchlights had us for dead tracked us halfway back to base camp then the questions started how close did they get any weak points in the security did they reach the fence was anyone still out there we split up submachine guns i figure werent messing split into ten groups of threeeasier to lie low state of the art more questions flew at them siobhan started counting heads stopped at fifteen meaning a further fifteen were still out on the ochils somewhere in the hubbub she launched her own question wheres santal a shake of the head didnt see her after we split up one of them had unfolded a map to show how far theyd gotten he had a flashlight strapped to his forehead and was tracing the route with a muddied finger siobhan squeezed closer its a totalexclusion zone has to be a weak spot force of numbers thats all weve got well be ten thousand strong by morning herbal cigarettes for all our brave soldiers as the dealer started handing them out there were bursts of laughter from the crowda release of tension siobhan retreated to the back of the throng a hand grasped her arm it was the young woman whod bought from the dealer earlier pigs better get wings she hissed siobhan glared at her or what the young woman offered a malevolent smile or i might have to squeal siobhan said nothing just hoisted her bag and backed away the young woman waved her off the same guard was on duty at the gate did the disguise hold he asked with something just shy of a smirk all the way back to her car siobhan tried to think of a comeback rebus had acted the gentleman returned to gayfield square bearing cup noodles and chicken tikka wraps youre spoiling me ellen wylie said as he switched on the kettle you also get first choicechicken and mushroom or beef curry chicken she watched him peel open the plastic containers so how did it go i found hackman and he wanted a tour of the fleshpots yuck i told him i couldnt oblige and in return he told me very little we dont already know or couldnt have guessed shed come over to join rebus at the kettle picked up one of the wraps and examined its sellby date july halfprice she commented i knew youd be impressed but theres even more he produced the mars bar from his pocket and handed it over so what news of edward isley again theres more paperwork coming north she said but the di that i spoke to was one of the brighter lights on the tree recited most of it from memory let me guess no shortage of enemiessomeone with a grudgekeeping an open mindno progress to report just about sums it up wylie admitted i got the impression a few stops had been left unpulled nothing to connect fast eddie to mr guest she shook her head different prisons no sign of shared associates isley didnt know newcastle and guest hadnt been hanging around carlisle or the m and cyril colliar probably knew neither of them bringing us back to their shared appearance on beastwatch wylie watched rebus pour water onto the noodles he offered her a spoon and they stirred their individual pots have you spoken to anyone at torphichen he asked told them you were shorthanded ratass probably hinted we were involved in a bunkup how well you know dc reynolds she said with a smile by the way some jpegs arrived from inverness that was quick he watched as she logged on at the computer the photos appeared as thumbnails but wylie enlarged each one it looks just like auchterarder rebus commented photographer got some closeups wylie said bringing them up on screen tattered remnants of cloth but none of it looking recent what do you think she asked i dont see anything for us do you no she agreed one of the phones started ringing she picked up and listened send him up she said replacing the receiver guy called mungo she explained says he has an appointment more of an open invitation rebus said sniffing the contents of the wrap hed just opened wonder if he likes chicken tikka mungo did indeed and demolished the gift in two huge bites while rebus and wylie examined the photographs you work fast rebus said by way of thanks what are we looking at ellen wylie asked friday night rebus explained a dinner at the castle ben websters suicide rebus nodded thats him there he said tapping one of the faces mungo had been as good as his word not just his own snatched shots of the motorcade and its passengers but copies of the official portraits lots of welldressed smiling men shaking hands with other welldressed smiling men rebus recognized only a few the foreign secretary defense secretary ben webster richard pennen how did you get these rebus asked openly available to the mediajust the sort of pr opportunity the politicos like got any names to put to the faces thats a job for a subeditor the photographer said swallowing the last of the wrap but i dug out what i could he reached into his bag and pulled out sheets of paper thanks rebus said ive probably already seen them but i havent wylie said taking them from mungo rebus was more interested in the photos from the dinner i didnt realize corbyn was there he mused whos he when hes at home mungo asked our esteemed chief constable mungo looked to where rebus was pointing didnt stay long he said sifting through his own prints here he is leaving again i was just packing up so how long was that after it all kicked off not even half an hour id been biding my time in case of latecomers richard pennen hadnt made it into any of the official portraits but mungo had snapped his car as it entered the compound pennen caught unawares mouth agape it says here ellen wylie piped up ben webster helped try to negotiate a truce in sierra leone also visited iraq afghanistan and east timor racked up a few air miles mungo commented and liked a bit of adventure she added turning a page i didnt realize his sister was a cop rebus nodded met her a few days back he paused for a moment funerals tomorrow i think i was supposed to be calling her then he went back to studying the official photographs theyd all been posed leaving little for him to glean no têteàtêtes caught in the background nothing these powerful men didnt want the world to see just like mungo said a pr exercise rebus picked up the phone and called mairie on her cell any chance you could drop in to gayfield he asked her he could hear the clacking of her keyboard need to polish this off first half an hour ill see what i can do theres a mars bar riding on it wylies face showed her displea sure rebus ended the call and watched wylie unwrap the chocolate and bite into it bang goes my bribe rebus told her ill leave these with you mungo was saying brushing flour from his fingers theyre yours to keep anywaybut not for publication our eyes only rebus agreed he spread out the photos of the various backseat passengers most were blurred the result of vehicles refusing to slow for the photographer a few of the foreign dignitaries were smiling however perhaps pleased to be noticed and can you give these to siobhan mungo added handing over a large envelope rebus nodded and asked what they were the princes street demonstration she was interested in the woman on the edge of the crowd ive managed to zoom in a little rebus opened the envelope the young woman with braided hair held her own camera to her face santal was that what she was called meaning sandalwood rebus wondered if siobhan had run the name past operation sorbus the face seemed focused on its job the mouth a thin line of concentration dedicated maybe a professional in other snaps she was holding the camera away from her looking to left and right as if on the lookout for something totally uninterested in the array of riot shields not scared of the flying debris not excited or in awe just doing her job ill see she gets them rebus told mungo as the photographer strapped his bag shut and thanks for these i owe you mungo nodded slowly maybe a tipoff next time youre first at a scene seldom happens son rebus warned him but ill keep it in mind mungo shook both officers hands wylie watched him leave youll keep him in mind she echoed bugger is ellen at my time of life the memorys not what it was rebus reached for the noodles only to find theyd gone cold good as her word mairie henderson turned up within the half hour her look turning sour as she saw the mars bar wrapper on the desk dont blame me rebus apologized holding up his hands thought you might like to see this she said unfolding a printout of the next mornings front page we got lucky no big stories police probe g murder mystery plus photos of the clootie well and gleneagles hotel rebus didnt bother reading the text what was it you were just saying to mungo wylie teased rebus ignored her focusing instead on the dignitaries care to enlighten me he asked mairie she took a deep breath and started reeling off names government ministers from countries as diverse as south africa china and mexico most had trade or economic portfolios and when mairie wasnt sure she placed a call to one of the papers pundits who set her straight so we can assume they were talking about trade or aid rebus asked in which case what was richard pennen doing there or our own defense minister come to that you can trade in weapons too mairie reminded him and the chief constable she shrugged probably invited as a courtesy this man here she tapped one of the portraits hes mr genetic modification ive seen him on tv arguing with the environmentalists were selling genetics to mexico rebus wondered mairie shrugged again you really think theyre covering something up why would they do that rebus asked as though surprised by her question because they can ellen wylie suggested these men are cleverer than that pennens not the only businessman on display she pointed to two other faces banking and airlines they got the vips out of there in a hurry rebus said once websters body was discovered standard procedure id think mairie answered rebus slumped into the nearest chair pennen doesnt want us sticking our oars in and steelforths been trying to give me a good smack what does that tell you that any publicity is bad publicitywhen youre trying to trade with some governments i like this guy wylie said coming to the end of the webster notes im sorry now hes dead she looked at rebus you going to the funeral thinking about it another chance to rub pennen and special branch the wrong way mairie guessed paying my respects rebus countered and telling his sister that were getting nowhere hed picked up one of mungos closeups from princes street gardens mairie was looking at them too way i hear it she said you guys went over the top we went in hard wylie said sounding prickly few dozen hotheads versus a few hundred riot police and who is it gives them the oxygen of publicity wylie sounded ready for the fight you and your billy clubs mairie countered if there was nothing to report we wouldnt report it but its the way the truth can be twisted wylie realized that they had lost rebus he was staring at one photograph in particular eyes narrowed john she said when the name had no effect she nudged him care to back me up here im sure you can fight your own battles ellen whats wrong mairie asked peering over his shoulder at the tableau you look like youve seen a ghost in a manner of speaking rebus said he picked up the phone but thought better of it let it clatter back into its cradle again after all he said tomorrow is another day not just another day john mairie reminded him its when everything finally kicks off and heres hoping london doesnt get the olympics wylie added well be hearing about it from now till doomsday rebus had risen to his feet still seemingly distracted beer time he stated and im buying i thought youd never ask mairie sighed wylie went to fetch her jacket and bag rebus was leading the way not leaving that mairie hinted nodding at the photo he still held in his hand he glanced down at it then folded it into his pocket patted his other pockets before resting his palm on mairies shoulder im a bit short as it happens any chance of a loan later that evening mairie henderson returned to her murrayfield home she owned the top two floors of a detached victorian pile and shared the mortgage with her boyfriend allan problem was allan was a tv cameraman and she saw precious little of him at the best of times this week was turning out to be pure murder one of the spare bedrooms was now her office and she made straight for it throwing her jacket over the back of a chair the coffee table didnt have room for even a single mug of the stuff covered as it was with piles of newsprint her own cuttings files took up a whole wall and her precious few journalism awards were framed above the computer she sat down at her desk and wondered why she felt so comfortable in this cramped and stuffy room the kitchen was airy but she spent very little time there the living room had been swamped by allans home cinema and stereo this roomher officewas hers and hers alone she looked at the racks of cassette tapesinterviews shed done each one encapsulating a life caffertys story had demanded more than forty hours of conversation the transcripts stretching to a thousand pages the resulting book had been compiled meticulously and she knew she deserved a bloody medal for it not that one had been forthcoming that the book sold by the truckload had done nothing to alter the flat fee shed signed up for and it was cafferty who appeared on the talk shows cafferty who did the bookstore signings the festivals the circuit of celebrity parties in london when the book had gone into its third printing theyd even changed the jacket magnifying his name and shrinking hers bloody nerve and when she saw cafferty these days all he did was tease her with the notion of a further installment hinting that he might get another writer this time roundbecause he knew damned well she wouldnt allow herself to be conned in the same way what was the old saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me bastard she checked for emails thinking back to the drink shed just had with rebus she was still annoyed with him annoyed that he hadnt given her an interview for the cafferty book without him it had been caffertys word alone on so many events and incidents so yes she was still annoyed with rebus annoyed because she knew hed been right to refuse her fellow journalists thought shed probably cleaned up on the cafferty book some had stopped talking to her or answering her calls jealousy doubtless played a part but they also felt they had nothing to offer her work had dried up she found herself scratching around penning pieces about councillors and charity workershuman interest stories with very little interest editors sounded surprised that she needed the work thought youd cleaned up on cafferty naturally she couldnt tell them the truth so she made up lies instead about needing to keep her hand in cleaned up her few remaining copies of the cafferty book were stacked beneath the coffee table shed stopped handing them out to family and friends stopped after watching cafferty share a joke with a daytime tv host the audience lapping it up mairie feeling grubbier than ever but when she thought about cafferty she couldnt help picturing richard pennen toogladhanding at prestonfield house cosseted by yesmen buffed to a spotless sheen rebus had a point about the edinburgh castle dinner it wasnt so much that an arms dealer of sorts had found himself at the top table but that no one had taken any notice pennen had said that anything hed given to ben webster would have been declared in the register of members interests mairie had checked and it looked as though the mp had been scrupulous it struck her now that pennen had known she would look hed wanted her looking into websters affairs but why because hed known there was nothing for her to find or to tarnish a dead mans name i like this guy ellen wylie had said yes and after a few minutes chat with westminster insiders mairie had started to like him too which only made her trust richard pennen all the less she fetched a glass of tap water from the kitchen and settled again at her computer decided to start from scratch typed richard pennens name into the first of her many search engines rebus was three steps away from the tenement door when the voice called his name inside the pockets of his coat his fingers curled into fists he turned to face cafferty hell do you want cafferty wafted a hand in front of his nose i can smell the booze from here i drink to forget people like you wasted your money tonight then cafferty gave a flick of his head something i want to show you rebus stood his ground a moment till curiosity got the better of him cafferty was unlocking the bentley gesturing for rebus to get in rebus opened the passenger door and leaned inside where are we going nowhere deserted if thats whats worrying you point of fact place were going will be packed the engine roared into life with two beers and two whiskeys under his belt rebus knew his wits werent going to be the sharpest nevertheless he got in cafferty offered chewing gum and rebus unwrapped a stick hows my case going cafferty asked doing just fine without your help as long as you dont forget who put you on the right track cafferty gave a little smile they were heading east through marchmont hows siobhan shaping up shes fine hasnt left you in the lurch then rebus stared at caffertys profile how do you mean i heard she was spreading herself a bit thin are you keeping a watch on us cafferty just smiled again rebus noticed that his own fists were still clenched as they rested on his lap one tug of the steering wheel and he could put the bentley into a wall or slide his hands around caffertys fat neck and squeeze thinking evil thoughts rebus cafferty guessed im a taxpayer remembertopbracket at thatwhich makes me your employer must give you a warm glow it does that mp who jumped from the rampartsmaking headway whats it to you nothing cafferty paused a couple of beats its just that i know richard pennen he turned toward rebus pleased by the visible effect of this statement met him a couple of times he continued please tell me he was trying to sell you some iffy weapons cafferty laughed he has a stake in the firm that published my book meant he was at the launch party sorry you couldnt make it by the way invite came in handy when the toilet paper ran out met him again over lunch when the book hit fifty thousand private room at the ivy he glanced at rebus again thats in london i thought of moving there you know used to have a lot of friends down south business acquaintances same ones steelforth put away rebus thought for a moment why didnt you tell me you knew pennen too there have to be some secrets between us cafferty said smiling i ran a check on your pal jacko by the waydidnt get anywhere you sure hes a cop rebus answered with another question of his own what about steelforths bill at the balmoral picked up by lothian and borders police thats generous of us you never let up do you rebus why should i because sometimes you just have to let things go whats past is another countrymairie told me that when we were doing the book i just had a drink with her and not grape juice by the smell of it shes a good kid shame shes got your claws in her back the car was heading down dalkeith road cafferty signaling left toward craigmillar and niddrie either that or they were heading for the a south out of the city where are we going rebus asked again not far now and mairies quite capable of looking after herself does she pass everything along probably not but that doesnt stop me asking her see what mairie really needs is another bestseller this time shed push for a percentage rather than a set fee i keep tempting her with stories that didnt make it into the bookthe girl needs to keep me happy more fool her its funny cafferty went on but talking about richard pennen reminds me of a few tales about him too not that youd want to hear them he started chuckling again his face lit from below by the dashboard he seemed all shadows and smudges a preparatory sketch for some grinning gargoyle im in hell rebus thought this is what happens when you die and go downstairs you get your own personal devil salvation awaits cafferty cried suddenly turning the steering wheel hard so that the bentley slalomed through a set of gates sending gravel flying skyward it was a hall lights glowing within a hall attached to a church time to renounce the demon drink cafferty teased shutting off the engine and pushing open his door but a sign next to the open doorway told rebus this was a public meeting part of g alternativescommunities in action the future crisis averted entry was free to students and the unwaged unwashed more like cafferty muttered seeing the bearded figure holding a plastic bucket the man had long curly black hair and wore prescription glasses with thick black frames he shook the bucket as the new arrivals approached there were coins inside but not many cafferty made a ritual of opening his wallet and extracting a fiftypound note better be going to a good cause he warned the collector rebus followed him indoors pointing out to the bucket holder that his share could come out of caffertys contribution there were three or four rows of empty chairs at the back but cafferty had made the decision to stand arms folded and legs apart the room was busy but the audience looked bored or maybe just lost in contemplation up on the stage four men and two women were squeezed behind a trestle table sharing a single distortionprone microphone there were banners behind them stating craigmillar welcomes g protesters and our community is strong when we speak with one voice the one voice speaking at that particular moment belonged to councilman gareth tench its all very well he boomed out saying give us the tools and we will do the job but there need to be jobs there in the first place we need concrete proposals for the betterment of our communities and thats what im striving for in my own small way there was nothing small about the councilmans delivery a hall this size someone like tench barely needed a microphone in the first place hes in love with his own voice cafferty commented rebus knew it was true it had been the same when hed stopped to watch tench deliver his sermons on the mound he hadnt shouted to be heard hed shouted because the noise confirmed for him his own importance in the world but friendscomrades tench continued without seeming to draw breath were all prone to see ourselves as cogs in the vast political machine how can we be heard how can we make a difference well think about it for a moment the cars and buses you used when you traveled here tonightremove just one small cog from the engine and the machinery breaks down because every single moving part has equal worthequal importanceand thats as true in human life as it is with the infernal congestion engine he paused long enough to smile at his own pun preening little prick cafferty muttered to rebus he couldnt love himself any better if he was doublejointed and giving himself a blow job rebus was powerless to prevent the sudden choking laugh that escaped him he tried camouflaging it as a cough but to little avail some in the audience had turned in their seats to seek out the commotions cause even tench had been pulled up short what he saw from the stage was morris gerald cafferty patting the back of detective inspector john rebus rebus knew hed been recognized despite the hand he was holding over his mouth and nose tench put off his stride worked hard to regain the momentum of his speech but some of his previous forcefulness had evaporated into the night he handed the microphone to the woman next to him who emerged from her trancelike state and started reciting in a monotone from the copious notes in front of her cafferty passed in front of rebus and stepped outside after a moment rebus followed cafferty was pacing the parking lot rebus lit a cigarette and bided his time till his nemesis was standing before him i still dont get it rebus admitted flicking ash from the cigarette cafferty shrugged and youre supposed to be the detective a clue or two would help cafferty stretched out his arms this is his territory rebus his little fiefdom but hes getting itchy planning to expand you mean tench rebus narrowed his eyes youre saying hes the one muscling in on your turf mr fire and brimstone himself cafferty lowered his arms so that his hands slapped his thighs as if placing a period on the proceedings i still dont get it cafferty glared at rebus the thing is he sees nothing wrong with shouldering me aside because hes got righteousness on his side by controlling the illicit he makes it a force for good cafferty gave a sigh sometimes i think thats how half the globe operates its not the underworld you should be watchingits the overworld men like tench and his ilk hes a councilman rebus argued i mean they may take the occasional bribe cafferty was shaking his head he wants power rebus he wants control see how much he loves being able to make his speeches the stronger he is the more talking he can doand be listened to so set some of your thugs on him make sure he gets the message caffertys eyes bored into him thats your best shot is it rebus shrugged this is between you and him im owed a favor youre owed the square root of fuckall good luck to him if he takes you out of the game rebus flicked the remains of the cigarette to the ground and crushed it beneath his heel you sure about that cafferty asked quietly you sure youd rather have him running the show man of the peopleman with political clout think hell be an easier target than me but then youre just shy of retirementso maybe its siobhan we should be thinking of what is it they say cafferty angled his head upward as if the words were somewhere up there better the devil you know he declared rebus folded his arms you didnt bring me here to show me gareth tench he said you did it to show me to himthe two of us side by side you patting me on the backa nice little portrait we must have made you want him to think im in your pocket and the rest of cid with me cafferty tried to look hurt by the accusation you overestimate me rebus i doubt that you could have told me all this back in arden street but then youd have missed the show aye and so would councilman tench tell me hows he going to finance this takeover and where are the soldiers to back him up cafferty stretched his arms out again this time spinning degrees he owns this whole districtthe bad as well as the good and the money hell talk his way into the money rebus its what he does best i do talk a good game its true both men turned to see gareth tench standing in the doorway illuminated from behind and im not easily scared caffertynot by you not by your friends rebus was about to protest but tench hadnt finished im cleaning up this area no reason i cant do the same job elsewhere in the city if your pals in the force wont put you out of business the community might have to rebus noted the two thickset men standing farther back in the doorway on either side of tench lets go he suggested to cafferty last thing he wanted was to step in between cafferty and a beating all the same he knew hed have to step in his hand was on caffertys arm the gangster shrugged him off ive never fought a battle and lost cafferty warned tench think about that before you start i dont need to do anything tench shot back your little empires turning to dust time you woke up to the fact having trouble recruiting bouncers for your pubs cant find tenants for your deathtrap apartments taxi firm short a few drivers a smile was spreading across tenchs face youre in the twilight zone cafferty wake up and smell the coffin cafferty started to spring forward rebus grabbed him just as tenchs men pushed past their boss rebus turned cafferty so his own back was facing the door he gave the gangster a shove toward the bentley get in and get going he ordered never lost a battle cafferty was raging face puce but he yanked open the door and dumped himself into the drivers seat as rebus walked around to the passenger side he looked toward the doorway tench was waving a gloating goodbye rebus wanted to say something if only to let tench know he wasnt caffertys manbut the councilman was already turning away leaving his minions to monitor proceedings im going to rip his fucking eyeballs out and make him suck them like jawbreakers cafferty was snarling flecks of saliva pocking the inside of the windshield and if he wants concrete fucking proposals ill mix the cement myself before i whack him with the shovelnow thats betterment of the community cafferty stopped talking as he maneuvered out of the lot but his breathing remained fast and noisy eventually he turned toward his passenger i swear to god when i get my hands on that prick his knuckles were white as they wrapped themselves around the steering wheel but if you do say anything rebus intoned which may be used against you as evidence in a court of law theyd never convict cafferty roared with a wild laugh forensics will have to scoop up whats left of him with a teaspoon but if you do say anything rebus repeated it started three years back cafferty said making an effort to control his breathing gaming licenses refused bar applications refusedi was even going to open a cab office on his turf take a few of the locals off the dole he made sure the council bounced me out every time so its not just that youve finally met someone with the guts to stand up to you cafferty glanced at rebus i thought that was your job maybe it is eventually cafferty broke the resulting silence i need a drink he said licking his lips the corners of his mouth were coated with white flecks good idea rebus told him like me maybe youll drink to forget he kept watching cafferty during the rest of the silent ride back into town the man had killed and gotten away with itprobably more times than rebus knew hed fed victims to the hungry pigs on a borders farm hed ruined countless lives served four jail terms hed been a savage since his teenage years served an apprenticeship as enforcer to the london mob so why the hell was rebus feeling sorry for him ive got some thirtyyearold malt at the house cafferty was saying butterscotch and heather and melted butter drop me in marchmont rebus insisted what about that drink but rebus shook his head im supposed to be renouncing it remember cafferty snorted but said nothing all the same rebus could tell the man wanted him to change his mind wanted them to have that drink together sitting opposite each other as the night circled them on tiptoe cafferty wouldnt insist though insisting would sound like begging he wouldnt beg not just yet it struck rebus that what cafferty feared was a loss of power tyrants and politicians alike feared the selfsame thing whether they belonged to the underworld or the overworld the day would come when no one listened to them anymore their orders ignored reputation diminished new challenges new rivals and predators cafferty probably had millions stashed away but a whole fleet of luxury cars was no substitute for status and respect edinburgh was a small city easy for one man to exert control over the greater part of it tench or cafferty cafferty or tench rebus couldnt help wondering if he would have to choose the overworld everyone from g leaders to pennen and steelforth all of them driven by the will to power a chain of command affecting every person on the planet rebus was still thinking about it as he watched the bentley drive away but then he became aware of a shadowy figure standing next to his tenement door he clenched his fists and looked around in case jacko had brought his buddies but it wasnt jacko who stepped forward it was hackman evening all he said i nearly took a swing at you then rebus replied relaxing his shoulders how the hell did you find me couple of phone calls is all it took very helpful the local cops must say though i wouldnt have thought a street like this was your style so where am i supposed to live dockside condo hackman stated is that right nice young blond thing to cook you breakfast on weekends i only see her on weekends do i rebus couldnt help smiling thats all the time you can give her clean out the old pipes and then its back to the daily grind youve got it all worked out doesnt explain what youre doing here this time of night couple of bits and pieces ive remembered about trevor guest and theyre mine for the price of a drink rebus guessed hackman nodded but theres got to be a floor show mind a floor show chicks youve got to be joking but rebus could tell from hackmans face that he was quite quite serious they hailed a cab on marchmont road and headed for bread street the driver gave a little smile into his rearview two middleaged men with a few drinks under their belts heading for the fleshpots so tell me rebus said what hackman asked the info on trevor guest but hackman wagged a finger if i tell you now whats to stop you jumping ship my word as a gentleman rebus offered hed had enough for tonight no way he was embarking on a lapdance crawl of lothian road hed get the info then leave hackman curbside point him in the right direction all the hippies are shipping out tomorrow you know the englishman said busloads heading for gleneagles what about you hackman shrugged i do what im told well im telling you to cough up what you know about guest okay okayso long as you promise not to beat it as soon as the taxi stops scouts honor hackman leaned back in the seat trevor guest had a short fuse made a lot of enemies headed south to london once but it didnt work out ripped off by some tart or otherseemed to take against the fairer sex after that you said trev ended up on some web site beastwatch any idea who posted his details they did it anonymously but trev was predominantly a burglara burglar with a temperthats why he went into the clink so so who put him on the web siteand why you tell me hackman gave another shrug gripping on to the handrail as the taxi made a sharp turn one more story he said checking he had rebuss attention when trev went to london rumor was that a consignment of tasty drugs went with himcould even have been smack he was an addict occasional user i dont think he injecteduntil the night he died that is did he rip someone off could be seeim wondering if theres a connection youre not getting and what connection might that be smalltime villains maybe getting too big for their boots or ripping off those they shouldnt rebus was thoughtful the edinburgh victim worked for our local mobster hackman clapped his hands together there you are then i suppose eddie isley might have had but he broke off unconvinced the taxi was pulling to a stop the driver telling them it would be a fiver rebus realized that they were directly outside the nook one of the citys more respectable lapdance bars hackman had jumped out and was paying the cabbie through the passengerside windowa sure sign he was a visitor locals paid up from the backseat rebus considered his options stay in the cab or get out and tell hackman he was calling it a night the door was still open the englishman gesturing impatiently rebus got outjust as the door of the nook burst open a man staggering from its darkened interior the two doormen were right behind him im telling you i didnt touch her the man was protesting he was tall well dressed and darkskinned rebus seemed to know the blue suit from somewhere bloody liar one of the doormen yelled stabbing a finger at the customer she robbed me the suit was protesting her hand was trying to extract my wallet from my jacket it was only when i stopped her that she started to complain another bloody lie the same doorman spat hackman had given rebus a dig in the ribs you dont half know some classy joints john but he seemed happy enough the other doorman was talking into his wrist microphone she was attempting to take my wallet the suit kept arguing so she didnt rob you then given the chance she most certainly did she rob you you swore blind a minute ago that she did and ive got witnesses to prove it the doormans head twitched toward rebus and hackman the customer turned toward them and recognized rebus straight off my friend do you see the situation i am in sort of rebus was forced to admit the suit was shaking his hand we met at the hotel yes at that delicious lunch hosted by my good friend richard pennen i wasnt at lunch rebus reminded him we chatted in the hallway you do get around john hackman chuckled giving rebuss ribs another dig this is a most unfortunate and serious situation the suit was saying i felt myself to be thirsty and entered what i assumed would be a tavern of some description both doormen gave a snort yeah the angrier of the two said after wed told you the admission charge even hackman had to laugh at that but he was cut off by the door swinging open again this time it was a woman who emerged one of the dancers obviously dressed in bra gstring and high heels her hair was piled atop her head and she was wearing too much makeup says i mugged him does he she roared hackman looked as though hed found the best ever ringside seat were handling it the angry doorman said staring daggers at his partner whod obviously passed the accusation along he owes me fifty for the dances the woman shouted she had a hand stretched out ready to collect payment then he starts pawing me right out of order a marked patrol car cruised past faces inside staring out rebus saw its brake lights come on and knew it would be doing a uturn i am a diplomat the suit was declaring i have a right to protection from false allegations swallowed a dictionary and all hackman commented laughing to himself legal immunity the suit went on as a member of the kenyan delegation the patrol car had stopped two officers climbing out fixing their caps to their heads seems to be the trouble here the driver asked just escorting this gentleman from the premises the nolongerangry doorman said i was forcibly removed the kenyan protested and almost robbed of my wallet also calm down sir lets get this sorted out the uniform had turned toward rebus aware of movement from the corner of his eye rebuss badge shoved into his face i want these two taken to the nearest copshop rebus stated no need for that the doorman began to argue you want to go with them pal rebus demanded shutting him up which copshops that then the uniform asked rebus stared at him where you from hull rebus made an exasperated sound west end he said its on torphichen place the uniform nodded near haymarket yeah thats the one rebus confirmed diplomatic immunity the kenyan was stressing rebus turned to him theres a necessary procedure he explained trying to find words long enough to satisfy the man you dont want me the woman was saying pointing to her ample breasts rebus didnt dare look at hackman fearing hed be salivating afraid i do rebus told her gesturing to the uniforms client and dancer were ushered toward the patrol car one in the front one in the back the driver told his partner the dancer looked at rebus as she clacked past him on her heels hang on he said removing his jacket and slipping it over her shoulders then he turned to hackman i need to see to this he explained like your chances eh the englishman leered dont want a diplomatic incident rebus corrected him will you be okay never better hackman confirmed slapping rebus on the back im sure my friends heremaking sure the doormen could hear himwill waive their entry fee for an officer of the law just one thing stan rebus cautioned whats that then dont let your hands wander the cid suite was deserted no sign of ratass reynolds or shug davidson easy enough to secure two interview rooms easy to get a couple of uniforms on overtime to act as babysitters glad of the business one of them said first the dancer rebus took her a plastic cup of tea i even remember how you like it he told her molly clark sat with arms folded still wearing his jacket and not much else she was shuffling her feet face twitching might have let me get changed she complained giving a loud sniff afraid youll catch a cold dont worry a car will run you back in five minutes she looked at him eyes rimmed with kohl cheeks rouged youre not charging me what with our friends not going to want to pursue it trust me its me should be pursuing him whatever you say molly rebus offered her a cigarette theres a no smoking sign she reminded him so there is he agreed lighting up she hesitated another moment go on then took the cigarette from him leaned across the table so he could light it for her he knew her perfume would be clinging to his jacket for weeks she inhaled and held the smoke deep within her when we came to see you on sunday rebus began eric was a bit shaky when it came to explaining how you met i think i can guess now bully for you she was examining the cigarettes glowing tip her body rocked a little and rebus realized she was pumping one knee up and down so he knows what you do for a living rebus asked is it any business of yours not really well then another drag on the cigarette as if drawing nourishment from it the smoke billowed into rebuss face no secrets between eric and me fair enough she finally made eye contact he was touching me up and as for that line about me grabbing his wallet she snorted different culture same shit she calmed a little thats why eric means something rebus nodded his understanding its our kenyan friend whos in trouble not you he assured her really she gave him that wide smile again same as on sunday the whole dreary room seemed to brighten for an instant erics a lucky man youre a lucky man rebus told the kenyan interview room ten minutes later the nook was sending a car for mollya car and some clothes shed promised to leave rebuss jacket at the stations front desk my name is joseph kamweze and i have diplomatic immunity then you wont mind showing me your passport joseph rebus held out his hand if youre a diplomat itll say so i do not have it with me where are you staying the balmoral now theres a surprise room paid for by pennen industries mr richard pennen is a good friend to my country rebus leaned back in his chair hows that then in matters of trade and humanitarian assistance he sticks microchips into weapons i do not see the connection what are you doing in edinburgh joseph i am part of my nations trade mission and what part of your job description took you into the nook tonight i was thirsty inspector and maybe a wee bit horny i am not sure what it is that you are trying to insinuate i have already told you that i have immunity and i couldnt be happier for you tell me do you know a british politician called ben webster kamweze nodded i met him one time in nairobi at the high commission youve not seen him this trip i did not have a chance to talk with him the night his life ended rebus stared at him you were at the castle indeed yes you saw mr webster there the kenyan nodded i thought it unnecessary to speak with him on that occasion as he would be joining us for lunch at prestonfield house kamwezes face fell but then this great tragedy unfolded before our eyes rebus tensed how do you mean please do not misunderstand i only say that his fall was a great loss to the international community you didnt see what happened no one did but perhaps the cameras were of some assistance security cameras rebus felt like slapping himself across the head the castle was an army hqof course thered be cameras we were given a tour of the control room it was impressively technical but then terrorism is an everyday threat is it not inspector rebus didnt answer for a moment whats everyone saying about it he eventually asked im not sure i understand kamwezes brow had furrowed the other missionsthat little league of nations i saw you with at prestonfieldany rumors about mr webster the kenyan shook his head tell me does everyone feel as warmly toward richard pennen as you seem to again inspector i do not think i kamweze broke off and rose hurriedly to his feet the chair toppling behind him i would like to leave now something to hide joseph i feel you have brought me here under false pretenses we could go back to the real onesstart discussing your little oneman delegation and its factfinding tour of edinburghs lapdancing bars rebus leaned forward resting his arms on the table these places have cameras too joseph theyll have you on tape immunity im not talking about charging you with anything joseph im talking about the folks back home im assuming youve got family in nairobimum and dad maybe a wife and kids i want to leave now kamweze slammed a fist down on the table easy there rebus said holding up his hands thought we were having a nice wee chat here do you wish a diplomatic incident inspector im not sure rebus seemed to ponder the notion do you i am outraged another thump on the table and the kenyan headed for the door rebus did nothing to stop him instead he lit a cigarette and lifted his legs onto the table crossing them at the ankles stretched back and stared at the ceiling naturally steelforth hadnt said anything about cameras and rebus knew hed have a hell of a time persuading anyone to hand over the footage it was owned by the military and sited within the militarystrictly out of rebuss jurisdiction which wouldnt stop him raising the issue a minute passed before there was a knock at the door and a constable appeared from behind it our african friend says he wants a car back to the balmoral tell him the walk will do him good rebus ordered and warn him about getting thirsty again sir the constable thought he must have misheard just tell him yes sir oh and one more thing what no smoking in here rebus turned his head and stared the young officer out when the door had closed he reached into his trouser pocket for his cell pushed the buttons and waited to be connected mairie he said got some information you might be able to find a use for side three no gods no masters wednesday july most of the g leaders touched down at prestwick airport southwest of glasgow in all nearly one hundred and fifty aircraft would land in the course of the day the leaders their spouses and their closest personnel would then be transferred to gleneagles by helicopter while fleets of chauffeured cars conveyed other members of the various delegations to their eventual destinations george bushs sniffer dog had its own car today was bushs fiftyninth birthday jack mcconnell first minister of the scottish parliament was on the tarmac to greet the world leaders there were no visible protests or disruptions not at prestwick but in stirling morning tv news showed masked protesters hitting out at cars and vans smashing the windows of a burger king blocking the a attacking gas stations in edinburgh demonstrators halted all traffic on queensferry road lothian road was lined with police vans a chain of uniformed officers protecting the sheraton hotel and its several hundred delegates police horses paraded down streets usually busy with the morning rush hour but today devoid of traffic buses lined the length of waterloo place ready to convey marchers north to auchterarder but there were mixed signals no one very sure that the official route had been sanctioned the march was off then on then off again police ordered the bus drivers not to move their vehicles until the situation could be verified one way or the other and it was raining looked like the final push concert that evening might be a washout the musicians and celebrities were at murrayfield stadium busy with sound checks and rehearsals bob geldof was at the balmoral hotel but preparing to visit gleneagles with his friend bono always supposing the various protests would let them through the queen was on her way north too and would host a dinner for the delegates the news journalists sounded breathless wired on doses of caffeine siobhan having spent a night in her car was getting by on watery coffee from a local bakers the other customers had been more interested in the events unfolding on the wallmounted tv set behind the counter thats bannockburn one of them had said and theres springkerse theyre everywhere circle the wagons her friend had advised to a few smiles the protesters had left camp horizon as early as two in the morning literally catching the police napping cant understand how those bloody politicians can tell us this is good for scotland a man in painters overalls had muttered waiting for his bacon roll to arrive ive got jobs in dunblane and crieff today christ knows how im supposed to get there back in her car siobhan was soon warmed by the heater though her spine remained creaky her neck tight shed stayed in stirling because going home would have meant coming back this morning with the same security rigmarolemaybe even worse she washed down two aspirin and headed for the a she hadnt made much progress along the twolane highway when the flashers on a car ahead told her both lanes were at a dead stop drivers had emerged from their vehicles to shout at the men and women in clown costumes who were lying in the road some chained to the central medians crash barriers police were chasing other garish figures through the adjoining fields siobhan parked on the hard shoulder and walked to the head of the line where she showed her id to the officer in charge im supposed to be in auchterarder she told him he waved his short black baton in the direction of a police motorcycle if archies got a spare helmet he can have you there in two shakes archie produced the necessary helmet youre going to be bloody cold on the back mind he warned ill just have to snuggle up then wont i but as he accelerated away the word snuggle suddenly didnt fit siobhan was clinging to him for dear life there was an earpiece inside her helmet allowing her to listen in on messages from operation sorbus around five thousand demonstrators were descending on auchterarder preparing to march past the gates of the hotel futile siobhan knew theyd still be hundreds of yards from the main building their slogans evaporating on the wind inside gleneagles the dignitaries would have no scent of any march any largescale dissent protesters were heading across country from all directions but the officers on the other side of the security cordon were prepared leaving stirling siobhan had noticed fresh graffiti on a fastfood outlet pharaohs six billion slaves she was still trying to work out who was meant to be who archie braked suddenly tipping her forward so she could see over his shoulder the scene unfolding ahead riot shields dog handlers mounted police a twinengined chinook helicopter scything the air overhead flames licking from an american flag a sitdown protest stretching the full width of the roadway as officers started breaking it up archie gunned the bike toward the gap and squeezed through if siobhans knuckles hadnt been rigid and numb with cold she might have eased her grip on him long enough to offer a pat on the back the earpiece was telling her that stirling railway station might reopen shortly but anarchists could be using the line as a shortcut to gleneagles she remembered that the hotel boasted its own railway station doubted anyone would be using it today there was better news from edinburgh where torrential rain had dampened the demonstrators spirits archie turned his head toward her scottish weather he yelled what would we do without it the forth road bridge was operating with minimal disruption and early road blocks on quality street and corstorphine road had been cleared archie slowed to negotiate another blockade siobhan taking the opportunity to wipe drizzle from her visor with the sleeve of her jacket as they signaled to turn off the highway another smaller helicopter seemed to be following their progress archie brought his bike to a stop end of the line he said they hadnt quite reached the towns boundary but she could see he was right ahead of them past a police cordon flew a sea of flags and banners chants whistles and jeers bush blair cia how many kids did you kill today same chant shed heard at the naming of the dead george bush we know you your daddy was a killer too okay so that was a new one siobhan eased herself from the pillion handed over the helmet and thanked archie he grinned at her wont get too many days as exciting as this he said turning the bike around speeding off he gave her a wave siobhan waved back some of the feeling returning to her fingers a redfaced cop bounded up to her she already had her id open which only makes you more of a bloody idiot he barked you look like one of them he stabbed a finger in the direction of the stalled demonstration they see you behind our lines theyll think thats where they belong too so either make yourself scarce or get suited up youre forgetting she told him there is a third way and with a smile she walked up to the police line squeezed between two of the blackclad figures and ducked under their riot shields she was now in the front line of demonstrators the redfaced officer looked aghast show your badges a protester was calling out to the police rank siobhan stared at the cop immediately in front of her the thing he was wearing looked almost like coveralls the letters zh were painted in white on his helmet above the visor she tried to remember if any of the squad from princes street gardens boasted the same insignia all she could remember was xs police excess sweat was running down both sides of the officers face but he seemed composed orders and encouragement were being called down the police line keep it tight easy lads move it back there was an element of agreed orchestration to the pushing on both sides one of the demonstrators seemed to be in control calling out that the march was official and the police were now in breach of all agreements he could not he said be responsible for the consequences throughout he held a cell phone to his ear while news photographers stood on tiptoe cameras held aloft to capture some of the drama siobhan started backpedaling then shuffled sideways until she was on the edge of the proceedings from this vantage point she started scanning the crowd for any sign of santal there was a teenager next to her with bad teeth and a shaved head when he started yelling abuse the accent sounded local his jacket flapped open at one point and siobhan caught a glimpse of something tucked into his waistband something not unlike a knife he had his cell phone out using it to capture snippets of video sending them to his buddies siobhan looked around no way she could alert the police officers if they waded in to arrest him all hell would break loose instead she squeezed in behind him waiting for the right moment when a chant broke out and hands rose into the air she seized her chance grabbed his arm and wrenched it around his back pressing forward so he was sent down onto his knees her free hand went to his waist removed the knife then pushed him hard so he fell on all fours she moved backward briskly through the crowd tossing the knife over a low wall into shrubbery melted into the crowd and raised her own arms into the air clapping along his face was purple with anger as he elbowed his way through the throng in front of her seeking out his attacker he wasnt going to find her siobhan almost allowed herself a smile but knew her own search might well prove every bit as fruitless as his and meantime she was in the middle of a demonstration one that could at any moment turn into a riot id kill for a starbucks latte she thought wrong place and very definitely the wrong time mairie was in the foyer of the balmoral hotel the elevator door opened and she saw the man in the blue silk suit appear she got up from her chair and he walked toward her holding out his hand mr kamweze she asked he gave a bow of confirmation and she returned his handshake good of you to see me on short notice mairie said trying not to sound too gushing her phone call had been just that the cub reporter overawed to be talking to such a senior figure in african politicsand could he possibly spare five minutes to help with a profile she was doing the pose was no longer necessary he was right there in front of her all the same she didnt want him bolting just yet tea he suggested leading the way to the palm court i love your suit she said as he drew out her chair for her she smoothed her skirt beneath her as she sat joseph kamweze seemed to enjoy the view thank you he said sliding onto the banquette opposite her is it designer purchased in singapore on my way back from a delegation to canberra really rather inexpensive he leaned toward her conspiratorially but lets keep that to ourselves he gave a huge grin showing one gold tooth at the back of his mouth well i want to thank you again for seeing me mairie was reaching into her bag for notebook and pen she also had a little digital recorder and she asked him if he would mind that will be dependent on your questions he said with another grin the waitress arrived and he ordered lapsang souchong for both of them mairie hated the stuff but kept her mouth shut you must let me pay she told him he waved the offer aside it is of no consequence mairie raised an eyebrow she was still busying herself with the tools of her trade when she asked her next question your trips being funded by pennen industries the grin disappeared the eyes hardened i beg your pardon she tried for a look of unsullied naïveté just wondered who was paying for your stay here what is it you want the voice was chilled his hands brushed the edge of the table the fingertips running along it mairie made a show of consulting her notes you are part of the kenyan trade delegation mr kamweze what exactly is it that youre looking for from the g she checked that the recorder was running and placed it on the table between them joseph kamweze seemed thrown by the sheer ordinariness of the question debt relief is crucial to africa s rebirth he recited chancellor brown has indicated that some of kenya s neighbors he broke off unable to keep going why are you here is henderson even your real name im a fool for not asking to see your identification ive got it right here mairie began to rummage through her bag why did you mention richard pennen kamweze interrupted she blinked at him i didnt liar i did mention pennen industries but thats a company not an individual you were with the policeman at prestonfield house it sounded like a statement though he could have been guessing either way she didnt deny it i think you should go now he stated are you sure about that her own voice had hardened and she returned his stare because if you walk away from here im going to splash a photo of you across the whole front page of my newspaper you are being ridiculous its a bit grainy and well need to blow it up meaning it might be on the fuzzy side too but it will show a pole dancer cavorting in front of you mr kamweze youll have your hands on your knees and a big smile on your face as you stare at her naked chest her names molly and she works at the nook on bread street i took possession of the securitycamera tape this morning lies all lies but she loved the effect they were having on him his fingernails were digging into the tabletop his closecropped hair glistened with sweat you were then questioned at a police station mr kamweze i daresay theres footage of that little expedition too what is it you want from me he hissed but he had to compose himself as the tea tray arrived and with it some shortbread biscuits mairie bit into one no breakfast this morning the tea smelled like ovenbaked seaweed and she pushed her cup aside after the waitress had poured the kenyan did the same with his not thirsty she asked and couldnt help smiling the detective told you kamweze realized he too threatened me like this thing is he cant prosecute me on the other handwell unless you give me a good reason to dump a frontpage exclusive she could see he hadnt yet taken the bait a front page that will be seen around the worldhow long till the press in your own country picks up the story and runs with it how long till your government masters get to hear of it your neighbors friends enough he growled his eyes were focused on the table it was highly polished throwing his own reflection back at him enough he repeated and his tone told her he was beaten she bit into another of the biscuits what do you want not much really she assured him just everything you can tell me about mr richard pennen am i to be your deep throat miss henderson if the thought excites you she offered thinking to herself but really youre just another dupe who got caughtanother flawed civil servant another informer his second funeral in a week hed crawled out of the citydomino effect from earlier at the forth bridge fife constabulary were pulling over trucks and vans checking their potential as barricades once over the bridge however traffic was fine he was early as a result drove into the center of dundee parked by the waterfront and smoked a cigarette with the radio tuned to news funny the english stations were on about london s olympic bid hardly a mention of edinburgh tony blair was jetting back from singapore rebus pondered whether he got frequentflier miles the scottish news had picked up on mairies story everyone was calling him the g killer chief constable james corbyn was making no public statements on the subject so was stressing that there was no danger to the leaders gathering at gleneagles two funerals inside a week he wondered if one reason that he was working so hard was so he wouldnt have time to think too much about mickey hed brought a cd of quadrophenia with him played some of it on the drive north daltrey rasping the insistent question can you see the real me he had the photos on the passenger seat edinburgh castle dinner jackets and bow ties ben webster with about two hours to live looking no different from anyone else but then suicides didnt wear signs around their necks neither did serial killers gangsters bent politicians beneath all the official portraits was mungos closeup of santal and her camera rebus studied it for a moment before placing it on top then he started the car and headed for the funeral home place was packed family and friends plus representatives from all the political parties labor msps too the media kept their distance huddled at the gates probably the office juniors sourfaced with the knowledge that their elders and betters were busy at the g capturing thursdays headlines and front pages rebus hung back as the real guests were ushered indoors some of them had looked at him quizzically thinking it unlikely hed been a man with any connection to the mp taking him for some kind of vulture preying on the grief of strangers maybe they were right at that a hotel in broughty ferry was providing refreshments afterward the family the reverend was telling the assembly have asked me to say that youll all be most welcome but his eyes told another story close family and bosom friends only please quite right too rebus doubted any hotel in the ferry could cope with a crowd this size he was seated in the back row the reverend had asked one of ben websters colleagues to step up and say a few words sounded much like the eulogy at mickeys funeral a good manmuch missed by those who knew him and many diddevoted to his familywell liked in the community rebus reckoned hed given it long enough there was no sign of stacey he hadnt really thought much about her since that meeting outside the morgue he guessed shed gone back to london or else was clearing out her brothers home dealing with the banks and insurers and such but to miss the funeral there had been more than a week between mickeys death and his cremation and ben webster not even five full days could the haste be classed as indecent stacey websters decision or someone elses outside in the parking lot he lit another cigarette and gave it five more minutes then he unlocked the drivers side and got in can you see the real me oh yes he said quietly turning the ignition mayhem in auchterarder the rumor had gone around that bushs helicopter was on its way siobhan had checked her watch knowing he wasnt due to arrive at prestwick till midafternoon every chopper that came over the crowd booed and bayed theyd streamed down lanes and through fields clambered over walls into peoples gardens one aim in mind get to the cordon get past the cordon that would be the real victory no matter if they were still half a mile from the actual hotel they would be on the gleneagles estate they would have beaten the police she saw a few members of the clown army and two protesters dressed in plus fours and carrying golf bags the peoples golfing association whose mission was to play a hole on the hallowed championship course she had heard american accents spanish voices germans she had watched a huddle of blackclad facemuffled anarchists planning their next move an airship droning overhead gathering surveillance but no santal back on auchterarders main street news had arrived that the edinburgh contingent was being prevented from leaving the city so theyre marching there instead someone explained gleefully bullyboys are going to be stretched to breaking siobhan doubted it all the same she tried her parents cell her father answered said theyd been sitting on the bus for hours and were still there promise me you wont join any march siobhan implored promise her father said then he put his wife on so siobhan could hear the same pledge from her as she ended the call siobhan suddenly felt like an utter idiot what was she doing here when she could be with her parents another march meant more riot cops could be her mother would recognize her attacker or something might nudge a nugget of remembrance to the surface she cursed herself quietly then turned and was face to face with her quarry santal she said the young woman lowered her camera what are you doing here santal asked surprised just a little yes are your parents theyre stranded in edinburgh i see your lisps improved what monday in the gardens siobhan went on you were busy with your little camera only thing is you werent zeroing in on the cops why is that im not sure i know what youre getting at but santal glanced to the left and right as if afraid they would be overheard reason you didnt want to show me any of your photos is that they would tell me something like what she sounded neither scared nor wary but genuinely curious theyd tell me you were interested in your fellow rabblerousers rather than the forces of law and order so so i got to wondering why that might be it should have come to me earlier everyone said so after allat the niddrie camp and then again in stirling siobhan had taken a step closer the two women nose to nose she leaned in toward santals ear youre undercover she whispered then she stood back as if admiring the young womans getup the earrings and piercingsmostly fake she guessed temporary tattoos andstaring at the coils of haira nicely made wig why you bothered with the lisp ive no ideamaybe to help you retain a sense of your own identity she paused how am i doing santal just rolled her eyes a phone was ringing and she searched her pockets bringing out two the screen on one was lit up she studied it then stared over siobhans right shoulder gangs all here she said siobhan wasnt sure what she meant oldest trick in the book but she turned and looked anyway john rebus standing there with a phone in one hand and what looked like a business card in the other im not sure of the etiquette he commented coming closer if i light up something thats a hundred percent tobacco does that make me a slave to the evil empire he shrugged and brought out the pack of cigarettes anyway santal here is a plant siobhan explained to him this just might not be the safest place to announce that fact santal hissed tell me something i dont know siobhan snorted i think i can oblige rebus said but his eyes were on santal beyond the call of duty he told her skipping your own brothers funeral she glared at him you were there he nodded i have to admit though i stared and stared at the photo of santal and it still took an age to dawn on me ill take that as a compliment you should i wanted to be there you know what sort of excuse did you give only at this point did siobhan butt in youre ben websters sister the penny drops rebus commented ds clarke meet stacey webster rebuss eyes were still on stacey but im guessing we should keep calling you santal bit late for that now stacey replied as if on cue a young man with a red bandanna around his forehead started toward them everything cool here just catching up with an old friend rebus warned him you look like pigs to me his eyes shifted between rebus and siobhan hey i can handle it santal was back in character the strong woman able to fight her own battles she stared the young man down if youre sure he was already retreating as she turned back toward rebus and siobhan she became stacey again you cant stay here she stated im due to be relieved in an hourwe can talk then where she considered for a moment inside the security fence theres a field behind the hotel thats where the drivers hang out wait for me there siobhan looked at the crowds surrounding them and how exactly do we get there stacey offered a sour smile show some initiative i think rebus explained shes telling us to get ourselves arrested it took rebus a good ten minutes to push his way to the front of the throng siobhan tucking herself in behind him with his body pressed to a scratched and scrawled riot shield rebus palmed his id against the seethrough reinforced plastic level with the cops eye line get us out of here he mouthed the cop wasnt falling for it called out instead for his boss to decide the redfaced officer appeared over the cops shoulder recognized siobhan straight off she was trying to look suitably chastened the officer gave a sniff then an order the cordon of shields opened a fraction and hands hauled at rebus and siobhan the noise level rose perceptibly on the other side of the line show them your id the officer ordered rebus and siobhan were happy to oblige the officer held a megaphone in front of him and let the crowd know no arrests had been made when he identified rebus and siobhan as police detectives a huge jeer went up all the same the situation seemed to be easing i should put you on report for that little escapade he told siobhan were murder squad rebus lied fluently there was someone we needed to talk towhat else could we do the officer stared at him but suddenly found himself with more pressing concerns one of his men had fallen over and the protesters were aiming to exploit this breach in the barricade he barked out orders on his megaphone and rebus gestured to siobhan that maybe they should make themselves scarce van doors were opening more cops spilling out to provide backup on the front line a medic asked siobhan if she was okay im not injured she told him a small helicopter was sitting on the road rotor blades turning rebus got into a crouch and went to talk to the pilot then waved siobhan across he can take us to the field the pilot was nodding from behind mirrored sunglasses not a problem he called out in an american accent thirty seconds later they were installed and the machine was rising into the air whipping up dust and litter below it rebus whistled a bit of wagnera nod to apocalypse nowbut siobhan ignored him hard to hear anything which didnt stop her asking rebus what hed told the pilot she read his lips as he replied murder squad the hotel was a mile to the south from the sky it was easy to make out the security fence and the watchtowers thousands of acres of deserted hillside and pockets of demonstrators being corralled by black uniforms im not allowed to go near the hotel itself the pilot was yelling a missile would have us down if i did he sounded serious and he took a wide arc around the hotels security fence there were lots of temporary structures probably to shelter the worlds media satellite dishes on the tops of anonymouslooking vans television or maybe the secret service rebus could make out a track that led from a large white canopy toward the security fence the field had been reduced to stubble and someone had spraypainted a giant letter h to let the chopper know where to land their flight had taken only a couple of minutes rebus shook the pilots hand and jumped out siobhan following my day for traveling in style she mused a motorbike brought me up the a siege mentality rebus explained this week its us and them as far as this lot are concerned there was a soldier approaching dressed in combat fatigues and toting a submachine gun he looked far from pleased at their arrival both showed their id but this was not enough for the soldier rebus noted that there was no insignia on his uniform nothing to identify his nationality or which branch of the armed services he belonged to he insisted on taking their badges from them wait right there he ordered pointing to where they were standing as he turned away rebus did a little softshoe shuffle and gave siobhan a wink the soldier had disappeared into a huge trailer another armed soldier guarded its door i get the feeling were not in kansas anymore rebus offered does that make me toto lets see whats over there rebus suggested heading for the canopy its roof was a fixed structure of plastic sections held up by a series of poles beneath it sat rows of limousines liveried drivers shared cigarettes and stories strangest of all a chef dressed in white jacket and checkered trousers and with a toque perched on his head was cooking what appeared to be omelets he stood behind a sort of platform a large red bottle of cooking gas by his side the food was being dished out on proper plates with silver cutlery tables had been set up for the drivers use i heard about this when i was up here with the dci siobhan said hotel staff are using a back route into the compound leaving their vehicles in the next field over im assuming theyve all been vetted rebus said which is whats happening to us right now he glanced toward the trailer then nodded a greeting to one group of drivers omelets all right lads he asked receiving replies in the affirmative the chef was awaiting fresh orders one with everything rebus told him turning toward siobhan same she said the chef got busy with his little plastic containers of cubed ham sliced mushrooms chopped peppers rebus picked up a knife and fork while he was waiting bit of a change for you he said to the chef the man just smiled all modern conveniences though rebus went on sounding impressed chemical toilets hot food a bit of shelter for when it rains half the cars have got tvs one of the drivers informed him signals not up to much mind its a hard life rebus commiserated ever allowed inside the trailers the drivers shook their heads theyre chockfull of gizmos one man offered i caught a glimpse computers and stuff that aerial on the roof probably isnt for coronation street then rebus said pointing the drivers laughed just as a door opened and the soldier reappeared he seemed nonplussed that rebus and siobhan were no longer where hed left them as he marched toward them rebus accepted his omelet from the chef and scooped up a mouthful he was praising the food as the soldier halted in front of him want some rebus offered holding out his fork its an earful youll be getting the soldier countered rebus turned toward siobhan pretty good comeback she told him taking her own plate from the chef ds clarke is an expert rebus informed the soldier well just finish our grub then hop into one of the mercedes to watch columbo im keeping hold of your badges the soldier said for verification purposes looks like were stuck here then which channels columbo on one of the drivers asked i like that program itll be in the tv pages a colleague offered the soldiers head jerked upward chin jutting as he watched a heli copter approaching it was low and deafening the soldier stepped out from under the canopy to get a better view you have got to be kidding rebus said as the man stiffly saluted the underside of the machine does it every time one of the drivers yelled another asked if it might be bush arriving watches were checked the chef was covering his ingredients in case flying debris from the downdraft landed in them hes due around now someone surmised i brought boki in from prestwick another added going on to explain that this was the name of the presidents dog the helicopter had disappeared over a line of trees they could hear it coming in to land what do the wives do siobhan asked while the menfolk are arm wrestling we can take them on a scenic tour or shopping or museums and galleries whatever they want thats what they get even if it means shutting roads or clearing the public out of a shop but theyre also ferrying in some arty types from edinburgh writers and paintersto pass the time and bono of course another driver added him and geldof are doing their gladhanding bit later today speaking of which siobhan glanced at the time on her cell ive got the offer of a final push ticket who from rebus asked knowing shed had no luck in the public draw one of the guards in niddrie think well be home in time he just shrugged oh he said something i meant to tell you what ive coopted ellen wylie onto the team siobhans look became a glare she knows more about beastwatch than we do rebus plowed on failing to make eye contact yes siobhan said a damned sight too much meaning what meaning shes too close to it john think what a defense lawyer would do to her in court siobhan was failing to keep her voice down you didnt think to ask me im the one whose heads on the block if this all falls apart shes just doing admin rebus said knowing himself how pathetic this sounded he was saved by the soldier striding back toward them i need you to state your business the man announced crisply well im in the cid business rebus replied as is my colleague here weve been told to meet someone and this is where its hap pening which person whose orders rebus tapped the side of his nose hushhush he said in an under tone the drivers had returned to their own conversation debating which stars they might be chauffeuring to the scottish open on saturday not me one of them boasted im doing the run between glasgow and t in the park youre based in edinburgh inspector the soldier was saying this is way out of your jurisdiction were investigating a murder rebus hit back three murders actually siobhan corrected him and that means no boundaries rebus concluded except the soldier countered rising onto his toes youve been ordered to put your inquiry on ice he seemed to like the effect his words had on siobhan in particular okay so you made a phone call rebus told him not about to be impressed your chief constable wasnt very happy the soldier was smiling with his eyes and neither was he rebus followed the line of his eyes a land rover was bumping its way toward them the passengerside window was wide open steelforths head leaning out from it as though he was straining at some leash oh crap siobhan muttered chin up rebus advised her shoulders back he was rewarded with another withering look the car had screeched to a halt steelforth spilling out do you know he was yelling how many months of training and preparation weeks of deep cover surveillancedo you know how much of that youve just blown to smithereens not sure i follow you rebus answered blithely handing his empty plate back to the chef i think he means santal siobhan said steelforth glared at her of course i do shes one of yours rebus asked then he nodded to himself stands to reason send her to the campsite at niddrie get her taking photos of all those protesters compiling a nice little portfolio for future useso valuable to you in fact that you couldnt even spare her for her own brothers funeral her decision rebus steelforth snapped two oclock columbo started one of the drivers said steelforth was not to be deflected a surveillance operation like that oftentimes they hardly get off the ground before the covers blown months shed been in place rebus picked up on that use of the past tense and steelforth confirmed it with a nod how many people he asked do you think saw you with her today how many clocked you as cid either theyll start to mistrust her or theyll feed her garbage in the hope that well bite if shed trusted us in the first place siobhan was cut off by a harsh burst of laughter from steelforth trusted you he laughed again leaning forward with the effort my god thats a good one should have been here earlier siobhan told him our soldier friends comeback was better and by the way rebus said i wanted to thank you for putting me in a cell overnight i cant help it if officers decide to use their own initiative or if your own boss wont answer a phone call they were real cops then rebus asked steelforth rested his hands on his waist elbows jutting he stared at the ground then back up at rebus and siobhan youll be put on suspension of course we dont work for you this week everyone works for me he turned his attention to siobhan and you wont be seeing ds webster again she has evidence evidence of what that your mother got hit by a baton during a riot its up to her if she wants to make a complainthave you even asked her i siobhan hesitated no you just tore off on this little crusade ds websters being sent back homeyour fault not mine speaking of evidence rebus said whatever happened to those securitycamera tapes steelforth frowned tapes he echoed the operations room at edinburgh castlecameras trained on the ramparts weve been through this a dozen times steelforth growled nobody saw anything so its okay for me to watch the tapes if you can find any be my guest theyve been wiped rebus guessed steelforth didnt bother replying this suspension of ours rebus went on you forgot to add pending an inquiry im guessing thats because there wont be one steelforth shrugged up to the pair of you dependent on our conduct like not pushing for the tapes to be made available steelforth shrugged again you can survive thisbut just barely i can make you look like heroes or villains the radio clipped to steelforths belt crackled to life report from one of the watchtowers security fence breached steelforth held the radio to his mouth and ordered a chinooks worth of reinforcements then strode back toward the land rover one of the chauffeurs intercepted him wanted to introduce myself commander names steve and ill be driving you to the open steelforth snarled some sort of oath stopping steve dead the other drivers started joking that he wouldnt be getting much of a tip this weekend steelforths land rover meantime was already revving its engine not even a farewell kiss rebus called out offering a wave of his hand siobhan stared at him youve got retirement to look forward tosome of us were hoping for a career you see what hes like shiv moment this is all over well have fallen off his radar rebus kept waving as the vehicle roared away the soldier was standing in front of them holding out their badges off you go now he snapped where exactly siobhan asked or more to the point how rebus added one of the drivers cleared his throat and stretched out an arm drawing attention to the array of luxury cars i just got a textone of the suits has to get back to glasgow i could drop you off somewhere siobhan and rebus shared a look siobhan then smiled at the driver and nodded toward the cars do we get to choose she asked they ended up sitting in the back of a sixliter audi a four hundred miles on its clock most of them added since first thing that morning pungent aroma of new leather and the bright gleam of chrome siobhan asked if the tv was working rebus gave her a look just wondering if london got the olympics she explained their ids were scrutinized at three separate checkpoints between the field and the hotel grounds we dont go near the hotel itself the driver said ill pick up the suit from the meet n greet next to the media center both were situated near the hotels main car lot rebus saw that no one was playing the golf course pitchandputt and croquet lawnsboth empty except for dapper slowpaced security men hard to believe theres anything happening siobhan commented her voice was just above a whisper something about the placerebus felt it too you didnt want to draw attention to yourself just be a sec the driver said stopping the car he pulled on his chauffeurs peaked cap as he exited rebus decided to get out too he couldnt see any rooftop marksmen but figured they were probably there nevertheless they had parked to one side of the main baronial building near a vast conservatory that rebus guessed was probably the restaurant weekend here would do me grand he confided to siobhan as she emerged from the backseat cost you a grand too no doubt she countered inside the media centera tented structure with solid sidesreporters could be glimpsed hammering copy into their laptops rebus had lit a cigarette he heard a sound and turned to see a bicycle round the corner of the hotel its rider was bent low aiming for speed another bike tucked in directly behind the leading cyclist passed within thirty feet caught sight of them and offered a wave rebus gave a flick of his cigarette in acknowledgment but lifting his fingers from the handlebars had unbalanced the rider his front wheel wobbled slewing across the gravel the other cyclist tried to avoid him but ended up going over his own handlebars men in dark suits arrived as if from nowhere making a rapid huddle around the two sprawled figures did we just do that siobhan asked quietly rebus said nothing just dumped the cigarette and eased himself back into the car siobhan followed his example and they watched through the windshield as the first cyclist was helped to his feet rubbing his grazed knuckles the other rider was still on the ground but no one seemed to be paying him much heed a question of protocol rebus guessed the needs of president george w bush must always come first did we just do that siobhan repeated her voice trembling a little the audi driver had emerged from the meet n greet followed by a man in a gray suit the man carried two bulging briefcases like the driver he paused for a moment to watch the commotion the chauffeur held open the passengerside door and the civil servant got in without so much as a nod of greeting in the direction of the backseat the chauffeur got behind the steering wheel his cap grazing the audis roof and asked them what was going on wheels within wheels rebus offered at last the civil servant decided to acknowledge that he waspossibly to his chagrinnot the only passenger im dobbs he said fco meaning foreign and commonwealth office rebus reached out a hand call me john he invited im a friend of richard pennens siobhan looked to be taking none of this in her attention as the car drew away was on the scene unfolding behind them two men in green paramedics uniforms were being prevented from reaching the us president by his insistent security detail hotel staff had emerged to watch as had a couple of the reporters from the media center happy birthday mr president siobhan sang huskily pleased to meet you dobbs was telling rebus richard been here yet rebus asked casually the civil servant frowned not sure hes on the list he seemed worried that he might have been kept out of the loop told me he was rebus lied blithely thought the foreign sec had a role for him quite possibly dobbs stated trying to sound more confident than he looked george bush just fell off his bike siobhan commented it was as if the words needed to be spoken before they could become fact oh yes dobbs said not really listening he was opening one of the briefcases ready to immerse himself in some reading rebus realized the man had suffered enough small talk his mind geared to higher things statistics and budgets and trade figures he decided on one last try were you at the castle no dobbs drawled were you i was as a matter of fact hellish about ben webster wasnt it ghastly best pps we had siobhan seemed suddenly to realize what was going on rebus offered her a wink richards not too sure he jumped rebus commented accident you mean dobbs replied pushed rebus stated the civil servant lowered his sheaf of papers turned his head toward the backseat pushed he watched rebus slowly nod who the hell would do that rebus offered a shrug maybe he made enemies some politicians do almost as many as your chum pennen dobbs countered how do you mean rebus tried to sound slighted on his friends behalf that company of his used to belong to the taxpayer now hes making a packet out of r and d we paid for serves us right for selling it to him siobhan chipped in maybe the government was badly advised rebus teased the civil servant government knew bloody well what it was doing then why sell to pennen siobhan asked genuinely curious now dobbs was shuffling through his papers again the driver was on the phone to someone asking which routes were open to them r and d departments are costly dobbs was saying when the mod needs to make cuts it always looks bad if its regiments taking the brunt ditch a few techs the media doesnt so much as blink im still not sure i get it siobhan admitted thing about a private company dobbs went on is that they can sell to pretty much anyone they likefewer constraints than the mod fco or department of industry result faster profits profits made rebus added from selling to suspect dictators and spitpoor nations already up to their eyes in debt i thought he was your dobbs flinched as he realized he was not necessarily among friends who did you say you were again john rebus reminded him and this is my colleague but you dont work for pennen industries never implied that we did rebus insisted were lothian and borders police mr dobbs and i want to thank you for your frank answers to our questions rebus stared over the seat toward the civil servants lap you seem to be crushing all your lovely papers is that to save on a shredder ellen wylie was busy manning the phones when they got back to gayfield square siobhan had called her parents discovering that theyd given up on the trip to auchterarder and had kept clear of the angry protest in princes street there had been trouble stretching from the mound to the old town disgruntled protesters prevented from leaving the city clashing with riot police as rebus and siobhan walked into the cid suite wylie gave them a look rebus thought she was on the verge of a protest herselfalone all day in the station but then a figure emerged from derek starrs private officenot starr himself but chief constable james corbyn his hands were clasped behind his back showing impatience rebus stared at wylie who shrugged a response indicating that corbyn had stopped her from texting a warning pair of you in here corbyn snapped retreating back into starrs airless domain close the door after you he added he was seating himself no other chairs in the room so rebus and siobhan stayed standing im glad you could make time sir rebus stated getting his retaliation in first i wanted to ask you about the night ben webster died corbyn was caught off guard what about it you were at the dinner sirsomething you should probably have declared from the start were not here to talk about me di rebus were here so that i can formally suspend the pair of you from active duty with immediate effect rebus nodded slowly as if this were a given all the same sir now you are here best if we get your statement looks like were hiding something otherwise papers are flocking around like vultures hardly in the interests of public relations for the chief constable to be corbyn rose to his feet maybe you werent listening inspector youre no longer taking part in any inquiry i want the pair of you off the premises in the next five minutes youll go home and sit by the phone waiting for news of my investigation into your conduct is that clear i need a few minutes to update my notes sir need to make our conversation a matter of record corbyn stabbed a finger toward rebus ive heard all about you rebus his gaze shifted to siobhan might explain why you were so reluctant to give me your colleagues name when i put you in charge you never actually asked sir if you dont mind me saying siobhan retorted but you knew damned well trouble couldnt be far off his attention was firmly back on rebus not with rebus here in the vicinity with respect sir siobhan started to argue corbyn slammed his fist against the desk i told you to put the whole thing on ice instead of which it makes the front pages and then you proceed to end up at gleneagles when i tell you youre off the case thats all you need to know end of game sayonara finito picked up a few words at the dinner eh sir rebus responded with a wink corbyns eyes bulged from his head just their luck if he were to collapse with an aneurysm but instead he stalked from the room almost sending siobhan and a bookcase toppling as he passed them rebus exhaled noisily ran a hand through his hair and scratched his nose so what do you want to do now he asked siobhan just looked at him pack my things she guessed packing certainly comes into it rebus replied we pack all the case files off to my place set up camp there john youre right he said choosing to misinterpret her tone theyll be noticed if they go missing so we need to copy them instead this time he got a smile ill do it if you want he added i know youve got a hot date in the pouring rain only excuse travis needs to play that bloody song of theirs he emerged from starrs office did you catch any of that ellen she was putting the phone down i couldnt warn you she began dont apologize i suppose corbyn knows who you are now he perched on the corner of her desk didnt seem that interested he got my name and rank never bothered to ask if i was a regular here perfect rebus told her means you can keep being our ears and eyes hang on a second siobhan interrupted thats not your call to make yes maam siobhan ignored him focusing on ellen wylie this is my show ellen understood dont worry siobhan i can tell when im not wanted im not saying youre not wanted but i need to know youre on our side wylie prickled visibly as opposed to whose ladies ladies rebus said stepping between them like an oldfashioned wrestling referee his eyes were on siobhan an extra pair of hands wouldnt go amiss boss you have to admit that she smiled eventuallyboss had done the trick but her gaze stayed fixed on wylie even so she said we cant ask you to spy for us its one thing for john and me to get into trouble another to land you in the mire i dont mind wylie said nice overalls by the way siobhans smile reappeared i suppose i should change before the show rebus exhaled noisily flash point avoided so whats been happening here he asked wylie trying to alert all the offenders listed on beastwatch ive asked the various police authorities to tell them to be on their guard and did they sound enthusiastic not exactly betweentimes ive had several dozen reporters following up on the front page she had the newspaper beside her and tapped mairies headline amazed she gets the time she commented hows that rebus wondered wylie opened the paper at a doublepage spread byline mairie henderson an interview with councilman gareth tench big photo of him in the midst of the niddrie campsite i was there when they did that siobhan said i know him wylie couldnt help countering rebus gave her a look explain she gave a shrug wary of his sudden interest i just do ellen he warned drawing her name out she sighed hes been seeing denise your sister denise siobhan asked wylie nodded it was me who hooked them up more or less theyre an item rebus had wrapped his arms around himself like a straitjacket theyve been out a few times hes been she sought the right words hes been good for her brought her out of herself with the help of a drop of wine rebus guessed but how did you come to meet him beastwatch she said quietly eyes refusing to connect with his say again he saw that piece i wrote sent me an email full of praise rebus had jumped to his feet unfolding his arms as he searched the desk for a sheet of paperthe list bain had given of beastwatch subscribers which one is he he demanded handing her the names that one she said ozyman rebus checked watching her nod hell kind of name is that hes not from down under is he ozymandias maybe siobhan offered ozzy osbournes more my line rebus admitted siobhan leaned over a keyboard and stuck the name into a search engine a couple of clicks and a biography appeared on the screen king of kings siobhan explained put up a huge statue of himself two more clicks and rebus was looking at a poem by shelley look on my works ye mighty he recited and despair he turned toward wylie not that hes bigheaded or anything cant dispute it she conceded all i said was hes been good for denise we need to talk to him rebus said his eyes running down the list of names wondering how many more lived in edinburgh and you ellen should have said something before now i didnt know you had a list she said defensively he got to you through the web sitestands to reason wed want to question him christ knows weve few enough leads to go on or too many siobhan countered victims in three different regions clues left in anotherits all so scattered i thought you were heading home to get ready she nodded looked around the office youre really going to take it all with you why not i can copy the paperwork ellen here wont mind staying late to make some floppies he gave her a meaningful look will you ellen thats my punishment is it i can appreciate youd want denise kept out of it rebus told her but you should still have given us tench just remember john siobhan interrupted the councilman saved me from a beating that night in niddrie rebus nodded could have added that hed witnessed another side to gareth tench but didnt bother enjoy your concert he said instead siobhans attention was back on ellen wylie my team ellen if i think youre hiding anything else message received siobhan started to nod slowly then thought of something did beastwatch subscribers ever have gettogethers not that i know of but they can contact each other obviously did you know who gareth tench was before you met him first email he sent he said he was based in edinburgh signed off with his real name and you told him you were cid wylie nodded whats your thinking rebus asked siobhan im not sure yet siobhan started to get her things together rebus and wylie watched her finally with a wave over her shoulder she was gone ellen wylie folded the newspaper and dumped it in a wastebasket rebus had filled the kettle and switched it on i can tell you exactly what shes thinking wylie told him then youre cleverer than me she knows that murderers dont always work alone she also knows sometimes they need validation over my head ellen i dont think so john if i know you youre thinking much the same somebody decides to start killing perverts they might want to tell someone about iteither beforehand almost asking permission or afterward to get it off their chest okay rebus said busy with the mugs hard to work in a team if youre one of the suspects i really do appreciate you helping out ellen he said pausing before adding so long as thats what youre doing she sprang from the chair placing her hands on her hips elbows jutting rebus had been told once why humans did thatto make them seem bigger more threatening less vulnerable you think she was saying ive been here half the day just to protect denise nobut i do think people will go a long way to protect family like siobhan and her mum you mean lets not pretend we wouldnt do the same johnim here because you asked me and ive said im grateful but heres the thing ellensiobhan and me have just been sent out of the game we need someone to look out for us someone we can trust he spooned coffee into the two chipped mugs sniffed the milk and decided it would do he was giving her time to think all right she said at last no more secrets he asked she shook her head nothing i should know shook it again you want to be there when i interview tench her eyebrows lifted slightly how do you plan to do that youre on suspension remember rebus made a face and tapped his head shortterm memory loss he told her it comes with the territory after the coffee they got busy rebus filled the copier with a fresh ream of paper wylie asked what he wanted copied from the computers various databases the phone rang half a dozen times but they ignored it incidentally wylie chimed in at one point did you hear london got the olympics whoopdeedoo it was great actually everyone dancing around trafalgar square means paris lost out wonder how chiracs taking it rebus checked his watch hell be sitting down to dinner with the queen right around now with tb doing his cheshire cat impression no doubt rebus smiled yes and gleneagles serving up the best of caledonian fare for the french presidenthe thought back to that afternoon standing a few hundred yards from all those powerful men bush toppling from his bike a painful reminder that they were every bit as fallible as anyone else what does the g stand for he asked wylie just looked at him in g he amplified government she guessed giving a shrug there was a tapping against the open door one of the duty uniforms from the front desk someone to see you downstairs sir he glanced pointedly in the direction of the nearest phone weve not been picking up rebus explained who is it woman called webstershe was hoping for ds clarke but said youd do in a pinch backstage at the final push rumors that some sort of rocket had been fired from the railway tracks nearby falling short of its target filled with purple dye bobby greig had told siobhan he was in civvies faded jeans and a battered denim jacket looked damp but happy as the rain drizzled down siobhan had changed into black cords and a pale green tshirt topped off with a biker jacket bought secondhand from an oxfam shop greig had smiled at her how come hed said whatever you wear you still look like cid she hadnt bothered replying she kept fingering the laminated pass strung around her neck it showed an outline of africa and the legend backstage access sounded grand but greig soon explained her spot on the food chain his own pass was access all areas but beyond this were two further levelsvip and vvip shed already seen midge ure and claudia schiffer both of them vvips greig had introduced her to the concert promoters steve daws and emma diprose the pair of them glamorous despite the weather amazing lineup siobhan had told them thank you daws had said then diprose had asked if siobhan had a favorite but shed shaken her head throughout greig hadnt bothered mentioning to them that she was a cop there had been ticketless fans outside murrayfield begging to buy and a few scalpers whose prices were deterring all but the wealthiest and most desperate with her pass siobhan had been able to wander around the base of the stage and onto the playing field itself where she joined sixty thousand drenched fans but the hungry looks they gave in the direction of her little plastic rectangle made her uncomfortable and she soon retreated behind the security fence greig was stuffing his face with the free food while holding a halfempty bottle of continental lager the proclaimers had opened the show with a singalong of miles word was eddie izzard would be playing piano on midge ures version of vienna texas snow patrol and travis were due up later with bono helping out the corrs and a closing set by james brown but the frenetic backstage activity was making her feel old she didnt know who half the performers were they looked important moving to and fro with their various entourages but their faces didnt mean anything to her it struck her that her parents might be leaving on friday giving her just one more day with them shed called them earlier theyd gone back to her place buying provisions on the way and might go out for dinner just the two of them her dad had said making it look like this was what he wanted or maybe so she wouldnt feel guilty at being elsewhere she was trying to relax to get in the mood but work kept intruding rebus she knew would still be hard at it he wouldnt rest till his demons had been quelled yet each victory was fleeting and each fight drained him a little more now that the sun was setting the stadium was dotted with the flashes from camera phones luminous glow sticks were being waved in the air greig found an umbrella from somewhere and handed it to her as the rain got heavier had any more trouble in niddrie she asked him he shook his head theyve made their point he said besides which they probably think theres a better chance of a fight if they head into town he tossed his empty beer bottle into a recycling bin did you see it today i was in auchterarder she said he looked impressed bits i saw on tv made it look like a war zone wasnt quite that bad how about here bit of a demonstration when the buses were stopped from going nothing like monday though he nodded over her shoulder annie lennox he pointed out and so it was not ten feet away giving them a smile as she headed to her changing room you played great at hyde park greig called out to her she just kept smiling her mind on the performance ahead greig went to fetch more beers most of the people siobhan saw were just hanging around looking bored technical crews who wouldnt be busy again until it was time to pack everything away and dismantle the stage personal assistants and record company staffthe latter wearing a uniform of black suits with matching vneck sweaters sunglasses on and phones clamped to their ears caterers and promoters and hangerson she knew she was one of the last group no one had asked what role she was playing because no one thought she was a player the terraces thats where i belong she thought either there or the cid room she felt so very different from the teenager whod hitched her way to greenham common singing we shall overcome as she locked hands with the other women ringing the air base already saturdays make poverty history march seemed like history itself and yetbono and geldof had managed to breach the g security putting their case to the various leaders theyd made damned sure those men knew what was at stake and that millions expected great things of them tomorrow decisions might be made tomorrow would be crucial her cell was in her hand and she was on the verge of calling rebus but she knew he would laugh tell her to switch it off and enjoy herself she suddenly doubted that despite the ticket pinned by a magnet to the fridge in her kitchen she would go to t in the park doubted the killings would be solved by then especially now she was officially off the case her case except now rebus had brought in ellen wylieit rankled that he hadnt thought to ask rankled too that hed been right they needed help but now it turned out wylie knew gareth tench and tench knew wylies sister bobby greig had returned with her beer so what do you think he asked i think theyre all remarkably small she commented he nodded his agreement pop stars he explained mustve been the school runts this is how they get their revenge youll notice their heads are big enough though he saw that he had lost her attention whats he doing here siobhan asked greig recognized the figure gave a wave councilman gareth tench waved back he was talking to daws and diprose but broke offa pat on the shoulder for the former peck on either cheek for the latterand came toward them hes the councils culture convener greig stated he held out a hand for tench to squeeze how are you lad tench inquired just fine keeping out of trouble this question was directed at siobhan she took the proffered hand and returned its firm grasp trying to tench turned back to greig remind me again where do i know you from the campsite names bobby greig tench shook his head at his own incompetence of course of course well isnt this great he clapped his hands together and looked around whole bloody worlds got its eyes on edinburgh or on the concert at any rate siobhan couldnt help qualifying tench just rolled his eyes theres no pleasing some folk tell me did bobby here sneak you in for free siobhan felt obliged to nod and youre still complaining he gave a chuckle remember to give a donation before you leave eh might look like a kickback otherwise thats a bit unfair greig started to protest but tench waved the complaint aside and hows that colleague of yours he was asking siobhan you mean di rebus thats the one seems a bit too friendly with the criminal fraternity if you ask me how do you mean well you work togetherim sure he confides in you the other night as if jogging her memory craigmillar faith center i was making a speech when your man rebus showed up with a monster called cafferty he paused im assuming you know him i know him siobhan confirmed seems strange to me that the forces of law and order would need to he seemed to be searching for the right word fraternize he decided then he paused eyes boring into siobhans im presuming di rebus wouldnt have kept any of this from you i mean im not telling you anything you dont already know siobhan felt like a fish worried by an insistent hook we all have our private lives mr tench was the only reply she could muster tench seemed disappointed and what about yourself she continued hoping to persuade a few bands into playing the jack kane center he rubbed his hands again if the opportunity presents his voice drifted away as he saw a face he recognized siobhan knew it too marti pellow from wet wet wet the name reminded her to raise her umbrella the rain tomtommed off it as tench moved away toward his target what was all that about greig asked she just shook her head why do i get the feeling youd rather be elsewhere sorry she said greig was watching tench and the singer works fast doesnt he not shy either i think thats why people listen you ever heard him when hes giving a speech the hairs on your arms start to rise siobhan nodded slowly she was thinking about rebus and cafferty it didnt surprise her that rebus hadnt said anything she looked at her phone again she had an excuse now to call him but still she held back im owed a private life an evening off otherwise shed become just like rebusobsessed and sidelined cranky and mistrusted hed been stuck at inspector rank for the best part of two decades she wanted more wanted to do the job well but be able to switch off now and again wanted a life outside her job rather than a job that became her life rebus had lost family and friends pushing them aside in favor of corpses and con men killers petty thieves rapists thugs racketeers and racists when he went out drinking he did so on his own standing quietly at the bar facing the row of optics he had no hobbies didnt follow any sports never took a vacation if he had a week or two off she could usually find him at the oxford bar pretending to read the paper in a corner or staring dully at daytime tv she wanted more this time she made the call it was picked up and she broke into a smile dad she said you still in the restaurant tell them to squeeze in an extra place setting for dessert stacey webster was herself again dressed much as she had been the time rebus had met her outside the morgue her tshirt had long sleeves that to hide the tattoos he asked theyre temporary she told him theyll fade in time most things do he saw the suitcase it was standing on end carry handle retracted back to london sleeper car she nodded look im sorry if we rebus looked around the reception area as though reluctant to make eye contact it happens she said maybe my cover wasnt breached but commander steelforth doesnt like to risk his officers she seemed awkward and uncertain brain stuck in the nomansland between two very separate identities time for a drink he asked i came to see siobhan she slid a hand into her pocket is her mum okay recuperating rebus said staying at siobhans santal never got the chance to say goodbye she was holding her hand out toward rebus a clear plastic wallet within which sat a silver disk cdrom she said film copied from my camera that day on princes street rebus nodded slowly ill see she gets it the commander would kill me if our secret rebus assured her tucking the disk into his breast pocket now lets get you that drink plenty of pubs available to them on leith walk but the first they walked past looked busy the murrayfield concert blaring from the tv farther downhill they found what they wanteda quiet traditional place with a jukebox sound track and a onearmed bandit stacey had left her suitcase behind the desk at gayfield square she told him she wanted to offload some scottish moneyher excuse for getting the round they settled at a corner table ever used the sleeper car before rebus asked thats why im drinking gin and toniconly way to sleep on that damned train is santal gone for good depends steelforth said you were undercover for months months she agreed cant have been easy in londonalways the chance someone would recognize you i walked past ben once as santal he never knew she sat back thats why i let santal get close to siobhan her parents had told me she was cid you wanted to see if your cover would hold rebus watched her nod thinking now that he understood something stacey would have been devastated by her brothers death but to santal it would have mattered very little problem was all that grief was still cagedsomething he knew a bit about london wasnt really my main base though stacey was saying a lot of the groups have moved outtoo easy for us to monitor them there manchester bradford leedsthats where i spent most of my time you think you made a difference she gave this some thought we hope we do dont we he nodded his agreement sipped at his own pint then put it down im still looking into bens death i know the commander told you he watched her nod hes been putting obstacles in my way he probably sees it as his job inspector its nothing personal if i didnt know better id say he was trying to protect a man called richard pennen pennen industries it was rebuss turn to nod pennen was picking up your brothers hotel tab strange she said there wasnt much love lost oh she stared at him ben had visited plenty of war zones he knew the horrors inflicted by the arms trade the line i keep being fed is that pennen sells technology rather than guns she snorted only a matter of time ben wanted to make things as awkward as possible you should look back at hansardspeeches he made in the house asking all sorts of difficult questions yet pennen paid for his room and ben would have loved that hed take a room from a dictator then spend the whole trip slamming them she paused and swirled her drink then turned her eyes back toward him you thought it was bribery didnt you pennen buying ben off his silence answered her question my brother was a good man inspector at last tears were welling in her eyes and i couldnt even go to his bloody funeral hed have understood rebus offered my own had to stop and clear his throat my own brother died last week we cremated him on friday im sorry he lifted the glass to his mouth he was in his fifties doctors say it was a stroke you were close phone calls mostly he paused again i put him in jail once for dealing drugs looked at her to gauge her reaction is that whats bothering you she asked what that you never told him she struggled to get the words out face twisting as the tears started falling never told him you were sorry she got up from the table fled to the restroomone hundred percent stacey webster now he thought maybe he should follow her or at least send the barmaid in after her but he just sat there instead swilling the glass until fresh foam appeared on the surface of the beer thinking about families ellen wylie and her sister the jensens and their daughter vicky stacey webster and her brother mickey he said in a whisper naming the dead so theyd know they werent forgotten ben webster cyril colliar edward isley trevor guest michael rebus he said out loud making a little toast with his glass then he got up and bought refillsipa vodka and tonic stood by the bar as he waited for his change two regulars were discussing team britains chances at the olympics how come london always gets everything one of them complained funny they didnt want the g his companion added knew what was bloody coming rebus had to think for a moment wednesday todayit all wrapped up on friday just one more full day and then the city could start getting back to normal steelforth and pennen and all the other intruders would head south there wasnt much love lost shed meant between her brother and richard pennen the mp trying to stymie pennens expansion plans rebus had had ben webster all wrong seeing him as a lackey and steelforth not letting rebus near the hotel room not because he didnt want any fuss didnt want the various bigwigs bothered with questions and theories but to protect richard pennen wasnt much love lost making richard pennen a suspect or at the very least giving him a motive any one of the guards at the castle could have heaved the mp over the ramparts there would have been bodyguards mixing with the guestssecret service tooat least one detail apiece to protect the foreign secretary and defense secretary steelforth was so next best thing to the spooks at mi and mi but if you wanted to get rid of someone why choose that method it was too public too showy rebus knew from experience the successful murders were where there was no murder smothered during sleep drugged and then left in a moving vehicle or simply made to disappear christ john he scolded himself itll be little green men next blame the circumstances easy to imagine any manner of conspiracy happening around you in g week he set the drinks down at the table a little concerned now that stacey had yet to emerge from the restroom it struck him that his back had been turned while hed waited at the bar gave it five more minutes then asked the barmaid to check she came out of the ladies shaking her head three quid wasted she told him gesturing toward staceys drink and too young for you anyway if you dont mind me saying back at gayfield square shed taken her suitcase but left him a note good luck but rememberben was my brother not yours make sure you do your own grieving too hours yet until the sleeper car left he could head to waverley but decided against it wasnt sure there was much more left to be said maybe she even had a point by investigating bens death he was keeping mickeys memory close suddenly there was a question he wished hed asked her what do you think happened to your brother well he had her business card somewhere the one shed given him outside the morgue hed call her tomorrow maybe see if shed been able to sleep on the train to london hed told her he was still investigating the death and all shed said was i know no questions no theories of her own warned off by steelforth a good soldier always obeyed orders but she must have been thinking about it weighing the options a fall a leap a push tomorrow he told himself heading back to the cid room a long night of clandestine photocopying ahead thursday july the buzzer woke him he stumbled through to the hall and pushed the button on the intercom what he rasped i thought i worked here tinny and distorted but still recognizable siobhans voice what time is it rebus coughed eight eight the start of another working day were suspended remember are you still in your jamjams i dont wear them meaning i need to wait out here ill leave the door open he buzzed her in collected his clothes from the chair by the bed and locked himself in the bathroom he could hear her tapping on the door pushing it open two minutes he called out stepping into the bath and under the nozzle of the shower by the time he emerged she had seated herself at the dining table and was sorting through last nights photocopies dont get too comfortable he said he was halfway through knotting his tie remembering that he wouldnt be going into work he tugged it free instead and threw it toward the sofa we need supplies he told her and i need a favor such as a couple of hours at lunchtimei want to take my parents out he nodded his agreement hows your mum doing she seems okay theyve decided to give gleneagles a miss even though climate change is on todays agenda theyre heading home tomorrow probably how was the show last night she didnt answer straightaway i caught the last bit on tvthought i might have seen you bopping down front id left by then oh she just shrugged so what are these provisions breakfast ive had mine then you can watch me while i demolish a bacon roll theres a café on marchmont road and while im tucking in you can call councilman tench fix up a powwow he was at the show last night rebus looked at her gets about a bit doesnt he shed wandered over to the stereo there were lps on a shelf and she picked one up that was made before you were born rebus told her leonard cohen songs of love and hate listen to this she said reading the back of the sleeve they locked up a man who wanted to rule the world the fools they locked up the wrong man wonder what that means case of mistaken identity rebus offered i think its to do with ambition she countered gareth tench said he saw you he did with cafferty rebus nodded big ger says the councilmans got plans to put him out of the game she put the record back and turned to face him thats a good thing isnt it depends what we get instead caffertys view is that tench himself would take over you believe him rebus seemed to be considering the question know what i need before i answer that proof she guessed he shook his head coffee eight fortyfive rebus was on his second mug all that was left of his roll was a side plate spotted with grease the café had a good selection of papers siobhan reading about the final push rebus showing her photos from yesterdays shenanigans at gleneagles that kid he said pointing at one didnt we see him she nodded but not with blood gushing from his head rebus turned the paper back toward him they love it really you know bit of blood always looks good to the media and makes us look like the villains of the piece speaking of which he lifted the cdrom from his pocket a goingaway present from stacey websteror santal if you prefer siobhan took it from him holding it between her fingers as rebus explained the circumstances when hed finished he took staceys business card from his wallet and tried her number there was no answer as he tucked the phone back into his jacket he could smell the faintest trace of molly clarks perfume hed decided siobhan didnt need to know about her wasnt sure how she would react he was still thinking it over when gareth tench walked in tench shook hands with both of them rebus thanked him for coming and gestured for him to sit what can i get you tench shook his head rebus could see a car parked outside the minders standing next to it good idea that he told the councilman nodding toward the window i dont know why more marchmont residents dont use bodyguards tench just smiled not at work today he commented bit more informal rebus explained cant have our elected politicians slumming it in copshop interview rooms i appreciate that tench had made himself comfortable but showed no sign of removing his threequarterlength coat so what can i do for you inspector but it was siobhan who spoke first as you know mr tench were investigating a series of murders certain clues were left at a site in auchterarder tenchs eyes narrowed his focus was still on rebus but it was clear hed expected some other conversationcafferty maybe or niddrie i dont see he started all three victims siobhan went on were listed on a web site called beastwatch she paused you know it of course i do thats our information she unfolded a sheet of paper and showed it to him ozymanthats you isnt it he thought for a moment before answering siobhan folded the sheet and put it back in her pocket rebus winked at tench conveying a simple message shes good so dont try jerking us around its me tench finally conceded what of it siobhan shrugged why are you interested in beastwatch mr tench are you saying im a suspect rebus gave a cold laugh thats a bit of a leap to make sir tench glowered at him never know what cafferty might try and hatchwith a little help from his friends i think were straying from the point siobhan interrupted we need to interview anyone who had access to that site sir its procedure thats all i still dont know how you got from my screen name to me you forget mr tench rebus said blithely weve got the worlds best intelligence officers here this week not much they cant do tench looked ready to add some remark but rebus didnt give him the chance interesting choice ozymandias poem by shelley right some king gets a bit above himself has this huge statue built but over time it crumbles away sitting there out in the desert he paused like i say interesting choice why so rebus folded his arms well this king must have had some egothats the point of the poem no matter how high and mighty you are nothing lasts and if youre a tyrant your falls all the greater he leaned forward a little across the table person who chose that name wasnt stupidhad to know it wasnt about power as such but powers corrupting influence tench smiled and nodded slowly di rebus is a fast learner siobhan added yesterday he was wondering if you might be australian tenchs smile broadened his eyes remained fixed on rebus we did that poem at school he said had this really enthusiastic english teacher he made us memorize it tench offered a shrug i just like the name inspector dont read any more into it his gaze shifted to siobhan and back peril of the profession i supposealways looking for motive tell me whats your killers motive have you considered that we think hes a vigilante siobhan stated picking them off one by one from that web site tench didnt look convinced youve still yet to tell us rebus said quietly your own motive for being so interested in beastwatch he unfolded his arms and laid his palms on the tabletop on either side of his coffee mug my districts a dumping ground rebusdont say you havent noticed agencies bring us their hardtohouse the dealers and flotsam sex offenders junkies losers of all descriptions sites like beastwatch give me a chance of fighting back they mean i can argue my corner when some fresh problems about to land on my doorstep and has it happened siobhan asked we had a guy released three months back sex maniaci made sure he steered clear making it someone elses problem siobhan commented always been the way ive worked someone like cafferty comes along same thinking prevails caffertys been here a long time rebus pointed out you mean despite your lot or because of them when rebus didnt answer tenchs smile became a sneer no way hed have lasted as long as he has without some help he leaned back and rolled his shoulders are we finished here how well do you know the jensens siobhan asked who the couple who run the site never met them tench stated really siobhan sounded amazed they live right here in edinburgh and so do half a million just like them i try to get about ds clarke but im not made of elastic what are you made of councilman rebus asked anger tench offered determination a thirst for whats right and just he took a deep breath but then released it noisily we could be here all day he apologized with another smile then rising to his feet bobby looked heartbroken when you walked out on him ds clarke you want to be careful passions a snarling beast in some men he made a little bow as he headed for the door well talk again siobhan warned him rebus was watching through the window as one of the minders opened the back door of the car and tench crammed his oversize frame inside councilmen often have a wellfed look he commented you ever notice that siobhan was rubbing a hand across her forehead we could have handled that better you ducked out of the final push wasnt really getting into it anything to do with our esteemed councilman she shook her head destroyer and preserver rebus muttered to himself what its another line from shelley so which of them is gareth tench the car was drawing away from the curb maybe both rebus offered then he gave a huge yawn any chance today will give us some respite she looked at him you could stop for lunch come and meet my parents pariah status has been lifted he guessed raising an eyebrow john she warned you dont want them to yourself she shrugged maybe ive been a bit greedy rebus had taken a couple of paintings down from one wall of his living room details of the three victims were now pinned there instead he was seated at the dining table while siobhan lay stretched out along the sofa both were busy reading asking occasional questions or pitching a notion dont suppose youve had a chance to listen to the ellen wylie tape rebus asked at one point not that it really matters plenty more subscribers we could talk to need to know who they are first think brains could do that without corbyn or steelforth getting a whiff tench talked about motivecould we be missing something some connection between all three come to that whys he stopped at three usual explanations hes gone elsewhere or weve arrested him for something else or he knows were onto him but were not onto him media say otherwise why the clootie well in the first place because we were bound to go there cant rule out a local connection what if this has nothing to do with beastwatch then were wasting precious time could he be sending a message to the g maybe hes here right now holding a banner somewhere photo might be on that cdrom and wed never know if those clues were left to taunt us how come he hasnt followed up shouldnt he be trying to make more of a game of it maybe he doesnt need to follow up meaning what he could be closer than we think thanks for that do you want a cup of tea go on then actually its your turni paid for the coffees theres got to be a pattern you know we are missing something siobhans phone bleeped text message she studied it turn on the tv she said which show are you missing but shed swung her legs off the sofa and punched the button herself found the remote and flipped channels news flash across the bottom of the screen blasts in london eric sent the text she said quietly rebus came and stood next to her there didnt seem to be much information a series of blasts or explosionsthe london undergroundcasualties several dozen suspected power surge the broadcaster was saying he didnt sound convinced power surge my ass rebus growled major railway stations closed hospitals on alert the public advised not to try entering the city siobhan slumped back onto the sofa elbows on knees head in hands blindsided she said quietly might not just be london rebus replied but he knew it probably was morning rush hourall those commutersand transport police sent packing to scotland for the g all those officers sent off from the met to scotland he squeezed shut his eyes thinking lucky it wasnt yesterday thousands of revelers in trafalgar square cheering the olympic result or saturday night in hyde parktwo hundred thousand the national grid had just confirmed that there were no apparent problems with its systems aldgate kings cross edgware road and fresh speculation that a bus had also been wrecked the broadcasters face was pale an emergency number was running along the foot of the screen what do we do siobhan asked quietly as the tv showed live pictures from one of the scenesmedics running pellmell smoke billowing wounded sitting curbside glass and sirens and the alarms from cars and nearby offices do rebus echoed he was saved from answering by siobhans phone she put it to her ear mum she said yes were watching it right now she paused listening im sure theyre fineyes you could call the number might take a while to get through though another pause to listen what today they might have locked down kings cross shed half turned from rebus he decided to leave the room let her say whatever needed saying in the kitchen he ran the tap filled the kettle listened to the water running such a basic sound he almost never heard it it was just there normal everyday and when he closed the tap there was a faint gurgle funny how he couldnt remember having caught it before when he turned siobhan was standing there mum wants to go home she said make sure the neighbors are okay i dont even know where they live forest hill she told him south of the thames no lunch then she shook her head he handed a strip of paaper towel to her and she blew her nose puts things in perspective something like this she said not really its been in the air all week there were times i could almost taste it thats three tea bags she said what youve just put three tea bags in that mug she handed him the teapot this what you were thinking of maybe he conceded in his mind he was seeing a statue in the desert smashed to smithereens siobhan had gone home she would help her parents maybe take them to the train if that was still the plan rebus watched tv the red doubledecker had been ripped apart its roof lying in the road in front of it and yet there were survivors a small miracle it seemed to him his instinct was to open the bottle and pour but so far hed resisted eyewitnesses were telling their stories the prime minister was on his way south leaving the foreign secretary in charge at gleneagles blair had made a statement before leaving flanked by his g colleagues you could just make out the bandaids on president bushs knuckles back on the news people were talking about crawling over body parts to get out of the trains crawling through smoke and blood some had used their camera phones to capture the horror rebus wondered what instinct had kicked in to make them do that turning them into war correspondents the bottle was on the mantelpiece the tea was cold in his hand three bad men had been chosen for death by a person or persons unknown ben webster had fallen to his doom big ger cafferty and gareth tench were squaring up for violence puts things in perspectivesiobhans words rebus wasnt so sure because now more than ever he wanted answers to questions wanted faces and names he couldnt do anything about london or suicide bombers or casual carnage on the scale in front of him all he could do was lock up a few bad people now and then results that didnt seem to change the bigger picture another image came to mind mickey as a kid maybe kirkcaldy beach or some holiday in st andrews or blackpool frantically scooping up lines of damp sand creating a barrier against the creeping sea working as if his life depended on it and big brother john too using the small plastic shovel to pile the sand on mickey patting it down twenty thirty feet long maybe six inches highbut the first flecks of foam would be arriving before they had a chance and theyd have to watch their edifice melt becoming one with its surroundings squealing in defeat stamping their feet and waving their tiny fists at the lapping water and the treacherous shore and the unmoved sky and god god above all else the bottle seemed to be swelling in size or maybe it was that he was growing smaller he thought of some lines in a jackie leven song but my boat is so small and your sea is so immense immense yes but why did it have to be so full of bloody sharks when the phone started ringing he considered not answering considered for all of ten seconds it was ellen wylie any news he asked then he barked out a short laugh and squeezed the bridge of his nose apart from the obvious i mean state of shock here she told him nobodys about to figure out that you copied all that stuff and took it home i doubt anyones going to look twice at anything until this weeks over i thought i might head back to torphichen see how my team is doing good idea london contingent are being sent home could be well need all available hands i wont be holding my breath actually even the anarchists seem to be stunned word from gleneagles is its all gone quiet a lot of them just want to go home rebus had risen from his chair he was standing by the mantelpiece time like this you want to be near your loved ones john are you all right just dandy ellen he drew a finger down the bottles length it was dewars pale gold in color you get yourself back to torphichen do you want me to drop by later i dont think well have accomplished much tomorrow then sounds good talk to you then he cut the connection leaned both hands against the edge of the mantelpiece could have sworn the bottle was staring back at him there were buses heading south and siobhans parents had decided to catch one of them wed have been leaving tomorrow anyway her father had said giving her a hug you never did get to gleneagles shed told him hed pecked her on the cheek right on the line of her jaw and for a few seconds shed been a kid again always the same spot be it christmas or a birthday good grades at school or just because he was feeling happy and then another embrace from her mother and whispered words it doesnt matter meaning the damage to her face meaning finding the culprit and then pulling free of the embrace but still holding her at arms length come see us soon promise siobhan had said the apartment seemed empty without them she realized that she lived most of her time there in silence well not silencethere was always music or the radio or tv but not many visitors nobody whistling as they walked down the hall or humming as they washed up nobody but her shed tried calling rebus but he wasnt answering the tv was on she couldnt bring herself to switch it off thirty deadforty deadmaybe fifty the mayor of london had made a good speech alqaeda had claimed responsibility the queen was deeply shocked londons commuters were starting the long march home from work commentators were asking why the terror alert had been downgraded from severe general to substantial she wanted to ask them what difference would it have made she went to the fridge her mother had been busy at the local shops duck fillets lamb chops a slab of cheese organic fruit juice siobhan tried the freezer compartment and hauled out a frosted tub of mackies vanilla ice cream got herself a spoon and went back through to the living room for want of anything else to do she booted up her computer fiftythree emails a quick glance told her she could delete the vast bulk of them then she remembered something reached into her pocket the cdrom she slotted it into her hard drive a few clicks of the mouse and she was studying a screens worth of thumbnails stacey webster had taken a few of the young mother and her pinkclad baby siobhan had to smile the woman was obviously using her child as a prop enacting the same diaperchanging scenario in different locations always directly in front of police lines a great photo op and a potential flash point there was even an image of the various press cameramen mungo included but stacey had been concentrating on the demonstrators putting together a nice little dossier for her masters at so some of the cops would be from the met theyd be on their way south now to help in the aftermath to check on loved ones maybe eventually to attend the funerals of colleagues if her mothers attacker turned out to be from londonshe didnt know what shed do her mothers words it doesnt matter she shook the notion away it was fifty or sixty pictures in before siobhan spotted her mum and dadteddy clarke trying to drag his wife away from the front line a complete melee around them batons raised mouths open in a roar or a grimace trash bins flying dirt and uprooted flowers flying and then the stick connecting with the front of her mothers face siobhan almost flinched but forced herself to look a stick looked like something picked up off the ground not a baton and swung from the protesters side of the trouble the person holding it he retreated fast and suddenly siobhan knew it was just like shed been told by mungo the photographer you strike out at the cops and when they retaliate you make sure innocent civilians are in the firing line maximum pr make the cops look like thugs her mother flinched as contact was made her face was blurred with movement but the pain was evident siobhan rubbed her thumb over the screen as if to take away the hurt followed the stick back to its owners bare arm his shoulder was in the shot but not his head she went back a few frames then forward a few past the actual blow there hed placed a hand behind his back hiding the stick but it was still there and stacey had caught him fullface caught the glee in his eyes the crooked grin a few more frames and he was up on his toes chanting baseball cap low down on his forehead but unmistakable the kid from niddrie the leader of the pack heading down to princes street like many of his kindjust for the pure hell of it last seen by siobhan emerging from the sheriff court where councilman gareth tench waited tenchs words a couple of my constituents got caught up in all that troubletench returning the culprits salute as he walked free from court siobhans hand was trembling slightly as she tried rebus again still no answer she got up and walked around the apartment in and out of every room the towels in the bathroom had been neatly folded and left in a pile there was an empty soup carton in the bin in the kitchen it had been rinsed out so that it wouldnt smell her mothers little touchesshe stood in front of her bedrooms fulllength mirror trying to see any resemblance she thought she looked more like her father theyd be on the a by now making steady progress south she hadnt told them the truth about santal probably never would back at the computer she went through all the other photos then started again from the beginning this time on the lookout for just the one figure one skinny little troublemaker in his baseball cap tshirt jeans and sneakers tried printing some of them off but got a warning that her ink levels were low there was a computer shop on leith walk she grabbed her keys and purse the bottle was empty and there was no more in the house rebus had found a half bottle of polish vodka in the freezer but its contents had been reduced to a single measure couldnt be bothered walking to the shops so he made himself a mug of tea instead and sat down at the dining table skimming through the case notes ellen wylie had been impressed by ben websters cv and so was rebus he went through it again the worlds trouble spots some people were drawn to themadventurers newsmen mercenaries rebus had been told a while back that mairie hendersons boyfriend was a cameraman and had traveled to sierra leone afghanistan iraqbut rebus got the feeling ben webster hadnt gone to any of these places from the need for a thrill or even because hed felt them particularly worthy causes hed gone because that was his job it is our most basic duty as human beings hed said in one of his parliamentary speeches to aid sustainable development wherever and whenever possible in the poorest and harshest regions of the world it was a point hed hammered home elsewhereto various committees on public platforms and in media interviews my brother was a good man rebus didnt doubt it nor could he think of any reason that someone would have pushed him from those ramparts onto the rocks below hardworking as he was ben webster still hadnt posed much of a threat to pennen industries rebus was coming back round to the suicide option maybe webster had been made depressed by all those conflicts and famines and catastrophes maybe hed known in advance that little progress would be made at the g his hopes of a better world stalled once again leaping into the void to bring attention to the situation rebus couldnt really see that webster had sat down to dinner with powerful and influential men diplomats and politicians from several nations why not voice his concerns to them make a fuss kick up a stink shout and scream that scream flying into the night sky as he launched himself into the dark no rebus said to himself shaking his head it felt to him as though the jigsaw was complete enough for him to make out the image but with some of the pieces wrongly placed no he repeated going back to his reading a good man after a further twenty minutes he found an interview from one of the sunday supplements of twelve months back webster was being questioned about his early days as an mp hed had a mentor of sorts another scottish mp and labor highflier called colin anderson rebuss own member of parliament didnt see you at the funeral colin rebus said quietly underlining a couple of sentences webster is quick to credit anderson for the help he gave the tyro mp he made sure i avoided the obvious pratfalls and i cant thank him enough for that but the surefooted webster is more reticent by far when questioned about the allegation that it was anderson who propelled him into his current role as parliamentary private secretary placing him where he could be of future assistance to the minister for trade in any leadership contest well well rebus said blowing across the surface of his cup even though the liquid within was tepid at best id completely forgotten rebus said dragging a spare chair over to the table that my own member of parliament was minister for trade i know youre busy so ill keep this short he was in a restaurant on edinburghs south side early evening but the place was busy the staff were making up a place setting for him trying to hand him a menu the right honorable colin anderson mp was seated across from his wife at a table meant for two who the hell are you he asked rebus was handing the menu back to the waiter im not eating he explained then to the mp my names john rebus im a detective inspector did your secretary not say can i see some identification anderson was asking not really her fault rebus was telling him i exaggerated a little said it was an emergency hed opened his id for inspection while the mp studied it rebus smiled in his wifes direction should i she motioned to rise from the table nothing top secret rebus assured her anderson was handing back rebuss id if you dont mind me saying inspector this isnt exactly conve nient i thought your secretary would have told you anderson lifted his cell from the table no signal he stated you should do something about that rebus commented lots of the city still like that have you been drinking inspector only when offduty sir rebus fussed in his pocket until he found the pack theres no smoking in here anderson warned him rebus looked at the cigarette pack as though it had crawled unnoticed into his hand he apologized and put it away again didnt see you at the funeral sir he told the mp which funeral ben webster you were a good friend to him in his early days i was otherwise engaged the mp made a show of checking his watch bens sister told me that once her brother was dead labor would soon forget about him i think thats unreasonable ben was a friend of mine inspector and i did want to attend the funeral but youve been busy rebus said all understanding and here you are trying to catch a quick quiet meal with your wife and i come barging in unannounced it happens to be my wifes birthday we managedgod knows howto keep a window free and ive gone and smudged it rebus turned to the wife many happy returns the waiter was placing a wineglass in front of rebus maybe some water instead anderson suggested rebus nodded have you been busy with the g the mps wife leaned forward to ask him busy despite the g rebus corrected her he saw husband and wife exchange a glance knew what they were thinking a hungover cop wired from all the demonstrations and the chaos and now the bombings damaged goods to be handled with care can this really not wait till morning inspector anderson asked quietly im looking into ben websters death rebus explained his voice sounded nasal even to his own ears and there was a creeping mist at the edges of his vision cant seem to find a reason for him to take his own life more likely an accident surely the mps wife offered or he was given a hand rebus stated what andersons hands stopped arranging the cutlery in front of him richard pennen wants to link overseas aid to arms sales doesnt he hows it going to workhe donates a chunk of money in exchange for looser controls dont be absurd the mp allowed his voice to betray his irritation were you at the castle that night i was busy at westminster any chance that webster had words with pennen maybe at your behest what sort of words cutting back the arms tradeturning all those guns into plowshares look you cant just go around defaming richard pennen if theres any evidence id like to see it me too rebus agreed meaning theres none and youre basing this witch hunt on what exactly inspector on the fact that special branch wants me to butt out or at the very least toe the line while youd prefer to cross that same line only way of getting anywhere ben webster was an outstanding member of parliament and a rising star in his party and hed have supported you to the hilt in any leadership contest rebus couldnt help adding now youre just being bloody scurrilous anderson snarled was he the sort to get up the nose of big business rebus asked the sort who couldnt be bribed or bought off his head was feeling even muzzier you seem exhausted officer the mps wife said voice sympathetic are you sure this really cant wait rebus was shaking his head aware of its sheer mass felt like he might crash through the floor his body was so heavy darling the mps wife was telling her husband heres rosie a flusteredlooking young woman was squeezing her way between the tables the staff looked worried that they might be asked to sit four at a table intended for two i left message after message after message rosie was saying and then thought maybe you werent getting them no signal anderson growled tapping his phone this is the inspector rebus had risen to his feet offering andersons secretary his chair she shook her head avoiding eye contact the inspector she was telling the mp is currently under suspension pending an inquiry into his conduct now her eyes met rebuss i made a couple of calls one of andersons substantial eyebrows had lifted i did say i was offduty rebus reminded him im not sure it was quite as cutanddried as that ahthe appetizers two waiters were hovering one with smoked salmon the other with a bowl of orangecolored soup youll be leaving now inspector it was statement rather than request ben webster deserves a bit of consideration dont you think the mp ignored this unfolding his napkin but his secretary had no such qualms get out she snarled rebus nodded slowly and half turned before remembering something pavements round my way are in a shocking state he told his mp maybe you could spare the time to visit your constituency once in a while jump in the voice ordered rebus turned and saw that siobhan had parked in front of his tenement car looks good he told her just as well the money your friendly mechanic charged i was just headed upstairs change of plan i need you to come with me she paused you okay had a couple of drinks earlier did something i probably shouldnt now theres a novelty but she still managed to look aghast when he told her about his trip to the restaurant another lecture in store no doubt went his closing words you dont say siobhan closed her own door as rebus got into the passenger seat what about you he asked so she told him about her parents and the contents of stacey websters camera reached into the backseat and handed him the evidence so now we go talk to the councilman rebus guessed that was the plan why are you smiling he pretended to be studying the pictures your mum says shes not bothered who whacked hernobody seems worried about ben websters deathand yet here we both are he lifted his face toward her and gave a tired smile its what we do she replied quietly my point exactly no matter what anyone thinks or says i just worry that youve learned all the wrong lessons from me credit me with a bit of sense she chided him putting the car into gear councilman gareth tench lived in a sizable victorian villa on duddingston park it was a main road but its houses were set back far enough to give them some privacy not five minutes drive from niddrie yet it was another world respectable middle class quiet there was a golf course to the rear of the properties and portobello beach was within striking distance siobhan had taken a route along niddries main road so they could see that the campsite was disappearing fast want to drop in on your boyfriend rebus teased maybe you should stay in the car she retorted let me talk to tench im as sober as a judge rebus argued wellgetting there anyway theyd stopped at a garage on ratcliffe terrace so he could buy irnbru and tylenol inventor deserves the nobel prize rebus had stated without specifying which product he was referring to there were two cars parked in tenchs forecourt the whole front garden had been paved to make room for them lights blazed in the living room good cop bad cop rebus suggested as siobhan rang the doorbell she rewarded him with the beginnings of a smile the door was opened by a woman mrs tench siobhan asked holding up her id any chance of a word with your husband then tenchs voice from inside the house who is it louisa police gareth she bellowed back retreating a little by way of invitation they didnt need asking twice and were in the living room by the time tench trudged downstairs the fittings werent to rebuss taste sashed velvet drapes brass lamps fixed to the walls on either side of the fireplace two oversize sofas taking up much of the floor space oversize and brassy seemed to describe louisa tench too she wore dangling earrings and a clatter of bracelets the tan had come from a bottle or salon as had the piled auburn hair a little too much blue eye shadow and pink lipstick he counted five carriage clocks in the room and decided that nothing here had been chosen by the councilman evening sir siobhan said as tench walked into the room he rolled his eyes heavenward in reply dont they ever let up lord should i sue for harassment before you do that mr tench siobhan went on calmly maybe you could look at this photo she handed it to him you recognize your constituent of course hes the same one you hooked up with outside the court rebus added helpfully and by the waydenise says hello tench glanced fearfully toward his wife she was back in her chair staring at the tv with its sound muted what about these photos then he said louder than was strictly necessary youll notice that hes attacking that woman with a wooden stick siobhan continued rebus was watching carefullyand listening too in this next photo hes trying to melt back into the crowd but youll agree that hed just attacked an innocent bystander tench looked skeptical eyes flitting between one photo and the other digital arent they he pointed out easy enough to manipulate its not the photos that are being manipulated here mr tench rebus thought it his duty to state whats that supposed to mean we want his name siobhan said we can get it tomorrow morning from the court but wed prefer to get it from you he narrowed his eyes whys that then because wed siobhan paused because id like to know what the connection is twice at the campsite you just happened along to save the dayshe stabbed a finger at one photofrom him next thing youre waiting for him when he comes out of police custody and now this hes just another kid from the wrong part of town tench said keeping his voice down but emphasizing each word wrong parents wrong school wrong choices at every fork in the road but he lives on my turf and that means i look out for him same as i would do for any other poor bloody kid in his position if thats a crime ds clarke then im ready to go into the dock and argue my case a fleck of saliva escaped his mouth and hit siobhan on the cheek she brushed it away with the tip of a finger his name she repeated hes already been charged louisa tench was back in her chair one leg crossed over the other her eyes on the muted television gareth she said emmerdale dont want your wife missing her soap do you mr tench rebus added the opening titles were already onscreen she had the remote in her hand finger poised above the volume button three pairs of eyes boring into gareth tench and rebus mouthing the name denise again carberry tench said keith carberry music burst suddenly from the tv tench slid his hands into his pockets stalked out of the room rebus and siobhan waited a few moments then said their goodbyes to the woman who was tucking her legs beneath her on the chair she ignored them lost in a world of her own the front door was ajar tench waiting for them outside arms folded feet apart a smear campaigns not going to do anyone any good he told them just doing our job sir i grew up near a farm ds clarke he said i know bullshit when i smell it siobhan looked him up and down and i know a clown when i see one even out of costume she walked toward the pavement rebus pausing in front of tench leaning forward toward his ear the woman your boy smacked is her mother that means this never ends understood not until we get a result were happy with leaned back again and nodded reinforcing the message wife doesnt know about denise then he added thats how you connected me to ozyman tench guessed ellen wylie told you not very clever of you councilman playing away from home this is more a village than a city bound to come out sooner or christ rebus it wasnt like that tench hissed not for me to say sir and now i suppose youll go tell your employer well let him do what he likesim not about to bow down to his kindor yours tench gave a look of defiance rebus stood his ground a moment longer then gave a smile and followed siobhan back to the car special dispensation he asked once hed fastened his seat belt she looked across saw that he was waving a cigarette pack keep the window open she ordered rebus lit the cigarette and blew smoke into the evening sky theyd only gone forty yards when a car pulled out in front of them then braked blocking half the road hells this rebus hissed bentley siobhan told him sure enough as the brake lights dimmed cafferty emerged from the drivers side walking purposefully toward them leaning down so his head was framed by rebuss open window youre a ways from home rebus advised him so are you a wee visit to gareth tench eh i hope hes not trying to buy you off he thinks youre paying us five hundred a week rebus drawled made a counteroffer of two grand he blew smoke into caffertys face ive just bought a pub in portobello cafferty said wafting his hands in front of him come and have a drink last thing i need rebus told him a soft drink then what is it you want siobhan said her hands still gripped the steering wheel is it just me cafferty asked rebus or is she toughening up suddenly he reached a hand through the window snatching one of the photos from rebuss lap took a couple of steps back into the road holding it close to his face siobhan was out of the car in an instant marching toward him im not in the mood for this cafferty ah he was saying i did hear something about your motherand i recognize this little bastard siobhan stopped dead hand caught in midgrab for the photo names kevin or keith cafferty went on keith carberry she told him rebus was getting out of the car too by now he could see that cafferty had snared her nothing to do with you rebus warned him of course not cafferty agreed i can understand its personal just wondered if i could help thats all help how siobhan asked dont listen to him rebus warned but caffertys gaze had her transfixed any way i can he said quietly keith works for tench doesnt he wouldnt it be better to bring down both of them rather than just the messenger tench wasnt in princes street gardens and young keith doesnt have the sense he was born with cafferty countered tends to make lads like him suggestible christ siobhan rebus pleaded gripping her by the arm he wants tench taken down doesnt matter to him how it happens he wagged a finger at cafferty shes not part of this i was only offering cafferty held up his hands in surrender whats with the stakeout anyway got a baseball bat and a shovel in the bentley cafferty ignored him gave siobhan back the photograph pound to a penny keiths playing pool at that place in restalrig only one way to find out her eyes were on the photo when he said her name she blinked a couple of times and focused on him instead then she shook her head later she said he gave a shrug whenever you like you wont be there she declared he tried to look hurt hardly fair after everything ive told you you wont be there she repeated cafferty turned his attention to rebus did i say she was toughening up might have been an understatement might have been rebus agreed hed been steeping in a bath for twenty minutes when the intercom buzzed decided to ignore it then heard his cell ringing whoever it was left a messagethe phone beeped afterward to let him know when siobhan had dropped him hed warned her to go straight home get some rest shit he said realizing that she might be in trouble got out of the bath and wrapped a towel around himself leaving wet footprints as he padded into the living room but the message wasnt from siobhan it was ellen wylie she was outside in her car never been so popular with the ladies he muttered punching the callback button give me five minutes he told her then he went and changed back into his clothes the intercom sounded again he let her in and waited at the door listening to the sand paper sound of her shoes as she climbed the two flights of stone steps ellen always a pleasure he said im sorry john we were all down at the pub and i just couldnt stop thinking about it the bombings she shook her head your case she clarified they were in the living room by now she walked across to where the paperwork lay saw the wall and moved toward it scanning the pictures pinned there ive spent half the day reading about all these monstersreading what their victims families think of them and then having to alert those same bastards that there might be someone out for revenge it was still the right thing to do ellen time like this we need to feel were doing something say they were bombers instead of rapists whats the point in that he asked waiting until shed given an answering shrug then anything to drink maybe some tea she half turned toward him this is okay isnt it me barging in like this glad of the company he lied heading for the kitchen when he came back with the two mugs she was seated at the dining table poring over the first pile of paperwork hows denise he asked shes fine tell me ellen he paused until he was sure she was giving him her attention did you know tench is married separated she corrected him rebus pursed his lips not by much he added they live in the same house she didnt blink why are all men bastards john present company excepted naturally makes me wonder about him rebus went on why is he so interested in denise shes not that bad a catch rebus conceded the point with a twitch of the mouth all the same i suspect the councilman is attracted to victims some men are arent they what are you getting at im not sure reallyjust trying to work out what makes him tick why rebus snorted another bloody good question you think hes a suspect how many do we have she offered a shrug eric bain has managed to pull some names and details from the subscription list my guess is theyll turn out to be the families of victims or professionals working in the field which camp does tench fall into neither does that make him a suspect rebus was standing next to her staring down at the case notes we need a profile of the killer all we know so far is that he doesnt confront the victims yet he left trevor guest in a hell of a statecuts scratches bruises also left us guests cash card meaning we had his name straightaway youre calling that an anomaly she nodded but then you could just as easily say cyril colliar is the anomaly being the only scot rebus stared at a photograph of trevor guests face guest spent time up here he said hackman told me as much do we know where rebus shook his head slowly must be in the files somewhere any chance that the third victim had some scottish connection i suppose its possible maybe thats the key instead of concentrating on beastwatch we should be thinking more about the three victims you sound ready to get started she looked at him im too wired to sleep how about you i could always take some stuff away with me rebus shook his head again youre fine where you are he picked up a handful of reports and headed over to his chair switching on a floor lamp behind him before settling down wont denise worry where you are ill text her say im working late best not to mention wheredont want any gossip she smiled no she agreed we certainly wouldnt want that speaking of which should we let siobhan know know what shes in charge of the case isnt she i keep forgetting rebus replied casually going back to his reading it was almost midnight when he woke up ellen was tiptoeing back from the kitchen with a fresh mug of tea sorry she apologized i dozed off he said well over an hour ago she was blowing across the surface of the liquid did i miss anything nothing to report why dont you go to bed leaving you plugging away on your own he stretched his arms out feeling his spine crackle ill be fine you look exhausted so everyone keeps telling me hed risen to his feet and was walking toward the table how far have you got cant find any connection between edward isley and scotlandno family no jobs and no vacations i began to wonder if we were going at it from the wrong end how do you mean maybe it was colliar who had connections with the north of england good point but that doesnt seem to be panning out either maybe you need to take a break she hoisted the mug what does this look like i meant something more substantial she was rolling her shoulders havent got a jacuzzi or a masseur on the premises by any chance she saw the look on his face im joking she reassured him something tells me youre not an expert at back rubs besides but she broke off lifting the mug to her face besides what he asked she lowered the mug again well you and siobhan are colleagues he stated colleagues and friends nothing more than that despite the rumor mill stories have gone around she admitted and thats what they arestories meaning fiction wouldnt be the first time though would it i mean you and dcs templer gill templer was years back ellen im not saying she wasnt she stared into space this job we dohow many do you know manage to keep a relationship together there are a few shug davidsons been married twenty years she conceded the point but you me siobhandozens more i could name comes with the territory ellen all these other lives we get to know she wafted a hand over the case files and were useless at finding one for ourselves she looked at him theres really nothing between you and siobhan he shook his head so dont go thinking you can somehow drive a wedge between us she tried to look outraged by the suggestion but struggled for words youre flirting he told her only reason i can think of for that is so you can wind siobhan up jesus christ she slammed the mug down on the table splashing the paperwork spread out there of all the arrogant misguided thickheaded she was rising from her chair look if im wrong i apologize its the middle of the nightmaybe we both need some shuteye a thankyou would be nice she demanded for what for slogging while you were snoring for helping you out when it could cost me a tonguelashing for everything rebus stood seemingly dazed for another moment before opening his mouth and uttering the two words she wanted to hear thank you and fuck you too john she retorted picking up her coat and bag he stood back to give her room as she walked out listened to the door slam behind her took a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed the teastained paperwork no real damage he said to himself no real damage thanks for this morris gerald cafferty said holding open the passengerside door siobhan paused for a moment then decided to get in were just talking she warned him absolutely he closed her door gently and walked around to the drivers side its been a hell of a day hasnt it he said there was a bomb scare on princes street we dont move from here she decreed ignoring him he closed his own door and half turned toward her we could have talked upstairs she shook her head no way youre crossing that threshold cafferty accepted the slur on his character he peered out at her tenement thought youd be living somewhere better by now suits me fine she snapped back though i wouldnt mind knowing how you found me he gave a warm smile i have friends he told her one phone call job done yet you cant manage the same trick with gareth tench one call to a professional and hes never heard of again i dont want him dead he sought the right phrase just brought low as in humiliated cowed scared i think its time people saw him for what he is he leaned over a little closer you know what he is now but in focusing on keith carberry youll be missing a clear shot at the goal he gave another smile i speak as one soccer fan to another even if were on opposite sides in our choices were on opposite sides in everything caffertynever think otherwise he bowed his head slightly you even sound like him you know who rebus of course you both share the same hostile attitudethink you know better than anyone think you are better than anyone wow a counseling session see there you go again its almost as if rebus is working the strings he chuckled time you became your own woman siobhan and it has to happen before rebus gets the gold watchmeaning soon he paused no time like the present advice from you is the last thing i need im not offering adviceim offering to help between us we can bring tench down you made john the same offer didnt you that night at the church hall im betting he said no he wanted to say yes but he didnt rebus and me have been enemies too long siobhan weve almost forgotten what started it but you and me weve not got that history youre a gangster mr cafferty any help from you i become like you no he said shaking his head what you do is you put away the people responsible for that attack on your mother if all youve got to work from is that photo youre not going to get further than keith carberry and youre offering so much more she guessed like one of those shysters on the shopping channels now thats cruel he chided her cruel but fair she corrected him she was staring out through the windshield a taxi was dropping a drunklooking couple at their door as it moved away they hugged and kissed almost losing their balance on the pavement what about a scandal she suggested something that would put the councilman on the front of the tabloids anything in mind tench plays away from home she told him wife sitting in front of the tv while he visits his girlfriends how do you know this theres a colleague of mine ellen wylieher sisters but if news broke it wouldnt just be tench on the front pagesit would be denise too no she said shaking her head forget that stupid stupid stupid why because wed be hurting a woman whose skins more fragile than most then consider it forgotten she turned to face him so tell me what would you do if you were me how would you get to gareth tench through young keith of course he said as if it were the most obvious thing in the starlit world mairie was relishing the chase this wasnt features wasnt some puff piece for a pal of the editor or interviewasmarketingtool for an overhyped film or book it was an investigation it was why shed gone into journalism in the first place even the dead ends were thrilling and so far shed taken plenty of wrong turns but now shed been put in touch with a journalist down in londonanother freelancer the two of them had danced around each other during their first telephone conversation her london connection was attached to a tv project a documentary about iraq my baghdad laundrette it was going to be called at first he wouldnt tell her why but then shed mentioned her kenyan contact and the man in london had melted a little and shed allowed herself a smile if there was any dancing to be done shed be the one doing the leading baghdad laundrette because of all the money washing around iraq in general and its capital in particular billionsmaybe tens of billions of usbacked dollarshad gone into reconstruction and much of it could not be accounted for suitcases of cash used for the bribing of local officials palms greased to ensure that elections would go ahead no matter what american companies moving into the emerging market with extreme prejudice according to her new friend money sloshing around the various sides in the conflict needing to feel safe in these uncertain times needing to be armed shiites and sunnis and kurds yes water and electricity were necessities but so were efficient guns and rocket launchers for defense only of course because reconstruction could only come when people felt protected i thought arms were being taken out of the equation mairie had commented only to be put back in again as soon as nobodys looking and youre linking pennen to all of this mairie had eventually asked scribbling notes to herself furiously the phone clenched between cheek and shoulder just the tiniest portion hes a footnote a little ps at the end of the missive and its not even him per se really is it its the company he runs and the company he keeps she couldnt help adding in kenya hes been making sure his breads buttered on both sides funding the government and the opposition yes id heard about that as far as i know its no big deal but the diplomat kamweze had given her a little more cars for government ministers roadbuilding in districts run by opposition leaders new houses for the most important tribal leaders all of it described as aid while arms powered by pennen technology added to the national debt in iraq the london journalist went on pennen industries seems to fund rather a gray area of reconstructionnamely private defense contractors armed and subsidized by pennen it may be the first war in history run largely by the private sector so what do these defense contractors do act as bodyguards for people coming into the country to do business plus man the barricades protect the green zone ensure local dignitaries can turn their car key in the ignition without having to fear a godfather moment i get the picture theyre mercenaries right not at allperfectly legit but sponsored by pennen cash to a degree eventually shed ended the call with promises on both sides to stay in touch her london friend stressing that as long as she steered clear of the iraq story they might be able to help each other mairie had typed up her notes while they were fresh then had bounced through to the living room where allan was slumped in front of die hard watching all his old favorites again now that he had his home cinema to play with shed given him a hug and poured them each a glass of wine whats the occasion hed asked pecking her on the cheek allan she said youve been to iraqtell me about it later that night shed slipped out of bed her phone was beeping telling her she had a text it was from the westminster correspondent of the herald newspaper theyd sat next to each other at an awards dinner two years back knocking back the mouton cadet and laughing at the short lists in every single category mairie had kept in touch with him actually quite fancied him though he was marriedhappily married as far as she knew she sat on the carpeted stairs dressed in just a tshirt chin on her knees reading his text u shd hv said u had interest in pennen call me more shed done more than call him shed driven to glasgow in the middle of the night and made him meet her at a twentyfourhour café the place was full of studenty drunks bleary rather than loud her friend was called cameron bruceit was a joke with them the name that works just as well from both directions he arrived wearing a sweatshirt and jogging pants his hair tousled morning he said glancing meaningfully at his watch youve only got yourself to blame she chided him you cant go teasing a girl at close to midnight it has been known he replied the twinkle in his eye told her shed need to check the current status of that happy marriage she thanked god she hadnt arranged to meet him at a hotel spit it out then she said coffees not that bad actually he replied lifting his mug i didnt drive halfway across scotland for bad jokes cammy then why did you so she sat back and told him about her interest in richard pennen she left bits out of coursecammy was the competition after all despite being a friend he was wise enough to know there were gaps in her storyevery time she paused or appeared to change her mind about something he gave a little smile of recognition at one point she had to break off while the staff dealt with an unruly new client it was all done professionally and at speed and the man found himself back on the pavement gave the door a few kicks and the window a few thumps but then slouched away they ordered more coffees and some buttered toast and then cameron bruce told her what he knew or rather what he suspectedall of it based on stories doing the rounds and therefore to be taken with the usual shaker of salt she nodded her understanding party funding he stated mairies reaction feigned sudden sleep bruce laughed and told her it was actually quite interesting you dont say richard pennen it transpired was a major personal donor to the labor party nothing wrong with that not even when his own company stood to benefit from government contracts happens with capita bruce commented and plenty of others youre saying you dragged me all the way here to tell me pennens doing something completely legal and aboveboard mairie sounded less than overwhelmed im not so sure about that see mr pennen is playing on both sides of the net giving money to the tories as well as labor in a manner of speaking yes pennen industries has sponsored several tory shindigs and bigwigs but thats the company rather than pennen himself so hes probably not breaking any laws bruce just smiled mairie you dont have to break the law to get into trouble in politics she glared at him theres something else isnt there might be he said biting into another half slice of toast side four the final push friday july the front pages were carnage large color photos of the red london doubledecker survivors speckled with blood and soot eyes vacant one woman with a huge white compress held to

work boards removed from windows barriers lifted onto flatbed trucks the protesters were melting away from gleneagles too tony blair had flown back from london in time for the closing ceremony there would be speeches and signings but people seemed unsure how to feel about any of it the london bombs had given the perfect excuse for trade talks to be curtailed there would be extra aid for africa but not as much as the campaigners had wanted before poverty could be tackled the politicians had a more immediate war to wage rebus folded the newspaper closed and tossed it onto the small table next to his chair he was in a corridor on the top floor of lothian and borders police hq fettes avenue the summons had come just as rebus was stirring from bed the chief constables secretary had been insistent when rebus had tried querying the time frame at once shed stipulated which was why rebus had stopped off just long enough for a coffee bun and paper he still had the last chunk of dough ring in his hand when james corbyns door opened rebus stood thinking he would be going inside but corbyn seemed content that their conversation would take place right there in the corridor i thought youd been given fair warning di rebusyou were off the case yes sir rebus agreed well then well sir i knew i wasnt allowed to work the auchterarder case but thought id tie up a few loose ends regarding ben webster you were suspended from duty rebus looked dumbfounded not just the one case you know damned well what a suspension means sorry sirage creeping up it is indeed corbyn purred youre already on

with everything that happened rebus could feel corbyns eyes on him sweetheart he crooned into the phone im going to call you back promise he made a kissing sound and killed the call girlfriend he explained to corbyn shes a brave woman the chief constable said opening the door to his office meeting over keith siobhan was seated in her car window down keith carberry was walking toward the door of the pool hall the place opened at eight and siobhan had been there since quarter to just to be on the safe side watching sluggish workers trudging to the bus stop she motioned him toward the car with her hand he looked to left and right fearing some sort of ambush there was a thin black carrying case under his armhis personal cue siobhan reckoned it would come in handy as a weapon should occasion demand yeah he said remember me i can smell the bacon from here the hood of his navy top had been pulled over his pale baseball cap same outfit hed been wearing in the photos knew id be seeing you againyou were gagging for it that night he reinforced the message by adjusting his crotch with a cupped hand how was your day in court lovely charged with breach of the peace she recited bailed on condition you steer clear of princes street and sign in daily at craigmillar police station you stalking me ive heard of women who get obsessed like that he laughed and straightened up we done here just getting started fine he turned away see you inside then she called out his name again but he ignored her yanked open the door and went into the pool hall siobhan wound her window up got out and locked the car followed him into lonnies pool academy best tables in restalrig it was dimly lit and fuggy as though never quite cleaned properly at the end of each day there were already two tables in play carberry was sticking coins into a drinks machine pulling out a can of cola siobhan couldnt see any staff which meant they were probably playing balls clattered and dropped into pockets swearing seemed to be mandatory between shots lucky bastard fuck off six in the top corner watch this ya moron fanny alert four pairs of eyes looked up at siobhan only carberry ignored her drinking his drink there was a radio playing in the background its signal distorted help you sweetheart one of the players asked looking to play a few games she said handing him a fivepound note any chance of some change he was still in his teens but obviously ran the early shift took the note from her and keyed open the register behind the food counter counted out ten fiftypence pieces cheap tables she told him crap tables one of the players corrected her fuckin shut it jimmy the teenager said but jimmy was just getting into his stride hey sweetheart ever see that film the accused if you feel a jodie foster moment coming on we can make sure the doors bolted try anything youll be the one doing the bolting siobhan snapped back just ignore him the teenager advised her ill give you a game if you want its me she wants to take on keith carberry called out stifling a burp as he crushed the empty can in his fist maybe after siobhan told the teenager making her way to carberrys table she crouched to slot home the coin rack them up she said carberry got busy with the triangle while she chose a cue the tips were ragged and there was no sign of chalk carberry had opened his case screwed his twopiece cue together drew a fresh cube of blue from his pocket and got to work the chalk went back into his pocket and he winked at her want some youll have to reach in and get it going to toss me for break there were guffaws at this but siobhan was already leaning down over the cue ball the rustcolored baize was snagged in places despite which she made pretty good contact splitting open the pack a stripe finding the middle pocket potted two more before she missed an angle shes better than you are keith one of the other players chipped in carberry ignored him and potted three in a row tried doubling the fourth the length of the table missed by half an inch siobhan played safe and he decided to get out of the snooker by coming off three cushions fouled it two shots siobhan reminded him she needed both to pot her next ball then succeeded with a double of her own bringing a whoop from one of the other tables the games had paused so they could watch the last two pots were straightforward leaving only the black she ran it along the bottom cushion but it stopped in the jaws of the pocket carberry cleaned up want another tanning he asked with a smirk think ill get a drink first she walked over to the machine and got a fanta carberry followed her the other games were back in play seemed to siobhan shed won some level of acceptance youve not told them who i am she stated quietly thanks for that what is it youre after im after you keith she handed him a folded piece of paper it was a printout of the photo from princes street gardens he took it from her and studied it then tried handing it back so he said the woman you hittake another look at her she swigged from her can notice any family resemblance he stared at her youre joking she shook her head you put my mother in the hospital keith didnt matter to you who it was or how badly they were injured you went down there for a fight and you were going to get one and ive been to court for it i looked at the notes keith prosecutor doesnt know about this siobhan tapped the photo all hes got on you is witness testimony from the cop who pulled you out of the crowd saw you tossing the stick away what do you think youll get fiftypound fine payable at a pound a week directly out of my account but if i give them this photoand all the others ive gotsuddenly its looking more like jail isnt it nothing i cant handle he said with confidence she nodded because youve been inside more than once but theres time she paused and then theres time eh a word from me and suddenly the screws arent so friendly there are wings they can put you on where only the bad men go sex offenders psychopaths lifers with nothing to lose your record says youve done juvenile time open prisons with day release see the reason you say you can handle it is that you havent had to try all this because your mum got in the way of a swing all this she corrected him because i can tell you something thoughyour pal tench knew about this last night funny he didnt think to warn you the teenager in charge of the hall was getting a text message he called across to them hey lovebirdsboss wants a word carberry tore his eyes away from siobhan what boss the teenager was pointing to a door marked private above it screwed to the wall sat a surveillance camera i think we better oblige siobhan said dont you she led him toward the door and tugged it open hallway behind it and stairs leading up the roof space had become an office desk chairs filing cabinet broken cues and an empty water cooler light coming in through two dusty skylights and big ger cafferty waiting for them you must be keith he said holding out a hand carberry shook it his eyes flitting between the gangster and siobhan maybe you know who i am carberry hesitated then nodded of course you do cafferty gestured for the young man to sit siobhan stayed on her feet you own this place carberry asked with the slightest of tremors have done for years what about lonnie dead before you were born son cafferty brushed a hand over one of his trouser legs as if hed found some chalk dust there now keithi hear good things about youbut seems to me youve been led astray got to get back on the strait and narrow before its too late mum worries about youdads lost the plot now he cant hit you without getting hit twice as hard back older brother already in shotts for thieving cars cafferty gave a slow shake of his head its like your lifes mapped out nothing you can do but go along with it he paused but we can change that keith if youre willing to let us help carberry looked confused am i getting a whipping or what cafferty shrugged we can arrange that too of coursenothing ds clarke here would like better than to see you cry like a baby only fair when you think what you did to her mum another pause but then theres the alternative siobhan shifted a little part of her wanting to haul carberry out of there getting both of them away from caffertys hypnotic voice the gangster seemed to sense this and shifted his gaze to her for a moment awaiting her decision what alternative keith carberry was asking cafferty didnt answer his eyes were still locked on siobhan gareth tench she explained to the young man we want him and you keith cafferty added are going to deliver deliver siobhan noticed that carberrys legs were all but refusing to hold him up he was terrified of cafferty terrified of her too most probably you wanted this she told herself tench is using you keith cafferty was saying his voice as soft as a bedtime lullaby hes not your friend never has been never said he was the youth felt compelled to argue good lad cafferty was rising slowly to his feet almost as wide as the desk he now stood behind just keep telling yourself that he advised itll make everything so much easier when the time comes time carberry echoed to turn him over to us sorry about earlier rebus told stan hackman what was i interrupting a whipping from my chief constable hackman laughed youre a man after my own heart johnny boy but why did i have to become your sweetheart he held up a hand no let me guess you didnt want him to know it was businessmeaning youre not supposed to have any businessam i right ive been suspended rebus confirmed hackman clapped his hands together and laughed again they were sitting in a pub called the crags it had just opened and they were the only customers it was the nearest watering hole to pollock halls and catered to students with its array of video and board games a sound system and cheap burgers glad someone finds my life such a source of fun rebus muttered so how many anarchists did you thump rebus shook his head i just kept sticking my nose in where it wasnt wanted like i say johna man after my own heart by the way i havent thanked you properly for introducing me to the nook glad to be of service did you end up bedding the pole dancer no tell you what she was the best of a mediocre bunch i didnt even bother with the vip booth his eyes glazed over for a moment lost to memories then he blinked and shook himself back to the present so now that youve been redcarded what do i do offer you the info ive gleaned or stick it in the pending pile rebus took a sip from his glassfresh orange hackman had already seen off half his lager were just two combatants having a chat rebus told him that we are the englishman nodded thoughtfully and sharing a final drink before im off youre shipping out later today he confirmed i wont say it hasnt been fun come back another time rebus offered ill show you the rest of the sights well that just about finalizes the deal he slid a little farther forward on his chair remember i told you trevor guest spent some time up here well i asked one of the lads back at base to dust off the archives he reached into his pocket for a notebook and opened it at a page of jottings trevor was in the borders for a bit but he spent more time right here in edinburgh he jabbed the tabletop with a fingertip had a room in craigmillar and helped out at a day centerthey cant have been doing background checks back then a day center for adults old people he wheeled them from shit house to dinner table at least thats what he told us he had a criminal record by then couple of burglariesclassa possessionroughed up a girlfriend but she wouldnt take it to court means two of your victims have a local connection yes rebus agreed how far back are we talking four five years can you give me a minute stan he got up and walked into the parking lot took out his cell and called mairie henderson its john he told her about bloody time whys everything gone quiet on the clootie well case my editors nagging me stupid ive just discovered that the second victim spent some time in edinburgh worked in a day center in craigmillar im wondering if he got himself into any trouble while he was here dont the police have computers to tell them things like that i prefer to use good oldfashioned contacts i can do a search of the database maybe ask our court guy if he knows anything joe cowries been doing the job for decadesand he remembers every bloody case just as wellthis may go back five years call me with whatever you get you think the killer could be right here under our noses i wouldnt go telling your editor might have to dash his hopes at a later date rebus ended the call and went back inside hackman had settled down with a fresh pint he nodded toward rebuss glass i wouldnt insult you by offering to buy another of those im fine rebus assured him thanks for taking a bit of trouble with this he tapped the open notebook anything for a fellow officer in his hour of need hackman toasted him with the glass speaking of which whats the mood like at pollock hackmans face hardened last night was grim lot of the met lads were on their phones nonstop others had already shipped out i know we all hate the place but when i saw those londoners on the tv determined to keep going no matter what rebus nodded agreement bit like yourself eh john he laughed again i can see it in your faceyoure not about to give up just because theyre out to nail you rebus took a moment to consider his response then asked hackman if he happened to have an address for the day center in craigmillar it wasnt much more than a fiveminute drive from the crags on the way rebus took a call from mairie who was drawing blanks on trevor guests time in edinburgh if joe cowrie didnt remember him he hadnt ended up in court rebus thanked her anyway and promised she still had first refusal on anything he dug up hackman had gone back to pollock to begin packing theyd parted with a handshake and a reminder from hackman about rebuss promised tour of the fleshpots beyond the nook you have my word rebus had told him neither man really believing it would ever happen the day center was next door to an industrial factory rebus could smell diesel fumes and something like burning rubber gulls were on the scrounge cackling overhead the center itself was an extended bungalow with a sun trap added through the windows he could see old people listening to accordion music ten years from now john he muttered to himself and thats if youre lucky the very efficient secretary was called mrs eadieno first name offered but although trevor had only worked a couple of hours a week and then only for a month or so she still had his paperwork in the filing cabinet no she couldnt show it to himright to privacy and so on if he applied for permission well that might be another story rebus nodded his understanding the buildings thermostat was set to death ray and sweat was pouring down his back the office was tiny and airless with a sickly background aroma of talcum powder this guy he told mrs eadie hed had some trouble with the police how come you didnt know that when you hired him we knew hed had problems inspector gareth told us as much rebus stared at her councilman tench tench brought trevor guest here never easy to get strong young men to work in a place like this mrs eadie explained the councilmans always been a good friend to us finding you volunteers you mean she nodded we owe him a debt of gratitude im sure hell be round to collect it one of these days five minutes later as rebus emerged into the fresh air he could hear that the accordion had been replaced by a recording of moira anderson there and then he made a vow to off himself rather than sit with a shawl across his lap being spoonfed boiled eggs to the strains of charlie is my darling siobhan sat in her car outside rebuss tenement shed already been upstairs he wasnt home probably just as wellshe was still shaking felt jittery inside and didnt think she could blame the caffeine when she checked herself in the rearview mirror her face was paler than usual she gave her cheeks a few pats trying to cheat some of the color back she had the radio on but had given up on the news stations all the voices sounded either too brittle and urgent or syrupy and colluding shed settled instead for classic fm recognized the tune but couldnt name it couldnt even be bothered trying keith carberry had walked out of lonnies pool academy like a man whose lawyers had just secured his release from death row if there was a world outside he wanted a taste of it the manager had had to remind him to pick up his cue on the way out siobhan had watched the whole thing on surveillance cameras the screen had been greasy blurring the figures cafferty had wired the place for sound too voices crackling from a batteredlooking speaker some feet away from the monitor wheres the fire keith get lost jimbob what about your light saber carberry pausing just long enough to replace the cue in its case i think cafferty had said quietly we can safely say weve got him for what its worth siobhan had added got to be patient cafferty advised a lesson well worth the learning ds clarke now in her car she pondered her options the simplest would be to hand the evidence over to the public prosecutor get keith carberry in court again on the more serious charge that way tench would go untouched but so what even supposing the councilman had set up those attacks on the niddrie campsite he really had come to her rescue in the gardens behind the flatscarberry hadnt been toying with her his blood was up adrenaline pumping the threat had been for real hed wanted to taste her fear see her panic not always controllable tench just managing to rescue the situation she owed him that much on the other hand carberry in exchange for her mother didnt sound like a fair deal didnt taste like justice she wanted more beyond an apology or a show of remorse beyond a custodial sentence of weeks or months when her phone rang she had to ease her fingers from around the steering wheel the screen said it was eric bain she whispered an oath before answering what can i do for you eric she asked just a little too brightly hows it all going siobhan slowly she admitted with a laugh pinching the bridge of her nose no hysterics girl she warned herself well im not sure about this but i might have someone you should talk to oh yes she works at the university i helped her out months back with a computer simulation good for you there was a moments silence on the line sure youre all right im fine eric hows everything with you hows molly mollys greati uh was telling you about this lecturer of course you were you think i should go see her well maybe just call her up first i mean it might turn out to be a dead end it usually does eric thanks for nothing siobhan closed her eyes and sighed loudly into the phone sorry eric sorry shouldnt be taking it out on you taking what out on me a weeks worth of crap he laughed apology accepted ill call again later when youve had a chance to just hang on a sec will you she reached across to the passenger seat extracting her notebook from her bag give me her number and ill talk to her he recited the number and she jotted it down adding the name as best she could neither of them being totally sure how it was spelled so what is it you think she might have for me siobhan asked a few crackpot theories sounds great cant do any harm to listen bain advised but by now siobhan knew differently knew that listening could have repercussions bad ones at that rebus hadnt been to the city chambers in a while the building was situated on the high street opposite st giles cathedral cars were supposedly banned from the road between the two but like most locals rebus ignored the signs and parked curbside he seemed to remember hearing that the councils hq had been built as some sort of merchants meeting place but the local traders had shunned it and carried on as before rather than concede defeat the politicians had moved in and made it their own soon however theyd be on the movea parking lot next to waverley station had been earmarked for development no way of telling as yet how far over budget it would run if it turned out anything like the parliament the bars of edinburgh would soon have a fresh topic to inflame the drinkers indignation the city chambers had been built on top of a plague street called mary kings close years back rebus had investigated a murder in the dank underground labyrinthcaffertys own son the victim the place had been tidied up now and was a tourist haunt in the summer one of the staff was busy on the pavement handing out flyers she wore a housemaids cap and layered petticoats and tried to offer rebus a discount coupon he shook his head the papers said local attractions were feeling the bite of the gweek tourists had been steering clear of the city hiho silver lining rebus muttered starting to whistle the songs first verse the receptionist at the front desk asked him if it was madonna then smiled to let him know she was teasing gareth tench please rebus said i doubt hell be here she warned friday you knowa lot of our councilmen do district business on a friday giving them an excuse to knock off early rebus guessed i dont know what youre implying but her smile was back meaning she knew damned well rebus liked her checked for a wedding ring and found one changed his whistling to another one bites the dust she was looking down a list on the clipboard in front of her seems youre in luck she announced urban regeneration committee subgroup she glanced at the clock behind her meetings due to break up in five minutes ill tell the secretary youre here mr detective inspector rebus he offered a smile of his own john if you prefer take a seat john he gave a little bow of his head in thanks the other receptionist was having a lot less luck trying to fend off an elderly couple who wanted to talk to someone about the trash bins in their street through wi they lazy bastards weve got the car numbers an evthing but naebodys been near rebus took a seat and decided against any of the reading material council propaganda disguised as newsletters they appeared regularly in rebuss mailbox helping him contribute to the recycling effort his cell sounded and he flipped it open mairie hendersons number what can i do for you mairie he asked i forgot to tell you this morningim getting somewhere with richard pennen tell me more he moved outside into the quadrangle again the lord provosts rover was parked by the glasspaneled doors he stopped next to it and lit a cigarette business correspondent on one of the london broadsheets put me on to a freelancer who sells stuff to the likes of private eye he in turn set me up with a tv producer whos been keeping an eye on pennen ever since the company split off from the mod okay so youve earned your pennies this week well maybe ill just head to harvey nicks and start spending them all right im shutting up now pennen has links to an american company called trimerino theyve got people on the ground in iraq just now during the war a lot of equipment got trashed including weaponry trimerino are in the business of rearming the good guys whoever they are making sure the iraqi police and any new armed forces can hold their own they see it aswait for thisa humanitarian mission meaning theyre looking for aid money billions are being poured into iraq quite a bits already gone missing but thats another story the murky world of foreign aid thats the tv producers pitch and hes lassoing richard pennen hoping to and how does this tie in to my dead politician any sign that ben webster had control of iraqi aid money not yet she conceded rebus noticed that some of his ash had landed on the rovers gleaming hood i get the feeling youre holding something back nothing to do with your deceased mp going to share with uncle john might not come to anything she paused i can still make a story though im the first print journalist the producers told the whole story to good for you you could try that again with a bit more enthusiasm sorry mairieminds on other things if you can tighten the screws on pennen so much the better but it doesnt necessarily help you youve been doing me a lot of favorsonly right you get something out of it my feelings exactly she paused again any progress your end im betting you visited the day center where trevor guest worked didnt get much anything worth sharing not yet that sounds like evasion rebus moved aside as some people started to emerge from the buildinga liveried driver followed by another man in uniform carrying a small case and behind them the lord provost she seemed to notice the flecks of ash on her vehicle gave rebus a scowl and disappeared into the back of the car the two men got into the front rebus guessing that the case held her chain of office thanks for letting me know about pennen he told mairie keep in touch its your turn to phone me she reminded him now were back on speaking terms i dont want oneway traffic he ended the call stubbed out his cigarette and headed back indoors where his receptionist had joined in the debate about trash bins its environmental health you need to speak to she was stressing nae good hen that lot never listen summats got to be done his wife shouted folk are fed up being treated like numbers all right the first receptionist said caving in with a sigh ill see if someones available to talk to you take a ticket from over there she nodded toward the dispenser the old man pulled a sliver of paper from it and stared at what hed been given a number rebuss receptionist beckoned him over leaned forward to whisper that the councilman was on his way down she glanced toward the couple letting him know she didnt want them to share in the information im assuming its official business she asked fishing for some inside info rebus leaned even closer to her ear smelling perfume rising from her nape im wanting my drains cleaned he confided she looked shocked for a moment then gave a lopsided grin hoping he was joking moments later tench himself emerged grimly into the reception area he was clasping a briefcase to his chest as though it could afford some useful protection this is a bollock hair away from serious harassment he hissed rebus nodded as if in agreement then stretched out an arm in the direction of the waiting couple this is councilman tench he informed them hes the helpful sort they were already on their feet and shuffling toward the glowering tench ill be waiting outside when youre done rebus told him hed smoked another cigarette by the time tench emerged through the window rebus could see that the couple had taken their seats again looking satisfied for the moment as though some further meeting had been arranged youre a bastard rebus tench growled give me one of those cigs i didnt know you indulged tench lifted a cigarette from the pack only when im stressedbut this smoking bans on the horizon so i figure i should claim my share while i can with the cigarette lit he inhaled deeply letting the smoke pour down his nostrils only real pleasure some people have you know remember john reid talking about single mums in the projects rebus remembered it well but reid the defense secretary had given up the smokes so wasnt much of an apologist for the habit sorry i did that rebus offered nodding in the direction of the window theyve got a point tench conceded someones coming to talk to themwasnt too happy about me calling him mind i think his tee shot had just clipped the ninth green chip and run for a birdie he smiled and rebus smiled with him they smoked in silence for a moment the atmosphere could almost have been called companionable but then tench had to spoil it why do you side with cafferty hes a badder bugger than i could ever be im not disputing it well then i dont side with him rebus stated not what it looks like then youre refusing to see the whole picture im good at what i do rebus if you dont believe me talk to the people i represent im sure youre terrific at what you do mr tench and sitting on the regeneration committee must tip a load of cash into your district making your constituents cheerful healthy and well behaved slums have been replaced by new housing local industry offered incentives to stay put nursing homes given upgrades rebus added absolutely and staffed by your own recommendations trevor guest being a case in point who while back you placed him in a day center he was from newcastle originally tench was nodding slowly hed had a few problems with drink and drugs happens to some of us doesnt it inspector tench gave rebus a meaningful look i was looking to integrate him into the community didnt work he headed back south to be murdered murdered one of the three whose effects we found in auchterarder another was cyril colliar funnily enough he used to work for big ger cafferty youre at it againtrying to pin something on me tench made jabbing motions with the cigarette just want to ask about the victim how you met him why you felt the need to help its what i doi keep telling you that cafferty thinks youre muscling in tench rolled his eyes weve been through all this all i want is for him to be consigned to the scrap heap and if we wont do it you will ill do my damnedestive already said as much he rubbed his palms across his face as though washing has the penny not dropped yet rebus always supposing youre not in his pocket hasnt it occurred to you that he might be using you to get to me big drug problem in my wardsomething ive vowed to control with me out of the way cafferty has free rein youre in charge of the gangs down there im not ive seen the way it works your little runt of a hood runs amok gives you the chance to state your case for more cash from the authorities youve turned havoc into a nice little earner tench stared at him then gave a loud exhalation he looked to the left and right between us but rebus wasnt about to comply all right maybe theres an element of truth in what you say money for regeneration thats the bottom line im happy to show you the booksyoull see that every last cent and penny is accounted for whats carberry listed under on the balance sheet you dont control someone like keith carberry a bit of channeling sometimes tench offered a shrug what happened in princes street had nothing to do with me rebuss cigarette was down to its filter he flicked it away and trevor guest was a damaged man who came to me for help he said he wanted to give something back for what tench shook his head slowly stubbing his cigarette underfoot and began to look thoughtful i got the feeling something had happenedput the fear of death into him what sort of thing a shrug the drugs maybedark night of the soul hed had a bit of trouble with the police but seemed to me there was more to it than that he went to jail eventually aggravated burglary assault attempted sexual assault your good samaritan act didnt exactly win him over i hope its never been an act tench said quietly eyes focused on the street beneath him youre putting on an act right now rebus told him i think you do it because youre good at it same sort of act that got ellen wylies sister out of her pantiesbit of wine and sympathy at your end and no mention of the missus back home in front of the tv tench made a pained face but all rebus did was give a cold chuckle im curious he went on you looked at the beastwatch siteits how you snared ellen and her sister so you had tove seen your old pal trevors picture there seems odd to me that you never said and put myself further in the frame youve been trying to nail together around me tench shook his head slowly ill need something in your own words about trevor guesteverything youve told me and anything else you can add you can drop it off at gayfield squarethis afternoon will do hope thats not going to eat into your golf time tench looked at him how do you know i play way you spoke earlierlike you knew what you were talking about rebus leaned toward him youre easy enough to read councilman compared to some ive known youre dick and fucking jane the line was adequate and rebus left tench with it back at the car a warden was hovering rebus pointed out the police notice on his dashboard at our discretion the warden reminded him rebus blew the man a kiss and got behind the steering wheel as he pulled away he checked in his rearview and saw that someone was watching from outside the cathedral same outfit hed been wearing that day at court keith carberry rebus slowed the car but kept moving carberrys attention shifted and rebus stopped the saab kept watching in the rearview expected carberry to cross the street go say a few words to his employer but he stayed where he was hands tucked into the front of his hooded jacket some sort of narrow black carry case held beneath one arm content to stand in the midst of what tourists there were paying them no heed staring across the road toward the city chambers the city chambersand gareth tench what have you been up to rebus asked shed been waiting for him on arden street hed said maybe he should give her a key if they were going to keep using his place as an office not much siobhan replied taking off her jacket how about you they went into the kitchen and he boiled the kettle telling her about trevor guest and councilman tench she asked a few questions watching him spoon coffee into two mugs gives us our edinburgh connection she agreed of a kind you sound doubtful he shook his head you said so yourselfso did ellen trevor guest could be the key started off looking different from the others with all those wounds he broke off what is it but he shook his head again stirred a spoon in his mug tench thinks something happened to him guest had been taking drugs hitting the bottle pretty hard then he scurries north and ends up in craigmillar meets the councilman works with old people for a few weeks nothing in the case notes to suggest he did anything like that before or since funny thing to do when youre a thief and you probably need a bit of cash unless he was planning to fleece them in some way did the day center mention anything about money going missing rebus shook his head but took out his phone and called mrs eadie to ask by the time shed answered in the negative siobhan was seated at the dining table in the living room delving into the files again what about his time in edinburgh she asked i got mairie to check she looked at him didnt want anyone else getting wind that were still active so what did mairie say her answer wasnt definitive time to call ellen he knew she was right and made that call too but warned ellen wylie to be careful start searching the computer and youll be leaving a calling card im a big girl john maybe so but the chief constables keeping a beady eye itll be fine he wished her luck and slid the phone back into his pocket you all right he asked siobhan why seemed to be in a dream have you spoken to your parents not since they left best thing you can do is hand those photos to the public prosecutor make sure of a conviction she nodded but didnt look convinced thats what youd do right she asked if someone had lashed out at your nearest and dearest theres not much room on the ledge shiv she stared at him what ledge the one i always seem to be perched on you know you dont want to be standing too close whats that supposed to mean it means hand over the photos leave the rest to judge and jury her eyes were still boring into his youre probably right no alternative he added none youd ever want to consider thats true or you could always ask me to kick the crap out of mr baseball cap arent you a bit long in the tooth for that she asked with the hint of a smile probably he acknowledged might not stop me trying though well theres no need i only wanted the truth she considered for a moment i mean when i thought it was one of us way this weeks gone it might well have been he said quietly pulling out a chair and seating himself across from her but i couldnt have stood it john thats what im getting at he made a show of turning some of the paperwork toward him youd have thrown it in it was an option but now its all right again he was hoping for some reassurance she gave a slow nod picking up some paperwork of her own why hasnt he struck again it took rebuss brain a moment to shift gears hed been on the verge of telling her about seeing keith carberry outside the city chambers ive no idea he eventually conceded i mean they speed up right once they get a taste for it thats the theory and they dont just stop maybe some do whatever it is inside themmaybe it gets buried somehow he shrugged i dont pretend to be an expert me neither thats why were meeting someone who claims she is what siobhan was checking her watch in an hour from now which just gives us time to decide what questions we need to ask the university of edinburgh department of psychology was based in george square two sides of the original georgian development had been flattened and replaced with a series of concrete boxes but the psychology department was based in an older building sandwiched between two such blocks dr roisin gilreagh had a room on the top floor with views over the gardens nice and quiet this time of year siobhan commented the students being gone i mean except that in august the gardens play host to various fringe shows dr gilreagh countered offering a whole new human laboratory rebus added the room was small and awash with sunlight dr gilreagh was in her midthirties with thick curly blond hair falling past her shoulders and pinched cheeks that rebus took to be clues as to her irish ancestry despite the resolutely local accent when she smiled at rebuss comment her sharp nose and chin seemed to become even more jagged i was telling di rebus on the way here siobhan interrupted that youre considered a bit of an expert in the field i wouldnt go that far dr gilreagh felt obliged to argue but there are interesting times ahead in the field of offender profiling the crichton street parking light is being turned into our new center for informatics part of which will be dedicated to behavior analysis add in neuroscience and psychiatry and you begin to see that there are potentials she beamed at both her visitors but you work for none of those particular departments rebus couldnt help pointing out true true she was happy to acknowledge she kept twitching in her seat as though stillness were a crime motes of dust danced across the sunbeams in front of her face could we maybe draw the blind he suggested squinting a little for effect she leaped to her feet and apologized as she pulled the blind down it was pale yellow and made from something like tent canvas doing little to relieve the rooms glare rebus gave siobhan a look as if to suggest that dr gilreagh was kept locked in the attic for a reason tell di rebus about your research siobhan said encouragingly well dr gilreagh clapped her hands together straightened her back gave a little wriggle and took a deep breath behavioral patterning in offenders is nothing new but ive been concentrating on victims its by delving into the behavior of the victim that we begin to see why offenders act the way they do whether on impulse or through a more deterministic approach almost goes without saying rebus offered with a smile term time being over and thus having room for some smaller personal projects i was intrigued by the little shrinei suppose the description is fittingin auchterarder the newspaper reports were sometimes sketchy but i decided to take a look anywayand then as if it were meant to be detective sergeant clarke asked for a meeting she took another deep breath i mean my findings arent really ready tono what i mean is ive only scratched the surface as yet we can get the case notes to you siobhan assured her if that would help but in the meantime wed be grateful for any thoughts you might have dr gilreagh clapped her hands together again stirring the cloud of dust particles in front of her well she said interested as i am in victimologyrebus tried to catch siobhans eye but she wouldnt let himi have to admit that the site stirred my curiosity its a statement isnt it im guessing youve considered the possibility that the killer lives locally or has some longstanding knowledge of the immediate area she waited till siobhan had nodded and you will also have speculated that the murderer knows of the clootie well because its existence is recorded in various guidebooks and also extensively on the world wide web siobhan sneaked a glance at rebus actually we hadnt really followed that particular path she admitted its mentioned on various sites dr gilreagh assured her new age and pagan directoriesmyths and legendsworld mysteries allied to which anyone with a knowledge of the sister site on the black isle might have come across the one in perthshire im not sure this gets us anywhere we havent already been rebus said siobhan looked at him again people who accessed the beastwatch site she stated what if they also accessed sites referring to the clootie well and how would we find out the inspector raises a fair question dr gilreagh admitted though of course you may have computer experts of your ownbut in the interim one has to concede that the location must have some significance for the perpetrator she waited until rebus had nodded in which case might it also have significance for the victims in what way rebus asked eyes narrowing countrysidedeep woodsbut close to human dwellings is this the sort of terrain the victims inhabited rebus snorted hardly likelycyril colliar was an edinburgh bouncer fresh out of jail cant see him with a knapsack and bar of kendall mint cake but edward isley traveled up and down the m siobhan countered and thats the lake district isnt it plus trevor guest spent time in the borders as well as newcastle and edinburgh rebus turned to the psychologist all three served timethats your link right there doesnt mean there arent others siobhan warned or that youre not being led astray dr gilreagh said with a kindly smile led astray siobhan echoed either by patterns that dont exist or patterns the killer is placing in full view to toy with us siobhan guessed its a possibility there is such a huge sense of playfulness she broke off her face falling into a frown youll have to forgive me if that sounds frivolous but its the only word i can think of this is a killer determined to be seen as shown by the display he left at clootie well and yet as soon as his work is discovered he withdraws perhaps behind a smoke screen rebus leaned forward elbows on knees youre saying all three victims are a smoke screen she gave a little wriggle of her shoulders which he interpreted as a shrug a smoke screen for what he persevered she wriggled again rebus threw an exasperated look toward siobhan the display gilreagh said at last is slightly wrong a piece cut from a jacketa sports shirta pair of cord trousersinconsistent you see a serial killers trophies would normally be more similaronly shirts or only patches its an untidy collection and ultimately not quite right this is all very interesting dr gilreagh siobhan said quietly but does it get us any further im not a detective the psychologist stressed but coming back to the rural motif and the display which may be a classic magicians feintid wonder again about why those particular victims were chosen she began nodding to herself you see sometimes victims choose themselves almost in that they fulfill the killers basic needs sometimes all that means is a lone woman in a vulnerable situation but most often there are other considerations she focused her attention on siobhan when we spoke on the phone ds clarke you mentioned anomalies those can be signifiers in themselves she paused meaningfully but scrutiny of the case notes might help me toward a more thorough determination she was looking at rebus now i can hardly blame you for your skepticism inspector but contrary to all your available visual evidence im not in the least bit batty im sure youre not dr gilreagh she clapped her hands together again and this time leaped to her feet to indicate that their time was up meantime she said rurality and anomalies rurality and anomalies she held up two fingers to stress the point then added a third and perhaps above all else wanting you to see things that arent really there is rurality even a word rebus asked siobhan turned the ignition it is now and youre still going to give her the notes worth a shot because were that desperate unless youve got a better idea but he had no answer for that and rolled down the window so he could smoke they passed the old parking lot informatics rebus muttered siobhan signaled right making toward the meadows and arden street the anomaly is trevor guest she ventured once a few more minutes had elapsed weve said that from the start so so we know he spent time in the bordersdoesnt get much more rural than that hell of a long way from either auchterarder or black isle rebus stated but something happened to him in the borders weve only got tenchs word for that fair point she conceded all the same rebus got out hackmans number and gave him a call ready for me he asked are you missing me already hackman replied recognizing rebuss voice one question i meant to askwhere in the borders did trevor guest spend time do i hear the sound of a hand grasping at straws you do rebus conceded well im not sure i can be much of a lifeguard i seem to think guest mentioned the borders during one of our sessions with him weve not seen all the transcripts yet rebus reminded him lads in newcastle being their usual efficient selves got an email address on you john rebus recited it check your computer in about an hours time but be warnedpoets day meaning the cid cupboard might be a bit on the mother hubbard side appreciate anything you can get for us stan happy trails rebus clicked the phone shut poets day he reminded siobhan piss off early tomorrows saturday she recited speaking of whichyou still going to t in the park tomorrow not sure you fought hard enough for the ticket might wait till evening i can still catch new order after a hard saturdays work you were thinking of a walk along the seafront at portobello depends on newcastle doesnt it been a while since i took a day trip to the borders she doubleparked and climbed the two flights with him the plan was to have a quick recon of the case notes decide what might be useful to dr gilreagh and head to a copy shop with them ended up with a pile an inch thick good luck rebus said as she headed out the door he could hear a horn blaring downstairsa motorist shed managed to block he pulled the window open to let in some air then collapsed into his chair he felt dog tired his eyes stung and his neck and shoulders ached he thought again of the massage ellen wylie had wanted him to offer had she really meant anything by it didnt matterhe was just relieved now nothing had happened his waist strained against his trouser belt he undid his tie and opened the top two buttons of his shirt felt the benefit so worked the belt loose too jumpsuits what you need fatso he chided himself jumpsuit and slippers and a homehelp nurse in fact everything short of charlie is my darling and just a touch more selfpity he rubbed a hand over one knee kept waking in the night with a sort of cramp there rheumatics arthritis wear and tearhe knew there was no point troubling his doctor hed been there before with the blood pressure less salt and sugar cut down the fat get some exercise kick the booze and ciggies to the curb rebuss response had been shaped as a question ever felt you could just write it on a board stick it on your chair and bugger off home for the afternoon producing one of the weariest smiles hed ever seen on a young mans face the phone rang and he told it to get stuffed anyone wanted him that much theyd try the cell sure enough it rang thirty seconds later he took his time picking it up ellen wylie yes ellen he asked didnt feel she needed to know hed just been thinking of her only the one wee spot of trouble for trevor guest during his stay in our fine city enlighten me he leaned his head against the back of the chair letting his eyes close got into a fight on ratcliffe terrace you know it where the taxi drivers buy their gas i was there last night theres a pub across the street called swanys ive been in a few times now theres a surprise well guest went there at least the once a drinker seemed to take against him and it ended up outside one of our cars happened to be in the garage forecourtstocking up on provisions no doubt both combatants were taken into custody for the night that was it never went to court witnesses saw the other man swing the first punch we asked guest if he wanted to press charges and he declined i dont suppose you know what they were fighting about i could try asking the arresting officers i dont suppose it matters what was the other guys name duncan barclay she paused he wasnt local thoughgave an address in coldstream is that in the highlands wrong end of the country ellen rebus had opened his eyes was easing himself upright its bang in the middle of the borders he asked her to wait while he readied some paper and a pen then picked up the phone again okay give me what youve got he told her the driving range was floodlit not that it was completely dark yet but the brilliance of the illumination made it look like a film set mairie had hired a threewood and a basket containing fifty balls the first two stalls were taken plenty of gaps after that automatic teesmeant you didnt have to go to the trouble of bending down to replace the ball after each shot the range was broken up into fiftyyard sections nobody was hitting out on the grass a machine resembling a miniaturized combineharvester was scooping up the balls its driver protected by a mesh screen mairie saw that the very last stall was in use the golfer there was getting a lesson he addressed the tee took a swing and watched his ball hit the ground no more than seventy yards away better the instructor lied but try to focus on not bending that knee im scooping again his pupil guessed mairie placed her metal basket on the ground next stall over decided to take a few practice swings loosen up her shoulders instructor and pupil seemed to resent her presence excuse me the instructor said mairie looked at him he was smiling at her over the partition we actually booked that bay but youre not using it mairie informed him point is we paid for it a matter of privacy the other man butted in sounding irritated then he recognized mairie oh for pitys sake his instructor turned to him you know her mr pennen shes a bloody reporter richard pennen said then to mairie whatever it is you want ive got nothing to say fine by me mairie answered readying for her first shot the ball sailed into the air making a clean straight line to the yard flag pretty good the instructor told her my dad taught me she explained youre a professional arent you she asked i think ive seen you on the circuit he nodded his agreement not at the open didnt qualify he admitted cheeks reddening if the two of you have finished richard pennen interrupted mairie just shrugged and prepared for another shot pennen seemed to be doing likewise but then gave up look he said what the hell do you want mairie said nothing until shed watched her ball sail into the sky dropping just short of and a little to the left bit of finetuning needed she told herself then to pennen just thought i should offer fair warning fair warning of what exactly probably wont make the paper till monday she mused time enough for you to prepare some sort of response are you baiting me miss henderson she told him mairie hendersonthats the byline youll read on monday and what will the headline be pennen industries secures scottish jobs at g that one might make the business pages she decided but mine will be page one up to the editor how he phrases it she pretended to think how about loans scandal envelops government and opposition pennen gave a harsh laugh he was swinging his club onehanded to and fro thats your big scoop is it i daresay theres plenty of other stuff to come out in the wash your efforts in iraq your bribes in kenya and elsewhere but for now i think ill stick with the loans see a little birdie tells me that youve been bankrolling both labor and the tories donations are a matter of record but loans can be kept hushhush thing is i very much doubt either party knows youre backing the other makes sense to me pennen split off from the mod because of decisions made under the last tory government labor decided the selloff could go ahead unhinderedfavors owed to both theres nothing illegal about commercial loans miss henderson secret or not pennen was still swinging the club doesnt stop it from being a scandal once the papers get hold of it mairie retorted and like i say who knows what else will come bubbling to the surface pennen brought the clubhead down with force against the partition do you know how hard ive worked this week arranging contracts worth tens of millions to uk industry and what have you been doing apart from some useless muckraking we all have our place in the food chain mr pennen she smiled wont be mr for much longer will it money youve been shelling out that peerage cant be far off mind you once blair finds out youre bankrolling his enemies any trouble here sir mairie turned to see three police uniforms the one whod spoken was looking at pennen the other two had eyes for her and her alone unfriendly eyes i think this woman was just leaving pennen muttered mairie made a show of peering over the partition got a magic lamp there or something any time ive ever called the cops theyve taken half an hour routine patrol the groups leader stated mairie looked him up and down no markings on his uniform the face tanned hair cropped jaw set one question she said do any of you know the penalty for impersonating a police officer the leader scowled and made a grab at her mairie wriggled free and ran from the safety of the driving area onto the grass surface itself fled toward the exit dodging shots from the first two bays the players yelling in outrage she reached the door just before her pursuers the woman at the register asked where her threewood was mairie didnt answer pushed open another door and found herself in the parking lot ran to her car stabbing the remote no time to look around into the drivers seat and all four doors locked key in the ignition a fist thumping at her window the lead uniform trying the handle then shuffling around to the front of the car mairie gave him a look that said she didnt care gunned the accelerator watch out jacko the bints crazy jacko had to dive sideways that or be killed in the wing mirror she could see him picking himself up a car had drawn up alongside him no markings on it either mairie screamed out onto the main highwayairport to her left city to the right the road back into edinburgh gave her more options more chances to lose them jacko shed remember that name bint one of the others had called her it was a term shed only heard from the mouths of soldiers exmilitarywith tans picked up in hot climes iraq private security disguised as constabulary she looked in the rearview no sign of them didnt mean they werent there a to the bypass breaking the speed limit all the way flashing her lights to let the drivers in front know she was coming where to next though it would be easy for them to get her address absurdly easy for a man like richard pennen allan was on a job wouldnt be back in town until monday nothing to stop her driving to the scotsman and working on her article her laptop was in the trunk all the information inside it notes and quotes and her rough drafts she could stay in the office all night if need be topped up by coffee and snacks cocooned from the outside world writing richard pennens destruction it was ellen wylie who gave rebus the news he in turn called siobhan who picked him up in her car twenty minutes later they drove to niddrie in silence through the dusk the jack kane center s campground had been dismantled no tents no showers or toilets half the fencing had been removed and the security guards were gone replaced for the moment by uniformed officers ambulance men and the same two morgue assistants who had collected ben websters shattered remains from the foot of castle rock siobhan parked alongside the line of vehicles rebus recognized some of the detectivesthey were from st leonard s and craigmillar they nodded a greeting toward the new arrivals not exactly your turf one of them commented lets just say weve an interest in the deceased rebus replied siobhan was by his side she leaned toward him so as not to be overheard news hasnt leaked that were on suspension rebus just nodded they were nearing a circle of crouched scene of crime officers the duty doctor had pronounced death and was signing his name to some forms on a clipboard flash photographs were being taken flashlights scouring the grass for clues onlookers were being kept at a distance by a dozen uniforms while the area was taped off kids on bikes mums with their toddlers in carriages nothing drew a crowd quite like a crime scene siobhan was getting her bearings this is pretty much where my parents tent was pitched she told rebus im assuming theyre not the ones who left the mess he flicked an empty plastic bottle into the air with his toe plenty of other debris strewn across the park discarded banners and leaflets fastfood cartons a scarf and a single glove a babys rattle and a rolledup diapersome of it was being bagged by the socos to be checked for blood or fingerprints love to see them get the dna from that rebus said nodding toward a used condom you think maybe your mum and dad siobhan gave him a look im not going any closer he shrugged and left her behind councilman gareth tench was growing cold on the ground he lay on his front legs bent as if hed collapsed in a heap his head was turned to one side eyes not quite shut there was a dark stain on the back of his jacket im guessing stabbed rebus told the doctor three times the man confirmed in the back wounds dont look all that deep to me doesnt take much rebus stated what sort of knife hard to tell as yet the doctor peered over his halfmoon glasses blade about an inch wide maybe a little less anything missing hes got some cash on himcredit cards and such made identification that bit easier the doctor gave a tired smile and turned his clipboard toward rebus if you could countersign here inspector but rebus held his hands up not my case doc the doctor looked toward siobhan but rebus shook his head slowly and walked off to join her three stab wounds he informed her she was staring at tenchs face and seemed to be trembling a little feeling the chill he asked its really him she said quietly you thought he was indestructible not quite she couldnt tear her eyes away from the body i suppose we should tell someone he looked around for a likely candidate tell them what that weve been giving tench a bit of grief bound to come out sooner or she had snatched his hand and was dragging him toward the sports centers gray concrete wall whats up but she wasnt about to answer not until she felt they were far enough away even then she stood so close to him that they could have been readying to waltz her face was hidden in shadow siobhan he prompted her you must know who did this she said who keith carberry she growled then when he didnt respond she raised her face to the heavens and screwed shut her eyes rebus noticed that her hands had become clenched fists her whole body tensed what is it he asked quietly siobhan what the hell have you done eventually she opened her eyes blinking back tears and getting her breathing back under control i saw carberry this morning we told him she paused i told him i wanted gareth tench she glanced back in the direction of the corpse must be his way of delivering rebus waited for her to meet his eyes i saw him this afternoon he said he was keeping watch on tench at the city chambers he slid his hands into his pockets you said we siobhan did i where did you talk to him the pool hall same one cafferty told us about he watched as she nodded cafferty was there too wasnt he her look was the only answer he needed he pulled his hands from his pockets and slapped one of them against the wall for christs sake he spat you and cafferty she just nodded again when he gets his claws into you shiv they dont come out all these years youve known me you mustve seen that what do i do now he thought for a moment if you keep your mouth shut cafferty knows hes got you but if i own up i dont know he confessed bounced back into uniform maybe might as well type out my resignation right now what did cafferty say to carberry just that he was to hand us the councilman whos the us cafferty or the law she gave a shrug and how was he going to deliver hell john i dont knowyouve said yourself he was shadowing tench rebus looked toward the murder scene bit of a leap from there to stabbing him in the back three times maybe not in keith carberrys mind rebus thought about this for a moment we keep it quiet for now he decided who else saw you with cafferty just carberry there were people in the pool hall but upstairs it was just the three of us and you knew cafferty would be there he watched her nod because youd set the whole thing up with him another nod without thinking to tell me he struggled to keep the anger out of his voice cafferty came to my flat last night siobhan confessed jesus he owns the pool hallthats how he knew carberry goes there youve got to stay away from him shiv i know damage is done but we can try some running repairs can we he stared at her by we i meant i because john rebus can fix anything her face had hardened a little i can take my own medicine john you dont always get to do the knightinshiningarmor thing he placed his hands on his hips are we finished mixing our metaphors you know why i listened to cafferty why i went to that pool hall knowing hed be there her voice was shaking with emotion he was offering me something i knew i wouldnt get from the law youve seen it here this weekhow the rich and powerful operate how they get away with anything they like keith carberry went down to princes street that day because he thought its what his boss wanted he thought he had gareth tenchs blessing to cause as much mayhem as he liked rebus waited to see if there would be more then touched his hands to her shoulders cafferty he said quietly wanted gareth tench put out to pasture and he was happy to use you as a means to that end he told me he didnt want him dead and he told me he did i had quite a descriptive little rant from him on that subject we didnt tell keith carberry to kill him she stated siobhan rebus reminded her you said it yourself just a minute agokeith does pretty much what he thinks people want him to dopowerful people people whove got some measure of control over him people like tenchand caffertyand you he pointed a finger at her so im to blame she asked eyes narrowing we can all make a mistake siobhan well thanks for that she turned on her heels and started striding back across the playing field rebus looked down at his feet and gave a sigh then reached into his pocket for cigarettes and lighter the lighter was empty he shook it tipped it up blew on it rubbed it for lucknot so much as a spark he sauntered back toward the line of police vehicles asked one of the uniforms if he had a light his colleague was able to oblige and rebus decided he might as well beg another favor i need a lift he said watching siobhans taillights receding into the night couldnt believe cafferty had gotten his claws into her nohe could believe it all too readily siobhan had wanted to prove something to her parentsnot just that shed made a success of her job but that it meant something in the greater scheme shed wanted them to know there were always answers always solutions cafferty had promised her both but at a pricehis price siobhan had stopped thinking like a cop turning back into a daughter again rebus thought of how he had let his own family drift away from him first his wife and daughter and then his brother pushing them away because the job seemed to demand it demanded his unconditional attention no room for anyone elsetoo late now to do anything about it but not too late for siobhan you still want that lift one of the uniforms was asking rebus nodded and got in his first stop craigmillar police station he got himself a cup of coffee and waited for the team to reconvene stood to reason theyd set up the murder room here sure enough the cars started to arrive rebus didnt know the faces but introduced himself the detective angled his head its ds mcmanus you want mcmanus was just coming through the door he was younger even than siobhanmaybe not yet thirty boyish features tall and skinny looked to rebus as though he might have grown up locally rebus offered a handshake and introduced himself again i was beginning to think you were a myth mcmanus said with a smile i hear tell you were based here a while back true worked with bain and maclay for my sins well theyre both long gone so you neednt worry they were walking down the long hallway behind the reception desk what can i do for you rebus just something i thought you ought to know oh aye id had a few runins recently with the deceased mcmanus glanced at him that right ive been working the cyril colliar case still just the two additional victims rebus nodded tench had links to one of themguy worked at an adult daycare center not far from here tench got him the position fair enough youll be interviewing the widowshell probably say cid paid a visit and that was you myself and a colleague yes theyd taken a left turn into an adjoining corridor rebus following mcmanus into the cid office where the team was gathering anything else you think i should know rebus tried to look as though he were racking his brain finally he shook his head thats about it he said was tench a suspect not really rebus paused we were a bit concerned by his relationship with a young rebel called keith carberry i know keith mcmanus said he was in court charged with fighting and disturbing the peace in princes street when he came out councilmen tench was waiting for him they seemed pretty friendly then surveillance cameras showed carberry whacking some innocent bystander looked like he might be in deeper trouble than first thought i happened to be at the city chambers this lunchtime talking with councilman tench when i left i saw carberry watching from across the street rebus ended the speech with a shrug as if to indicate that hed no idea what any of this might mean mcmanus was studying him carberry saw the pair of you together rebus nodded and that was lunchtime i got the feeling he was tailing the councilman you didnt stop to ask i was in my car by thenonly caught a glimpse of him in the rearview mcmanus was gnawing on his bottom lip need a quick result on this he said almost to himself tench was hellish popular did this area a power of good there are going to be some very angry people no doubt rebus confirmed did you know the councilman friend of my unclesthey go back to school days youre from round here rebus stated grew up in the shadow of craigmillar castle so youd known councilman tench for some time years and years rebus tried to make his next question sound casual ever hear rumors about him what sort of rumors i dont know the usual stuff i supposeextramarital flings money going astray from the coffers guys not even cold yet mcmanus complained just wondering rebus apologized im not trying to imply anything mcmanus was looking toward his teamseven of them including two women they were trying to look as though they werent eavesdropping mcmanus stepped away from rebus and stood in front of them we go to his house inform the family need someone to make the formal id he half turned his head toward rebus after that we bring in keith carberry few questions we need to ask him such as wheres the knife keith one of the team offered mcmanus allowed the joke i know weve had bush and blair and bono up here this past week but in craigmillar gareth tench counts as royalty so we need to be proactive more boxes we can check off tonight happier ill be there were a few groans but they lacked force seemed to rebus that mcmanus was well liked his officers would go the extra hour for him any overtime one of them asked g wasnt enough for you ben mcmanus retorted rebus stayed put for a moment ready to say something like thanks or good luck but mcmanuss attention was on this fresh new case hed already started doling out tasks ray barbara see if theres any securitycamera footage from around the jack kane center billy tom youre going to light some fires under our esteemed pathologistsditto those lazy sods at forensics jimmy you and kate go pick up keith carberry sweat him in the cells till i get back ben youre with me little trip to the councilmans house in duddingston park any questions no questions rebus headed back down the corridor hoping siobhan could be kept out of it no way of telling mcmanus owed rebus no favors carberry might spill his guts which would be awkward but nothing they couldnt handle rebus was already forming the story in his head ds clarke had information that keith played pool in restalrig when she got there the owner morris gerald cafferty also happened to be present he doubted mcmanus would swallow it they could always deny any meeting had taken place but thered been witnesses besides the denial would only work if cafferty played along and the only reason hed do that would be to tighten the noose around siobhan she would owe cafferty her whole future and so would rebus which was why out in reception he asked for another lift this time to merchiston the uniforms in the patrol car were chatty but didnt question where he was headed maybe they thought cid could afford to own homes in this quiet treelined enclave the detached victorian houses sat behind high walls and fences the street lighting seemed subdued so as not to keep the inhabitants awake the wide streets were almost emptyno parking problems here each house boasted a driveway for half a dozen cars rebus got the patrol car to stop on ettrick roaddidnt want to be too obvious they seemed content to hang out and watch him enter whichever house was his final destination but he waved them away busying himself with lighting a cigarette one of the uniforms had gifted him half a dozen matches rebus struck one against a wall and watched the patrol car signal right at the end of the street at the foot of ettrick road he took a rightstill no sign of the patrol car and no place they could be hiding no sign of life anywhere no traffic or pedestrians no sounds from behind the thick stone walls huge windows muffled by wooden shutters bowling green and tennis courts deserted he took another right and walked halfway up this new street holly hedge in front of one house its porch was lit flanked by stone pillars rebus pushed open the gate yanked on the bellpull wondered if maybe he should go around to the back last time he was here there was a hot tub there but then the heavy wooden door gave a shudder as it was opened from within a young man was standing there his body had been sculpted in the gym and he wore a tight black tshirt to underline the fact need to go easy on those steroids rebus warned him is your lord and master home does it look like hed want whatever youre selling im selling salvation soneverybody needs a taste of that even you over the mans shoulder rebus could see a pair of female legs descending the staircase bare feet the legs slim and tanned and ending at a white terrycloth robe she stopped halfway and leaned down so she could see who was at the door rebus gave her a little wave shed been brought up wellwaved back even though shed no idea who he was then she turned and started padding back upstairs you got a warrant the bodyguard was saying the penny drops rebus exclaimed but me and your boss go back a ways he pointed a finger in the direction of one of the entrance halls many doors thats the living room and thats where ill wait for him rebus made to pass the man but an open palm against his chest stopped him hes busy the bodyguard said shagging one of his employees rebus agreed which means i may have to hang around for all of two minutesalways supposing he doesnt have a coronary halfway through he stared at the hand pressed like a lead weight against him you sure you want this rebus met the bodyguards stare every time we meet from now on he said quietly this is what ill be rememberingand believe me son whatever failings people may tell you i have ive got a whole fistful of gold medals in carrying a grudge and the booby prize when it comes to timing a voice roared from the top of the stairs rebus watched big ger cafferty descend tying his own voluminous bathrobe around him what hair he still possessed was rising in tufts from his head and his cheeks were red from exertion what the bloody hell brings you here he growled its a bit lame as an alibi rebus commented bodyguard plus some girlfriend you probably pay by the hour what do i need an alibi for you know damned well clothes in the washing machine are they blood can be hard to get out youre making no sense but rebus could tell that cafferty had bitten down on the hook time to reel him in gareth tench is dead he stated stabbed in the backwhich is probably just your style want to discuss it in front of arnie here or should we step into the parlor caffertys face gave nothing away the eyes were small dark voids the mouth set in a thin straight line he placed his hands in the pockets of his robe and gave a little flick of the head a signal the bodyguard seemed to read the hand dropped and rebus followed cafferty into the huge drawing room there was a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a baby grand piano taking up space next to the bay window huge loudspeakers on either side of it and a stateoftheart stereo on a rack by the wall the paintings were brash and modern violent splashes of color above the fireplace hung a framed copy of the jacket from caffertys book he was busying himself at the drinks cabinet it meant his back was kept turned to rebus whiskey he asked why not rebus replied stabbed you say three times outside the jack kane center home turf cafferty commented a mugging gone wrong i think you know better cafferty turned round and handed rebus a glass it was quality stuff dark and peaty rebus didnt bother offering a toast just washed it around his mouth before swallowing you wanted him dead rebus went on watching cafferty take the smallest sip of his own drink i listened to you rant and rave on the subject i was a bit emotional cafferty conceded in which state id put nothing whatsoever past you cafferty was staring at one of the paintings thick blotches of white oil melting into oozing grays and reds i wont lie to you rebusim not sorry hes dead makes my life that bit less complicated but i didnt have him killed i think you did cafferty gave the slightest twitch of one eyebrow and what does siobhan say to all this shes the reason im here now cafferty smiled thought as much he said she told you about our little chat with keith carberry after which i happened to catch him stalking tench that was his prerogative you didnt make him ask siobhanshe was there her names detective sergeant clarke cafferty and she doesnt know you the way i do have you arrested carberry cafferty turned his attention back from the painting rebus gave a slow nod and my money says hell talk so if you did have a little word in his ear i didnt tell him to do anything if he says i did hes lyingand ive got the detective sergeant as my witness she stays out of this cafferty rebus warned or what rebus just shook his head she stays out he repeated i like her rebus when they finally drag you kicking and screaming to the twilight benevolent home i think youll be leaving her in good hands you dont go near her you never speak to her rebuss voice had dropped to a near whisper cafferty gave a huge grin and emptied the crystal tumbler into his mouth smacked his lips and exhaled loudly its the boy you should be worried about your money says hell talk if he does he could well end up dropping ds clarke right in it he made sure he had rebuss full attention we could of course make sure he doesnt get a chance to talk i wish tench was still alive rebus muttered because now i know id help him take you down but youre changeable rebuslike a summers day in edinburgh next week youll be blowing me kisses cafferty puckered his lips for effect youre already suspended from duty are you sure you can afford any more enemies how long is it now since they started to outnumber your friends rebus looked around the room i dont see you hosting too many parties thats because youre never invitedthe book launch excepted cafferty nodded toward the fireplace rebus looked again at the framed artwork from caffertys book changeling the maverick life of the man they call mr big ive never heard you called mr big rebus commented cafferty shrugged mairies idea not mine i must give her a calli think shes been avoiding me that wouldnt be anything to do with your good self i suppose rebus ignored him with tench out of the way youll be moving into niddrie and craigmillar will i with carberry and his ilk as your foot soldiers cafferty gave a chuckle mind if i make some notes i wouldnt want to forget any of this when you talked to carberry this morning you were letting him know the outcome you wantedthe only outcome that would save his neck youre assuming young keith was the only person i spoke to cafferty was dribbling more whiskey into his glass who else maybe siobhan herself flew off the handle i assume the murder team will want to talk to her caffertys tongue was protruding slightly from his mouth who else have you talked to about gareth tench cafferty swilled the liquid around his glass youre supposed to be the detective around here i cant go fighting all your battles for you judgment days coming cafferty for you and me both rebus paused you know that right the gangster shook his head slowly i see us in a couple of deck chairs somewhere hot but with icecold drinks reminiscing about the sparring we used to do back in the days when the good guys thought they knew the bad guys one thing this week should have shown all of usonly takes a few moments for everything to change protests crumble poverty returns to the back burnersome alliances are strengthened others weaken all that effort sidelined the voices silenced in the time it takes to snap your fingers he did just this as if to reinforce his point makes all your hard work seem a little bit petty and unimportant wouldnt you say and gareth tencha year from now think anyones going to remember him he drained his glass for the second time now i really have to get back upstairs not that i dont always enjoy our little gettogethers you understand cafferty placed his empty glass on the coffee table and gestured for rebus to do the same as they left the room he switched off the lights said something about doing his bit for the planet the bodyguard was in the hall hands clasped in front of him ever worked as a bouncer rebus asked one of your colleaguesname of colliarhe ended up on a stainlesssteel slab just one of many perks associated with your dangerous employer cafferty was already climbing the staircase it gratified rebus that he had to use the banister to haul himself up each step but then he did much the same thing these days in his tenement the bodyguard held the door open rebus brushed past him none too gentlynot even a ripple of movement from the younger man the door slammed after him he stood on the path a moment walked back to the gate and let it clank shut scratched another match and lit a cigarette headed up the street but paused beneath one of the underpowered lampposts took out his phone and tried siobhans number but she didnt pick up he walked to the top of the road and back down again while he was standing there an emaciated fox trotted out of a driveway and into the one next door hed started seeing them a lot in the city they never seemed to panic or be shy the look they gave their human neighbors was close to disdain or disappointment hunts had been banned from chasing them across country people in the towns left scraps out for them hard to think of them as predatorsbut it was in their nature predators being treated like pets mavericks it was another thirty minutes before he began to hear the approaching taxi its toiling diesel engine as distinctive as birdsong rebus climbed into the back and closed the door but told the driver they were waiting for one more remind me he said is it cash or contract contract mgc holdings right the nook the driver corrected him dropping off at the driver now turned in his seat whats the game pal no game its a womans name on the pickup sheetand if youve got a pussy you should get on the phone to one of those extreme makeover programs thanks for the advice rebus tucked himself into the farthest corner of the cab as caffertys door opened and closed heels clacking down the footpath and then the cabs door was opened perfume wafting in in you get rebus said before the woman could complain i just need a lift home she hesitated but climbed in eventually and settled herself as far from rebus as was possible the red button was lit meaning the driver would be able to listen in rebus found the right switch and turned it off you work at the nook he asked quietly didnt realize caffertyd got his mitts on it whats it to you the woman snapped back just making conversation friend of mollys never heard of her i was going to ask how she was im the guy who dragged the diplomat off her the other night the woman studied him mollys fine she said at last then how did you know you wouldnt be waiting till dawn human psychology he offered with a shrug caffertys never struck me as the kind whod let a woman stay the night clever you there was just the hint of a smile hard to make out her features in the taxis shadowy interior clean hair the sheen of lipstick the smell of her perfume jewelry and high heels and a threequarterlength coat falling open to show a much shorter dress beneath plenty of mascara the eyelashes exaggerated he decided on another nudge so mollys all right as far as i know whats cafferty like to work for hes okay she turned to stare out at the passing scene the street lighting showing him half her face he told me about you im cid she nodded when he heard your voice downstairs it was like someone had changed his batteries i do have that effect on people are we headed to the nook i live in the grassmarket handy for work he commented what is it you want you mean apart from a lift at caffertys expense rebus gave a shrug maybe i just want to know why anyone would want to get close to him see im beginning to think he carries a viruseveryone he touches gets hurt in some way youve known him a lot longer than i have she replied thats true meaning you must be immune he shook his head not immune no hes not hurt me yet thats goodbut the damage isnt always immediate they were turning into lady lawson street the driver signaled to make a right another minute and theyd be in grassmarket finished your good samaritan routine she asked turning to face rebus its your life thats right she leaned forward toward the drivers panel pull over next to the lights he did as ordered started filling in the contract slip but rebus told him there was one last dropoff to make she was climbing out of the cab he waited for her to say something but she slammed the door crossed the road and headed down a darkened alley the driver kept the engine running until a beam of light showed him shed opened her stairwell door always like to make sure he explained to rebus cant be too careful these days where to chief quick uturn rebus answered drop me at the nook it was a twominute ride at the end of which rebus told the driver to add twenty quid to the bill as a tip signed his name to it and handed it back sure about this chief the driver asked easy when its someone elses cash rebus told him getting out the doormen at the nook recognized him which didnt mean they were happy to renew the acquaintance busy night lads rebus asked paydays always are been a good week for overtime too rebus got the bouncers meaning the moment he walked in a large group of drunken cops seemed to have monopolized three of the lap dancers their table groaned with champagne flutes and beer glasses not that they looked out of placea stag party on the far side of the room was enjoying the competition rebus didnt know the cops but their accents were scottisha last night on the town for this motley crew before they headed home to their wives and girlfriends in glasgow inverness aberdeen two women were gyrating on the small central stage another was parading along the top of the bar for the benefit of the lone drinkers seated there she squatted to allow a fivepound note to be tucked into her gstring earning the donor a peck on the pockmarked cheek there was just the one stool left and rebus took it two dancers emerged from behind a curtain and started working the room hard to say if theyd been giving private dances or taking a cigarette break one started to approach rebus her smile evaporating as he shook his head the barman asked him what he was drinking im not he said just need to borrow your lighter a pair of high heels had stopped in front of him their owner wriggled her way down until she was at eye level with him rebus broke off lighting his cigarette long enough to tell her he needed a word ive a break coming in five minutes molly clark said she turned toward the barman ronnie give my friend here a drink fine ronnie answered but its coming out of your wages she ignored him stretching herself upright again and treading gingerly toward the other end of the bar whiskey thanks ronnie rebus said pocketing the lighter unnoticed and i prefer to add my own water even so rebus could have sworn the stuff poured from the bottle had already seen its share of adulteration he wagged a finger at the barman you want to tell trading standards youve been here thats your business ronnie shot back rebus pushed the drink aside and turned on his stool as though interested in the dancers when actually he was watching the posse of cops what was it he wondered that marked them out a few had mustaches all had neat haircuts most still wore ties though their suit jackets were draped over their chairs various ages and builds yet he couldnt help feeling there was something uniform about them they acted like a small separate tribe slightly at odds with the rest of the world moreover all week theyd been in charge of the capitalsaw themselves as conquerors invincible allpowerful look on my works had gareth tench really seen himself that way too rebus thought it was more complex tench had known he would fail but was determined to give it a try all the same rebus had considered the outside chance that the councilman had been their killer his works the little gallery of horror in auchterarder determined to rid the world of its monsterscafferty included killing cyril colliar had put cafferty briefly in the frame a lazy investigation might have ended there with cafferty the chief suspect tench had also known trevor guesthelps the guy out then is incensed to come across his details on a web site decides hes been betrayed leaving only fast eddie isley nothing to connect tench to him and isley had been the first victim the one who set the whole train in motion and now tench was dead and they were going to blame it on keith carberry who else have you talked to about gareth tench youre supposed to be the detective around here or a poor excuse for one rebus reached for his drink again just to give himself something to do the dancers on the stage looked bored they wanted to be down on the floor where this weeks pay was being emptied into peekaboo bras and minuscule thongs rebus didnt doubt thered be a rotationtheyd get their chance more men were coming inside executive types one of them was grinding to the rooms pounding sound track he was fifteen pounds overweight and the moves didnt suit him but no one was about to ridicule him that was the whole point of somewhere like the nook it was all about the shedding of inhibitions rebus couldnt help thinking back to the s when most edinburgh bars had offered a lunchtime stripper the drinkers would hide their faces behind their pint glasses whenever the dancer looked in their direction all that reticence had melted away in the course of the intervening decades the businessmen were yelping encouragement as one of the lap dancers at the police table started doing her stuff while her victim sat with legs parted hands on knees grinning and sweatyfaced molly was standing next to rebus he hadnt noticed her ending her routine give me two minutes to throw a coat on and ill see you outside he nodded distractedly penny for them she said suddenly curious just thinking about how sex has changed over the years we used to be such a shy wee nation and now the dancer was gyrating her hips mere inches from her victims nose now rebus mused itswell in your face she offered he nodded his agreement and placed the empty glass back on the bar she offered him a cigarette from her own pack shed wrapped a long black woolen coat around her and was leaning against one of the nooks walls just far enough from the doormen for eavesdropping to be a problem you dont smoke in the apartment rebus commented erics allergic it was eric i wanted to speak to you about actually rebus was making a show of examining his cigarettes glowing tip what about him she shuffled her feet and rebus noticed shed exchanged the stilettos for sneakers when we talked before you said he knows how you go about earning a wage you even told me hed been a customer at one point and rebus shrugged i dont really want him getting hurt which is why i think maybe you should leave him leave him so i dont have to tell him that youve been milking him for inside info and passing everything he tells you back to your boss see ive just been talking to cafferty and it suddenly clicked hes known stuff he shouldnt stuff hes been getting from the inside and who knows more than someone like brains she snorted you call him brainswhy dont you start crediting him with some how do you mean you think im the big bad hooker wheedling stuff out of the poor sap she rubbed a finger across her top lip id go a bit further actuallyseems to me youre only living with eric because cafferty tells you toprobably feeds that coke habit of yours to make it all worthwhile first time we met i thought it was just nerves she didnt bother denying it soon as eric stops being useful rebus went on youll drop him like a stone my advice is to do that right now like i said rebus erics no idiot hes known all along what the score is rebus narrowed his eyes in the apartment you said you stopped him taking job offershow will he feel when he finds out that was because hed be no use to your boss in the private sector he tells me stuff because he wants to she went on and he knows damned fine where itll end up classic honey trap rebus muttered once you get a taste she said teasingly youre still going to walk away from him he demanded or what her eyes burned into him youll go tell him something he already knows sooner or later caffertys walking the plankyou really want to be there with him im a good swimmer its not water youll end up in mollyits jail time inside will play havoc with those looks i guarantee it see slipping confidential info to a criminal is just about as serious as it gets you sell me out rebus eric gets sold out too so much for protecting him price has to be paid rebus flicked away the remains of the cigarette first thing tomorrow ill be talking to him your bags had better be packed what if mr cafferty doesnt agree he will once your covers blown cid could be feeding you any amount of manure dressed as caviar cafferty takes one bite and weve got him her eyes were still fixed on his so why arent you doing that sting operation means telling the brassand that really would be the end of erics career you walk away now i get eric back too many lives shat on by your boss molly i just want a few of them sluiced down he reached into his pocket for his cigarettes opened the pack and offered her one so what do you say times up one of the doormen called pressing a finger to his earpiece clients threedeep in there she looked at rebus times up she echoed turning toward the backstage door rebus watched her go lit himself another cigarette and decided the walk home across the meadows would do him good his phone was ringing as he unlocked the door he picked it up from the chair rebus he said its me ellen wylie said what the hells been happening what do you mean ive had siobhan on the phone i dont know what youve been saying to her but shes in a hell of a state gareth tench is dead it was me who told you remember she thinks she should take some of the blame i tried telling her shes crazy thatll have helped rebus started turning on the lights he wanted them all onnot just the living room but the hall and the kitchen the bathroom and his bedroom she sounded pretty pissed off with you you dont need to sound so happy about it i spent twenty minutes calming her down wylie yelled dont you dare start accusing me of enjoying any of this sorry ellen rebus meant it too he sat on the edge of the bath shoulders slumped phone tucked in against his chin were all tired john thats the trouble i think my troubles go just that little bit deeper ellen so go beat yourself up about itwouldnt be the first time he puffed air from his cheeks so whats the bottom line with siobhan maybe give her a day to calm down i told her she should drive up to t in the park let off some steam not a bad idea except that his own weekend plans included the borderslooked like hed be heading south unaccompanied no way he could invite ellendidnt want it getting back to siobhan at least we can rule tench out as a suspect wylie was saying maybe siobhan said youd be arresting some kid from niddrie probably already in custody so it has nothing to do with the clootie well or beastwatch coincidence thats all so what happens now your notion of a weekend break sounds good everybodys back to work on mondaywe can organize a proper murder inquiry you wont be needing me then theres a place for you if you want it ellen youve got a whole fortyeight hours to think it over thanks john but do me a favorgive siobhan a call tomorrow let her know im worried worried and sorry ill leave the wording to you night ellen he ended the call and studied his face in the bathroom mirror he was surprised not to see scourge marks and raw flesh looked much the same as ever sallow and needing a shave hair unkempt bags under his eyes he gave his cheeks a few slaps and headed through to the kitchen made himself a cup of instant coffeeblack the milk had decided it was sourand ended up seated at the dining table in the living room the same faces stared down at him from his walls cyril colliar trevor guest edward isley he knew that on tv the main topic would still be the london bombs experts would be debating what could have been done and what to do next all other news would have been pushed aside yet he still had his three unsolved murderswhich were actually siobhans now that he thought of it chief constable had put her in charge then there was ben webster receding into obscurity with each turn of the news cycle nobodyd blame you for coasting nobody but the dead he rested his head on his folded arms saw the wellfed cafferty descending that millionpound staircase saw siobhan falling for his tricks saw cyril colliar doing his dirty work and keith carberry doing his dirty work and molly and eric bain doing his dirty work cafferty coming downstairs perfumed from the shower smelling sweeter than any nosegay cafferty the mobster knew steelforths name cafferty the author had met richard pennen who else who else have you talked to cafferty with his tongue protrudingmaybe siobhan herself no not siobhan rebus had seen the way she acted at the murder sceneshe hadnt known a thing which didnt mean she hadnt wanted it to happen hadnt wished it into existence by letting her eyes meet caffertys for just that second too long rebus heard a plane climbing into the sky from the west there werent many late flights out of edinburgh he wondered if maybe it was tony blair or some of his minions thank you scotland and good night the summit would have enjoyed the best the country had to offerscenery whiskey ambience food the morsels turning to ash as that red london bus exploded and meantime three bad men had diedand one good manben websterand one rebus wasnt sure about even now gareth tench might have been acting from the best of motives but with his conscience hammered into submission by circumstance or he could have been on the cusp of wrenching away caffertys tarnished crown rebus doubted he would ever know for sure he stared at the phone lying in front of him on the dining table seven digits and hed be connected to siobhans apartment seven tiny points of pressure on the keypad how could something be so difficult what makes you think shes not better off without you he found himself asking the silver lozenge it replied with a bleep and his head twitched upward he snatched at it but all it was trying to tell him was that its battery was low no lower than mine he muttered rising slowly to his feet to seek out the charger hed just plugged it in when it rang mairie henderson evening mairie rebus said john where are you at home whats the problem can i email you something its the story im writing on richard pennen you need my proofreading skills i just want whats happened mairie i had a runin with three of pennens goons they were wearing uniforms but they were no more cops than i am rebus eased himself down onto the arm of his chair one of them called jacko how did you know ive met them too what happened she told him adding her suspicion that they might have spent time in iraq and now youre scared rebus guessed thats why you want to make sure there are copies of your piece im sending out a few but not to other journalists right dont want to put temptation in their way no copyright on scandal rebus agreed do you want to take things any further how do you mean you were right the first timeimpersonating a cop is a serious matter once ive filed my copy ill be fine you sure im sure but thanks for asking if you need me mairie youve got my number thanks john good night she ended the call and left him staring at his phone the charge symbol came on again the battery taking its little sips of electricity rebus walked to the dining table and switched on his laptop plugged the cable into the phone socket and managed to get himself online it never ceased to amaze him when it actually worked her email was waiting for him he clicked to download it and added her story to one of his folders hoping hed be able to find it again there was another email this time from stan hackman better late than never it read here i am back in the toon and about to hit a few nightspots just time to let you know about our trev interview notes say he moved to coldstream for a timedont say why or for how long hope this helps your pal stan coldstreamsame place as the man hed had the fight with outside swanys on ratcliffe terrace clicketyclick rebus said to himself deciding he was owed a drink saturday july only a week since rebus had walked down to the meadows and found all those people there dressed in white a long time in politics so the saying went every moment of every day life moved on the hordes of people making the pilgrimage north today would be headed for the outskirts of kinross and t in the park sports fans would venture farther west to loch lomond and the final rounds of the scottish open golf championship rebus figured his own route south would take under two hours but there were a couple of detours firstslateford road to start with he sat in the idling car staring up at the windows of the converted warehouse thought he could tell eric bains flat the curtains were open rebus was playing the elbow cd again the singer comparing the leaders of the free world to kids chucking stones he was about to get out of the car when he saw bain himself shambling into view returning from the corner shop he hadnt shaved or combed his hair his shirt wasnt tucked in he carried a carton of milk and wore a dazed expression in most people rebus might have put it down to tiredness he rolled down his window and sounded the horn bain took a second or two to recognize him and crossed the road toward the car thought that was you rebus stated bain said nothing just nodded mind elsewhere shes left you then this seemed to focus bains thoughts left a message saying someone would come by to pick up her stuff rebus nodded get in eric we need to have a little chat but bain stood his ground how did you know talk to anyone eric theyll tell you im the last one who should be giving relationship advice rebus paused on the other hand we cant have you passing inside information to big ger cafferty bain stared at him you i had a word with molly last night if shes scampered that means shed rather keep working at the nook than stay shacked up with you i dontim not sure i bains eyes widened as though lit by a jolt of caffeine the milk carton fell from his grasp his hands reached in through the window and found rebuss throat his teeth were bared with the effort rebus pushed himself back toward the passenger seat one hand scrabbling at bains fingers the other finding the window button up went the glass trapping bain rebus slid all the way over to the passenger side and exited the car walked around to where bain was extracting his arms from the door frame as bain turned rebus kneed him in the crotch sending him down onto his knees in the widening pool of milk rebus swung a punch at bains chin and sent him onto his back straddled him holding his shirt by its open collar your fault eric not mine one whiff of pussy and you start spilling your guts and according to your girlfriend you were delighted to oblige even after youd figured out it wasnt just natural curiosity on her part made you feel important did it thats the reason most informers start gabbing bain wasnt putting up any sort of a struggle apart from a jerking of his shouldersand even this fell far short of resistance in point of fact he was sobbing face spattered with droplets of milk like a kid whose favorite plaything had just been lost rebus rose to his feet straightening his own clothes get up he ordered but bain seemed content to lie there so rebus hauled him to his feet look at me eric he said drawing out a handkerchief and holding it out here wipe your face bain did as he was told there was a bubble of snot swelling from one of his nostrils now listen rebus ordered the deal i made with her was that if she left wed let it go at that meaning i dont go telling fettes about any of thisand you get to keep your job rebus angled his face until bain met his eyes do you understand plenty more jobs in it sure and they all love an employee who cant keep secrets from strippers i loved her rebus maybe so but she was playing you like clapton with a sixstringwhatre you smiling at im named after himmy dads a fan is that a fact bain looked up at the sky his breathing slowing a little i really thought she cafferty was using you ericend of story but heres the thing rebus made sure he had eye contact you cant go near her you dont go to the nook pining for her shes sending someone for her stuff because she knows thats how it works rebus emphasized his point by chopping the air karatestyle with his hand you saw her that day in the apartment rebus she mustve liked me at least a little bit keep thinking that if you likejust dont go asking her if i hear youre trying to contact her dont think i wont tell corbyn bain mumbled something rebus didnt catch he asked him to repeat it bains eyes drilled into him it wasnt about cafferty at the start whatever you say eric but it was about him eventuallytrust me on that bain was silent for a few moments he stared down at the pavement i need more milk best get yourself cleaned up first look im heading out of town youre going to spend all day turning this overwhat if i give you a ring tomorrow you can let me know the score bain nodded slowly tried handing rebus back his handkerchief you can keep that he was advised got a friend you can talk to on the net bain said whatever works rebus patted his shoulder are you okay now i need to get going ill manage good boy rebus took a deep breath im not going to apologize for what i did ericbut im sorry you had to get hurt bain nodded again its me who should but rebus silenced him with a shake of the head all in the past now just got to pick yourself up and move on no use crying over spilled milk bain offered with an attempt at a smile been trying my damnedest not to say it these past ten minutes rebus admitted go stick your head under the shower wash it all away might not be that easy bain said quietly rebus nodded agreement but all the sameits a start siobhan had spent a good forty minutes soaking in the bath normally she only had time for a shower in the morning but today she was determined to pamper herself about a third of a bottle of space nk bath foam and a big glass of fresh orange juice bbc music on her digital radio and her cell phone switched off the ticket to t in the park was on the sofa in the living room next to a list of things she would needbottled water and snacks her fleece suntan lotion well you never could tell last night shed been on the verge of calling bobby greig and offering him her ticket but why should she if she didnt go shed just end up slouched on the sofa with the tv playing ellen wylie had called first thing told her shed been talking to rebus hes sorry ellen had reported sorry for what for anything and everything nice of him to tell you instead of me my fault ellen had admitted i said he should leave you in peace for a day or so thanks hows denise still in bed so whats the plan for today bopping yourself into a sweat at kinross or would you rather we go somewhere and drown all our sorrows ill bear that offer in mind but i think youre rightkinross might be just what i need not that shed be staying the night although her ticket was valid for both days shed had quite enough of the outdoors life she wondered if the dope dealer from stirling would be there plying his trade maybe this time she would decide to indulge break yet another rule she knew plenty of officers who did a bit of pot had heard rumors of some who even did coke at weekends all kinds of ways to unwind she considered the options and decided shed better pack a couple of condoms just in case she did end up in someones tent she knew two women pcs who were heading to the festival they were hoping to rendezvous with her by text message a wild pair they were with a crush on the front men with the killers and keane they were already in kinrosswanted to be sure of a place front of stage you better text us when you get there theyd warned siobhan leave it too long we might be in a sorry state sorry for anything and everything but what had he to feel sorry about had he sat in the bentley gt and listened to caffertys plan had he climbed those stairs with keith carberry and stood with him as cafferty held court she screwed shut her eyes and ducked her head beneath the surface of the bathwater im to blame she thought the words kept bouncing around the inside of her skull gareth tenchso vividly alive voice boomingcharismatic like all the best showmenjust happening along to chase carberry and his pals away proving to the outside world that he was the only man for the job a bravura con trick finessing grant aid for his constituents larger than life and seemingly indefatigableand now lying cold and naked in one of the drawers at the city morgue turned into a series of incisions and statistics someone had told her once an inchlong blade was all it took a single slender inch of tempered steel could knock the whole world out of kilter she heaved herself up into daylight spluttering and wiping the hair and suds from her face shed thought she could hear a phone ringing but there was nothing just a floorboard creaking in the apartment upstairs rebus had told her to stay away from cafferty and he was right if she lost it in front of cafferty shed be the loser but then she was already the loser wasnt she and so much fun to be around she muttered to herself rising to a crouch and stretching out a hand toward the nearest towel it didnt take her long to packsame bag shed taken with her to stirling and even though she wouldnt be staying the night she dropped in her toothbrush and toothpaste anyway maybe once she was in the car shed just keep on driving if she ran out of land she could always take a ferry to orkney that was the thing about a carit gave the illusion of freedom the ads always played on that sense of adventure and discovery but in her case would be more accurate not doing that she explained to the bathroom mirror hairbrush in hand shed said as much to rebus told him she could take her own medicine not that cafferty was medicinemore like poison she knew the route she should take go see james corbyn and tell him how badly shed messed up then end up back in uniform as a result im a good copper she told the mirror trying to imagine how she would explain it to her dadher dad whod become so proud of her and to her mother whod told her it didnt matter didnt matter whod hit her and just why had it mattered so much to siobhan not really because of the anger at thinking it might be another cop but because she could use it to prove she was good at her job a good cop she repeated quietly and then wiping steam from the mirror despite all the evidence to the contrary second and final detour craigmillar police station mcmanus was already at work conscientious rebus said walking into the cid office there was no else about as yet mcmanus was dressed casuallysports shirt and denims what does that make you mcmanus asked wetting a finger so he could turn the page of the report he was reading autopsy results rebus guessed mcmanus nodded im just back déjà vu all over again rebus commented i was in your shoes last saturdayben webster no wonder professor gates looked miffedtwo saturdays in a row by now rebus was standing next to mcmanuss desk any conclusions serrated knife seven eighths of an inch in width gates figures youd find them in most kitchens hes right is keith carberry still on the premises you know the drill rebus after six hours we charge or throw out meaning youve not charged him mcmanus looked up from the report he denies any involvement even has an alibihe was playing pool at the time seven or eight witnesses all of them doubtless good friends of his mcmanus just shrugged plenty of knives in his mums kitchen but no sign any of thems missing weve lifted the lot for analysis and carberrys clothes went through those too no traces of blood meaning theyve been disposed of same as the knife mcmanus leaned back in his chair whose investigation is this rebus rebus held up his hands in surrender just thinking aloud who was it interviewed carberry i did it myself you think hes guilty he seemed genuinely shocked when we told him about tench but just behind those nasty blue eyes of his i thought i could see something else what he was scared because hed been found out mcmanus shook his head scared to say anything rebus turned away not wanting mcmanus to see anything behind his eyes say carberry didnt do itwas cafferty himself suddenly in the frame again the young man scared because that was his thinking tooand if cafferty had struck at tench would keith himself be next did you ask him about tailing the councilman admitted waiting for him said he wanted to thank him for what rebus turned to face mcmanus again moral support after he was bailed for fighting rebus gave a snort you believe that not necessarily but it wasnt grounds to hold him indefinitely mcmanus paused thing iswhen we told him he could go he was reluctanttried not to show it but he was looked to left and right as he walked out of the door as though expecting something fairly hared away too mcmanus paused again do you see what im getting at rebus rebus nodded hare rather than fox along those lines yes makes me wonder if theres something youre not telling me id still have him down as a suspect agreed mcmanus rose from his chair fixed rebus with a look but is he the only one we should be speaking to councilmen make enemies rebus stated according to the widow tench counted you among them shes mistaken mcmanus ignored this and concentrated on folding his arms instead she also thinks the family home was being watchednot by keith carberry though description she gave was a silverhaired man in a big posh car does that sound to you like big ger cafferty rebus shrugged a reply another little story i hear mcmanus was approaching rebus concerns you and a man answering that same description at a meeting in a church hall just a few days back the councilman had a few words with this third man care to enlighten me he was close enough for rebus to feel his breath on his cheek case like this he speculated youll always get stories mcmanus just smiled ive never had a case like this rebus gareth tench was loved and admiredplenty of friends of his out there angry at their loss and wanting answers some of them packing all sorts of cloutclout theyve promised to share with me thats nice for you an offer id find it very hard to refuse mcmanus went on meaning this might be the only chance ill be able to give he took a step back so di rebus having apprised you of the situationis there anything at all you want to tell me there was no way to land cafferty in it without embroiling siobhan before he could do anything he had to be sure shed be safe dont think so he said folding his own arms mcmanus nodded toward the gesture sure sign youve got something to hide really rebus slid his hands into his pockets how about you then he turned and headed for the door leaving mcmanus to wonder just when it was exactly that hed decided to fold his own arms nice day for a drive even if he spent half the journey behind a truck south to dalkeith and from there to coldstream at dun law he passed a wind farm turbines on either side of the roadit was as close as hed ever come to them sheep and cattle grazing and plenty of roadkill pheasants and hares birds of prey hovering overhead or peering intently from fence posts fifty miles and he hit coldstream passed through the town and over a bridge finding himself suddenly in england a road sign told him he was only sixty miles north of newcastle he turned at a hotel parking lot and headed back across the border parking curbside there was a police station cleverly disguised as just another gabled house with a blue wooden door the sign told him it was only open weekdays nine till twelve coldstreams main drag was dominated by bars and small shops daytrippers took up most of the space on the narrow pavements a singledecker bus from lesmahagow was pouring out its chatty cargo at the rams head rebus beat them inside and demanded a half of best looking around he saw that the tables had been reserved for lunch there were sandwiches behind the bar and he asked for cheese and pickle weve soup too the barmaid informed him cockaleekie canned she gave a tut would i poison you with that muck go on then he said with a smile she called his order out to the kitchen and he gave his spine a stretch rolling his shoulders and neck where are you off to she asked on her return im already there he replied but before he could get a conversation going the tourbus party started swarming in she called out again to the kitchen and a waitress emerged notepad in hand the chef himself ruddyfaced and wide of girth delivered rebuss soup he rolled his eyes as he calculated the average age of the new arrivals guess how many will want steak pie he said all of them rebus decided and the goat cheese and filo starter not a hope rebus confirmed unwrapping his spoon from its paper napkin there was golf on tv looked breezy up at loch lomond rebus searched in vain for salt and pepper then found that the soup needed neither a man in a shortsleeved white shirt came and stood next to him he was mopping his face with a vast handkerchief what hair he possessed was slicked back from his forehead warm one he announced are those your lot rebus said indicating the throng at the tables im theirs more like the man stated never seen so many backseat drivers he shook his head and begged the barmaid for a pint of orange and lemonade with plenty of ice she winked as she placed it in front of himno payment necessary rebus knew the score by bringing his bus parties here the driver was on freebies for life the man seemed to read his mind way the world turns he confessed rebus just nodded who was to say the g didnt operate in much the same way he asked the driver what lesmahagow was like sort of place that makes a day out to coldstream an attractive proposition he risked a glance toward his party there was some sort of dispute over the seating plan i swear to god the un would have trouble with this crowd he gulped his drink you werent in edinburgh last week were you i work there the driver feigned a wince i had twentyseven chinese tourists arrived by train from london on saturday morning could i get anywhere near the station to pick them up could i buggery and guess where they were staying the sheraton on lothian road more security there than barlinnie on the tuesday we were halfway to rosslyn chapel when i realized wed taken one of the japanese delegates with us by mistake the driver started chuckling and rebus joined him christ it felt good so youre just down for the day the man asked rebus nodded some nice walks if the fancy takes youbut you dont seem the type youre a good judge of character comes with the job he gave a slight jerk of his head see that group back there i could tell you right now which ones will tip at days end and even how much theyll give rebus tried to look impressed buy you another the mans pint glass was empty better not ill just need a pit stop halfway through the afternoon and that means most of them will follow suit might take half an hour to get them on board again the driver offered his hand for rebus to shake nice talking to you though you too rebus said returning the firm grip he watched the driver head for the door a couple of elderly women cooed and waved but he pretended not to have noticed rebus decided another half of best was in order the chance encounter had cheered him because it was a taste of another life a world running almost parallel to the one he inhabited the ordinary the everyday conversation for its own sake no search for motives or secrets normality the barmaid was placing a fresh glass in front of him you look a bit better she stated when you came in i wasnt sure what to make of you looked as likely to throw a punch as blow a kiss therapy he explained lifting the glass the waitress had finally worked out what each customer wanted and was fleeing to the kitchen before minds could be changed again so what brings you to coldstream the barmaid continued to probe im cid lothian and borders doing background on a murder victim name of trevor guest he was from newcastle but lived round here a few years back i cant say i know the name might have been using another one rebus held up a photo of guest taken around the time of his trial she peered at itneeded spectacles but didnt like the thought of them then she shook her head sorry dear she apologized anyone else i could show it to maybe the chef so she took the photograph from him and disappeared behind the partition toward the clanking sound of pots and bowls being moved she was back less than a minute later handed the photo back to him to be fair she said rabs only been in town since last autumn you say this guy was from newcastle why would he come here newcastle mightve been getting too hot for him rebus explained he didnt always stay on the right side of the law seemed glaringly obvious to him nowmuch more likely that whatever had changed guest it had happened in newcastle itself if fleeing you might want to dodge the atoo obvious you could branch off at morpeth onto a road that led you straight here i suppose he said its too much to ask you to cast your mind back four or five years no spate of housebreakings locally she shook her head some of the bus party had made it as far as the bar they carried with them a jotted order list three halfs of lager one lager and limearthur go check if thats a half or a wholea ginger ale advocaat and lemonadeask if she wants ice in the advocaat arthur no hang on its two halfs of lager and a beer and lemonade rebus drained his drink and mouthed to the barmaid that hed be back he meant it tooif not this trip then some other time trevor guest might have dragged him here but it would be the rams head that brought him back it was only when he was outside that he remembered hed not asked about duncan barclay he walked past a couple of shops and stopped at the newsdealers went inside and showed the photo of trevor guest a shake of his head from the proprietor who went on to say that hed lived in the town all his life rebus then tried him with the name duncan barclay this time he got a nod moved away a few years back though a lot of the young folk do any idea where another shake of the head rebus thanked him and moved on there was a grocers but he drew a blank therethe young female assistant only worked saturdays told him he might have more luck on monday morning same story down the rest of that side of the street antique shop hairdressers tearoom charity shoponly one other person knew of duncan barclay still see him around hes not moved far then rebus asked kelso i think next town along rebus paused for a moment in the afternoon sunshine and wondered why his blood was coursing answer he was working oldfashioned dogged police workalmost as good as a vacation but then he noticed that his final destination was another pub and this one didnt look half as welcoming it was a far more basic affair than the rams head a floor of faded red linoleum pocked with cigarette burns a frayed dartboard frequented by two equally frayedlooking drinkers three senior citizens hammering out a game of dominoes at a corner table all of it shrouded in a cigarette haze the color on the tv seemed to be bleeding and even at this distance rebus could tell that beyond the door to the mens room the urinal needed cleaning he felt his spirits dip but realized this was probably more trevor guests sort of place problem was that very fact meant his queries were less likely to yield a helpful smile the barman had a nose like a chewed tomatoa real boozers face etched with scars and nicks each one hinting at a story for late at night rebus knew his own face contained a few explicit chapters of its own he hardened his whole demeanor as he approached the bar pint of heavy no way he could ask for a half in a place like this he already had his cigarettes out ever see duncan these days he asked the barman who duncan barclay dont seem to know the name in trouble is he not especially one question in and already hed been exposed im a detective inspector he declared you dont say couple of questions i need to ask duncan doesnt live here moved to kelso right the barman just shrugged so which boozer does he now call home the barman had yet to make eye contact look at me rebus persisted and tell me im in the mood for this shit go on do it the sound of chairs scraping against floor as the oldtimers got to their feet rebus half turned toward them still game eh he said with a grin but im looking into three murders the grin vanished as he held up three fingers any of you want to become part of that investigation just keep standing he paused long enough for them to lower themselves back into their seats clever boys he said then to the barman whereabouts in kelso will i find him you could ask debbie the barman muttered she always had a wee crush on him and where would i find debbie saturdays she works in the grocery rebus pretended this was fine he took out the creased and printsmeared photograph of trevor guest years back the barman admitted buggered off back south i heard you heard wronghe headed for edinburgh got a name for him wanted to be called clever trevornever quite saw why probably after the ian dury song rebus mused he drank in here not for longbarred him for taking a swing he lived in the town though the barman shook his head slowly kelso i think he said then he started nodding definitely kelso meaning guest had lied to the cops in newcastle rebus was starting to get a bad feeling he left the pub without bothering to pay thought hed played it just about right took him a few minutes outside to let the tension ebb tracked back to the grocers and the saturday girldebbie she could see straightaway that he knew opened her mouth and began another version but he waved a hand in front of her and she stuttered to a halt then he leaned across the counter knuckles pressed down on it so what can you tell me about duncan barclay he asked we can either do it here or in a copshop in edinburghyour decision she had the good grace to start blushing in fact her color became so heightened he thought maybe she would burst like a balloon he lives in a cottage down carlingnose lane in kelso she managed a slow nod put a hand to her forehead as though she felt dizzy but as long as theres still light in the sky hes usually out in the woods the woods behind the cottage woods what had the psychologist said woods might be important how long have you known him debbie threemaybe four years hes older than you twentytwo she confirmed and yourewhat sixteen seventeen nineteen next birthday the two of you are an item bad choice of question her color deepened further rebus had known paler blackberries were just friendsi dont even see him that much these days what does he do wood carvingsbowls and stuff sells them in the galleries in edinburgh artistic type eh good with his hands hes brilliant nice sharp tools she started to answer but then stopped he hasnt done anything she cried have i said he has rebus tried to sound peeved what makes you think that he doesnt trust you me now rebus sounded confused all of you been in trouble before has he she shook her head slowly you dont understand she said quietly her eyes were growing moist he said you wouldnt debbie she burst out crying and pulled open the hatch emerging from behind the counter she had her arms stretched out and he did the same but she darted beneath them and by the time hed turned she was at the door hauling it open so its chimes rattled a complaint debbie he called but when he got to the pavement she was halfway down the street he cursed under his breath and realized that a woman toting an empty wicker basket was standing next to him he reached back behind the door and turned the sign from open to closed halfday on saturday he told her since when she spluttered in outraged tones okay he conceded then lets say its selfservejust leave your money on the counter he pushed past her and headed for his car siobhan felt like the specter at the feast the crowd jostling her as it bounced on its toes offkey singalongs flags of all nations obscuring her view sweary sweaty neds and nedettes dancing reels with college henrys and henriettas cheap beer and cider spuming from shared cans pizza crusts slippery underfoot and the bands performing on a stage a quarter mile away constant lines for the toilets she allowed herself a small smile as she remembered her backstage pass at the final push shed dutifully texted her two friends but so far without reply everybody looked so happy and boisterous and she could feel none of it all she could think about were cafferty gareth tench keith carberry cyril colliar trevor guest edward isley shed been entrusted by her own chief constable with a major case a result would have been a big step toward promotion but shed been sideswiped by the assault on her mother finding the attacker had become allconsuming throwing her too close to cafferty she knew she had to focus had to get involved again monday morning the investigation proper would be up and runningprobably under dci macrae and di derek starra team organized as much manpower as was necessary and shed been suspended only thing she could do was track down corbyn and apologizepersuade him to let her back in he would want her to swear she wouldnt let rebus anywhere near all ties severed the thought gave her pause sixtyforty chance shed agree if asked a new band had taken the main stage and someone had turned the volume up she checked her phone for texts one missed call she studied the callers number eric bain last bloody thing i need she told herself hed left a message but she wasnt about to listen to it stuck the phone back in her pocket and pulled a fresh bottle of water from her bag sweet smell of dope wafting over her but no sign of the dealer from camp horizon the young men on the stage were working hard but there was too much treble to their sound siobhan moved farther away couples were lying on the ground snogging or staring up at the sky with dreamy smiles on their faces she realized she was still walkinglacked the will to stop herselfheading for the field where shed parked her car new order was hours away and she knew she wouldnt be coming back for them what was waiting for her in edinburgh maybe she would phone rebus and tell him she was starting to forgive maybe shed just find herself a wine bar and a chilled bottle of chardonnay sit there with notebook and pen rehearsing the speech shed give the chief constable on monday morning if i let you back on the team theres no room for your partner in crimeunderstood ds clarke understood sir and i really do appreciate this and you agree to my terms well ds clarke a simple yes will suffice except that there was nothing simple about it back onto the m heading south this time twenty minutes and she was at the forth road bridge no more vehicle searches everything the way it had been before the g on the outskirts of edinburgh siobhan realized she was near cramond she decided she would drop in on ellen wylie thank her in person for listening to the previous nights rant she turned left down whitehouse road parked outside the house there was no answer called ellens cell its shiv she said when ellen answered i was going to bum a coffee off you were out walking i can hear the streamare you just behind the house there was silence on the line then later would be better well im right here i thought maybe a drink in townjust you and me sounds good but a frown had crept across siobhans face wylie seemed almost to sense this look she said maybe a quick cup of coffee thensee you in five rather than wait siobhan walked to the end of the terrace and down a short path to the river almond ellen and denise had been as far as the ruined mill but were heading back ellen waved but denise didnt seem so keen she was gripping her sisters arm just you and me denise wylie was shorter and thinner than her sister teenage fears about her weight had left her with a starved look her skin was gray the hair mousy brown and lifeless she refused to meet siobhans eyes hiya denise siobhan said anyway receiving a grunt in reply ellen on the other hand seemed almost unnaturally buoyed talking twenty to the dozen as they made their way back to the house go through to the garden ellen insisted and ill stick the kettle onor a glass of beer if youd preferbut youre driving arent you show wasnt up to much then or did you not go in the end im way past the age of going to watch pop groupsthough id change my mind for coldplayeven then id want to be sitting standing all day in a field isnt that what scarecrows and potato pickers do are you upstairs denise shall i bring you a cup up wylie emerged from the kitchen to place a plate of shortbread on the table you all right there shiv waters boiling cant remember what you take in it just milk siobhan peered up at the bedroom window is denise all right at that moment wylies sister appeared behind the glass eyes widening as she caught siobhan staring at her she yanked the curtains shut despite the clammy day the window itself was closed too shell be fine wylie said dismissing the question with a flick of her hand and what about you wylie gave a fluttering laugh what about me pair of you look like youve raided the medicine cabinet but found different bottles another short sharp laugh and wylie retreated to the kitchen siobhan rose slowly from the hardwood chair and followed her pausing at the threshold have you told her she asked quietly about what wylie opened the fridge and found the milk but then started searching for a jug gareth tenchdoes she know hes dead the words almost caught in siobhans throat tench plays away from home theres a colleague of mine ellen wylieher sisters skins more fragile than most oh christ ellen she said now reaching out a hand to grip the doorjamb whats the matter you know dont you siobhans voice was hardly above a whisper youre not making sense wylie stated fretting now with the tray lifting saucers on and then off again look me in the eye and tell me you dont know what im talking about ive absolutely no idea what youre i asked you to look me in the eye ellen wylie made the effort her mouth a thin determined line you sounded so weird on the phone siobhan told her and now all this jabbering while denise shoots upstairs i think you should go you might want to reconsider ellen but before you do i want to apologize apologize siobhan nodded keeping her eyes on wylie it was me who told cafferty wouldnt have been hard for him to get an address were you here she watched wylie bow her head he came here didnt he siobhan persisted came here and told denise about tench still being married she was still seeing him wylie was shaking her head slowly tears splashed from her cheeks onto the tiled floor ellenim so sorry there it was on the work surface near the sinka wooden rack of knives one slot empty kitchen spotless no sign of washingup anywhere you cant have her ellen wylie sobbed still shaking her head did you find out this morning after she got up its bound to come out ellen siobhan argued keep denying it itll destroy both of you siobhan remembered tenchs own words passions a snarling beast in some men yes and in some women too you cant have her ellen wylie repeated but the words had taken on a resigned lifeless sound shell get help siobhan had taken a couple of steps into the small boxy room she pressed her hand to ellen wylies arm talk to her tell her itll be all right youll be there for her wylie rubbed the back of her forearm across her face smearing the tears youve no evidence she mumbled lines shed walked herself through a scripted denial prepared for the eventuality do we need any siobhan asked maybe i should ask denise no please another shake of the head and eyes that burned into siobhans what are the chances no one saw her ellen think she wont pop up somewhere on security tapes think the clothes she wore wont turn up the knife she ditched if it were my case id send a couple of frogmen to the riverbank maybe thats why you went therelooking to retrieve it and make a better job of disposal oh god wylie said voice cracking siobhan gave her a hug feeling the body beginning to trembledelayed shock you need to be strong for her ellen just for a little while longer you need to hang on siobhans thoughts churned as she rubbed a hand across wylies back if denise was capable of killing gareth tench what else might she have done she felt ellen wylie tense and pull away from her the two womens eyes met i know what youre thinking wylie said quietly do you but denise never so much as looked at beastwatch i was the one who was interested not her youre also the one trying to hide gareth tenchs killer ellen maybe its you we should be looking at eh siobhans voice had hardened so too had wylies face but after a moment it cracked into a sour smile is that the best you can do siobhan maybe youre not as hot as people think chief constable might have put you in charge but we both know its john rebuss showthough i dont suppose thatll stop you taking the creditalways supposing you get a result so go ahead and charge me if you want she held out her wrists as if awaiting handcuffs then when siobhan did nothing began a slow humorless laugh not as hot as people think she repeated not as hot as people think rebus lost no time on the road to kelso it was only eight miles away no sign of debbie in any of the cars he saw didnt mean she hadnt contacted barclay already by phone the countryside would have been impressive if hed given it any heed he sped past the sign welcoming safe drivers to the town and braked hard when he spotted his first pedestrian she was dressed head to foot in tweed and walking a small bugeyed dog looked like she was on her way into the lidl supermarket carlingnose lane rebus told her know where it is im afraid i dont she was still apologizing as rebus drove off he tried again in the town center received half a dozen different possibilities from the first three locals he asked near floors castleup by the rugby groundthe golf coursethe edinburgh road eventually he found that floors castle was on the road marked edinburgh its high perimeter wall seemed to stretch for hundreds of yards rebus saw signs to the golf course then spotted a park with sets of rugby posts but the housing all around him looked too new until a couple of schoolgirls walking a dog put him right behind the new houses the saab complained as he slammed it back into first engine was making a funny sound hed only just noticed it carlingnose lane comprised a single row of tumbledown cottages the first couple had been modernized and given a lick of paint the track ended at the final cottage its whitewashed walls turning yellow a homemade sign proclaimed local crafts for sale bits of discarded tree lay strewn across the small front garden rebus stopped the car at a fivebar gate beyond which a trail led across a meadow and into some woods he tried barclays door and peered in through the small window living room with kitchenette off it and untidy at that part of the back wall had been removed and french doors fitted meaning rebus could see that the back garden was every bit as deserted and unkempt as the front he looked up and saw that a pylon fed an electricity cable to the house no antenna though and no sign of a tv inside and no phone line next door had onearcing toward it from a wooden telegraph pole in the meadow doesnt mean hes not got a cell rebus muttered to himselfin fact probably made it more likely barclay had to keep in touch with those edinburgh galleries somehow to the side of the cottage sat a venerable land rover didnt look like it was used much hood cool to the touch but the key dangled from the ignition meaning one of two thingsno fear of car thieves or ready for a quick getaway rebus opened the driversside door and removed the key tucking it into his top pocket he stood by the meadow and lit a cigarette if debbie had managed to warn barclay hed either hoofed it on foot or had access to another vehicleor he was on his way back he took out his own phone signal strength of a single bar angling the phone the words no signal came up he climbed the gate and tried again no signal decided that what was left of the afternoon merited a walk into the woods the air was warm birdsong and distant traffic a plane high overhead its undercarriage glinting im on my way rebus thought to meeting a man in the middle of nowhere with no phone worth the name a man who once got into a fight a man who knows the police are coming and doesnt like them just great john he said out loud his breathing a little ragged as he climbed toward the tree line couldnt even say what kinds of trees they were brown ones with leaveswhich ruled out conifers but not much else he hoped to hear sounds of an ax or maybe a chain saw noscrub thatdidnt want barclay holding any form of sharpened tool wondered if maybe he should call out cleared his throat but didnt get any further now he was higher up maybe his phone would no signal lovely views though pausing to catch his breath he just hoped he would live to remember them why was duncan barclay nervous about seeing the police rebus would be sure to ask if he ever found him hed entered the forest now the ground yielding underfoot a thick mulchy carpet he had the feeling he was on a path of some kind invisible to the untutored eye but there all the samea route between saplings and shorn trunks avoiding the low scrub the place reminded him a lot of the clootie well he kept glancing to left and right stopping every few steps for another listen all alone and then another track appearedthis one wide enough for a vehicle rebus crouched down the pattern of tires looked crusteda few days old at the very least he gave a little snort not exactly tonto he muttered straightening up and brushing dried mud from his fingers not exactly a mans voice echoed rebus looked around and spotted its owner eventually he was seated on a fallen tree one leg crossed over the other a few yards off the track and dressed in olive green outerwear good camouflage rebus said are you duncan duncan barclay gave a little bow of his head rebus got closer and noted the sandy hair and freckled face maybe six feet tall but wiry the eyes were the same pale color as their owners jacket youre a policeman barclay stated rebus wasnt about to deny it did debbie warn you barclay stretched out his arms no meansim a luddite in that regard as in several others rebus nodded i noticed at the cottageno tv or phone line and no cottages either soon enoughdevelopers got his eye on them then itll be the field and after that the woodsi thought youd be coming he paused at rebuss look not you personally but someone like you because trevor guest the young man stated i didnt know he was dead till i read it in the paper but when they said the case was being handled in edinburghwell i thought there might still be something about me in the files rebus nodded and lifted out his cigarettes mind if i id rather you didntand so would the trees theyre your friends rebus asked putting the pack away then so you only found out about trevor guest when it was in the papers barclay paused to consider was it wednesday i didnt actually buy a paper you understandive no time for them but i saw the headline on the front of the scotsman went and got himself done in by some sort of serial killer some sort of killer yes rebus took a step back as barclay suddenly bounded to his feet but all the young man did was gesture with a crooked finger and then start walking follow me and ill show you he said show me what the whole reason youre here rebus held back but eventually relented catching up with barclay is it far duncan he asked barclay shook his head he walked with large purposeful strides you spend a lot of time in the woods as much as i can other woods too not just these ones i mean i find bits and pieces all over bits and branches uprooted trunks and the clootie well barclay turned his head toward rebus what about it ever been there dont think so barclay stopped so suddenly rebus almost went past him the young mans eyes had widened he slapped a hand to his forehead rebus could see the bruised fingernails and traces of scar tissueevidence of an artisans life holy christ barclay gasped i can see what youre thinking and whats that duncan you think maybe i did it me really holy mother of christ barclay gave a shake of the head and started walking again almost faster than before so that rebus struggled to keep up just wondering why you and trevor guest had that fight he asked between lungfuls of oxygen background info thats all im here for but you do think i did it well did you no nothing to worry about then rebus looked around not really sure of his bearings he could retrace the vehicle track but would he know where to branch off to reach the meadow and civilization i cant believe you think that barclay gave another shake of his head i conjure new life from dead wood the living world means everything to me trevor guest isnt coming back as a fruit bowl anytime soon trevor guest was an animal as abruptly as before barclay stopped again arent animals part of the living world rebus asked breathlessly you know i dont mean it like that he was sweeping the area with his eyes they said as much in the scotsmanhe was locked up for burglary rape sexual assault actually barclay continued regardless he was locked away because theyd finally caught up with himthe truth had come out but hed been an animal long before that he was heading into the woods again rebus trailing after him trying to get images of blair witch out of his head the landscape was sloping down a gradient growing steeper rebus realized they were now on the other side of the track from civilization he started looking around for a weapon of some kind bent down and picked up a tree branch gave it a shake and it crumbled in his hand its innards rotted away what is it youre going to show me he asked one more minute barclay held up a single digit for effect hey i dont even know who you are names rebus im a detective inspector i talked to you guys you knowback when it happened tried to get you to look at trevor guest but i dont think you did i was in my teensalready marked out as the weird kid coldstreams like one big tribe inspector when you dont fit in its not easy to pretend you do im sure thats true a comment rather than the question rebus really wanted to askwhat the hell are you talking about its better now people see the things i make they can appreciate that theres a glimmer of talent there when did you move to kelso this is my third year must like it then barclay looked at rebus then gave a quick smile making conversation eh because youre nervous i dont like games rebus stated ill tell you who does thoughwhoever left those trophies at the clootie well thats something we agree on rebus almost lost his footing felt something tear in his ankle as he went over on it careful barclay said without stopping thanks rebus replied hobbling after him but the young man stopped again almost immediately there was a chainlink fence in front of them and farther down the hill a modern bungalow great views barclay offered nice and quiet you have to drive all the way down therehe traced the route with a fingerto reach the main road he turned his whole body toward rebus this is where she died id seen her in town chatted with her we were all in shock when it happened his look intensified as he saw rebus was still in the dark mr and mrs webster he hissed i mean he died later but thats where his wife was murdered he stabbed a finger at the bungalow in there rebuss mouth felt dry ben websters mother yes of coursevacation home in the borders he remembered the photos from the file mairie had compiled youre saying trevor guest killed her hed moved here only a few months before moved out again quick afterward a few of his drinking pals said it was because he already had a history with the police in newcastle he used to hassle me in the street tell me i was a teenager with long hair so i had to know where he could get drugs he paused for a moment then i was up in edinburgh that night drinking with a pal and i saw him id already told the cops i thought he did it seemed to me the whole case was shoddy he stared hard at rebus you never followed it up you saw him in the pub rebuss head was reeling the blood pounding in his ears i lashed out i admit it felt bloody wonderful and then when i saw that hed been killedwell i felt better stilland vindicated too said as much in the paperhed been in jail for burglary and rape sexual assault rebus said weakly the anomalyone of several and thats what hed done herebroken in killed mrs webster and ransacked the place then fled to edinburgh suddenly penitent and of a mind to help those older and weaker than himself gareth tench had been rightsomething had happened to trevor guest something lifechanging if rebus were to believe duncan barclays story he didnt assault her rebus argued say again rebus cleared his throat spat out some gluey saliva mrs webster wasnt raped or assaulted no because she was too oldthe kid he did in newcastle was in her teens yes and hadnt hackman confirmed itliked them a bit on the young side youve given it a lot of thought rebus seemed to concede but you wouldnt believe me well im sorry about that rebus leaned against a tree and ran a hand through his hair his fingers came away coated in sweat and i cant be a suspect barclay went on because i didnt know the other two men three killings he stressed not just one thats rightnot just one a killer who likes games rebus thought back to dr gilreaghrurality and anomalies i could tell he was trouble barclay was saying from the first time i clapped eyes on him in coldstream i could use one of those right now rebus interrupted a nice cool current of water to duck his head under trevor guest as the killer of ben websters mother the father dies of a broken heartmeaning guest has destroyed the whole family goes to jail for another offense but when he gets out and soon after ben webster mp takes a nosedive over the parapets of edinburgh castle ben webster duncan a yell in the distance somewhere uphill debbie barclay called back down here he started clambering up the slope rebus toiling in his wake by the time he reached the vehicle track barclay was enveloping debbie with a hug i wanted to tell you she was explaining her words muffled by his jacket and i couldnt get a lift and i knew hed be looking for me and i got here as soon as she broke off as she caught sight of rebus gave a little squeal and pulled back from barclay its all right he told her me and the inspector have just been talking thats all he looked over his shoulder at rebus and whats more i actually think hes been listening rebus nodded his agreement with this and slid his hands into his pockets but ill need you in edinburgh all the same he announced everything youve just said could do with being a matter of record dont you think barclay smiled a tired smile after all this time itll be my pleasure debbie bounced on her toes one arm sliding around duncan barclays waist i want to come too dont leave me here thing is barclay said with a sly glance at rebus the inspector here has me down as a suspectwhich would make you my accomplice she looked shocked duncan wouldnt hurt a soul she squealed gripping him more tightly than ever or a wood louse i daresay rebus added these woods have looked after me barclay said quietly eyes fixed on rebus thats why the stick you picked up fell apart in your hand he gave a huge wink then to debbie you sure about this our first date a police station in edinburgh she replied by going up onto her tiptoes again and planting a kiss on his lips the trees started rustling in a sudden gentle breeze back to the car children rebus commanded hed taken half a dozen tentative steps along the track when barclay indicated that he was headed in completely the wrong direction siobhan realized she was headed the wrong way well not the wrong way exactlydepended which destination she had in mind and that was the problem she couldnt think of one home probably but what would she do there as she was already on silverknowes road she pushed on until marine drive then pulled over at the side of the road other cars were already parked there it was a popular spot on weekends with views across the firth of forth dogs were being exercised sandwiches eaten a helicopter rose loudly into the air taking its passengers on one of the regular sightseeing tours reminding her of the chopper at gleneagles one year siobhan had bought rebus a gift certificate for the tour as a birthday present as far as she knew hed never used it she knew hed want to hear about denise and gareth tench ellen wylie had promised to call craigmillar and get them to come take a statement which hadnt stopped siobhan requesting the selfsame thing as soon as shed left the house shed had half a mind to get them to pull both women in kept hearing wylies laughtermore than a touch of hysteria to it maybe natural under the circumstances but all the sameshe lifted her phone now took a deep breath and punched in rebuss number the woman who answered was just a recording your call cannot be takenplease try again later she stared at the liquid crystal display and remembered that eric bain had left a message in for a penny she muttered to herself pushing more buttons siobhan its eric the recorded voice sounded slurred mollys walked out andchrist i dont know why im the sound of coughing juss wann you tomatryin to say another dry cough as though he was on the verge of being sick siobhan stared out at the scenery not really seeing it oh hell andtakentaken too many she cursed under her breath and turned the ignition slammed the car into gear headlights switched to high beam and her hand pressed to the horn at every red light managed to steer and call for an ambulance at the same time thought shed still beat it twelve minutes and she was pulling to a stop outside his blockno damage other than a scrape to her bodywork and a dinged wing mirror meaning another trip to rebuss friendly repair shop outside bains place she didnt even have to knockthe door had been left ajar she ran in found him slumped on the floor in the living room head resting against a chair empty smirnoff bottle empty tylenol bottle she snatched his wristit was warm his breathing shallow but steady a sheen of sweat on his face and a stain at the crotch where hed wet himself she shouted his name a few times slapping his cheeks prying open his eyes come on eric wakeywakey shaking his body time to get up eric come on you lazy fuck he was too heavy for her no way she could haul him to his feet unaided she checked that his mouth was clearnothing impeding the airway shook him again how many did you take eric how many tablets the door left ajar was a good signmeant he wanted to be found and hed called her toocalled her you always were a drama queen eric she told him pushing the slick hair back from his forehead the room was messy what if molly comes back and sees how untidy youve made everything better get up right now his eyes were fluttering a groan coming from deep within him noises at the door paramedics in their green uniforms one of them toting a box whats he taken tylenol how long ago couple of hours whats his name eric she got up and moved back a little giving them room they were checking his pupils taking out the instruments theyd need can you hear me eric one of them asked any chance you can give me a nod maybe just move your fingers for me eric my names colin and im going to be looking after you eric just nod your head if youre hearing me eric siobhan stood there with arms folded when eric spasmed and then started to puke one of the paramedics asked her to look around the rest of the apartment see what else he might have ingested as she left the room she wondered if maybe he was just trying to spare her the sight nothing in the kitchenit was spotless apart from a liter of milk that needed putting in the fridgeand next to it the screw cap from the smirnoff she crossed to the bathroom the door of the medicine cabinet stood open some unopened packets of flu remedy had ended up in the sink she put them back there was a fresh bottle of aspirin its seal intact so maybe the tylenol bottle had been opened previously meaning he might not have taken as many as shed thought bedroom mollys things were still there but strewn across the floor as though eric had planned some act of retribution upon them a snapshot of the pair of them had been removed from its frame but was otherwise undamaged as though hed been unable to go through with it she reported back to the paramedics eric had stopped vomiting but the room reeked of the stuff so thats two thirds of a bottle of neat vodka the one called colin said and maybe thirty tablets as a chaser most of which has just come back to say hello his colleague added so hell be all right she asked depends on the internal damage you said two hours he called me twonearly three hours ago they looked at her i didnt get the message untilwell seconds before i called it in how drunk was he when he called his speech was slurred no kidding colin locked eyes with his partner how do we get him downstairs strapped to a stretcher stairwell has a few tight corners so give me an alternative ill call for backup colin rose to his feet i could take his legs siobhan offered those corners wont seem nearly so tight if theres no stretcher to maneuver fair point the paramedics shared another look siobhans phone started ringing she went to turn it off but caller id had flashed up the letters jr she stepped out into the hall and answered the call youre not going to believe it she blurted out realizing as she did so that rebus was telling her the exact same thing he had decided on st leonardsfigured there was less chance of being spotted there no one on the front desk had seemed to know he was under suspension they hadnt even asked why he wanted the use of an interview room and had let him borrow a constable to act as witness to the recording he was about to make duncan barclay and debbie glenister sat next to each other throughout nursing cans of cola and feasting on chocolate from the vending machine rebus had broken open a fresh pack of cassette tapes slotting two into the machine barclay had asked why two one for you and one for us rebus had answered the questioning had been straightforward the constable sitting bemused throughout rebus having failed to explain any of the background to him afterward rebus had asked the officer if he could arrange transport for the visitors back to kelso hed guessed sounding daunted but debbie had squeezed barclays arm and said maybe they could be dropped somewhere along princes street instead barclay had hesitated but finally agreed as they were preparing to leave rebus had slipped him forty pounds drinks here can be that bit more expensive hed explained and its a loan rather than a handout i want one of your best fruit bowls next time youre in town so barclay had nodded and accepted the notes all these questions inspector hed said have they helped you at all more than you might think mr barclay rebus had said shaking the young mans hand before retreating to one of the empty upstairs offices this was where hed been based before the move to gayfield square eight years of crimes solved and shelvedit surprised him that no mark had been left there was no visible trace of him here or of all those convoluted casesthe ones he remembered best the walls were bare most of the desks unused and lacking even chairs to sit on before st leonards hed worked at the station on great london roadand the high street before thatthirty years hed been a cop and thought hed seen just about everything until this there was a large whiteboard on one wall he wiped it clean with some paper towels from the mens room the ink was hard to erase meaning it had been there for weeksbackground to operation sorbus officers would have heaved their backsides onto the desks and sat there swigging coffee while their boss filled them in on what was to come now safely erased rebus searched in the drawers of the nearest desks until he found a marker he began to write on the board starting at the top and working down with lines branching off to the sides some words he double underlined others he encircled a few he stuck question marks after when he was finished he stood back and surveyed his mind map of the clootie well killings it was siobhan whod taught him about such maps she seldom worked a case without them though usually they stayed in her drawer or briefcase she would bring them out to remind herself of somethingsome avenue not yet explored or connection meriting further inspection it took a while for her to own up to their existence why because shed thought he would laugh at her but in a case as apparently complex as this a mind map was the perfect tool because when you started to look at it the complexity vanished leaving just a central core trevor guest the anomaly his body attacked with unusual viciousness dr gilreagh had warned them to look out for feints and shed been right the whole case had been almost nothing but a magicians misdirection rebus slid his backside onto one of the desks it gave only the mildest creak of complaint his legs made little paddling motions as they hung above the floor his palms were pressed against the surface of the desk on either side of him he leaned forward slightly gazing at the writing on the wall the arrows and underlinings and question marks he started to see ways to resolve those few questions he started to see the whole picture the one the killer had been trying to disguise and then he walked out of the office and the station into the fresh air and across the road headed to the nearest shop and realized he didnt really want anything bought cigarettes and a lighter and some chewing gum added the afternoon edition of the evening news decided to call siobhan at the hospital to ask how much longer she would be im here she told him meaning st leonards where the hell are you i must just have missed you the shopkeeper called out as he pulled open the door to leave rebus twitched his mouth in apology and reached into his pocket to pay the man where the hell was his mustve given barclay his last two twenties he pulled out some loose change instead poured it onto the counter not enough for cigarettes the elderly asian complained rebus shrugged and handed them back where are you siobhan was asking into his ear buying chewing gum and a lighter he could have added but no cigarettes they sat down with mugs of instant coffee silent for the first minute or so then rebus thought to ask about bain ironically she said given the amount of painkillers hed scarfed the first thing he complained of was a thumping headache my fault in a way rebus told her explaining first of all about his morning conversation with bain and then about his chat the night before with molly so we have a fallingout over tenchs corpse siobhan said and you head straight to a lapdancing club rebus shrugged deciding he had been right to leave out the visit to caffertys home well siobhan went on with a sigh while were playing the selfblame game and she filled him in on bain and t in the park and denise wylie at the end of which there was another lengthy silence rebus was on his fifth piece of chewing gumdidnt really go with coffee but he needed some outlet for the current that was pounding through him you really think ellens turned her sister in he eventually asked what else could she do he gave a shrug then watched as siobhan picked up a handset and made a call to craigmillar guy you want is ds mcmanus he informed her she looked at him as if to say how the hell do you know that he decided it was time to get up and find a wastebasket in which to deposit the wad of flavorless gum when she finished the call siobhan joined him in front of the whiteboard pair of them are there right now mcmanus is going easy on denise figures she could play the mental cruelty card she paused when was it exactly that you spoke to him rebus deflected the question by pointing to the board see what ive done here shiv taken a leaf out of your book so to speak he tapped the middle of the board with his knuckles and it all boils down to trevor guest theoretically she added evidence comes later he started to trace the time line of the killings with a finger say trevor guest did kill ben websters mother in fact we dont need to say that at all its enough that guests killer believed he did the killer sticks guests name into a search engine and comes up with beastwatch thats what gives the killer the idea make it look like theres a serial killer at large the police are fooled as a result looking in all the wrong places for the motive killer knows about the g so decides to leave a few clues right there under our noses knowing theyll be found killer was never a beastwatch subscriber so knows theyve got nothing to fear well be run ragged tracking down all the people who were and warning all the other sex attackersand with the g and everything chances are the investigation will end up tying itself in knots too tight ever to be unraveled remember what gilreagh saidthe display was slightly wrong she was right because it was only ever guest the killer wantedonly ever guest he prodded the name again the man whod torn the webster family apart rurality and anomalies siobhanand being led up the garden path but how could the killer have known that siobhan felt obliged to ask by having access to the original inquiry maybe going through it all with a finetooth comb going to the borders and asking around listening in on the local gossip she was standing next to him staring at the board youre saying cyril colliar and eddie isley died as a diversion worked too if wed been running a fullscale inquiry we might have missed the kelso connection rebus gave a short harsh laugh i seem to remember i gave a snort when gilreagh started talking about the countryside and deep woods near human dwellings is this the sort of terrain the victims inhabited dead on doc he said in an undertone siobhan ran her finger along ben websters name so why did he kill himself how do you mean well do you think it was the guilt finally catching up with him hes killed three men when only one was necessary hes under a lot of pressure because of the g weve just identified the patch from cyril colliars jacket he starts to panic that we will catch himis that how you see it im not even sure he knew about the patch rebus said quietly and how would he have gone about procuring some heroin for those lethal injections why are you asking me siobhan gave a short laugh because youre the one whos accusing an innocent man no access to hard drugsno easy access to police files rebus traced the line from ben webster to his sister stacey on the other hand stacey is an undercover cop probably means she knows a few dealers shes spent the past few months infiltrating anarchist groupstold me herself they tend to base themselves outside london these daysleeds and manchester and bradford guest died in newcastle isley in carlisleboth a manageable drive from the midlands as a cop shed be able to access any information she liked staceys the killer using your wonderful systemrebus slapped his hand against the board againits the obvious conclusion siobhan was shaking her head slowly but she wasi mean we talked to her shes good rebus conceded shes very good and now shes back in london weve no proofnot a shred of evidence true up to a point but when you listen to duncan barclays tape youll hear him say she was in kelso last year asking around she even spoke to him he mentioned trevor guest to her trevor with his housebreakers credentials trevor who was in the area same time mrs webster was killed rebus gave a shrug to let her know he had no trouble accepting any of this all three were attacked from behind siobhan whacked hard so they couldnt retaliatejust the way a woman would do it he paused theres her name gilreagh said there could be something significant about trees staceys not the name of a tree he shook his head but santal is it means sandalwood i always thought sandalwood was just a perfume turns out its a tree he shook his head in wonder at stacey websters intricate construction and she left guests cash card he concluded because she wanted to be sure wed have his nameleading us by the nose a bloody smoke screen just like gilreagh said siobhan was studying the board again probing the schematic for flaws so what happened to ben she asked at last i can tell you what i think go on then she folded her arms guards at the castle thought there was an intruder my guess is it was stacey she knew her brother was there and was bursting to tell him wed found the patchshed probably heard about that from steelforth thought it was time to share news of her exploits with her brother as far as she was concerned guests death meant closure and by christ shed made sure he paid for his crimesmutilating his body she relishes the challenge of sneaking past the guards maybe shes sent him a message so he comes out to meet her she tells him everything and he offs himself rebus scratched the back of his head i think shes the only one who can tell us in fact if we play it right bens going to be crucial in getting a confession think how hellish she must be feelingthats her whole family gone now and the one thing she thought would bring her and ben closer together has actually destroyed him and its all her fault she did a pretty good job of hiding it behind all those masks she wears rebus agreed all these warring sides to her personality steady siobhan warned youre starting to sound like gilreagh he burst out laughing but stopped just as abruptly and scratched at his head again eventually running the hand through his hair do you think it holds up siobhan puffed out her cheeks and exhaled loudly i need to give it a bit more thought she conceded i meanscrawled on a board like this i can see it makes a kind of sense i just dont see how well prove any of it we start with what happened to ben fine but if she denies it were left with nothing youve just said so yourself john she wears all these masks nothing to stop her slipping one on when we start asking about her brother one way to find out rebus said he was holding stacey websters business card the one with her cell number think for a minute siobhan counseled soon as you call her youre giving her advance warning then we go to london and hope steelforth lets us talk to her rebus considered for a moment yes he said quietly steelforthfunny how quickly he knocked her back to london isnt it almost as if he knew we were getting close you think he knew there was surveillance video at the castle he told me there was nothing to see but now im wondering theres no way hes going to let us go public siobhan argued one of his officers turns out to be a killer and might even have done away with her own brother not exactly the pr hes looking for which is why he might be willing to do a deal and what exactly have we got to offer control rebus stated we step back and let him do it his way if he turns us down we go to mairie henderson siobhan spent the best part of a minute considering the options then she saw rebuss eyes widen and we dont even have to go to london he told her why not because steelforths not in london then where is he under our bloody noses rebus explained starting to wipe the board clean by which he meant an hours rapid drive to the west they spent the whole trip going through rebuss theory trevor guest hightailing it out of newcastlemaybe owing money on some deal quick route to the handily anonymous border country scratches around but cant find a fix and hasnt any money his one area of expertise burglary but mrs webster is home and he ends up killing her panics and flees to edinburgh where he assuages his guilt by working with the elderly with people like the woman he murdered not sexually assaultedhe liked them a lot younger meanwhilestacey webster is destroyed by her mothers murder heartbroken when the death destroys her father too using her detectives skills to track down the likely culprit only hes already behind bars but due out soon giving her time to plan her revenge shes found guest on beastwatch alongside others like him she picks her targets geographicallyeasy reach of her midlands base her counter culture existence gives her access to heroin does she get guest to confess before she murders him it doesnt really matter by then shes already killed eddie isley adds one more to reinforce the notion that a serial killer is at large then stops sated and at peace far as shes concerned shes been cleaning scum off the streets sos g planning has led her to the clootie well and she knows its the perfect spot someone will happen upon it and theyll spot the clues to be certain she ensures they have one name straightawaythe only name that matters no way shes going to be found the perfect crime nearly i have to admit siobhan said it sounds plausible thats because its what happened thing about the truth siobhan it almost always makes sense they made good time along the m and got onto the a the village of luss was just off the main road on the western shore of loch lomond they used to film take the high road here rebus informed his passenger one of the few soaps ive never watched cars were crawling past them on the other side of the road looks like plays finished for today siobhan commented might have to come back tomorrow but rebus wasnt about to concede defeat loch lomond golf club was a membersonly facility and the arrival of the open had brought with it extra security there were guards on the main gate and they checked both rebuss and siobhans id carefully before phoning on ahead during which time a mirror on a long stick was played along the length of the cars undercarriage after thursday were taking no chances the guard explained handing back their badges ask at the clubhouse for commander steelforth thanks rebus said by the waywhos winning its a tietim clark and maarten lafeber fifteen under tim shot six under today montys nicely placed thoughten under be a great game tomorrow rebus thanked the guard again and put the saab into gear did you catch any of that he asked siobhan i know monty means colin montgomerie then youre every bit as well informed about the royal and ancient game as i am youve never tried he shook his head its those pastel sweatersi could never see myself wearing one as they parked and climbed out half a dozen spectators walked past discussing the days events one wore a pink vneck the others yellow or pale orange or sky blue see what i mean rebus said siobhan nodded her agreement the clubhouse was scots baronial and called rossdhu there was a silver mercedes parked up alongside the chauffeur snoozing in the front seat rebus remembered him from gleneaglessteelforths designated driver cheers big man he said raising his eyes to the heavens a short bespectacled gent with a highly developed mustache and sense of his own importance was striding out of the building toward them all manner of laminated passes and id cards were strung around his neck clacking together as he moved he barked out a word that sounded like sekty but rebus chose to translate as secretary the bony hand that shook rebuss was trying too hard but at least he got a handshake siobhan might as well have been a shrub we need to speak to commander david steelforth rebus explained i doubt hes the type to rub shoulders with the unwashed masses steelforth the secretary took off his glasses and rubbed them against the sleeve of his crimson sweater could he be corporate thats his driver rebus said nodding toward the merc siobhan chipped in pennen industries the secretary slipped his glasses back on and directed his reply at rebus oh yes mr pennen has a hospitality tent he glanced at his wristwatch probably winding down by now mind if we check the secretarys face twitched and he told them to wait before disappearing back into the building rebus looked at siobhan awaiting some comment officious twerp she obliged you wont be wanting an application form have you seen any women since we got here rebus looked around before admitting she had a point he turned at the sound of an electric motor it was a golf cart emerging from behind rossdhu house and driven by the secretary hop on he told them cant we walk rebus asked the secretary shook his head and repeated the instruction there were two rearfacing cushioned seats at the back of the cart lucky youre smallboned rebus told siobhan the secretary was ordering them to hold on tight the machine clunked into action at a rate just above walking speed whee siobhan said managing to look underwhelmed reckon the chief constables a golf fan rebus asked probably the luck weve had this week well be passing him any moment but they didnt the course itself was home to only a few last stragglers the stands were vacant and the sun was setting amazing siobhan was forced to admit as she stared across loch lomond to the mountains beyond takes me back to my youth rebus told her did you come here on vacation he shook his head but the neighbors did and they always sent a postcard swiveling round as best he could he saw they were approaching a village of tents with its own cordon and security white tents piped music and the sounds of loud conversation the secretary slowed the cart to a stop and nodded toward one of the larger tents it had clear plastic windows and liveried serving staff champagne was being poured oysters offered from silver salvers thanks for the lift rebus said shall i wait rebus shook his head well find our own way sir thanks again lothian and borders rebus stated to the guards opening his id your chief constables in the champagne tent one of the guards replied helpfully rebus gave siobhan a look that kind of weekhe picked up a glass of fizz and worked his way through the throng thought he recognized some of the faces from prestonfieldg delegates people richard pennen wanted to do business with the kenyan diplomat joseph kamweze met rebuss gaze but turned away quickly pushing deeper into the crowd quite the united nations siobhan commented eyes were appraising her not too many women on display but the ones who werewell on display summed it up cascading hair short tight dresses and fixed smiles they would describe themselves as models rather than escorts hired by the day to add glamour and sunbed tan to proceedings should have smartened yourself up rebus scolded siobhan bit of makeup never goes amiss listen to karl lagerfeld she retorted rebus tapped her shoulder our host he gave a nod in the direction of richard pennen same immaculate hair glinting cuff links heavy gold wristwatch but something had changed the face seemed less bronzed the posture less confident when pennen laughed at something his companion was saying he threw his head back a little too far mouth open too wide faking it obviously his companion seemed to think so too and studied pennen wondering what to make of him pennens flunkiesone per shoulder as at prestonfieldalso looked nervous at their bosss inability to play the game as before rebus thought for a moment of walking right up to pennen and asking how things were just for the pleasure of getting a reaction but siobhan had placed a hand on his arm directing his attention elsewhere david steelforth emerging from the champagne tent deep in conversation with chief constable james corbyn bugger rebus said then after a deep breath in for a pound he could feel siobhan hesitate and turned toward her maybe you should go walk around for a few minutes but shed come to her decision and actually led the way toward the two men sorry to interrupt she was saying as rebus caught up what the hell are you two doing here corbyn spluttered never one to miss free bubbly rebus explained raising his glass expect thats your reasoning too sir corbyns face had reddened mightily i was invited us too sir siobhan said in a manner of speaking hows that steelforth asked looking amused murder inquiry sir rebus said tends to act as a vip pass vvip siobhan corrected him youre saying ben webster was murdered steelforth asked eyes on rebus not quite rebus answered but weve an inkling why he died and it seems to connect to the clootie well he shifted his gaze to corbyn we can fill you in later sir but right now its commander steelforth we need to talk to im sure it can wait corbyn snapped rebus turned back to steelforth who offered another smile this time for corbyns benefit i think id better listen to what the inspector and his colleague have to say very well the chief constable relented fire away rebus paused exchanging a glance with siobhan steelforth was quick to catch on he made a show of handing his untouched glass to corbyn ill be right back chief constable im sure your officers will explain everything to you in due course theyd better corbyn stressed eyes boring into siobhan steelforth patted his arm reassuringly and walked away rebus and siobhan close behind when all three reached the low white picket fence they stopped steelforth faced away from the crowd toward the course where groundsmen were hard at work replacing divots and raking sand traps he slid his hands into his pockets what is it you think you know he asked nonchalantly i think you know rebus answered when i mentioned the link between webster and the clootie well you didnt blink makes me think you already suspected something stacey websters your officer after all you probably like to keep tabs on hermaybe started wondering why she was making sorties north to places like newcastle and carlisle also makes me wonder what you saw on the security film that night at the castle spit it out steelforth hissed siobhan took over we think stacey webster is our serial killer she wanted trevor guest but was prepared to kill two more men to hide the fact and when she went to tell her brother the news rebus continued well he didnt take it well maybe he jumped maybe he was appalled and threatened to go publicshe decided he had to be silenced he gave a shrug fanciful stuff steelforth commented still not looking at either of them being good detectives youll have put together a watertight case should be easy enough now we know what were looking for rebus told him of course itll be damaging for so steelforth gave a twitch of the mouth turned degrees to watch the feasting until about an hour ago he drawled id have told the pair of you to go fuck yourselves know why pennen offered you a job rebus said steelforth raised an eyebrow educated guess rebus explained its him youve been protecting throughout mustve been a reason for it steelforth nodded slowly it so happens youre right but youve changed your mind siobhan added you just need to look at him its all crumbling to dust isnt it like a statue in the desert siobhan commented eyes on rebus monday i was tendering my resignation steelforth said ruefully special branch could have gone to hell some might say it already has rebus stated when one of its operatives is allowed to slaughter left and right steelforth was still staring at richard pennen funny the way it sometimes worksits the tiniest flaws that bring a structure down like al capone siobhan added helpfully they only got him for tax evasion didnt they steelforth ignored her and turned his attention to rebus instead the security video wasnt conclusive he admitted it showed ben webster meeting someone ten minutes after he took a call on his cell do we need to check the phone company records or shall we assume it was stacey as i say the video wasnt conclusive so what did it show steelforth gave a shrug two people talkingwebster seeming to remonstrategrabbing the other person by the shoulders as if to shake some sense into them and a push in the chest enough to make him lose his balance if you ask me it was hardly enough to send him over the parapet steelforth locked eyes with rebus in that instant he wanted it to happen there was silence for a moment broken by siobhan and youd have swept it all under the carpet so as not to make a fuss just like youve dispatched stacey webster to london yes wellgood luck discussing that with ds webster what do you mean he turned toward her shes not been heard of since wednesday seems she boarded the night train to euston siobhans eyes narrowed the london bombings be a miracle if we idd every victim screw that rebus said pressing his face close to steelforths youre hiding her steelforth gave a laugh you do see conspiracies everywhere dont you rebus you knew what shed done bombs were the perfect cover for her to vanish steelforths face hardened shes gone he said so go ahead and compile any evidence you can findsomehow i doubt itll get you anywhere itll dump a trailerload of dung on your head rebus warned will it steelforths jaw jutted out barely an inch from rebuss face good for the land though isnt it the occasional bit of manure now if youll excuse me im going to get absolutely smashed at richard pennens expense he strode away from them removing his hands from his pockets so he could take his glass back from corbyn the chief constable said something and gestured toward the two lothian and borders detectives steelforth just shook his head then leaned a little toward corbyn and said something that caused the chief constable to arch his neck presaging a loudand entirely genuineguffaw what kind of result is that siobhan asked not for the first time they were back in edinburgh seated in a bar on broughton street just around the corner from her place hand those photos from the gardens over rebus told her and your little skinhead friend might get the custodial sentence he deserves she stared at him and gave a wild humorless laugh is that it four men dead because of stacey webster and weve got that weve got our health rebus reminded her and the whole bar listening in on us eyes turned away as she strafed the clientele four vodka tonics shed had so far to rebuss pint and three laphroaigs they were seated in a booth the bar was busy and had been relatively noisy until shed started mentioning multiple murders a suspicious death a stabbing sex offenders george bush special branch the princes street riots and bianca jagger weve still got to put the case together rebus reminded her she responded by blowing a raspberry what good will that do she queried cant prove anything plenty of circumstantial this time she merely snorted and started counting on her fingers richard pennen so the government cafferty gareth tench a serial killer the glooked for a little while like they all connected they do all connect when you start to think of it she was holding up seven fingers in front of his face when he didnt respond she lowered them and seemed to be studying him how can you be so calm about it who said im calm youre bottling it up then ive had a bit of practice not me she shook her head extravagantly something like this happens i want to shout it from the rooftops id say the first steps have already been taken she was staring at her halffull glass and ben websters death had nothing to do with richard pennen nothing rebus conceded but its destroyed him too hasnt it he just nodded she muttered something he didnt catch he asked her to repeat it so she did no gods no masters ive been mulling it over since monday i mean supposing its truewho do we look up to whos running the show im not sure i can answer that siobhan she gave a twitch of the mouth as though he had confirmed some sort of suspicion her phone sounded alerting her to a message she glanced at the screen but did nothing about it youre popular tonight rebus pointed out she gave a shake of the head in reply if i had to guess id say its cafferty she glowered at him so what if it is you might want to change your number she nodded agreement but only after ive sent him a nice long text telling him exactly what i think of him she looked around the table is it my turn to buy she asked i thought maybe some food didnt you have enough of pennens oysters hardly a meal of substance theres a curry house up the street i know course you do youve been here all your life most of it he conceded never known a week like this one though she challenged him never he conceded now drink up and well go get that curry she nodded her hands gripping her glass viselike my mum and dad were in that indian on wednesday night i got there in time for coffee you can always go see them in london just wondering how much longer theyll be around her eyes were glistening is this what its like to be scottish john a few drinks to make you maudlin we do seem cursed he admitted to be always looking back and then you go and join cid which only makes it worse people die and we look back into their livesand we cant change anything she tried lifting her glass but its mass defeated her we could go give keith carberry a kicking rebus suggested she nodded slowly or big ger cafferty come to thator anyone else we felt like theres two of us he leaned forward a little trying for eye contact two against nature she gave him a sly look song lyric she guessed album title steely dan tell you what ive always wondered she slouched against the back of the booth how did they get their name ill tell you when youre sober rebus offered draining his glass he could feel eyes following them as he helped her to her feet and out of the bar there was a sharp breeze and a smattering of rain maybe we should go back to yours he suggested we can phone out for food im not that drunk fair enough then they started the steep uphill climb side by side not saying anything saturday night the town back to normal soupedup teenagers in their soupedup cars money looking for a place to spend itself the diesel chug of cruising taxicabs at some point siobhan snaked her arm through his said something he didnt catch its not enough is it she repeated justsymbolicbecause theres nothing else you can do what are you talking about he asked with a smile the naming of the dead she told him resting her head against his shoulder epilogue monday morning he was on the first train south left waverley at six due into kings cross just after ten at eight he called gayfield square and told them he was sick which wasnt so far from the truth if theyd asked him the cause he might have had some problems spending the overtime was all the duty sergeant said rebus went to the restaurant car and ate his fill of breakfast back at his seat he read the paper and tried to avoid his fellow passengers there was a surlylooking youth across the table nodding along to the guitar music leaking from his earphones businesswoman next to him annoyed that she didnt have enough room to spread out the contents of her office nobody in the seat next to rebusnot until york he hadnt been on the train in years busy with tourists and their baggage mewling infants vacationers workers heading back to their weekday jobs in london after york came doncaster and darlington the pudgy man whod settled down in his reserved seat next to rebus had drifted off to sleep after pointing out that really hed booked the window seat but didnt mind the aisle if rebus didnt want to shift fine was all rebus had said the newsstand at waverley had opened only a few minutes before the train was due to leave but rebus had managed to grab a scotsman mairies piece had made the front page it wasnt the main story and it was full of words like alleged and perhaps and potentially but the headline still gladdened rebuss heart arms boss in parliment loans mystery rebus knew an opening salvo when he saw one mairie would be holding back plenty of ammo for the future hed brought no luggage with him fully intended being on the last train back there was the option to upgrade to a sleeper compartment and it might even come to thata chance to question the crew see if any of them had worked the sleeper south from edinburgh on wednesday rebus had it seemed been the last person to see stacey websterunless the gner staff could oblige if hed followed her to waverley that night he could have satisfied himself that shed actually taken the train as it was she could be anywhereincluding tucked away somewhere until steelforth could arrange a new identity for her rebus doubted shed have any trouble picking up a new life it had dawned on him last night all those multiple personalities of hers cop santal sister killer bloody quadrophenic just like the who album said on sunday kenny mickeys son had arrived at the apartment in his bmw telling rebus there was something for him on the backseat rebus had gone to lookalbums tapes and cds smickeys entire collection they were in the will kenny had explained dad wanted you to have them after theyd hauled the whole lot up two flights of stairs and kenny had rested long enough for a glass of water rebus had waved him goodbye and stared at the gift then hed eased himself down onto the floor beside the boxes and started going through them a mono sergeant pepper let it bleed with the ned kelly poster a lot of kinks and taste and freesome van der graaf and steve hillage there were even a couple of eighttrack cartridgeskiller by alice cooper a beach boys album a treasure trove of memories rebus placed the sleeves beneath his nosethe very smell of them took him back in time warped hollies singles left too long on the turntable after a partya copy of silver machine with mickeys writing on itthis belongs to michael rebuspaws off and quadrophenia of course its corners creased the vinyl scarred but still playable sitting on the train rebus remembered staceys last words to him never told him you were sorryjust before shed bolted to the toilet hed thought shed been talking about mickey but now realized she was meaning her and ben too sorry shed killed three men sorry shed gone and told her brother ben realizing he would have to turn her in feeling the thick stone rampart behind him sensing the drop immediately behind itrebus thought of caffertys memoirschangeling decided it was a title most people could use for their own autobiographies people you knew they might always look the same on the surfacea few gray hairs or a thickening around the middlebut you could never tell what was going on behind their eyes it was darlington before his phone rang waking his softly snoring neighbor the number was siobhans rebus ignored it so she sent a text whichnewspaper finished and countryside boringhe eventually opened where r u corbyn wants talk us need tell him sth call me he knew he couldnt not from the trainshed guess where he was headed to delay the inevitable he waited half an hour and then texted a reply in bed not well talk later hadnt mastered any of the punctuation she texted straight back hangover loch lomond oysters he responded switched the phone off to save its battery then closed his eyes just as the conductor announced that london kings cross would be the next and final station stop next and final the loudspeaker repeated there had been an announcement earlier concerning subway station closures the sternfaced businesswoman had consulted her map of the underground holding it close to her so as not to share the information on the outskirts of london rebus recognized a few of the local stations as the train trundled through them the regular travelers began putting away their things getting to their feet the businesswomans laptop went back into her shoulder bag along with her files and papers diary and map the pudgy man next to rebus rose to his feet with a bow as if they had shared some lengthy heartfelt conversation rebus in no real hurry was one of the last to leave the train and had to squeeze past the cleaning crew on his way out london was hotter stickier than edinburgh his jacket felt too heavy he exited the station on foot no need for a taxi or subway train lit a cigarette and let the traffic noise and fumes wash over him blew a ring of smoke back at it and took a sheet of paper from his pocket it was a map lifted from an az atlas and provided by commander steelforth rebus had called him on sunday afternoon explained that theyd be taking things easy on the clootie well killings and would consult him about their findings before handing the case over to the public prosecutorif it ever came to that all right steelforth had said properly wary background noise edinburgh airport the commander heading home rebus on the other end of the line having just fed him a sack of crap and now asking for a favor result a name an address and a street map steelforth had even apologized for pennens goons their orders had been to watch him harassment never part of the brief only found out about it afterward steelforth had said you think you can control men like that control rebus picturing councilman tench again trying to manage an entire community unable to alter his own destiny less than an hours walk rebus had estimated and not a bad day for it one of the bombs had gone off on a subway train between russell square and kings cross another on a bus heading from euston to russell square all three were on the map he held in his hands the sleeper would have arrived at euston around seven that morning amthe subway blast amthe bus blast rebus couldnt believe stacey webster had been near either of them the train conductor had assured them they were lucky past three days the service had been terminating at finsbury park rebus could hardly have said that finsbury park would have done just as well cafferty was alone in the pool hall he didnt even look up when siobhan walked in not until hed played his shot it was an attempt at a double and it missed he walked around the table chalking his cue blew away some excess powder from the tip youve got all the moves siobhan told him he gave a grunt and lowered himself over the cue missed again and yet youre still lousy she added just about sums you up really good morning to you too detective sergeant clarke is this a social call does it feel like a social call cafferty glanced up at her youve been ignoring my little messages get used to it doesnt change what happened and what exactly did happen he seemed to consider the question for a moment we both got something we wanted he pretended to guess except now youre feeling guilty he rested the cue against the floor we both got something we wanted he repeated i didnt want gareth tench dead you wanted him punished she took a couple of steps toward him dont try to pretend any of this was for my benefit cafferty made a tutting sound you need to start enjoying these little victories siobhan life doesnt offer too many in my experience i screwed up cafferty but im a quick learner youve had a bit of fun down the years with john rebus but from now on youve got another enemy breathing down your neck cafferty chuckled and thats you is it he leaned against the cue but you have to admit siobhan we made a pretty good team imagine how we could run the city between usinformation exchanged tipoffs and tradesme going about my business and you swiftly climbing that promotion ladder isnt that what we both want when it comes down to it what i want siobhan said quietly is to have nothing to do with you until im standing in the witness box and youre on trial good luck with that cafferty said with another low chuckle he turned his attention back to the table want to thrash me at pool in the meantime i was never any good at this bloody game but when he turned around she was heading for the door siobhan he called to her remember the two of us upstairs in the office here and the way that little useless idiot carberry started squirming i saw it in your eyes shed pulled the door open but couldnt resist the question saw what cafferty you were starting to like it he ran his tongue around his lips id say you were definitely starting to like it his laughter followed her out into the daylight pentonville road and then upper streetfarther than he thought he stopped at a café opposite the highbury and islington subway stop ate a sandwich and flicked through the first edition of the days evening standard nobody in the café was speaking english and when he placed his order they struggled with his accent good sandwich though he could feel blisters forming on the soles of both feet as he headed back outside again turning off st paul s road into highbury grove opposite some tennis courts he found the street he was looking for found the block he wanted found the apartment number and its buzzer no name next to it but he pressed it anyway no reply checked his watch then pushed the other buzzers until someone answered yeah the voice crackled from the intercom package for number nine rebus said this is sixteen thought maybe i could leave it with you well you cant outside their door then the voice swore but the buzzer sounded and rebus was in up the stairs to the door of apartment it boasted a spy hole he pressed his ear to the wood took a step back and studied it solid door with half a dozen locks and a steel plate around the rim who lives in a place like this rebus asked himself quietly david its over to you the catchphrase from a tv show called through the keyhole difference was rebus knew exactly who lived here information gleaned byand fromsteelforth rebus rapped at the door halfheartedly then headed back downstairs again tore the lid from his cigarette pack and wedged it in the main door so it couldnt lock then went outside and waited he was good at waiting there were a dozen residents parking bays each one protected by a vertical metal pole the silvercolored porsche cayenne came to a stop while its owner got out and undid the padlock on the pole laying it flat so he could maneuver into the space he was whistling contentedly as he walked around the car giving its tires a kick because that was what guys did he rubbed his sleeve over a spot of dirt and tossed his keys in the air snatching them and returning them to his pocket another bunch of keys emerged and he sought the one that would unlock the main door to the block he seemed bemused that the door wasnt fully closed then his face smashed into it as he was propelled from behind through the door and into the stairwell rebus not giving him any sort of a chance grabbed him by the hair and pummeled the face into the gray concrete wall smearing blood across it a knee in the back and jacko was on the ground dazed and semiconscious a rabbit punch to the neck and another punch to the jaw the first for me rebus thought the second for mairie henderson rebus stared closely at the mans face scar tissue but well fed hed been exarmy for a while growing fat courtesy of the private sector the eyes glazed over and then slowly closed rebus waited a moment in case it was a trick jackos whole body had gone limp rebus made sure he still had a pulse and his airway wasnt blocked then he yanked the mans hands behind his back and secured them with the plastic restraints hed brought secured them nice and tight climbed to his feet took the car keys from jackos pocket and headed back outside checking no one was watching over to the porsche where he scored one side of the bodywork with the key before opening the driversside door slotted the key home and left the door open invitingly paused a moment to catch his breath and then headed for the main road again any passing taxi or bus hed take it fiveoclock train from kings cross would see him back in edinburgh before closing time he had an openreturn ticketcould have flown to ibiza for less but it meant he could catch any train he liked he had unfinished business at home too his luck was in a black cab with its yellow roof light shining in the back rebus reached into his pocket hed told the cabbie eustonknew it was a short walk from there to kings cross he took out the sheet of paper and roll of tape unfolded the sheet and studied itcrude but to the point two photos of santalstacey one from siobhans cameraman friend the other from an old newspaper above them in thick black pen the single word missing underlined twice below rebuss sixth and final attempt at a credible message my two friends santal and stacey missing since the bombs arrived at euston that morning on night train from edinburgh if you have seen them or have any news please call me need to know they are safe and well no name at the bottom just his cell number and half a dozen copies in his other pocket hed already flagged her as a missing person with the police national computer both identities height age and eye color a few background snippets next week her description would go out to the homeless charities the big issue sellers when eric bain was out of the hospital rebus would ask him about web sites maybe they could even set up one of their own if she was out there she was traceable no way rebus would be giving up on this one not for a good while yet acknowledgments there is no clootie well in auchterarder however the one on the black isle is worth a visit if you like your tourist attractions on the skincrawling side there is also no rams head in coldstream though a decent steak pie can be
