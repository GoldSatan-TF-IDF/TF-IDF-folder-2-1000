psychological depth and social critique as the main engine of crime fiction in all its forms herein lies the bullshit factor here we indict the most brilliant suppliers of the crimefiction art ill proffer indictment count number oneand cringe in the throes of selfindictment in the worldwide history of police work there has never been a single investigation that involved numerous gun battles countless sexual escapades pandemic political shakeups and revelations that define corrupt institutions and overall societies count number one informs all subsidiary counts that sweeping statement tells us that we are dealing with a garish narrative art its underpinnings are realistic its story potential is manifestand as such usurped by artists good great fair poor proficient and incompetent

the truecrime riches of this book james ellroy january peter landesman the girlsnext door from the new york times magazine the house at v west front street in plainfield new jersey is a conventional midcentury home with slategray siding white trim and victorian lines when i stood in front of it on a breezy day in october i could hear the cries of children from the playground of an elementary school around the corner american flags fluttered from porches and windows the neighborhood is a leafy middleclass anytown the house is set back off the street near two convenience stores and a gift shop on the door of superior supermarket was pasted a sign issued by the plainfield police safe neighborhoods save lives the stores manager who refused to tell me his name said he never noticed anything unusual about the house and never heard anything but david miranda the young man behind the counter of westside convenience told me he saw girls from the house roughly once a week they came in to buy candy and soda then went back to the house he said the same girls rarely came twice and they were all very young miranda said they never asked for anything beyond what they were purchasing they certainly never asked for help cars drove up to the house all day nice cars all kinds of cars dozens of men came and went but no one here knew what was really going on miranda said and no one ever asked on a tip the plainfield police raided the house in february expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel what the police found were four girls between the ages of fourteen and seventeen they were all mexican nationals without documentation but they werent prostitutes they were sex slaves the distinction is important these girls werent working for profit or a paycheck they were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move i consider myself hardened mark j kelly now a special agent with immigration and customs enforcement the largest investigative arm of the department of homeland security told me recently i spent time in the marine corps but seeing some of the stuff i saw then heard about from those girls was a difficult eyeopening experience the police found a squalid landbased equivalent of a nineteenthcentury slave ship with rancid doorless bathrooms bare putrid mattresses and a stash of penicillin morning after pills and misoprostol an antiulcer medication that can induce abortion the girls were pale exhausted and malnourished it turned out that v west front street was one of what lawenforcement officials say are dozens of active stash houses and apartments in the new york metropolitan areamirroring hundreds more in other major cities like los angeles atlanta and chicagowhere underage girls and young women from dozens of countries are trafficked and held captive most of them whether they started out in eastern europe or latin americaare taken to the united states through mexico some of them have been baited by promises of legitimate jobs and a better life in america many have been abducted others have been bought from or abandoned by their impoverished families because of the porousness of the united statesmexico border and the criminal networks that traverse it the towns and cities along that border have become the main staging area in an illicit and barbaric industry whose products are women and girls on both sides of the border they are rented out for sex for as little as fifteen minutes at a time dozens of times a day sometimes they are sold outright to other traffickers and sex rings victims and experts say these sex slaves earn no money there is nothing voluntary about what they do and if they try to escape they are often beaten and sometimes killed last september in a speech before the united nations general assembly president bush named sex trafficking as a special evil a multibilliondollar underground of brutality and lonely fear a global scourge alongside the aids epidemic influenced by a coalition of religious organizations the bush administration has pushed international action on the global sex trade the president declared at the united nations that those who create these victims and profit from their suffering must be severely punished and that those who patronize this industry debase themselves and deepen the misery of others and governments that tolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery under the trafficking victims protection act of the first us law to recognize that people trafficked against their will are victims of a crime not illegal aliensthe us government rates other countries records on human trafficking and can apply economic sanctions on those that arent making efforts to improve them another piece of legislation the protect act which bush signed into law last year makes it a crime for any person to enter the united states or for any citizen to travel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involving children the sentences are severe up to thirty years imprisonment for each offense the thrust of the presidents un speech and the scope of the laws passed here to address the sextrafficking epidemic might suggest that this is a global problem but not particularly an american one in reality little has been done to document sex trafficking in this country in dozens of interviews i conducted with former sex slaves madams government and lawenforcement officials and antisextrade activists for more than four months in eastern europe mexico and the united states the details and breadth of this sordid trade in the united states came to light in fact the united states has become a major importer of sex slaves last year the cia estimated that between eighteen thousand and twenty thousand people are trafficked annually into the united states the government has not studied how many of these are victims of sex traffickers but kevin bales president of free the slaves americas largest antislavery organization says that the number is at least ten thousand a year john miller the state departments director of the office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons conceded that figure could be low what we know is that the number is huge bales estimates that there are thirty thousand to fifty thousand sex slaves in captivity in the united states at any given time laura lederer a senior state department adviser on trafficking told me were not finding victims in the united states because were not looking for them abduction in eastern european capitals like kiev and moscow dozens of sextrafficking rings advertise nanny positions in the united states in local newspapers others claim to be scouting for models and actresses in chisinau the capital of the former soviet republic of moldovathe poorest country in europe and the one experts say is most heavily culled by traffickers for young womeni saw a billboard with a freshfaced smiling young woman beckoning girls to waitress positions in paris but of course there are no waitress positions and no paris some of these young women are actually tricked into paying their own travel expensestypically around as a down payment on what they expect to be bright prosperous futures only to find themselves kept prisoner in mexico before being moved to the united states and sold into sexual bondage there the eastern european trafficking operations from entrapment to transport tend to be welloiled monoethnic machines one notorious ukrainian ring which has since been broken up was run by tetyana komisaruk and serge mezheritsky one of their last transactions according to daniel saunders an assistant us attorney in los angeles took place in late june at the hard rock cafe in tijuana around dinnertime a buyer named gordey vinitsky walked in he was followed shortly after by komisaruks husband valery who led vinitsky out to the parking lot and to a waiting van inside the van were six ukrainian women in their late teens and early twenties they had been promised jobs as models and babysitters in the glamorous united states and they probably had no idea why they were sitting in a van in a backwater like tijuana in the early evening vinitsky pointed into the van at two of the women and said hed take them for each valery drove the young women to a gated villa twenty minutes away in rosarito a mexican honkytonk tourist trap in baja california they were kept there until july when they were delivered to san diego by boat and distributed to their buyers including vinitsky who claimed his two purchases the komisaruks mezheritsky and vinitsky were caught in may and are serving long sentences in us federal prison in october i met nicole a young russian woman who had been trafficked into mexico by a different network i wanted to get out of moscow and they told me the mexican border was like a freeway said nicole who is now twentyfive we were sitting at a cafe on the sunset strip in los angeles and she was telling me the story of her narrow escape from sex slaveryshe was taken by immigration officers when her traffickers were trying to smuggle her over the border from tijuana she still seemed fearful of being discovered by the trafficking ring and didnt want even her initials to appear in print nicole is a name she adopted after coming to the united states two years ago afraid for her life after her boyfriend was gunned down in moscow in an organizedcrimerelated shootout she found herself across a cafe table in moscow from a man named alex who explained how he could save her by smuggling her into the united states once she agreed nicole said alex told her that if she didnt show up at the airport ill find you and cut your head off russians do not play around in moscow you can get a bullet in your head just for fun donna m hughes a professor of womens studies at the university of rhode island and an expert on sex trafficking says that prostitution barely existed twelve years ago in the soviet union it was suppressed by political structures all the women had jobs but in the first years after the collapse of soviet communism poverty in the former soviet states soared young womenmany of them collegeeducated and marriedbecame easy believers in hollywoodgenerated images of swaying palm trees in los angeles a few of them have an idea that prostitution might be involved hughes says but their idea of prostitution is pretty woman which is one of the most popular films in ukraine and russia theyre thinking this may not be so bad the girls first contacts are usually with what appear to be legitimate travel agencies according to prosecutors the komisaruk mezheritsky ring in ukraine worked with two such agencies in kiev art life international and svit tours the helpful agents at svit and art life explained to the girls that the best way to get into the united states was through mexico which they portrayed as a short walk or boat ride from the american dream oblivious and full of hope the girls get on planes to europe and then on to mexico every day flights from paris london and amsterdam arrive at mexico citys international airport carrying groups of these girls sometimes as many as seven at a time according to two mexico city immigration officers i spoke with and who asked to remain anonymous one of them told me that officials at the airport who cooperate with mexicos federal preventive police pfp work with the traffickers and direct airlines to park at certain gates officials go to the aircraft they know the seat numbers while passengers come off they take the girls to an office where officials will process them magdalena carral mexicos commissioner of the national institute of migration the government agency that controls migration issues at all airports seaports and land entries into mexico told me everything happens at the airport we are giving a big fight to have better control of the airport corruption does not leave tracks and sometimes we cannot track it six months ago we changed the three main officials at the airport but its a daily fight these networks are very powerful and dangerous but mexico is not merely a way station en route to the united states for thirdcountry traffickers like the eastern european rings it is also a vast source of even younger and more cheaply acquired girls for sexual servitude in the united states while european traffickers tend to dupe their victims into boarding oneway flights to mexico to their own captivity mexican traffickers rely on the charm and brute force of los lenones tightly organized associations of pimps according to roberto caballero an officer with the pfp although hundreds of popcorn traffickersindividuals who take control of one or two girlswork the margins caballero said at least fifteen major trafficking organizations and one hundred and twenty associated factions tracked by the pfp operate as wholesalers collecting human merchandise and taking orders from safe houses and brothels in the major sextrafficking hubs in new york los angeles atlanta and chicago like the sicilian mafia los lenones are based on family hierarchies caballero explained the father controls the organization and the money while the sons and their male cousins hunt kidnap and entrap victims the boys leave school at twelve and are given one or two girls their age to rape and pimp out to begin their training which emphasizes the arts of kidnapping and seduction throughout the rural and suburban towns from southern mexico to the united states border along what traffickers call the via lactea or milky way the agents of los lenones troll the bus stations and factories and school dances where underage girls gather work and socialize they first ply the girls like prospective lovers buying them meals and desserts promising affection and then marriage then the men describe rumors theyve heard about america about the promise of jobs and schools sometimes the girls are easy prey most of them already dream of el norte but the theater often ends as soon as the agent has the girl alone when he beats her drugs her or simply forces her into a waiting car the majority of los lenones percent of them caballero saysare based in tenancingo a charmless suburb an hours drive south of mexico city before i left mexico city for tenancingo in october i was warned by mexican and united states officials that the traffickers there are protected by the local police and that the town is designed to discourage outsiders with mazelike streets and only two closely watched entrances the last time the federal police went there to investigate the disappearance of a local girl their vehicle was surrounded and the officers were intimidated into leaving i traveled in a bulletproof suburban with wellarmed federales and an immigration and customs enforcement agent on the way we stopped at a gas station where i met the parents of a girl from tenancingo who was reportedly abducted in august the girl suri is now twenty her mother told me that there were witnesses who saw her being forced into a car on the way home from work at a local factory no one called the police suris mother recited the names of daughters of a number of her friends who have also been taken minerva sylvia carmen she said in a monotone as if the list went on and on just two days earlier her parents heard from suri they call her by her nickname for the first time since she disappeared shes in queens new york the mother told me breathlessly she said she was being kept in a house watched by colombians she said they take her by car every day to work in a brothel i was crying on the phone when are you coming back when are you coming back the mother looked at me helplessly the father stared blankly into the distance then the mother sobered my daughter said im too far away i dont know when im coming back before she hung up suri told her mother dont cry ill escape soon and dont talk to anyone sextrafficking victims widely believe that if they talk they or someone they love will be killed and their fear is not unfounded since the tentacles of the trafficking rings reach back into the girls hometowns and local law enforcement is often complicit in the sex trade one officer in the pfps antitrafficking division told me that ten highlevel officials in the state of sonora share a weekly payoff from traffickers a gargantuan sum of money for mexico the officer told me with a frozen smile that he was powerless to do anything about it some officials are not only on the organizations payroll they are key players in the organization an official at the us embassy in mexico city told me corruption is the most important reason these networks are so successful nicolas suarez the pfps coordinator of intelligence sounded fatalistic about corruption when i spoke to him in mexico city in september we have that cancer corruption he told me with a shrug but it exists in every country in every house there is a devil the us embassy official told me mexican officials see sex trafficking as a united states problem if there wasnt such a large demand then peopletrafficking victims and migrants alike wouldnt be going up there when i asked magdalena carral the mexican commissioner of migration about these accusations she said that she didnt know anything about los lenones or sex trafficking in tenancingo but she conceded there is an investigation against some officials accused of cooperating with these trafficking networks nationwide sonora is one of those places she added we are determined not to allow any kind of corruption in this administration not the smallest kind gary haugen president of the international justice mission an organization based in arlington virginia that fights sexual exploitation in south asia and southeast asia says sex trafficking isnt a poverty issue but a lawenforcement issue you can only carry out this trade at significant levels with the cooperation of local law enforcement in the developing world the police are not seen as a solution for anything you dont run to the police you run from the police breaking the girls in once the mexican traffickers abduct or seduce the women and young girls its not other men who first indoctrinate them into sexual slavery but other women the victims and officials i spoke to all emphasized this fact as crucial to the trafficking rings success women are the principals caballero the mexican federal preventive police officer told me the victims are put under the influence of the mothers who handle them and beat them then they give the girls to the men to beat and rape into submission traffickers understand that because women can more easily gain the trust of young girls they can more easily crush them men are the customers and controllers but within most trafficking organizations themselves women are the operators haugen says women are the ones who exert violent force and psychological torture this mirrors the tactics of the eastern european rings mexican pimps have learned a lot from european traffickers said claudia a former prostitute and madam in her late forties whom i met in tepito mexico citys vast and lethal ghetto the europeans not only gather girls but put older women in the same houses she told me they get younger and older women emotionally attached theyre transported together survive together the traffickers harvest is innocence before young women and girls are taken to the united states their captors want to obliterate their sexual inexperience while preserving its appearance for the eastern european girls this preparation generally happens in ensenada a seaside tourist town in baja california a region in mexico settled by russian immigrants or tijuana where nicole the russian woman i met in los angeles was taken along with four other girls when she arrived in mexico the young women are typically kept in lockeddown gated villas in groups of sixteen to twenty the girls are provided with allamerican clothinglevis and baseball caps they learn to say united states citizen they are also sexually brutalized nicole told me that the day she arrived in tijuana three of her traveling companions were tried out locally the education lasts for days and sometimes weeks for the mexican girls abducted by los lenones the process of breaking them in often begins on calle santo tomas a filthy narrow street in la merced a dangerous and raucous ghetto in mexico city santo tomas has been a place for lowend prostitution since before spains conquest of mexico in the sixteenth century but beginning in the early nineties it became an important training ground for underage girls and young women on their way into sexual bondage in the united states when i first visited santo tomas in late september i found one hundred and fifty young women walking a slowmotion parabola among three hundred or four hundred men it was a balmy night and the air was heavy with the smell of barbecue and gasoline two dead dogs were splayed over the curb just beyond where the girls struck casual poses in stilettos and sprayontight neon vinyl and satin or skimpy leopardpatterned outfits some of the girls looked as young as twelve their faces betrayed no emotion many wore pendants of the grim reaper around their necks and made hissing sounds this i was told was part of a ritual to ward off bad energy the men who were there to rent or just gaze didnt speak from the tables of a shabby cafe midblock other menalso mexicans but more neatly dressedsat scrutinizing the girls as at an auction these were buyers and renters with an interest in the youngest and bestlooking they nodded to the girls they wanted and then followed them past a guard in a yankees baseball cap through a tin doorway inside the girls braced the men before a statue of st jude the patron saint of lost causes and patted them down for weapons then the girls genuflected to the stonefaced saint and led the men to the back grabbing a condom and roll of toilet paper on the way they pointed to a block of ice in a tub in lieu of a urinal beyond a blue hallway the air went sour like old onions there were thirty stalls curtained off by blue fabric every one in use fifteen minutes of straightforward intercourse with the girls clothes left on cost pesos or about for more the dress was lifted for another the bra would be taken off oral sex was acrobatic positions were each despite the dozens of people and the various exertions in this room there were only the sounds of zippers and shoes there was no human noise at all most of the girls on santo tomas would have sex with twenty to thirty men a day they would do this seven days a week usually for weeks but sometimes for months before they were ready for the united states if they refused they would be beaten and sometimes killed they would be told that if they tried to escape one of their family members who usually had no idea where they were would be beaten or killed working at the brutalizing pace of twenty men per day a girl could earn her captors as much as a week in the united states that same girl could bring in perhaps per week in europe girls and women trafficked for the sex trade gain in value the closer they get to their destinations according to iana matei who operates reaching out a romanian rescue organization a romanian or moldovan girl can be sold to her first transporterwho she may or may not know has taken her captive for as little as then for to the next eventually she can be sold for to the organization that will ultimately control and rent her for sex for tens of thousands of dollars a week though the moldovan and romanian organizations typically smuggle girls to western europe and not the united states they are matei says closely allied with russian and ukrainian networks that do jonathan m winer deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the clinton administration says the girls are worth a penny or a ruble in their home village and suddenly theyre worth hundreds and thousands somewhere else crossing the border in november i followed by helicopter the twelvefoothigh sheetmetal fence that represents the united states mexico boundary from imperial beach california south of san diego fourteen miles across the gritty warrens and havoc of tijuana into the barren hills of tecate the fence drops off abruptly at colonia nido de las aguilas a dry riverbed that straddles the border four hundred square miles of bonedry barren hills stretch out on the united states side i hovered over the end of the fence with lester mcdaniel a special agent with immigration and customs enforcement on the united states side jesus was spelled out in rocks ten feet high across a steep hillside a fifteenfoot white wooden cross rose from the peak it is here that thousands of girls and young womenmost of them mexican and many of them straight from calle santo tomasare taken every year mostly between january and august the dry season coyotesor smugglerssubcontracted exclusively by sex traffickers sometimes trudge the girls up to the cross and let them pray then herd them into the hills northward a few miles east we picked up a deeply grooved trail at the fence and followed it for miles into the hills until it plunged into a deep isolated ravine called cottonwood canyon a ukrainian sextrafficking ring forcemarches young women through here mcdaniel told me in high heels and seductive clothing the young women trek twelve miles to highway where panel trucks sit waiting mcdaniel listed the perils rattlesnakes dehydration and hypothermia he failed to mention the traffickers bullets should the women try to escape if a girl tries to run shes killed and becomes just one more woman in the desert says marisa b ugarte director of the bilateral safety corridor coalition a san diego organization that coordinates rescue efforts for trafficking victims on both sides of the border but if she keeps going north she reaches the gates of hell one girl who was trafficked back and forth across that border repeatedly was andrea andrea is just one name she was given by her traffickers and clients she doesnt know her real name she was born in the united states and sold or abandoned hereat about four years old she saysby a woman who may have been her mother she is now in her early to midtwenties she doesnt know for sure she says that she spent approximately the next twelve years as the captive of a sextrafficking ring that operated on both sides of the mexican border because of the threat of retribution from her former captors who are believed to be still at large an organization that rescues and counsels trafficking victims and former prostitutes arranged for me to meet andrea in october at a secret location in the united states in a series of excruciating conversationsandrea explained to me how the trafficking ring that kept her worked moving young girls and boys too back and forth over the border selling nights and weekends with them mostly to american men she said that the ring importedboth through abduction and outright purchase toddlers children and teenagers into the united states from many countries the border is very busy lots of stuff moving back and forth she said say you needed to get some kids this guy would offer a woman a lot of money and shed take birth certificates from the united statesfrom puerto rican children or darkerskinned childrenand then she would go into mexico through tijuana then shed drive to juarezacross the mexican border from el paso texasand then theyd go shopping i was taken with them once we went to this house that had a goat in the front yard and came out with a fouryearold boy she remembers the boy costing around five hundred dollars she said that many poor parents were told that their children would go to adoption agencies and on to better lives in america when we crossed the border at juarez all the border guards wanted to see was a birth certificate for the darkskinned kids andrea continued there would be a truck waiting for us at the mexico border and those trucks you dont want to ride in those trucks are closed they had spots where there would be transfers the rest stops and truck stops on the freeways in the united states one person would walk you into the bathroom and then another person would take you out of the bathroom and take you to a different vehicle andrea told me she was transported to juarez dozens of times during one visit when she was about seven years old the trafficker took her to the radisson casa grande hotel where there was a john waiting in a room the john was an older american man and he read bible passages to her before and after having sex with her andrea described other rooms she remembered in other hotels in mexico the howard johnson in leon the crowne plaza in guadalajara she remembers most of all the ceiling patterns when i was taken to mexico i knew things were going to be different she said the customers were american businessmen the men who went there had higher positions had more to lose if they were caught doing these things on the other side of the border i was told my purpose was to keep these men from abusing their own kids later she told me the white kids you could beat but you couldnt mark but with mexican kids you could do whatever you wanted theyre untraceable you lose nothing by killing them then she and the other children and teenagers in this cell were walked back across the border to el paso by the traffickers the border guards talked to you like did you have fun in mexico and you answered exactly what you were told yeah i had fun runners moved the hardertoplace kids the darker or notquiteaswellbehaved kids kids that hadnt been broken yet another trafficking victim i met a young woman named montserrat was taken to the united states from veracruz mexico six years ago at age thirteen montserrat is her nickname i was going to work in america she told me i wanted to go to school there have an apartment and a red mercedes benz montserrats trafficker who called himself alejandro took her to sonora across the mexican border from douglas arizona where she joined a group of a dozen other teenage girls all with the same dream of a better life they were from chiapas guatemala oaxacaeverywhere she said the group was marched twelve hours through the desert just a few of the thousands of mexicans who bolted for america that night along the two thousand miles of border cars were waiting at a fixed spot on the other side alejandro directed her to a nissan and drove her and a few others to a house she said she thought was in phoenix the home of a white american family it looked like america she told me i ate chicken the family ignored me watched tv i thought the worst part was behind me in the united states hiding in plain sight a week after montserrat was taken across the border she said she and half a dozen other girls were loaded into a windowless van alejandro dropped off girls at gas stations as we drove wherever there were minimarkets montserrat told me at each dropoff there was somebody waiting sometimes a girl would be escorted to the bathroom never to return to the van they drove twentyfour hours a day as the girls were leaving being let out the back all of them fourteen or fifteen years old i felt confident montserrat said we were talking in mexico city where she has been since she escaped from her trafficker four years ago shes now nineteen and shy with her body but direct with her gaze which is flat and unemotional i didnt know the real reason they were disappearing she said they were going to a better life eventually only montserrat and one other girl remained outside the air had turned frigid and there was snow on the ground it was night when the van stopped at a gas station a man was waiting montserrats friend hopped out the back gleeful she said goodbye ill see you tomorrow montserrat recalled i never saw her again after leaving the gas station alejandro drove montserrat to an apartment a couple of weeks later he took her to a dollarstore he bought me makeup montserrat told me he chose a short dress and a halter top both black i asked him why the clothes he said it was for a party the owner of the apartment was having he bought me underwear then i started to worry when they arrived at the apartment alejandro left saying he was coming back but another man appeared at the door the man said hed already paid and i had to do whatever he said montserrat said when he said he already paid i knew why i was there i was crushed montserrat said that she didnt leave that apartment for the next three months then for nine months after that alejandro regularly took her in and out of the apartment for appointments with various johns sex trafficking is one of the few human rights violations that rely on exposure victims have to be available displayed delivered and returned girls were shuttled in open cars between the plainfield new jersey stash house and other locations in northern new jersey like elizabeth and union city suri told her mother that she was being driven in a black town carjust one of hundreds of black town cars traversing new york city at any timefrom her stash house in queens to places where she was forced to have sex a russian ring drove women between various brooklyn apartments and strip clubs in new jersey andrea named trading hubs at highway rest stops in deming new mexico kingman arizona boulder city nevada and glendale california glendale andrea said was a fork in the road from there vehicles went either north to san jose or south toward san diego the traffickers drugged them for travel she said when they fed you you started falling asleep in the past several months i have visited a number of addresses where trafficked girls and young women have reportedly ended up besides the house in plainfield new jersey there is a row house on fiftyfirst avenue in the corona section of queens which has been identified to mexican federal preventive police by escaped trafficking victims there is the apartment at barrington plaza in the tony westwood section of los angeles one place that some of the komisarukmezheritsky rings trafficking victims ended up according to daniel saunders the assistant us attorney who prosecuted the ring and theres a house on massachusetts avenue in vista california a san diego suburb which was pointed out to me by a san diego sheriff these places all have at least one thing in common they are camouflaged by their normal middleclass surroundings this is not narcotraffic secrecy says sharon b cohn director of antitrafficking operations for the international justice mission these are not people kidnapped and held for ransom but women and children sold every single day if theyre hidden their keepers dont make money ijms president gary haugen says its the easiest kind of crime in the world to spot men look for it all day every day but border agents and local policemen usually dont know trafficking when they see it the operating assumption among american police departments is that women who sell their bodies do so by choice and undocumented foreign women who sell their bodies are not only prostitutes that is voluntary sex workers but also trespassers on us soil no department of justice attorney or police vice squad officer i spoke with in los angelesone of the countrys busiest thoroughfares for forced sex trafficconsiders sex trafficking in the us a serious problem or a priority a teenage girl arrested on sunset strip for solicitation or a group of russian sex workers arrested in a brothel raid in the san fernando valley are automatically heaped onto a pile of workaday vice arrests the united states now offers five thousand visas a year to trafficking victims to allow them to apply for residency and theres faint hope among sextrafficking experts that the bush administrations recent proposal on mexican immigration if enacted could have some positive effect on sex traffic into the united states by sheltering potential witnesses if illegal immigrants who have information about victims have a chance at legal status in this country they might feel secure enough to come forward says john miller of the state department but ambiguities still dominate on the front linesthe borders and the streets of urban america where sex trafficking will always look a lot like prostitution its not a particularly complicated thing says sharon cohn of international justice mission sex trafficking gets thrown into issues of intimacy and vice but its a major crime its purely profit and pleasure and greed and lust and its right under homicide imprisonment and submission the basement andrea said held as many as sixteen children and teenagers of different ethnicities she remembers that it was underneath a house in an uppermiddleclass neighborhood on the west coast throughout much of her captivity this basement was where she was kept when she wasnt working there was lots of scrawling on the walls she said the other kids drew stick figures daisies teddy bears this mexican boy would draw a house with sunshine we each had a mat andrea paused but nothing happens to you in the basement she continued you just had to worry about when the door opened she explained they would call you out of the basement and youd get a bath and youd get a dress and if your dress was yellow you were probably going to disneyland she said they used color coding to make transactions safer for the traffickers and the clients at disneyland there would be people doing dropoffs and pickups for kids its a big open area full of kids and nobody pays attention to nobody they would kind of quietly say go over to that person and you would just slip your hand into theirs and say i was looking for you daddy then that person would move off with one or two or three of us her account reminded mepainfullyof the legend of the pied piper of hamelin in the story a piper shows up and asks for one thousand guilders for ridding the town of a plague of rats playing his pipe he lures all the rats into the river weser where they drown but hamelins mayor refuses to pay him the piper goes back into the streets and again starts to play his music this time all the little boys and girls with rosy cheeks and flaxen curls and sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls follow him out of town and into the hills the piper leads the children to a mountainside where a portal opens the children follow him in the cave closes and hamelins childrenall but one too lame to keep upare never seen again montserrat said that she was moved around a lot and often didnt know where she was she recalled that she was in detroit for two months before she realized that she was in the city where cars are made because the door to the apartment alejandro kept her in was locked from the outside she says she was forced to service at least two men a night and sometimes more she watched through the windows as neighborhood children played outside emotionally she slowly dissolved later alejandro moved her to portland oregon where once a week he worked her out of a strip club in all that time she had exactly one night off alejandro took her to see scary movie all the girls i spoke to said that their captors were both psychologically and physically abusive andrea told me that she and the other children she was held with were frequently beaten to keep them offbalance and obedient sometimes they were videotaped while being forced to have sex with adults or one another often she said she was asked to play roles the therapists patient or the obedient daughter her cell of sex traffickers offered three age ranges of sex partnerstoddler to age four five to twelve and teensas well as what she called a damage group in the damage group they can hit you or do anything they wanted she explained though sex always hurts when you are little so its always violent everything was much more painful once you were placed in the damage group theyd get you hungry then to train you to have oral sex she said theyd put honey on a man for the littlest kids you had to learn not to gag and they would push things in you so you would open up better we learned responses like if they wanted us to be sultry or sexy or scared most of them wanted you scared when i got older id teach the younger kids how to float away so things didnt hurt kevin bales of free the slaves says the physical path of a person being trafficked includes stages of degradation of a persons mental state a victim gets deprived of food gets hungry a little dizzy and sleepdeprived she begins to break down she cant think for herself then take away her travel documents and youve made her stateless then layer on physical violence and she begins to follow orders then add a foreign culture and language and shes trapped then add one more layer a sextrafficking victims belief that her family is being tracked as collateral for her body all sextrafficking operations whether mexican ukrainian or thai are vast criminal underworlds with roots and branches that reach back to the countries towns and neighborhoods of their victims theres a vast misunderstanding of what coercion is of how little it takes to make someone a slave gary haugen of international justice mission said the destruction of dignity and sense of self these girls sense of resignation he didnt finish the sentence in tijuana in november i met with mamacita a mexican traffickingvictimturnedmadam who used to oversee a stash house for sex slaves in san diego mamacita who goes by a nickname was full of regret and worry she left san diego three years ago but she says that the trafficking ring run by three violent mexican brothers is still in operation the girls cant leave mamacita said theyre always being watched they lock them into apartments the fear is unbelievable they cant talk to anyone they are always hungry pale always shaking and cold but they never complain if they do theyll be beaten or killed in vista california i followed a pickup truck driven by a san diego sheriffs deputy named rick castro we wound past a tidy suburban downtown a supermall and the usual hometown franchises we stopped alongside the san luis rey river across the street from a baptist church a strawberry farm and a municipal ballfield a neat subdivision and cycling path ran along the opposite bank the san luis rey was mostly dry filled now with an impenetrable jungle of fifteenfoothigh bamboolike reeds as castro and i started down a wellworn path into the thicket he told me about the time he first heard about this place in october a local health care worker had heard rumors about mexican immigrants using the reeds for sex and came down to offer condoms and advice she found more than four hundred men and fifty young women between twelve and fifteen dressed in tight clothing and high heels there was a separate group of a dozen girls no more than eleven or twelve wearing white communion dresses the girls huddled in a circle for protection castro told me and had big eyes like terrified deer i followed castro into the riverbed and only fifty yards from the road we found a confounding warren of more than thirty roomlike caves carved into the reeds it was a sunny morning but the light in there was refracted dreary and basementlike the ground in each was a squalid nest of mud tamped leaves condom wrappers clumps of toilet paper and magazines soiled underwear was strewn here and there plastic garbage bags juryrigged through the reeds in lieu of walls one of the caves inhabitants had hung old cds on the tips of branches like christmas ornaments it looked vaguely like a recent massacre site it was eight in the morning but the girls could begin arriving any minute castro told me how it works the girls are dropped off at the ballfield then herded through a drainage sluice under the road into the riverbed vans shuttle the men from a eleven a mile away the girls are forced to turn fifteen tricks in five hours in the mud the johns pay fifteen dollars and get ten minutes it is in nearly every respect a perfect extension of calle santo tomas in mexico city except that this is what some of those girls are training for if anything the women i talked to said that the sex in the united states is even rougher than what the girls face on calle santo tomas rosario a woman i met in mexico city who had been trafficked to new york and held captive for a number of years said in america we had special jobs oral sex anal sex often with many men sex is now more adventurous harder she said that she believed younger foreign girls were in demand in the united states because of an increased appetite for more aggressive dangerous sex traffickers need younger and younger girls she suggested simply because they are more pliable in eastern europe too the typical age of sextrafficking victims is plummeting according to matei of reaching out while most girls used to be in their late teens and twenties thirteenyearolds are now far from unusual immigration and customs enforcement agents at the cyber crimes center in fairfax virginia are finding that when it comes to sex what was once considered abnormal is now the norm they are tracking a clear spike in the demand for hardercore pornography on the internet weve become desensitized by the soft stuff now we need a harder and harder hit says ice special agent perry woo cybernetworks like kazaa and morpheus through which you can download and trade images and videoshave become the mexican border of virtual sexual exploitation i had heard of one web site that supposedly offered sex slaves for purchase to individuals the ice agents hadnt heard of it special agent don daufenbach ices manager for undercover operations brought it up on a screen a hush came over the room as the agents leaned forward clearly disturbed that sure looks like the real thing daufenbach said there were streams of web pages of thumbnail images of young women of every ethnicity in obvious distress bound gagged contorted the agents in the room pointed out probable injuries from torture cyberauctions for some of the women were in progress one had exceeded with new internet technology woo said pornography is becoming more pervasive with web cams were seeing more live molestation of children one of ices recent successes operation hamlet broke up a ring of adults who traded images and videos of themselves forcing sex on their own young children but the supply of cheap girls and young women to feed the global appetite appears to be limitless and its possible that the crimes committed against them in the united states cut deeper than elsewhere precisely because so many of them are snared by the glittery promise of an america that turns out to be not their salvation but their place of destruction endgame typically a young trafficking victim in the united states lasts in the system for two to four years after that bales says she may be killed in the brothel she may be dumped and deported probably least likely is that she will take part in the prosecution of the people that enslaved her who can expect a young woman trafficked into the united states trapped in a foreign culture perhaps unable to speak english physically and emotionally abused and perhaps drugaddicted to ask for help from a police officer who more likely than not will look at her as a criminal and an illegal alien even andrea who was born in the united states and spoke english says she never thought of escaping because whats out there whats out there was scarier we had customers who were police so you were not going to go talk to a cop we had this customer from nevada who was a child psychologist so youre not going to go talk to a social worker so who are you going to talk to and if the girls are lucky enough to escape theres often nowhere for them to go the families dont want them back sister veronica a nun who helps run a rescue mission for trafficked prostitutes in an old church in mexico city told me theyre shunned when i first met her andrea told me were way too damaged to give back a lot of these children never wanted to see their parents again after a while because what do you tell your parents what are you going to say youre no good correction an article on january about sexual slavery referred erroneously to the film scary movie a mexican woman who was being held as a sex slave in the united states could not have been taken to see it by her captor by the time the movie came out in she had already escaped and returned to mexico the girl next door an article about the importing of women and girls to the united states for sexual slavery has generated much discussion since it appeared in the times magazine on january in response to questions from readers and other publications about sources and accuracy the magazine has carried out a thorough review of the article on the issue of sources the writer peter landesman conducted more than fortyfive interviews including many with highranking federal officials law enforcement officers and representatives of human rights organizations four sources insisted on anonymity to protect their professional positions a magazine factchecker also interviewed all relevant sources many of them both before and after publication some readers have questioned the figure of ten thousand enforced prostitutes brought into this country each year the source of that number is kevin bales recommended to the magazine by human rights watch as the best authority on the extent of enforced prostitution in the united states who based his estimates on state department documents arrest and prosecution records and information from nearly fifty social service agencies in the course of this review several errors were discovered in specific details one an erroneous reference to the release date of scary movie was corrected in the magazine last sunday on the question whether women imported through cottonwood canyon california could have been wearing high heels the original source when pressed acknowledged that his information was hearsay the article should not have specified what the women were wearing and the anecdote should have been related in the past tense since the trafficking ring was broken up in the woman in her twenties known to her traffickers as andrea recalled an incorrect name for the hotel to which she was taken in juarez mexico the radisson casa grande had not yet opened when she escaped from her captors after the article was published the writer made an impromptu comment in a radio interview noting that andrea has multiplepersonality disorder the magazine editors did not learn of her illness before publication andreas account of her years in slavery remained consistent over two and a half years of psychotherapy her therapist says that her illness has no effect on the accuracy of her memory her hourslong interview with the author recorded on tape is lucid and consistent an independent expert consulted by the magazine dr leonard shengold who has written books and papers about child abuse and the reliability and unreliability of memory affirms that a diagnosis of multiplepersonality disorder is not inconsistent with accurate memories of childhood abuse because multiplepersonality disorder has been associated with false memory however the diagnosis should have been cited in the article the magazines cover showed a nineteenyearold nicknamed montserrat who escaped from a trafficker four years ago an insignia on her school uniform had been retouched out of the picture by the magazines editors to shield her whereabouts the change violated the timess policy against altering photographs peter landesman is a journalist awardwinning novelist and screenwriter a contributing writer to the new york times magazine his journalism has also appeared in the new yorker and the atlantic monthly his journalism typically takes him inside underground networks that traffick in weapons refugees sex slaves and stolen and forged art and antiquities he lives in los angeles coda i spent five months in mexico the united states moldova russia and ukraine for this piece among victims police and federal agents and trafficking networks carrying out what was at times an emotionally and physically harrowing investigation the girls next doorcited by the overseas press club for best international reporting on human rights issues and the most requested and widely read newyork times story of and the most thoroughly factchecked in the history of the new york times magazine sparked a national conversation and a wave of controversy the story made people feel terrible and the attacks against it were organized and yet the truths the story laid out were incontrovertible while the controversy was bolstered by little more than blogesque ad hominem rhetoric and unsubstantiated and at times hysterical disbelief in the real worldthe corridors of power in washington dc mexico city rome and london among other capitals and in the streets where girls and young women are disappeared inside these networksthe story has had a profound and tangible effect government officials continually report to me the many ways the story changed policy inside the department of justice and the bush administration which had believed sex trafficking to be a problem in asia and eastern europe but not in the united states multiple federal and state task forces and initiatives were established in the storys wake two weeks after publication mexican and united states authorities performed simultaneous raids on one of the trafficking networks the story identifies its victims held captive in new york city and mexico were rescued and entered into a witness protection program the infant of one of themheld by the traffickers as collateral in mexicowas also saved the principles in the network were arrested and are now being tried in the united states that same week a sex trafficking ring operating near disneylandanother place the story identifiedwas broken up its principles arrested federal authorities have since surveilled and raided the san diego trafficking network exposed by the story rescuing dozens of its captives cities such as los angeles have begun to train its police officers to recognize sex trafficking when they see it embarrassed by the storys revelations the mexican government through its intelligence agency cisenfounded a task force to fight sex trafficking in mexico but perhaps most importantly the girls next door sparked a national conversation about sex slavery the use and captivity of thousands of foreign girls and young women in america i am frequently buttonholed by ngo experts and government officials including a number of justice officials and federal prosecutors and one high official from the department of health and human and servicesthat this article was not only groundbreaking in its accuracy but represented a watershed moment in the understanding of this barbaric economy robert draper the onesthat got away from gq the little white boat meant nothing to them out here in the gulf of aden on this soupy october morning what first came to mind was how the hell do they live in this heat that and how much farther to freaking bahrain somewhere along the wayduring the great ships twomonth voyage from norfolk virginia across the atlantic into the mediterranean and at last through the suez canal toward the northern arabian gulfthe whiff of danger had settled into the crews nostrils it would not be fair to say that they were unready but you would have to say that they were in the end unprepared there were of them male and female twentytwoyearold doeeyed peacetime recruits from flyspeck towns in wisconsin and north dakota and texas they were trained for a kind of warfare that after today would become virtually obsolete for at their disposal aboard the footlong ship were all the tools for superpower combat tomahawk and harpoon cruise missiles sm surfacetoair missiles spy multifunction radar a phalanx closein weapons system torpedoes and rapidfire multibarrel cannons they were girded it would seem for armageddon shielded by all this hightech weaponry the ships crew lined up outside the galleys for an early lunch of fajitas and when they observed the puttering approach of the little white boat they responded as any giant would with serene obliviousness trusting its puniness they dropped their guard the two men aboard the little white boat looked happy they were waving and salutingor was that a salute and calling out in greetingor was that a muslim prayer it was hard to tell from the destroyers great height looming feet above the water the crew believed the two men to be harbor garbage collectors though they could just as easily have been selling trinkets and snacks like so many other vendors bobbing across the water or they could have been fish merchants which was what the two men had told neighbors they were though no one had ever seen them at the aden fish market just as no one had ever seen them at the mosques the qatvending stands the bakeries the beachesonly a few furtive appearances from behind the wall they had erected around their cinderblock house overlooking the harbor elsewherebangkok nairobi afghanistanthe two men had been seen plenty but those in the intelligence community who were paid to track their whereabouts had failed to follow them here to the shabby district of madinat ash shab on the southern coast of yemen and now on the morning of october the two men had taken leave of the neighborhood that never knew them slid their little white boat down a ramp and into the water revved the outboard motor and commenced an unhurried path eastward across the bay toward the uss cole and the little white boat there was nothing unusual about it nothing at all in fact it had plied these waters just a month earlierfrom the inlet to the harbor and backwithout incident seemingly without purpose trolling right past the yemeni naval base there had been another time before that too january when another man launched the little white boat toward another american destroyer only to see it sink within minutes because the bomb it was carrying was too heavy no one aboard that particular american ship the sullivans ever saw the skiff submerge or saw it being retrieved the next day or saw it being subsequently reinforced with fiberglass while the c plastic explosives were compacted into a neat five hundredpound bundle no the little white boat gave away nothing not then not now nine months later with its two bearded passengers coming ever closer to the colerounding the hull toward the rear of the ship calling out and waving was that a wave was that a prayer was it garbage they were looking for all unasked but the answer came anyway as the little white boat and the two happy men detonated into a million pieces and the massive american destroyer roared in pain in that instant the world went asymmetric seventeen sailors lay dead another thirtynine wounded and america suddenly needed yemen to explain what had gone wrong yemen what did we know of yemen where did it stand this dogpoor muslim country that had been driven from our herd when it sided with saddam hussein in the gulf war and only after a decades worth of economic sanctions had been brought to heel we would alas soon find outbeginning with yemens president ali abdullah saleh who immediately blamed the explosion on a technical mishap inside the cole and later on the egyptians and later still on the israelis still to show the americans that his government would leave no stone unturned president saleh dispatched his political security organizationthe thuggish plainclothes domestic intelligence unit that reports directly to salehto rampage through aden and collar every man with a beard as one yemeni government official would say when fbi agents arrived in aden two days later and requested that those behind bars be extradited to the united states for prosecution president saleh informed them that the yemeni constitution forbade this when the fbi demanded to join the interrogations the pso refused on the grounds of national sovereignty when the fbi agents asked for interview transcripts they were handed pages that read like dadaist poetry and when the fbi suggested that certain islamic extremists in the yemeni government be investigated in connection with the crime the pso agents smiled and did nothing in late november the yemeni government suddenly announced that the case of the uss cole bombing had been solved that all ten perpetrators were in custody the investigation was shut down and a trial was set for the following january the americans protested that this was lunacy the plots two alleged overseers after all men with direct ties to osama bin laden were still at large so the yemeni government agreed to delay the trial for a year then it delayed the trial for another year by that time it was november one of the two alleged cole masterminds was in american hands and the united states was strongly urging yemen to proceed with trial as of april the ten cole suspects were still in prison awaiting formal charges as of the next morning they were not here now grinning for the cameras stands america with yemena marriage not quite from hell but ever so far from heaven it would be unfair to cast all blame on the war bride after all no sitting american president has ever deigned to set foot on yemeni sandthough in then vice president george h w bush briefly touched down to commemorate the opening of an oil refinery there by a texas petroleum firm as it has turned out the deserts of yemen are largely petrobarren and its government has been known to meddle in corporate profits and so since there is no point in americans trying to make any money there there has seemed little point in paying it much mind at all except of course when we have no choice in the two years since president george w bush proclaimed either you are with us or you are with the terrorists and president saleh dashed off to washington to pledge his countrys allegiance to the war on terror the united states has supplied yemen with special forces training coast guard patrol boats an fbi office and a fraction of the economic aid it gives to the far tinier nation of jordan about its new ally the us state department offers only this any counterterrorism cooperation will be judged on its continuing results though far more american travelers have been killed in say mexico than in yemen in recent years the state department warns americans not to go there then again yemen is bin laden country osamas father hailed from the southeastern tribal stronghold of hadhramawt and osama himself plucked his fifth and favorite wife from the town of ibb even when bin laden was in afghanistan says edmund hull the us ambassador to yemen he always imagined yemen as a fallback and after the routing of the taliban last year the worry was so great that al qaeda would regroup in bin ladens ancestral homeland that in the words of one us official we began looking around yemen for a tall guy with a cane bin laden would be at home in yemen in more ways than one though president saleh has denounced al qaeda almost as strongly as he has israeli am for jihad for resistance for arms and money to be sent to fight the jews he once declared by way of supporting a palestinian homelandhis instinctive tendency as one us official puts it is to seek accommodation with islamic extremists and with the tribal leaders who have long harbored terrorists in the lawless empty quarter that covers a vast swath of the country once upon a time travel writers spoke of yemen as a cradle of civilization the nexus of the frankincense trade the land of noahs son and the dominion of the queen of sheba no longer to talk about yemen today is to talk about terrorism but that is america doing the talking youve been here for a while a yemeni acquaintance said to me while i was there do we seem like a nation of terrorists to you and the only honest reply was no yemen did not seem that way on the night of my arrival i could hear the chattering of automatic gunfire somewhere below the window of my heavily guarded hotel in sanaa but this was only the revelry of a wedding party which i caught up to the next morning in the wadi dhahr valley where grapes and pomegranates and qat flourish on a peak overlooking a former sultans winter palace the bridegroom and his tribal brethren staged an elaborate jambiya sword fight to the furious rhythm of a tasa drumbeat several men standing around the dancers still toted their kalashnikovs from the night before when i told one of them i was an american he hesitated for only a moment before replying with the word i heard more often than any other during my two weeks in yemen welcome i was welcome here but so was the palestinian organization hamas which maintains an office in sanaa to the us government hamas is a terrorist organization to most yemenis it is a resistance movement for that matter to the arab world the honey produced in the hadhramawt region is a peerless aphrodisiac to the us government yemeni honey merchants are terrorist money launderers which truth prevails teetering between the exotic and the horrific became my psychic tightrope walk while shuffling through the spicescented thousandyearold alleyways of the sanaa souk tangled up in the foot traffic of beggars and silversmiths and qat procurersa claustrophobic bustle not that different from the one that suddenly coalesced around the us embassy last year screaming death to americai clung to the admonition sometimes usually nearly always a little white boat is just a little white boat and they no doubt thought of me sometimes after all an american man in yemen is not an fbi agent in this uneasy way we trusted each otherthough relieved if we were to be honest with ourselves that our governments did not the prison was not a prison it might have been helpful from the american point of view to know thisthat the ten conspirators believed responsible for the deaths of seventeen american sailors were being held in a mere interrogation center situated on the first floor of the aden headquarters of the pso a sullen twostory building the british had constructed sometime before when the south yemen socialists escorted the colonialists out of the country at gunpoint whatever the building had once been it had since taken on the psos own shadowy personality individuals were brought there without charges and were detained for unspecified periods many were not treated kindly amnesty international had asked to inspect the building to determine whether torture took place there lawyers demanded to meet with jailed clients family members showed up in tears all were turned away no one could get into this prison unless the pso had dragged him there getting out by comparison was a snap the ten men were not equal partners in crime one of them jamal albadawi the accused uss coleplot field coordinator was a highly regarded sheik and along with fahd alquso an al qaeda camp habitue the eight others however were mere crooked cops and civil servants who had supplied albadawi and alquso with phony identification and credit references one prisoners sole offense was that of preparing the cole suicide bombers a farewell lunch the day before the attack though the fbi agents saw little sport in crucifying marginal offenders were interested in quality not quantity said a top us official they saw no profit in quibbling justice of a kind would be served all ten would be tried together all were up for the death penalty in the meantime all ten occupied the same cell and it was a lucky thing for the rest that one of them was good friends with a certain uniformed man named hussein alansi around aden alansi was described as a mustachioed lout who enjoyed crashing diplomatic parties among the fbi he was believed to be the foremost obstructionist in the uss cole investigation here in the pso building he was chief and he was all they needed for this prison had no surveillance cameras no motion detectors no electric fences no watchtowers what it did have was a hole dug by hand through a concrete bathroom wall and so through this hole out into the coastal air across a vacant lot and over the low perimeter fence down the street beyond the forbidding gates of the pso headquarters and into a waiting taxicab galloped ten men with a plan with one good friend and with only the moon smiling down on themunless it too turned away later that afternoon of friday april while the yemeni government was denying that any prisoners had escaped roadblocks barricaded every major road in aden while the pso reprised its everymanwithabeard burlesque but the uss cole tenthe only suspects yemeni authorities had ever apprehended in connection with the bombinghad already disappeared into the creases of the southern arabian desert much as the two happy suicide bombers had scattered themselves over the gulf of aden three years before disappeared to this day they all remain the qat leaves i had been chewing for the past half hour began to achieve the expected effect my extremities trembled my stomach performed somersaults and i jawed like a jackass about matters of which i was extravagantly ignorant you have to understand i was saying very few americans can even find yemen on a map they only hear about yemen when theres an incident like the uss cole bombing the five young yemeni journalists i was talking to passed more leaves my way why is it one of them asked that america is so preoccupied with hunting down people who it thinks are terrorists while it allows israel to pursue blatant acts of terrorism against the palestinian people americas never going to view israel the way you do i said its the only reliable democracy in the middle east and its one of the most loyal allies we have what do you think about the fact that no jews were killed when the world trade center was attacked it was friday the holy day the five of themand almost everyone else in yemenhad been chewing qat leaves for hours golf ballsize convexities formed in their right cheeks the qat was of very high quality i was told no ddt or other pesticides we sat crosslegged and barefoot on a carpeted floor in a room whose only adornments were photographs of assassinated former leaders of yemen i had fallen into the journalists company while pursuing the mystery of the uss cole escapees the young reporters were eager to help but in truth they knew less than i did none of them had been to the prison and no yemeni official would speak to them about the investigation as the sunlight ebbed the sounds of traffic in the disordered streets of sanaa gave way to the muezzins final call to prayer lets take a fifteenminute break said the leanfaced yemen observer writer as he stood up and brushed the qat remnants off his traditional yemeni blazer skirt and ornamental belt as soon as they returned from their prayer session in the hallway i took the offensive i wanted to know why yemenwhich the united nations had recently ranked as th out of nations in terms of economic developmentdid not throw out president saleh after twentyfive years in power i wanted to know what it suggested about yemens supposed free press that journalists who impugned the president or islam were summarily hauled off to underground prisons by the pso as the qat buzz shivered through me like an electric eel i concluded my discourse with a rousing the governments not going to hand you more rightsyouve got to fight for them the journalists nodded listlessly then one of them asked do you think its right that the cia launches predator drone missiles into yemen and murders suspected terrorists extrajudicially the way the israeli army does so it went for hours a congenial impasse until the best we could do was rhapsodize about qat the opiate of the yemeni masses how it spurred a man to perform like a gladiator in the bedroom weep for the absence of his mother or produce seamless poetry on deadline what qat could not do was make a yemeni and an american see the world in remotely the same way no no no i was constantly assured by both united states and yemeni officials there has been much progress things are changing al qaeda is on the run here and cannot regroup jailed extremists are renouncing jihad in exchange for probation the imams are toning down their oratory american aid is trickling in and so why focus on the prison bring it up and everyone gets nasty again like interior minister rashad alalimi yemens top lawenforcement official its our negligence he said but the americans have their fingerprints on this too we wanted to put the ten suspects through the legal system try them in the courts and then move them from the interrogation center to a maximumsecurity prison but who was delaying this the americans they said no leave them there leave them there to which an official at the us embassy replied frankly we werent aware theyd been transferred there to begin with and so we arrive where we began blown back into the gulf of aden staring out at the little white boat to trust or not to trust so the pso chief in aden and all the prisons guards were sacked immediately following the jailbreak so the taxi driver who drove the ten men away was interrogated so a government commission was assembled to straighten the whole mess out where were the indictments why had the entire matter become classified and why had none of the fugitives been apprehended we have sources saying theyre at a certain location the interior minister assured me my people are on the ground and theyre trailing them that was in july sound familiar to clint guenther the fbis logistical coordinator for the uss cole investigation the jailbreak episode didnt surprise me one bit considering that the cooperation wed always gotten from the yemen government was shoddy at best i truly believe that they didnt want us to know everything and that was the way it was going to be just as america would see bin ladens ghost behind every beard just as it would browbeat with its predator bombings and extort with its foreignaid budget so too would yemen insist that its extremists are a dying breed and chafe at the slightest accusation to the contrary better then to stand together for the cameras grin our grinsenemies kept closer terrorized into friendshipand say nothing absolutely nothing about the prison except that i wanted to visit it and so one evening i flew from sanaa with my translator khaled alhammadi to the port town of aden the flight attendants mascara began to drip the moment she stepped onto the runway at eight in the evening the temperature exceeded ninety and the air leeched itself to our pores khaled haggled with a cabdriver before we stepped into his vehiclewhich like most yemeni taxis resembled an oil spill i hung my head out the window pretending there was a cool breeze and that i was in my swimsuit prostrate before the waves when we checked into our beachside hotel the clerk politely explained that as a foreigner i would be assessed a higher room rate than would khaled this informal visitors tax in yemen applies not only to hotels but also to plane tickets and restaurant meals its the countrys small contribution to globalwealth redistribution having endured an alcoholfree week in conservative sanaa i made for the hotel bar where i drank heineken from a can and watched an episode of arabicsubtitled friends in the company of several jordanian businessmen when i knocked on khaleds hotel door later that evening i found another man in the room he introduced himself as haydar and showed me his pso identification card haydar was short with a trim mustache and intense eyesa sort of arabian errol flynn except that he was pronouncedly duckfooted and had sweated completely through his olive silk shirt he explained that foreign journalists were not to be wandering around aden without a minder from the ministry of information i suggested that this was ridiculous that i had been interviewing cabinet officials unfettered all week long in sanaa and that president salehs aides had given me their blessings to travel to aden did i have documentation of this haydar wanted to know no i confessed i did not but he was free to call them haydar told us not to leave the hotel grounds that evening shook our hands and said good night the next morning haydar was already making himself comfortable in the lobby when i showed up for breakfast hello robert he called out in english and sprang to his feet to shake my hand i had people to see that morning and haydar informed me that he would escort me in his pickup truck the interview subject a powerful newspaper publisher was not daunted by haydar he closed the door on the pso agents nose when i finished my interview haydar was dutifully standing outside having sweated through his natty blue longsleeve shirt he was waiting to hear from the new aden pso chief about my visiting the prison in the meantime he offered with a shrug would i like a tour of aden we killed time by driving through the old market in crater bumping along the old britishbuilt boulevards past sagging and blistered storefronts and then finally around an immense cistern that had been dug perhaps two thousand years ago and now was dry at one point haydars pickup truck broke down and he fretted over the carburetor in the degree heat while khaled and i tried to control our laughter he was actually a decent sort not one of the psos musclemen and though he said he was from the mountains in the north and illsuited to adens stifling humidity he maintained a kind of futile dignity in his neatly trimmed mustache and his fine sweatstained clothes there wasnt much to see in the raggedy old coastal city so haydar ferried us back to the hotel we sat in deck chairs at the waters edge watching a procession of young yemeni women stride slowly through the waves in their headtotoe sharshafs like ebony apparitions at last haydars cell phone rang he strode off for some privacy kicking up sand and mopping his brow when he returned i could tell by his face that the news was not good khaled translated the new aden chief was irate at haydar what was this american journalist doing in aden anyway and you took him on a tour no he cannot see the prison do not let him leave the hotel grounds escort him to the airport tomorrow morning i am sorry robert haydar said then he bent down reached for my neck and kissed me on both cheeks with his sweaty lips the next morning a few minutes after the mascarastained yemen airways flight attendant welcomed me aboard i lay my forehead against the aircraft windowa portrait of stupefaction gaping at the dunes which swirled like caramel question marks in the almighty nothingness below thinking the prison is not a prison the little white boat is not just a little white boat the alliance is not an alliance then the plane thrust heavenward and the question marks melted under the arabian sun now in his eighth year as gq writeratlarge robert draper is also the author of the novel hadrians walls knopf and the biography rolling stone magazine the uncensored history doubleday he is at work on a book about the bush presidency for the free press draper resides in asheville north carolina coda and then fully eleven months after their escape in a single week in march of all ten suspects were magically recaptured in the mountains of abyan province dominated by tribal factions a security trial was staged for five of them in a sanaa courtroom in early july at some point during the course of the trial the defendants were awarded attorneys but were not permitted to speak with them outside of court the sentences came down in september five to ten years for four of the defendants and the death penalty for the plots ontheground coordinator albadawi who hollered out this is an unjust verdict this is an american verdict for me the proceedings were quintessentially yemeni but albadawi had a point american diplomats attended the trial and were quick to praise its outcome and once again it seemed that yemens eagerness to please both sides had produced slapstick consequences i left the country as most western journalists have awed and confoundedand oddly reluctant to return to my world of shallow banal mysteries skip hollandsworth the familyman from texas monthly when mothers saw todd becker in the carpool line at the elementary school in stonebridge ranch an upscale bedroom community in mckinney north of dallas theyd occasionally stop chatting on their cell phones and do a double take becker was a goodlooking young guy in his early thirties with neatly cut hair and brown eyes he wore khaki pants and crisp tshirts he had a pleasant smile his teeth very white and straight but it wasnt his looks the mothers later said that were the most attractive part about him around stonebridge ranch todd becker was known as the family man a devoted husband who always took the time to eat lunch with his sweet blond wife cathy and a doting father who coached his childrens soccer teams and took them to their ballet lessons some of the mothers were impressed that he liked to go to the school and read stories to his childrens classes others noted that he was happy to let the neighborhood kids swim in his backyard pool or jump on the trampoline he was pleasant and softspoken never one to talk too much about himself he rarely had more than a beer or two at parties he took his family to sunday services at the lutheran church not far from his home and at the stonebridge country club where he was one of the top tennis players he never threw his racket when he was losing lets face it one mother would later say a lot of women around stonebridge ranch wished their own husbands were more like todd at his twostory custombuilt home on fallen leaf lane in stonebridges autumn ridge neighborhood where he had turned the living room into an extra playroom for the kids becker always led the family in a prayer at dinner at bedtime he would kiss his children goodnight and tell them to sleep well then he would kiss his wife goodnight and tell her to sleep well too then he would get into his minivan or his ford expedition back out of the driveway and head off to commit some of the most daring professionally executed burglaries that law enforcement authorities have ever seen todd becker made his living by stealing the cash out of safes from stores restaurants and businesses throughout texas and florida where he had lived before moving to texas he and his small band of employees would pry the safes open with crowbars slam them apart with sledgehammers hack into them with concrete saws or cut them open with torches many times theyd yank the entire safe out of the floor and carry it away to be opened at a more discreet location occasionally inside beckers own garage becker would split up the loot with his team and then take his cut to his bedroom hiding the money under some clothes in his closet hed shower comb his hair and be downstairs by the time his kids awakened ready to fix them pancakes and drive them to school when a torrent of gunwielding police officers arrived at his house one morning in late bursting through his front door and stepping over childrens toys to arrest him his neighbors stood in their front yards cups of coffee in their hands their mouths open a few of them later told the cops that they had made a terrible mistake we said there is no way he could be a thief one neighbor recalled hes just like the rest of us a few months ago while the thirtythreeyearold becker was still out on bond he allowed me to come see him when i walked up to his house he greeted me at the door gave me a friendly handshake and said with a halfsmile well heres my crime den he led me to his dining room table made of burnished cherry while his youngest daughter aged two watched barney in the family room and cathy whos thirtyfive made coffee it was a couple of weeks before halloween and cathy had decorated the front of their house as she did every year with pumpkins and plastic skeletons hanging from a tree and a sign on the front door that read autumn greetings from the beckers next to the sewing machine in the kitchen were halloween costumes that she was making for their four children usually im in charge of the neighborhood halloween parade she told me with a slight shrug of her shoulders but this year i thought someone else should do it as she talked becker flipped through a scrapbook to a page that showed pictures of his wife and children in costumes from a previous halloween parade cheerfully marching down the street with their neighbors then he turned the page and showed me photos of birthday parties that he and cathy had thrown for their kids not what you were expecting huh becker asked me nor the authorities according to police detectives burglars are typically impoverished young males looking for money to buy drugs wearing sweatshirts with hoods they amateurishly smash through store windows and grab what they can while the alarms are blaring you dont find these guys meticulously planning out their crimes so that they can live an allamerican lifestyle in a nice neighborhood with a nice family said bill hardman a detective from fort pierce florida one of the many cities plagued by becker they want crack or guns but todd becker was one of a kinda cleancut yuppie daddy who bought dolls for his children what especially intrigued the cops about becker was the way he chose his accomplices like the old west outlaw jesse james who also had a love of snatching money out of safes and strongboxes becker relied mostly on kinfolk to help him his two half brothers his brotherinlaw a stepnephew and a childhood friend unlike jesse james however he didnt choose them because they were experienced criminals or good with guns becker didnt allow weapons of any kind to be used during his burglaries he didnt even allow guns in his home fearing that his children might find them and accidentally shoot themselves he picked relatives and friends who happened to be down on their luck involved in unhappy relationships or stuck in deadend jobs if they had jobs at all one brother who worked for becker had a job on the side performing as an entertainer on a subscription internet sex site and another worked parttime as a santas helper at a mall his childhood friend was battling a weight problem becker even used his own sister kim who was dancing at a strip club in florida to work as a lookout on one of his burglaries telling her that he hoped the money she made on the venture would encourage her to quit stripping and lead a more stable life maybe to someone else none of this makes any sense but youve got to understand todd said kim a perky single mother of five he had created this really happy life for himself in the suburbs with church and soccer and good schools and all that and i think he wanted all the rest of us in his family to experience what he had indeed becker was a new kind of american criminal so intent on improving his life and the lives of his fellow family members that he would often tune the radio in his vehicle to the nationally syndicated show of selfhelp counselor dr laura schlessinger as he drove through various shopping centers with his team scouting out potential businesses to rob he talked to his accomplices about the dangers of drinking and drug abuse he encouraged them to save their money for the future i really thought i was helping out everyone who went to work for me helping them put some money together and get a new start with their lives becker told me staring out his dining room window its still hard to believe just how it all turned out hewas literally an altar boy at a lutheran church in port st lucie the small city on floridas east coast where he was raised when he signed up for junior tennis tournaments he would inform the tournament directors that he could not play matches on sunday mornings because he had to attend church todd never smoked cigarettes and he would have only one beer at high school parties recalled one of his florida friends jeff drock and he wouldnt even drink that what amazed almost everyone who got to know todd becker during his teenage years was that he never tried to have sex with girls he said that he wanted to save himself for marriage if he had gone into the ministry none of his childhood friends would have been surprised but during beckers adolescence his father william becker began having runins with the law a former police officer from detroit the elder becker had quit the force in the sixties to sell encyclopedias doortodoor then moved to florida to sell video games during the era when pacman and donkey kong were the biggest sellers although he had been decorated as a cop for fighting crime he apparently went the other way when it came to making money as a salesman he spent some time in jail for business fraud during beckers youth and when he got out he had trouble finding steady employment while beckers father went through his legal problems beckers mother worked at dominos delivering pizzas but her income was hardly adequate to support herself and her three children of whom becker was the eldest i think the family was evicted out of a couple of houses said todds half brother dwayne becker one of four sons from william beckers first marriage who were raised by their mother in another home and i remember todd said he was never going to live this way again and maybe that explains him a little becker told me he began to steal simply to help out his family he swiped tennis balls from a tennis club because he didnt want his mother to use her money on him to pay for gasoline for his car he stole money from a country club by his junior year in high school he was stealing radar detectors out of cars and selling them for fifty to sixty dollars each and taking his siblings to the mall to buy clothes two years later becker enrolled at the university of central florida in orlando on a tennis scholarship but after hurting his neck he quit the team and dropped out of school in just after his freshman year he returned to port st lucie to attend junior college where he ran across a guy who told him that he knew about some apple computers that could be stolen from a warehouse that was when apple computers cost four thousand dollars which sure beat radar detectors becker said becker did get arrested a couple of times in his late teens and early twenties but either the charges were dropped or he was given a minor probated sentence when he met cathy in at a nightclub on the beach frequented by college students he told her on their first date about his past burglaries but he also talked about his love for family and his intentions to go straight cathy had been raised in west texas by her mother after her father a crop duster had died in a plane crash she too wanted a stable family life after having been moved from home to home and she found herself drawn to beckers oldfashioned sincerity especially when he told her his goal was to own a familyfriendly business like a chuck e cheeses todd really wanted to be ward cleaver and he wanted cathy to be june said another of beckers half brothers bill becker and they lived in the perfect community where they could walk around at night and not have to worry about the wrong elements still becker could not get away from the fact that he possessed a special gift for burglary to pay for his and cathys wedding for instance he slipped out one night and quickly burglarized a couple of computer stores six months after the marriage when he learned cathy was pregnant he committed a few more burglaries so they could rent a nice house in a quiet neighborhood on the florida coast cathy believed becker when he kept promising that his next burglary would be his last but as criminals like to say when describing their pasts one thing led to another and soon becker was a fulltime burglar focusing on computer companies located in outoftheway business parks throughout florida he asked dwayne a parttime construction worker who was then hanging out at bars in the afternoons drinking and playing darts to help him break into businesses and he persuaded bill a grizzly adams lookalike who had been unsuccessfully trying to build a career as a manager of holiday inn restaurants to allow the stolen computers to be stored in his garage although he could have found other professional burglars to work as his accomplices becker told me that he decided to work with family members and friends because he felt they would not squeal on anyone else if they ever got arrested he said he also thought it might be nice to boost the fortunes of his family especially those beckers who were facing personal or financial challenges as a favor to his sister kim becker asked her husband danny birtwell an electrician who had shown little competence in the workforcehe was a complete idiot kim told meto work with him and he also recruited a friend from his old high school tennis team paulo rodrigues who had become somewhat disheartened because he was seriously overweight becker estimated he weighed three hundred pounds and because he had a rather mundane job as a salesman at mattress giant it seemed to be the unlikeliest of operations this partnership between a fastidious young suburban dad and his unambitious relatives initially they looked more like the marx brothers than butch cassidys wild bunch the beerdrinking dwayne occasionally broke into the wrong businesses danny once fell off a roof while trying to get into an office building after one burglary while the team was unloading the computers from beckers car danny accidentally locked the keys inside the vehicle unwilling to damage his own car becker called a locksmith in the middle of the night when danny took a break from the burglary business complaining that he had been working too hard becker brought in kim to work one job with him she wore a cute sweat suit brushed her hair back into a ponytail and hid behind some bushes to look for cops when becker was ready to leave with a stack of computers she sprinted to the minivan her enhanced breasts bouncing like beach balls against all odds becker kept himself and his employees one step ahead of the cops he taught his guys how to pry open the front door of a business with a crowbar without shattering the glass or tearing the door frame thus allowing the door to shut behind them and preventing a cop or security guard driving by from realizing that a burglary was in process he showed them how to cut certain phone lines which would disconnect most alarm systems to make sure they hadnt tripped a silent alarm becker would have everyone pile back into the car after cutting the phone lines drive fifteen minutes in one direction and then return if no police officers had shown up by that time they would break in becker told me that he and his team made million in a tenyear span selling their stolen computers to fences other criminals who purchase stolen goods he was doing so much work that police departments all over florida had begun to share information in an attempt to find the computer thief becker figured that the cops had to be thinking about him because of his earlier arrests his name was in their databases whats more cathy wanted to find a place for the family to live where they wouldnt always have to look over their shoulder a place where they could be anonymous so becker did exactly what so many nineteenthcentury lawbreakers once did to hide out from the long arm of the law he moved to texas and just like the outlaws of old becker decided to hide out on a ranch well it was called a ranch at the edge of almost every large american city there is a development like stonebridge ranch a masterplanned community filled with just the right amenities for the upper middle class including eighteenhole golf courses a large community swimming pool hikeandbike trails surrounding manmade ponds and strategically placed shopping centers all the neighborhoods are given lofty names eldorado stone canyon and the custombuilt houses that line the uncracked streets look nearly identical with nearly identical trees planted in the front yards and nearly identical suvs sitting in the driveways in such communities can be found the newest generation of americans bonded together by their striving for entitlement the setting couldnt have been more perfect for todd becker in becker put down for his new home which cathy loved because it had a secondfloor catwalk perfect for decorating for christmas she told me they added a chandelier to the living room and on a dining room wall they hung vases from which poured fake ivy on another wall they placed photos of themselves holding each of their children he was a very caring loving neighbor friendly to everyone said kathy scherer who lived on the same street and who believed beckers story that he worked in computer consulting one of those nineties catchall phrases that could mean absolutely anything he helped clean up one neighbors house when it was toiletpapered by some kids he used his extralong ladder to help another neighbor put up christmas lights he tracked down another neighbor at work to let him know that his burglar alarm was going off and that hed be happy to check the house out for him parents appreciated the way he never yelled at the kids on the soccer teams he helped coach and the elders at the lutheran church near the becker home appreciated the checks he deposited in the collection plate cathy meanwhile babysat anytime someone needed her she generously gave money to a friend on the block who was running in a charity race to raise funds for breast cancer research she taught vacation bible school at the church and she made sure to invite the neighborhood kids over for her childrens birthday parties for which she brought in petting zoos and pony rides what can i say we loved them said neighbor jodi anderson my husband works for a defense contractor and he used to be in the navy so hes trained to be a little skeptical of people he can always spot the bad seed but he never thought twice about todd he told me that he wished he could find a job like todds so he could be around the house more becker still held on to his dream of opening a chuck e cheeses he also talked with cathy about someday owning a stride rite childrens shoe store and perhaps a tanning salon with his new stonebridge ranch lifestyle however he knew he wouldnt be going straight anytime soon on his way to texas as a matter of fact he had committed a couple of computer burglaries in louisiana and mississippi to get a jumpstart on his upcoming mortgage payments to help out the other members of his family he used some of his burglary earnings to buy a restaurant near port st lucie called big als catfish house changed the name to becker boys big als and hired bill to manage it but the restaurant failed he then opened a checkcashing and quickloan business called treasure coast cash company which he had his father run that company shut down after the state of florida charged the elder becker with loan sharking to cover his debts and to pay his fathers legal fees becker found himself forced to carry out even more burglaries and it wasnt long before he was flying in his old burglary buddies to help him plunder from texass computer companies during one job his brotherinlaw danny stumbled across a small safe in the corner of a store pulled it from the floor and carried it out to the minivan when they got the safe open they found more than inside becker always one to look for new entrepreneurial opportunities took a breath his career in crime was about to take a major step forward in the annals of american crime few criminals have been romanticized like those who can get into a safe almost since moviemaking began hollywood has loved producing films about a gentleman burglar leaning his ear against a safe and trying to decipher its combination the reality however is that safecrackers cannot compete with todays manufacturers who can build safes with electronically controlled locks bank safes surrounded by reinforced vaults and stateoftheart security systems are virtually impossible to penetrate but smaller safes and atms found inside many businesses can be broken apart or dislodged from their moorings they can be stolenwhich is exactly what becker decided to do he did not have to be told that compared with the pilfering of computers safestealing would be a highrisk noisy business the sound of a sledgehammer pounding into the bolts holding a safe to the floor or the earsplitting whine of a gasolinepowered saw slamming into a steel safe could be heard dozens of yards away whats more most businesses with safesat least safes with substantial moneyare located in busy commercial sections of cities rather than remote business parks increasing the likelihood of eyewitnesses and cops but as far as becker could tell about the only criminals willing to steal safes were stupid kids who would drive stolen pickups through the plateglass windows of convenience stores and frantically try to dislodge the safe behind the counter before the cops arrived he became convinced that he could beat the cops by carefully planning his burglaries spending days scouting locations looking for stores that his team could get into and then get away from without causing too much disturbance he studied stores on the internet to see what kind of cash transactions they did he particularly looked for stores that cashed payroll checks as well as stores owned by foreignborn shopkeepers because they tended not to trust american banks and thus were likely to keep more money in their own safes beckers team was also ready to make some more money although dwaynes life had improved somewhat through the computer theftshe had used his earnings to buy a mercedeshe remained in dicey financial shape to make extra money dwaynes new girlfriend had persuaded him to perform sex acts with her in front of a camera attached to their computer which were then shown on an internet sex site viewers who paid to watch the notparticularlygoodlooking couple could email them and request that they try new positions meanwhile bill was still having trouble keeping a steady job in the restaurant business and danny was still relying on the money kim made as a topless dancer paulo rodrigues was still fat becker brought in one more family member his stepnephew julian gavin whose mother had married bill julian was a rawboned chainsmoking country boy who liked to take his mother mudding driving her in his pickup through big mud pits he was also by his own admission a crackcocaine user who had been drifting through life ever since his fiancee had died in a car crash a concerned becker told julian that he could get a new start in life with the money he would make robbing safes since i had nothing else to lose at the time julian would later tell a police detective i took him up on the offer according to police reports becker also recruited a stonebridge ranch neighbor fortythreeyearold joey thompson an unhappy salesman of heavy equipment with no past criminal record becker told me that joey depressed after losing in the stock market had come to him to talk about new career opportunities like becker joey loved stonebridge ranch and didnt want to lose his home whatever youre doing i want in becker recalled joey saying taking pity on his sadsack neighbor becker replied well ive got something but it might not be exactly what youre expecting becker told his team that he would keep percent of whatever was found in a safe whoever was working with him on that particular job would receive the rest typically becker would commit a burglary with either one or two members of his team becker said he would pay all expenses and that he would purchase all the burglary tools including twoway radios with headsets so that everyone could remain in contact during the heists he promised they would hit the businesses only late at night when no one would be there thus avoiding the need to use guns and hold anyone up and if anyone was arrested he said he would pay for his bail and his lawyer whether he liked it or not becker was coming into his prime as a criminal mastermind after spending the day substituteteaching for his daughters kindergarten class or playing shortstop for a stonebridge ranch league softball team shouting out encouragement to his teammates he would find himself sitting at his dining room table sketching diagrams about how he could get into his next target on sunday nights when he and cathy watched the sopranos the hbo series about the fictional mob family that lives in a nice suburban neighborhood in new jersey he would instantly spot the mistakes that tony soprano and his mobsters were making when they committed their crimes for his own burglaries he had his guys wear lightcolored tshirts or polo shirts along with shorts or regular jeans because he thought that anyone wearing too much black at night would look suspicious he rented green or blue minivans for the burglaries because they blended in with traffic and were hard for potential eyewitnesses to remember he also did all the driving because he had learned how to stay calm no matter what when dealing with the cops while casing a location in dallas for instance becker and his team were pulled over by a police officer becker lowered the window of the minivan and pleasantly told the officer that he was giving his outoftown brothers a sightseeing tour the officer unable to detect anything suspicious smiled back and told them to be careful because several burglaries had recently taken place in the area regardless of beckers ingenuity it was hard to imagine that the becker crew the name the cops would later give to becker and his cohorts would last long enough to make a name for itself julian an eccentric sort refused to wear baseball caps during the heistshe believed hats made a man go baldwhich made him an easier target for identification dwayne would get so nervous that he constantly had to stop what he was doing to use the restroom during one burglary he unzipped his pants in the middle of the store and urinated on the floor during another burglary paulo tried to lift a safe lost his balance fell on his back and could not get up without assistance on another job the lumbering paulo ran so slowly during a getaway that becker was forced to drive toward him in the minivan to pick him up before he collapsed from exhaustion becker told me that danny was not quite focused during burglaries because he was worried about what kim was doing in his absence occasionally he would call her during a burglary just to make sure that she wasnt cheating on him with someone from the topless bar as for joey thompson he happened to own a highpowered torch that could cut through steel safes unfortunately he wasnt as skilled with it as becker had hoped according to becker he and joey broke into a company in rockwall a dallas suburb while using his torch joey burned the entire business to the ground the becker crew split time between florida and texas going after safes in bingo halls liquor stores small supermarkets selfstorage businesses camera shops clothing outlets gasoline stations convenience stores and restaurants from burger kings to red lobsters a typical suburbanite becker didnt like to venture into the inner city because he was afraid of gangs if a safe could be moved the becker crew would carry it into the back of the minivan where it would be taken either to beckers garage if they were in the dallas area or to bills garage if they were working along floridas east coast or sometimes they would dismantle the safe right in the minivan remove the money and then dump the safe out the back doors one time becker watched his team dump a safe in the parking lot of a lutheran church in florida a lutheran church beckers very own denomination guys please show some respect becker yelled becker told me that during and he and his crew pulled from as many as one hundred safes in florida and texas sometimes he said they would strike three or four times in one night the money in each safe ranging from a few hundred dollars to or more other times weeks would pass before becker would round up his guys and do a job during that period police departments in texas and florida were beginning to sense by the similar way the phone lines were being cut and the front doors carefully opened and the instore surveillance videotapes taken that one group was probably responsible for the sharp increase in safe thefts at one point at least thirty local agencies were on the case but amazingly despite numerous hairraising escapes the becker crew was never caught in one foiled burglary attempt in texas in which an alarm was accidentally tripped julian escaped from the cops by jumping over a fence only to find himself in a small pasture where he was chased by an angry horse that kept nipping at his rear end in florida becker and julian broke into norriss famous place for ribs in port st lucie and came across an unmovable fivehundredpound safe they started cutting it apart with a gasolinepowered saw that bill had rented for them but before they could get through the steel walls they ran out of gasoline they had bill bring them a can of gasoline and then they started again by daybreak however they had worn out their saw blade trying to get into the safe they drove to lowes hardware store waited for the store to open so they could purchase a new blade returned to the scene of the crime began again and then saw a restaurant employee arriving as they were fleeing becker suddenly realized that julian had left the rented saw which could be traced back to them in the restaurant julian ran back inside dashed past the startled employee grabbed the saw and raced out as becker pulled away in the minivan a few police cars were gathering on the street in front of the restaurant setting up a morning rushhour speed trap the police didnt realize until becker was long gone that a burglary had been attempted when i asked becker if he ever felt remorse about his chosen profession on sunday mornings as he sat in a church pew with his family he told me that he constantly prayed for forgiveness he said he also asked god to let him have one big score so he could finally quit and fulfill his dream of living the noncriminal life although he did buy a few nice things for his familya rolex for cathy and fivehundreddollar porcelain dolls for his daughters on their birthdayshe was not that big of a spender he was always trying to save money he said for that chuck e cheeses franchise when becker took the family to orlando for an expensive vacation at disney world he told me and later told investigators that he paid for the trip by having his stonebridge ranch buddy joey fly there and meet him so that they could burglarize businesses at night after becker had spent the day taking the children through the magic kingdom as for cathy there would be times during her friday night bunco games with other mothers when the conversation would inevitably turn to the challenges the women were facing in their marriages cathy would look searchingly for a moment across the table not sure what to say the women believed she simply had no complaints about her life what she told me however was that she lived in constant fear that her husband would someday go to jail it preyed on my mind every day she said when todd would leave for the night id lie in bed unable to sleep about to throw up every single second at one point cathy got her residential real estate license and went to work for coldwell banker vainly hoping that she could bring in enough income so that her husband would no longer feel a need to steal she went to a counselor at the lutheran church telling him she wasnt sure how to deal with a problem in her marriage but when the counselor asked exactly what that problem was she didnt dare tell him to use the selfhelp vernacular that she would hear on such television shows as oprah cathy was the classic enabler she had to admit that she loved the kind of life that todd had provided for her she could never convince herself that todd a man who truly loved his family and did everything he could to make their lives better was any worse than those corporate executives plenty of whom lived right there in stonebridge ranch who ignored their kids and kept mistresses on the side and did their own bit of whitecollar thievery bending accounting rules or hiding income from the irs she knew that todd would never harm anyone after all he tried to hit only businesses that had insurance so the owners could recover their losses and she liked to point out if todd were really that bad of a man would he go to such trouble to try to improve the lives of those who worked for him when he flew his accomplices to texas to do burglaries for instance he always invited them to come to his house to play with the children and eat one of cathys homecooked meals it was as if he wanted to show them that they too could climb the ladder toyes suburban life after one dinner at beckers home julian went outside to smoke a cigarette a neighbor saw the wiry young man wearing a very unsuburbanish muscle shirt and called the police thinking the becker house was being burglarized despite their attempts to get him to change the radio to a rock station during their scouting expeditions becker kept playing dr laura because he believed they could use her nononsense advice on improving relationships and raising children when dwayne asked becker to invest of his burglary earnings into the internet sex venture becker refused telling him that he didnt like those sex sites and that he believed dwayne needed to do something more productive with himself the truth was that his lessons didnt seem to be catching on behind his back the crew called becker ken and cathy barbie despite dr lauras admonitions about living an immoral life the crew still liked to get drunk at topless clubs to celebrate successful burglaries one night julian and the others persuaded becker to come with them to the lodge one of dallass more famous topless nightclubs for a while becker sat uncomfortably in a booth then he went back outside to sit in his minivan julian eventually showed up with a woman he had met and promptly had sex with her nearby on the hood of the womans car periodically julian would shout at the disgusted becker im giving her the mustard baby im giving her the mustard what becker never could have imagined was that his desire to help his brothers would eventually lead to his own arrest it wasnt a crack police investigation that exposed becker what brought him down was his own perplexing moral code in july dwaynes girlfriend frantically called the st lucie county sheriffs department and claimed that dwayne had hit her and kicked her in the face and taken a sixpack of beer from her refrigerator after dwayne was jailed on a charge of aggravated battery he tried to get becker to bail him out although becker had promised his coworkers he would always take care of them if anything happened to them during one of his burglaries he made it clear he was not going to help them if they got into their own trouble like a drug arrest and he was certainly not going to help out dwayne for battering his girlfriend i had had conversations with dwayne about hitting women becker told me i had said to him what kind of man could do that i was disgusted with dwayne so i said no im not bailing him out it was a tough decision becker knew that dwayne was already somewhat disenchanted with him because of his lack of interest in his internet venture dwayne had also been arguing with becker about his share of the burglary proceeds which he thought needed to be bigger the fact that becker would not bail him out was the last straw an angry dwayne impulsively contacted a police detective and said that he might know a thing or two about the mysterious safe burglaries that had been occurring around florida indeed dwayne was so willing to talk that he forgot to arrange any kind of immunity deal for himself before making his confession when the cops located julian and confronted him with the statements dwayne had made he did quickly cut a deal perhaps because a few months earlier hed been arrested for doing some burglaries on his own apparently julian had begun to believe he was as good as becker and no longer needed him in orlando in a single evening he had attempted to steal the safes of a dairy queen a checkcashing business and a steak and aleall of them located within a block of one another an orlando police officer saw julian running from the last burglary drove up beside him and shot him with a stun gun causing him to soil his pants julian realized that the only way he could avoid prison for his tripleburglary stunt was to betray the very person who had taught him how to do it and just like that the becker crew was no more police officers descended on todd and cathys dream home yelling at them where are the safes where is the money they found only a couple thousand dollars in the bedroom closet and around a hundred dollars in cathys purse which she told them was money from her daughters girl scout cookie sales when beckers fiveyearold son watched the officers lead becker away he told his mother that the men were soldiers and that they wanted becker to go away with them to fight terrorists cathy said i bet thats right and then she burst into tears when police officers in florida went looking for bill they found him working parttime as a santas helper at a mall because he was still having trouble finding a good job in the restaurant business he was also a very bad criminal the cops found one of the stolen safes which he had been too lazy to discard in his garage as the police approached he was wearing a santas hat and a bright green vest festooned with decorations of candy canes telling children to smile for their photo with santa according to bill the police shouted step away from the santa booth during the arrest of paulo in another part of florida the police found a sculpture of a purple dolphin titled taking flight that had been taken from one of the florida stores where a safe had been stolen the sculpture was so beautiful paulo later said that he just had to have it for his living room becker was taken to florida to be booked on state burglary charges in the jail he came across dwayne we were sitting there by ourselves becker recalled and i said what did i do to you that was so terrible that you had to do this to me i said my kids love youthey jump on you they call you uncle dwayne they jump all over you becker paused still stunned by the betrayal and there was nothing dwayne could say nothing he could say for days at stonebridge ranch people drove past the becker house to gawk neighbors on the street talked about how becker used to give each of them a nice bottle of wine for christmas parents from the soccer teams that becker helped coach wondered if the soccer league would let him coach again after he got out of prison he was after all so good with the kids we definitely knew what he did was criminal said jodi anderson but we did admire the way he pulled it off it did take a lot of courage and its pretty hard to get away with something like that for so long in this neighborhood where everyone knows your business some neighbors withdrew from the beckers and one woman on the street told her children they could no longer play with the becker children because their daddy was a burglar cathy told me she was so furious at what the neighbor had said that she marched up the street to where the woman and others were gathered one evening and shouted you hypocrites ive seen you get drunk in front of your own kids i know you smoke pot i know you went swimming naked in someone elses pool when investigators asked becker to explain how he could maintain his stonebridge ranch lifestyle despite filing income tax returns that showed him earning less than six figures becker said that he had made money gambling in las vegas becker had indeed done some gambling over the years in hopes that he could earn enough money to quit burglarizing but becker quickly succumbed after hearing the evidence accumulated against him besides the state burglary charges he was facing an irs task force was charging becker with money laundering and was planning to take away all his assets m andrew stover an assistant us attorney for the eastern district of texas met with becker and told him that cathy could well be prosecuted for conspiracy his reaction was amazing said stover he started crying and shakingsomething you rarely see a major criminal doand he said that all he wanted was to take care of his wife and family to keep his wife out of prison becker agreed to confess to everything he had done his attorney mark watson of dallas also arranged that in return for a fiveyear federal prison sentence becker would reveal the names of the various fences around the country who had bought his stolen computers years before dwayne bill and paulo received twoyear sentences in florida the cases against joey and danny are still pending kim was never charged because the statute of limitations had expired for her particular criminal adventure due to beckers encouragement she did quit dancing and now works as a waitress at an italian restaurant meanwhile with his full immunity julian has disappeared from florida the rumor is that he has used his burglary money to help out members of his family just as becker used to do julian has allegedly purchased his father a camaro and given money to his mother who now has no income with her husband bill in jail when i talked to becker about julians new life he paused for a moment then said i hope i had an effect on him getting him to help out his family because thats what its all about perhaps the greatest irony of all is that dwayne beckers judas told me when i went to see him in florida that as soon as he gets out of prison he is going to get his dog back from his girlfriend and move to tennessee im going to get started again he said find a nice house in a nice neighborhood and not drink or anything it sounds just like the life todd wanted you to live i said there was a pause well no said dwayne he paused again i dont know maybe i went to see becker and his wife for the last time this past november just before he left for federal prison the irs had decided not to confiscate his stonebridge ranch home which still had a sizable mortgage because real estate values had decreased in the area and the home would be difficult for the federal government to sell at a profit as a result cathy and the children were going to be able to stay in the house although cathy who has gone back to work as a real estate agent said she was going to make the mortgage payments with her income some detectives speculate that the beckers still have a secret stash of stolen money when i walked through the front door cathy was busy decorating the house for thanksgiving and becker had just returned from his nextdoor neighbors home where the woman there had locked herself out of the house i used a flathead screwdriver to pop open her back door he said with a shrug becker had been busy that weekcleaning out the attic so that cathy wouldnt have to do it for the next five years going to the school cafeteria to eat lunch with his children and attending church i asked becker if he could imagine ever returning to the craft that he does so well there are plenty of police detectives who believe he will go right back to burglary when he gets out of prison because its the only profession he knows but becker firmly insisted that this time he was going to go straight when i asked what he might do for a living after prison he mentioned a seminar he had given a few months earlier to a group of detectives on the burglaries he had committed the audience was so attentive that he had begun to ponder the idea of becoming some sort of paid consultant to police departments and businesses that wanted to know how to stop good burglars i think thats a good idea honey said cathy coming in from the kitchen there could be some money in it becker agreed we might finally get the money to open that chuck e cheeses he grabbed cathys hand and the two of them smiled at each other for a moment they looked just like ward and june skip hollandsworth has been a writer for texas monthly magazine for fifteen years he is completing a history of the city of austin in the year when a jack the ripperlike killer ripped apart seven women over the course of twelve months sending the city into chaos exposing one major political scandal after another and setting off a riproaring and at times completely comic hunt for the killer coda when this story was published many of the people who lived in stonebridge ranch called me to ask how much of what i had written was true they had no idea about the extent of todd beckers criminal life they simply assumed i was exaggerating many of them also refused to believe that todds neighbor joey thompson had been involved in the safestealing ring they still didnt believe joey was involved until todd was brought back from florida to texas in to testify at thompsons trial meanwhile kathy and the children still live their pristine suburban life in the home todd had bought for them and rumors are flying about how she is able to afford the mortgage payments cbs has bought the rights to her life story and a television movie about the beckers might be made soon david grann mysterious circumstances the strange death of a sherlock holmes fanatic from the new yorker richard lancelyn green the worlds foremost expert on sherlock holmes believed that he had finally solved the case of the missing papers over the past two decades he had been looking for a trove of letters diary entries and manuscripts written by sir arthur conan doyle the creator of holmes the archive was estimated to be worth nearly four million dollars and was said by some to carry a deadly curse like the one in the most famous holmes story the hound of the baskervilles the papers had disappeared after conan doyle died in and without them no one had been able to write a definitive biography a task that green was determined to complete many scholars feared that the archive had been discarded or destroyed as the london times noted earlier this year its whereabouts had become a mystery as tantalizing as any to unfold at b baker street the fictional den of holmes and his fellowsleuth dr watson not long after green launched his investigation he discovered that one of conan doyles five children adrian had with the other heirs agreement stashed the papers in a locked room of a chateau that he owned in switzerland green then learned that adrian had spirited some of the papers out of the chateau without his siblings knowledge hoping to sell them to collectors in the midst of this scheme he died of a heart attackgiving rise to the legend of the curse after adrians death the papers apparently vanished and whenever green tried to probe further he found himself caught in an impenetrable web of heirsincluding a selfstyled russian princesswho seemed to have deceived and doublecrossed one another in their efforts to control the archive for years green continued to sort through evidence and interview relatives until one day the muddled trail led to londonand the doorstep of jean conan doyle the youngest of the authors children tall and elegant with silver hair she was an imposing woman in her late sixties something very strong and forceful seems to be at the back of that wee body her father had written of jean when she was five her will is tremendous whereas her brother adrian had been kicked out of the british navy for insubordination and her elder brother denis was a playboy who had sat out the second world war in america she had become an officer in the royal air force and was honored in as a dame commander of the order of the british empire she invited green into her flat where a portrait of her father with his walrus mustache hung near the fireplace green had almost as great an interest in her father as she did and she began sharing her memories as well as family photographs she asked him to return and one day green later told friends she showed him some boxes that had been stored in a london solicitors office peering inside them he said he had glimpsed part of the archive dame jean informed him that because of an ongoing family dispute she couldnt yet allow him to read the papers but she said that she intended to bequeath nearly all of them to the british library so that scholars could finally examine them after she died in green eagerly awaited their transferbut nothing happened then last march green opened the london sunday times and was shocked to read that the lost archive had turned up at christies auction house and was to be sold in may for millions of dollars by three of conan doyles distant relatives instead of going to the british library the contents would be scattered among private collectors around the world who might keep them inaccessible to scholars green was sure that a mistake had been made and hurried to christies to inspect the materials upon his return he told friends that he was certain that many of the papers were the same as those he had uncovered whats more he alleged they had been stolenand he had proof over the next few days he approached members of the sherlock holmes society of london one of hundreds of fan clubs devoted to the detective green had once been chairman he alerted other socalled sherlockians including various american members of the baker street irregulars an invitationonly group that was founded in and named after the street urchins holmes regularly employed to ferret out information green also contacted the more orthodox scholars of conan doyle or doyleans about the sale unlike green who moved between the two camps many doyleans distanced themselves from the sherlockians who often treated holmes as if he were a real detective and refused to mention conan doyle by name green shared with these scholars what he knew about the archives provenance revealing what he considered the most damning piece of evidence a copy of dame jeans will which stated i give to the british library allmy late fathers original papers personal manuscripts diaries engagement books and writings determined to block the auction the makeshift group of amateur sleuths presented its case to members of parliament toward the end of the month as the groups campaign intensified and its objections appeared in the press green hinted to his sister priscilla west that someone was threatening him later he sent her a cryptic note containing three phone numbers and the message please keep these numbers safe he also called a reporter from the london times warning that something might happen to him on the night of friday march he had dinner with a longtime friend lawrence keen who later said that green had confided in him that an american was trying to bring him down after the two men left the restaurant green told keen that they were being followed and pointed to a car behind them the same evening priscilla west phoned her brother and got his answering machine she called repeatedly the next morning but he still didnt pick up alarmed she went to his house and knocked on the door there was no response after several more attempts she called the police who came and broke open the entrance downstairs the police found the body of green lying on his bed surrounded by sherlock holmes books and posters with a cord wrapped around his neck he had been garroted i will lay out the whole case for you john gibson one of greens closest friends told me when i phoned him shortly after learning of greens death gibson had written several books with green including my evening with sherlock holmes a collection of parodies and pastiches of the detective stories with a slight stammer gibson said of his friends death its a complete and utter mystery not long after i traveled to great bookham a village thirty miles south of london where gibson lives he was waiting for me when i stepped off the train he was tall and railthin and everything about himnarrow shoulders long face unruly gray hair seemed to slouch forward as if he were supported by an invisible cane i have a file for you he said as we drove off in his car as youll see there are plenty of clues and not a lot of answers he sped through town past a twelfthcentury stone church and a row of cottages until he stopped at a red brick house surrounded by hedges you dont mind dogs i hope he said ive two cocker spaniels i only wanted one but the person i got them from said that they were inseparable and so i took them both and theyve been fighting ever since when he opened the front door both spaniels leaped on us then at each other they trailed us into the living room which was filled with piles of antique books some reaching to the ceiling among the stacks was a nearcomplete set of the strand magazine in which the holmes stories were serialized at the turn of the twentieth century a single issue which used to sell for half a shilling is now worth as much as five hundred dollars altogether there must be about sixty thousand books gibson said we sat on a couch and he opened his case file carefully spreading the pages around him all right dogs dont disturb us he said he looked up at me now ill tell you the whole story gibson said that he had attended the coroners inquest and taken careful notes and as he spoke he picked up a magnifying glass beside him and peered though it at several crumpled pieces of paper i write everything on scraps he said the police he said had found only a few unusual things at the scene there was the cord around greens necka black shoelace there was a wooden spoon near his hand and several stuffed animals on the bed and there was a partially empty bottle of gin the police found no sign of forced entry and assumed that green had committed suicide yet there was no note and sir colin berry the president of the british academy of forensic sciences testified to the coroner that in his thirtyyear career he had seen only one suicide by garroting one gibson repeated selfgarroting is extremely difficult to do he explained people who attempt it typically pass out before they are asphyxiated moreover in this instance the cord was not a thick rope but a shoelace making the feat even more unlikely gibson reached in his file and handed me a sheet of paper with numbers on it take a look he said my phone records the records showed that he and green had spoken repeatedly during the week before his death if the police had bothered to obtain greens records gibson went on they would no doubt show that green had called him only hours before he died i was probably the last person to speak to him he said the police however had never questioned him during one of their last conversations about the auction gibson recalled green had said he was afraid of something youve got nothing to worry about gibson told him no im worried green said what you fear for your life i do gibson said that at the time he didnt take the threat seriously but advised green not to answer his door unless he was sure who it was gibson glanced at his notes there was something else he said something critical on the eve of his death he reminded me green had spoken to his friend keen about an american who was trying to ruin him the following day gibson said he had called greens house and heard a strange greeting on the answering machine instead of getting richards voice in this sort of oxford accent which had been on the machine for a decade gibson recalled i got an american voice that said sorry not available i said what the hell is going on i thought i mustve dialled the wrong number so i dialled really slowly again i got the american voice i said christ almighty gibson said that greens sister had heard the same recorded greeting which is one reason that she had rushed to his house reaching into his file gibson handed me several more documents make sure you keep them in chronological order he said there was a copy of jean conan doyles will several newspaper clippings on the auction an obituary and a christies catalogue that was pretty much all he had the police gibson said had not conducted any forensic tests or looked for fingerprints and the coronerwho had once attended a meeting of the sherlock holmes society to conduct a mock inquest of the murder from a conan doyle story in which a corpse is discovered in a locked roomfound himself stymied gibson said that the coroner had noted that there was not enough evidence to ascertain what had happened and as a result the official verdict regarding whether green had killed himself or been murdered was left open within hours of greens death sherlockians seized upon the mystery as if it were another case in the canon in a web chat room one person who called himself inspector wrote as for selfgarroting it is like trying to choke oneself to death by your own hands others invoked the curse as if only the supernatural could explain it gibson handed me an article from a british tabloid that was headlined curse of conan doyle strikes holmes expert so what do you think gibson asked im not sure i said later we went through the evidence again i asked gibson if he knew whose phone numbers were on the note that green had sent to his sister gibson shook his head it hadnt come up at the inquest he said what about the american voice on the answering machine i asked do we know who that is unfortunately not a clue to me thats the strangest and most telling piece of evidence did richard put that on his machine what was he trying to tell us did the murderer put it on there and if so why would he do that i asked if green had ever displayed any irrational behavior no never he said he was the most levelheaded man i ever met he noted that priscilla west had testified at the inquest that her brother had no history of depression indeed greens physician wrote to the court to say that he had not treated green for any illnesses for a decade one last question i said was anything taken out of the apartment not that we know of richard had a valuable collection of sherlock holmes and conan doyle books and nothing appears to be missing as gibson drove me back to the train station he said please you must stay on the case the police seem to have let poor richard down then he advised as sherlock holmes says when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth some facts about richard green are easy to discernthose which illuminate the circumstances of his life rather than the circumstances of his death he was born on july he was the youngest of three children his father was roger lancelyn green a bestselling childrens author who popularized the homeric myths and the legend of king arthur and who was a close friend of c s lewis and j r r tolkien and richard was raised near liverpool on land that had been given to his ancestors in and where his family had resided ever since nathaniel hawthorne who was the american consul in liverpool in the eighteenfifties visited the house one summer and he later described it in his english notebooks we passed through a considerable extent of private road and finally drove through a lawn shaded with trees and closely shaven and reached the door of poulton hall part of the mansion is three or four hundred years oldthere is a curious old stately staircase with a twisted balustrade much like that of the old province house in boston the drawingroom looks like a very handsome modern room being beautifully painted gilded and paperhung with a whitemarble fireplace and rich furniture so that the impression is that of newness not of age by the time richard was born however the green family was as one relative told me very englisha big house and no money the curtains were thin the carpets were threadbare and a cold draft often swirled through the corridors green who had a pale pudgy face was blind in one eye from a childhood accident and wore spectacles with tinted lenses one friend told me that even as an adult green resembled the god of pan with cherubiclike features a mouth which curved in a smile which was sympathetic ironic and always seeming to suggest that there was just one little thing that he was not telling you intensely shy with a ferociously logical mind and a precise memory he would spend hours roaming through his fathers enormous library reading dusty first editions of childrens books and by the time he was eleven he had fallen under the spell of sherlock holmes holmes was not the first great literary detectivethat honor belongs to edgar allan poes inspector auguste dupinbut conan doyles hero was the most vivid exemplar of the fledgling genre which poe dubbed tales of ratiocination holmes is a cold calculating machine a man who is as one critic put it a tracker a hunterdown a combination of bloodhound pointer and bulldog the gaunt holmes has no wife or children as he explains i am a brain watson the rest of me is a mere appendix rigidly scientific he offers no spiritual bromides to his bereaved clients conan doyle reveals virtually nothing about his characters interior life he is defined solely by his method in short he is the perfect detective the superhero of the victorian era out of which he blasted with his deerstalker hat and inverness cape richard read the stories straight through then read them again his rigorous mind had found its match in holmes and his science of deduction which could wrest an astonishing solution from a single seemingly unremarkable clue all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it holmes explains in the first story a study in scarlet which establishes a narrative formula that subsequent tales nearly always follow a new client arrives at holmess baker street consulting room the detective stuns the visitor by deducing some element of his life by the mere observation of his demeanor or dress in a case of identity he divines that his client is a shortsighted typist by no more than the worn plush upon her sleeves and the dint of a pincenez at either side of her nose after the client presents the inexplicable facts of the case the game is afoot as holmes likes to say amassing clues that invariably boggle watson the stories more earthbound narrator holmes ultimately arrives at a dazzling conclusionone that to him and him only seems elementary in the redheaded league holmes reveals to watson how he surmised that an assistant pawnbroker was trying to rob a bank by tunnelling underneath it i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar holmes says explaining that he then went to see the assistant i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem following the advice that holmes often gave to watson green practiced how to see what others merely observed he memorized holmess rules as if they were catechism it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact not long after green turned thirteen he carried an assortment of artifacts from local junk sales into the dimly lit attic of poulton hall part of the attic was known as the martyrs chamber and was believed to be haunted having once been tenanted by a lady who was imprisoned there and persecuted to death for her religion according to hawthorne nevertheless up in the attic green assembled his objects to create a strange tableau there was a rack of pipes and a persian slipper stuffed with tobacco there was a stack of unpaid bills which he stabbed into a mantle with a knife so that they were pinned in place there was a box of pills labelled poison empty ammunition cartridges and trompeloeil bullet marks painted on the walls i didnt think the attic would stand up to real bullets he later remarked a preserved snake a brass microscope and an invitation to the gasfitters ball finally outside the door of the room green hung a sign baker street relying on the stray details sprinkled throughout conan doyles stories green had pieced together a replica of holmes and watsons apartmentone so precise that it occasionally drew holmes aficionados from other parts of england one local reporter described the uncanny sensation of climbing the seventeen stairsthe same number specified in the storiesas a tape recording played in the background with the sounds of victorian london the rumble of cab wheels the clopping of horses hooves on cobblestones by then green had become the youngest person ever inducted into the sherlock holmes society of london where members sometimes dressed in period costumesin highwaisted trousers and top hats though holmes had first appeared in print nearly a century earlier he had spawned a literary cult unlike that of any other fictional character almost from his inception readers latched on to him with a zeal that bordered on the mystical as one conan doyle biographer has noted when holmes made his debut in the beetons christmas annual a magazine of somewhat lurid fiction he was considered not just a character but a paragon of the victorian faith in all things scientific he entered public consciousness around the same time as the development of the modern police force at a moment when medicine was finally threatening to eradicate common diseases and industrialization offered to curtail mass poverty he was the proof that indeed the forces of reason could triumph over the forces of madness by the time green was born however the worship of scientific thinking had been shattered by other faiths by nazism and communism and fascism which had often harnessed the power of technology to demonic ends yet paradoxically the more illogical the world seemed the more intense the cult surrounding holmes became this symbol of a new creed had become a figure of nostalgiaa person in a fairy tale as green once put it the characters popularity even surpassed the level of fame he had attained in conan doyles day as the stories were reenacted in some two hundred and sixty movies twentyfive television shows a musical a ballet a burlesque and six hundred radio plays holmes inspired the creation of journals memorabilia shops walking tours postage stamps hotels themed ocean cruises edgar w smith a former vicepresident of general motors and the first editor of the baker street journal which publishes scholarship on conan doyles stories wrote in a essay what is it that we love in sherlock holmes we see him as the fine expression of our urge to trample evil and to set aright the wrongs with which the world is plagued he is galahad and socrates bringing high adventure to our dull existences and calm judicial logic to our biased minds he is the success of all our failures the bold escape from our imprisonment what has made this literary escape unlike any other though is that so many people conceive of holmes as a real person t s eliot once observed perhaps the greatest of the sherlock holmes mysteries is this that when we talk of him we invariably fall into the fancy of his existence green himself wrote sherlock holmes is a real character who lives beyond lifes span and who is constantly rejuvenated at the sherlock holmes society of london green was introduced to the great game which sherlockians had played for decades it was built around the conceit that the stories true author was not conan doyle but watson who had faithfully recounted holmess exploits once at a gathering of the elite baker street irregulars which green also joined a guest referred to conan doyle as the creator of holmes prompting one outraged member to exclaim holmes is a man holmes is a great man if green had to invoke conan doyles name he was told he should refer to him as merely watsons literary agent the challenge of the game was that conan doyle had often written the four holmes novels and fiftysix short storiesthe sacred writings as sherlockians called themin haste and they were plagued with inconsistencies that made them difficult to pass off as nonfiction how for instance is it possible that in one story watson is described as having been wounded in afghanistan in the shoulder by a jezail bullet though in another story he complains that the wound was in his leg the goal was thus to resolve these paradoxes using the same airtight logic that holmes exhibits similar textual inquiries had already given birth to a related field known as sherlockianamock scholarship in which fans tried to deduce everything from how many wives watson has one to five to which university holmes attended surely cambridge or oxford as green once conceded quoting the founder of the baker street irregulars never had so much been written by so many for so few after green graduated from oxford in he turned his attention to more serious scholarship of all the puzzles surrounding the sacred writings the greatest one green realized centered on the man whom the stories had long since eclipsedconan doyle himself green set out to compile the first comprehensive bibliography hunting down every piece of material that conan doyle wrote pamphlets plays poems obituaries songs unpublished manuscripts letters to the editor carrying a plastic bag in place of a briefcase green unearthed documents that had long been hidden behind the veil of history in the midst of this research green discovered that john gibson was working on a similar project and they agreed to collaborate the resulting tome published in by oxford university press with a foreword by graham greene is seven hundred and twelve pages long and contains notations on nearly every scrap of writing that conan doyle ever produced down to the kind of paper in which a manuscript was bound cloth light blue diapergrain when the bibliography was done gibson continued in his job as a government property assessor green however had inherited a sizable sum of money from his family who had sold part of their estate and he used the bibliography as a launching pad for a biography of conan doyle writing a biography is akin to the process of detection and green started to retrace every step of conan doyles life as if it were an elaborate crime scene during the nineteeneighties green followed conan doyles movements from the moment he was born on may in a squalid part of edinburgh green visited the neighborhood where conan doyle was raised by a devout christian mother and a dreamy father he drew one of the first illustrations of sherlock holmesa sketch of the detective discovering a corpse which accompanied a paperback edition of a study in scarlet green also amassed an intricate paper record that showed his subjects intellectual evolution he discovered for instance that after conan doyle studied medicine at the university of edinburgh and fell under the influence of rationalist thinkers like oliver wendell holmeswho undoubtedly inspired the surname of conan doyles detectivehe renounced catholicism vowing never will i accept anything which cannot be proved to me in the early eighties green published the first of a series of introductions to penguin classics editions of conan doyles previously uncollected worksmany of which he had helped to uncover the essays written in a clinical style began garnering him attention outside the insular subculture of sherlockians one essay running more than a hundred pages was a small biography of conan doyle unto itself in another green cast further light on the short story the case of the man who was wanted which had been found in a chest more than a decade after conan doyles death and was claimed by his widow and sons to be the last unpublished holmes story some experts had wondered if the story was a fake and even if conan doyles two sons in search of money to sustain their lavish life styles had forged it yet green conclusively showed that the story was neither by conan doyle nor a forgery instead it was written by an architect named arthur whitaker who had sent it to conan doyle in hopes of collaborating scholars described greens essays variously as dazzling unparalleled andthe ultimate complimentholmesian still green was determined to dig deeper for his now highly anticipated biography as the mystery writer iain pears has observed conan doyles hero acts in nearly the same fashion as a freudian analyst piecing together his clients hidden narratives which he alone can perceive in a review of conan doyles autobiography memories and adventures which was published in green noted it is as if conan doylewhose character suggested kindliness and trusthad a fear of intimacy when he describes his life he omits the inner man to reveal this inner man green examined facts that conan doyle rarely if ever spoke of himselfmost notably that his father an epileptic and an incorrigible alcoholic was eventually confined to an insane asylum yet the more green tried to plumb his subject the more he became aware of the holes in his knowledge of conan doyle he didnt want just to sketch conan doyles story with a series of anecdotes he wanted to know everything about him in the draft of an early mystery story the surgeon of gaster fall conan doyle writes of a son who has locked his raving father inside a cagebut this incident was excised from the published version had conan doyle been the one to commit his father to the asylum was holmess mania for logic a reaction to his fathers genuine mania and what did conan doyle mean when he wrote in his deeply personal poem the inner room that he has thoughts he dare not say green wanted to create an immaculate biography one in which each fact led inexorably to the next he wanted to be both watson and holmes to conan doyle to be his narrator and his detective yet he knew the words of holmes data data data i cant make bricks without clay and the only way to succeed he realized was to track down the lost archive murder owen dudley edwards a highly regarded conan doyle scholar said i fear that is what the preponderance of the evidence points to i had called him in scotland after gibson informed me that edwards was pursuing an informal investigation into greens death edwards had worked with green to stop the auction which took place in spite of the uproar almost two months after greens body was found edwards said of his friend i think he knew too much about the archive a few days later i flew to edinburgh where edwards promised to share with me his findings we had arranged to meet at a hotel on the edge of the old city it was on a hill studded with medieval castles and covered in a thin mist not far from where conan doyle had studied medicine under dr joseph bell one of the models for sherlock holmes once during a class bell held up a glass vial this gentlemen contains a most potent drug he said it is extremely bitter to the taste to the classs astonishment he touched the amber liquid lifted a finger to his mouth and licked it he then declared not one of you has developed his power of perception while i placed my index finger in the awful brew it was my middle fingerayewhich somehow found its way into my mouth edwards greeted me in the hotel lobby he is a short pearshaped man with wild gray sideburns and an even wilder gray beard a history professor at the university of edinburgh he wore a rumpled tweed coat over a vneck sweater and carried a knapsack on his shoulder we sat down at the restaurant and i waited as he rummaged through the books in his bag edwards who has written numerous books including the quest for sherlock holmes an acclaimed account of conan doyles early life began pulling out copies of greens edited collections green he said was the worlds greatest conan doyle expert i have the authority to say it richard ultimately became the greatest of us all that is a firm and definite statement of someone who knows as he spoke he tended to pull his chin in toward his chest so that his beard fanned out he told me that he had met green in while researching his book on conan doyle at the time green was still working on his bibliography with gibson even so he had shared all his data with edwards that was the kind of scholar he was he said to edwards greens death was even more baffling than the crimes in a holmes story he picked up one of the conan doyle collections and read aloud from a case of identity in the cool ironical voice of holmes life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outre results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusion most stale and unprofitable after edwards closed the book he explained that he had spoken frequently with green about the christies sale our lives have been dominated by the fact that conan doyle had five children three of whom became his literary heirs edwards said the two boys were playboys one of them denis was i gather utterly selfish the other one adrian was a repulsive crook and then there was an absolutely wonderful daughter green he said had become so close to the daughter dame jean that he came to be known as the son she never had even though in the past conan doyles children had typically had fractious relationships with their fathers biographers in the early nineteenforties for example adrian and denis had cooperated with hesketh pearson on conan doyle his life and art but when the book came out and portrayed conan doyle as the man in the street a phrase conan doyle himself had used adrian rushed into print his own biography the true conan doyle and denis allegedly challenged pearson to a duel dame jean had subsequently taken it upon herself to guard her fathers legacy against scholars who might present him in too stark a light yet she confided in green who had tried to balance his veneration of his subject with a commitment to the truth edwards said that dame jean not only gave green a glimpse of the treasured archive she also asked for his help in transferring various papers to her solicitors office richard told me that he had physically moved them edwards said so his knowledge was really quite dangerous he claimed that green was the biggest figure standing in the way of the christies auction since he had seen some of the papers and could testify that dame jean had intended to donate them to the british library soon after the sale was announced edwards said he and green had learned that charles foley sir arthurs greatnephew and two of foleys cousins were behind the sale but neither he nor green could understand how these distant heirs had legally obtained control of the archive all we were clear about was that there was a scam and that clearly someone was robbing stuff that should go to the british library edwards said he added this was not a hypothesisit was quite certain in our own minds edwards also had little doubt that somebody had murdered his friend he noted the circumstantial detailsgreens mention of threats to his life his reference to the american who was trying to bring him down some observers he said had speculated that greens death might have been the result of autoerotic asphyxiation but he told me that there were no signs that green was engaged in sexual activity at the time he added that garroting is typically a brutal method of executiona method of murder which a skilled professional would use whats more green had no known history of depression edwards pointed out that green on the day before he died had made plans with another friend for a holiday in italy the following week moreover he said if green had killed himself there surely would have been a suicide note it was inconceivable that a man who kept notes on everything would not have left one there are other things edwards continued he was garroted with a bootlace yet he always wore slipon shoes and edwards found meaning in seemingly insignificant details the kind that holmes might note particularly the partially empty bottle of gin by his bed to edwards this was a clear sign of the presence of a stranger since green an oenophile had drunk wine at supper that evening and would never have followed wine with gin whoever did this is still at large edwards said he put a hand on my shoulder please be careful i dont want to see you garroted like poor richard before we parted he told me one more thinghe knew who the american was the american who asked that i not use his name lives in washington dc after i tracked him down he agreed to meet me at timberlakes pub near dupont circle i found him sitting at the bar sipping red wine though he was slumped over he looked strikingly tall with a hawkish nose and a thinning ring of gray hair he appeared to be in his fifties and wore bluejeans and a buttondown white shirt with a fountain pen sticking out of the front pocket like a professor after pausing a moment to deduce who i was he stood and led me to a table in the back of the room which was filled with smoke and sounds from a jukebox we ordered dinner and he proceeded to tell me what edwards had loosely sketched out that he was a longtime member of the baker street irregulars and had for many years helped to represent conan doyles literary estate in america it is his main job though that has given him a slightly menacing airat least in the minds of greens friends he works for the pentagon in a highranking post that deals with clandestine operations one of donald rumsfelds pals as edwards described him the american said that after he received a phd in international relations in and became an expert in the cold war and nuclear doctrine he was drawn into the sherlockian games and their pursuit of immaculate logic ive always kept the two worlds separate he told me at one point i dont think a lot of people at the pentagon would understand my fascination with a literary character he met green through the sherlockian community he said as members of the baker street irregulars both had been given official titles from the holmes stories the american was rodger prescott of evil memory after the american counterfeiter in the adventure of the three garridebs green was known as the three gables after the villa in the adventure of the three gables which is ransacked by burglars in search of a scandalous biographical manuscript in the midnineteeneighties the american said he and green had collaborated on several projects as the editor of a collection of essays on conan doyle he had asked green whom he considered then the single most knowledgeable living person on conan doyle to write the crucial chapter on the authors memoir my relationship with richard was always productive he recalled then in the early nineteennineties he said they had had a falling outa result he added of a startling rupture in greens relationship with dame jean richard had gotten very close to dame jean and was getting all sorts of family photographs having represented himself as a great admirer of conan doyle he said and then she saw something in print by him and suddenly realized that he had been representing his views very differently and that was kind of the end of it the american insisted that he couldnt remember what green had written that upset her but edwards and others in holmesian circles said that the reason nobody could recall a specific offense was that greens essays had never been particularly inflammatory according to r dixon smith a friend of greens and a longtime conan doyle book dealer the american played on dame jeans sensitivities about her fathers reputation and seized upon some of greens candid words which had never upset her before then twisted them like a screw edwards said of the american i think he did everything he possibly could to injure richard he drove a wedge between richard and dame jean conan doyle after dame jean cast green out edwards and others noted the american grew closer to her edwards told me that green never got over the quarrel with dame jean he used to look at me like his heart was breaking he said when i pressed the american further about the incident he said simply because i was jeans representative i got caught in the middle of it soon after he said the good feeling and cooperation by green toward me ended at sherlockian events he said they continued to see each other but green always reserved would often avoid him smith had told me that in greens final months he often seemed preoccupied with the american he kept wondering whats he gonna do next during the last week of his life green told several friends that the american was working to defeat his crusade against the auction and he expressed fear that his rival might try to damage his scholarly reputation on march two days before he died green learned that the american was in london and was planning to attend a meeting that evening of the sherlock holmes society a friend said that green called him and exclaimed i dont want to see him i dont want to go green backed out of the meeting at the last minute the friend said of the american i think he scared richard as i mentioned some of the allegations of greens friends the american unfolded his napkin and touched the corners of his mouth he explained that during his visit to london he had offered counsel to charles foleywhom he now served as a literary representative as he had for dame jeanand discussed the sale of the archive at christies but the american emphasized that he had not seen or spoken to green for more than a year on the night that green died he revealed with some embarrassment he was walking through london with his wife on a group tour of jack the rippers crime scenes he said that he had learned only recently that green had become fixated on him before his death and he noted that some sherlockians blurred the line between fandom and fanaticism it was because of the way people felt about the character he said holmes was a sort of vampirelike creature he said he consumed some people the waiter had served our meals and the american paused to take a bite of steak and onion rings he then explained that conan doyle had felt oppressed by his creation though the stories had made him the highestpaid author of his day conan doyle wearied of constantly inventing problems and building up chains of inductive reason as he once said bitterly in the stories holmes himself seems overwhelmed by his task going days without sleep and after solving a case often shooting up cocaine a sevenpercent solution in order to spell the subsequent drain and boredom but for conan doyle there seemed to be no similar release and he confided to one friend that holmes is becoming such a burden to me that it makes my life unendurable the very qualities that had made holmes invinciblehis character admits of no light or shade as conan doyle put it eventually made him intolerable moreover conan doyle feared that the detective stories eclipsed what he called his more serious literary work he had spent years researching several historical novels which he was convinced would earn him a place in the pantheon of writers in after he finished the white company which was set in the middle ages and based on tales of gallant pious knights he proclaimed well ill never beat that the book was popular in its day but it was soon obscured by the shadow of holmes as were his other novels with their comparatively stilted lifeless prose after conan doyle completed the domestic novel a duet with an occasional chorus in andrew lang a wellknown editor who had helped publish one of his previous books summed up the sentiment of most readers it may be a vulgar taste but we decidedly prefer the adventures of dr watson with sherlock holmes conan doyle was increasingly dismayed by the great paradox of his success the more real holmes became in the minds of readers the less the author seemed to exist finally conan doyle felt that he had no choice as the american put it he had to kill sherlock holmes conan doyle knew that the death had to be spectacular a man like that mustnt die of a pinprick or influenza he told a close friend his end must be violent and intensely dramatic for months he tried to imagine the perfect murder then in december six years after he gave birth to holmes conan doyle published the final problem the story breaks from the established formula there is no puzzle to be solved no dazzling display of deductive genius and this time holmes is the one pursued he is being chased by professor moriarty the napoleon of crime who is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city of london moriarty is the first true counterpart to holmes a mathematician who is as holmes informs watson a genius a philosopher an abstract thinker tall and asceticlooking he even physically resembles holmes what is most striking about the story though is that the two great logicians have descended into illogicthey are paranoid and consumed only with each other at one point moriarty tells holmes this is not danger it is inevitable destruction finally the two converge on a cliff overlooking reichenbach falls in switzerland as watson later deduces from evidence at the scene holmes and moriarty struggled by the edge of the precipice before plunging to their deaths after finishing the story conan doyle wrote in his diary with apparent delight killed holmes as the american spoke of these details he seemed stunned that conan doyle had gone through with such an extraordinary act still he pointed out conan doyle could not escape from his creation in england men reportedly wore black armbands in mourning in america clubs devoted to the cause lets keep holmes alive were formed though conan doyle insisted that holmess death was justifiable homicide readers denounced him as a brute and demanded that he resuscitate their hero after all no one had actually seen him go off the cliff as green wrote in a essay if ever a murderer was to be haunted by the man he had killed and to be forced to atone for his act it was the creator turned destroyer of sherlock holmes in under increasing pressure conan doyle released the hound of the baskervilles about an ancient family curse but the events in the story antedated holmess death then two years later conan doyle succumbed completely and began writing new holmes stories explaining less than convincingly in the adventure of the empty house that holmes had never plunged to his death but merely arranged it to look that way so he could escape from moriartys gang the american told me that even after conan doyle died holmes continued to loom over his descendants dame jean thought that sherlock holmes was the family curse he said like her father he said she had tried to draw attention to his other works but was constantly forced to tend to the detectives thousands of fansmany of whom sent letters addressed to holmes requesting his help in solving real crimes in a essay entitled sherlock holmes the god g k chesterton observed of sherlockians it is getting beyond a joke the hobby is hardening into a delusion several actors who played holmes were also haunted by him the american said in a autobiography in and out of character basil rathbone who played the detective in more than a dozen films complained that because of his portrayal of holmes his renown for other parts including oscarnominated ones was sinking into oblivion the public conflated him with his most famous character which the studio and audience demanded he play again and again until by the end he too lamented that he could not kill mr holmes another actor jeremy brett had a breakdown while playing the detective and was eventually admitted to a psychiatric ward where he was said to have cried out damn you holmes at one point the american showed me a thick book which he had brought to the pub it was part of a multivolume history that he was writing on the baker street irregulars and sherlockian scholarship he had started the project in i thought if i searched pretty assiduously id find enough material to do a single hundredandfiftypage volume he said ive now done five volumes for more than fifteen hundred pages and ive only gotten up to he added its been a slippery slope into madness and obsession as he spoke of his fascination with holmes he recalled one of the last times he had seen green three years earlier at a symposium at the university of minnesota green had given a lecture on the hound of the baskervilles it was a multimedia presentation about the origins of the novel and it was just dazzling the american said he repeated the word dazzling several times its the only word to describe it and as he sat up in his chair and his eyes brightened i realized that i was talking not to greens moriarty but to his soul mate then catching himself he reminded me that he had a fulltime job and a family the danger is if you have nothing else in your life but sherlock holmes he said in richard green made a pilgrimage to reichenbach falls to see where his childhood hero had nearly met his demise conan doyle himself had visited the site in and green wanted to repeat the authors journey standing at the edge of the falls green stared at the chasm below where as watson noted after he called out my only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me by the midnineteennineties green knew that he would not have access to the conan doyle archive until dame jean died presuming that she bequeathed the papers to the british library in the meantime he continued researching his biography which he concluded would require no less than three volumes the first would cover conan doyles childhood the second the arc of his literary career the third his descent into a kind of madness relying on public documents green outlined this last stage which began after conan doyle started using his powers of observation to solve realworld mysteries in conan doyle took up the case of george edalji a halfparsi indian living near birmingham who faced seven years of hard labor for allegedly mutilating his neighbors cattle during the night conan doyle suspected that edalji had been tagged as a criminal merely because of his ethnicity and he assumed the role of detective upon meeting his client he noticed that the young man was holding a newspaper inches from his face arent you astigmatic conan doyle asked yes edalji admitted conan doyle called in an ophthalmologist who confirmed that edaljis malady was so severe that he was unable to see properly even with glasses conan doyle then trekked to the scene of the crime traversing a maze of railroad tracks and hedges i a strong and active man in broad daylight found it a hard matter to pass he later wrote indeed he contended it would have been impossible for a nearly blind person to make the journey and then slaughter an animal in the pitch black of night a tribunal soon concurred and the new york times declared conan doyle solves a new dreyfus case conan doyle even helped in solving a case of a serial killer after he spotted newspaper accounts in which two women had died in the same bizarre manner the victims were recent brides who had accidentally drowned in their bathtubs conan doyle informed scotland yard of his theory telling the inspector in an echo of holmes no time is to be lost the killer dubbed the bluebeard of the bath was subsequently caught and convicted in a sensational trial around conan doyle tried to apply his rational powers to the most important matter of his daythe logic of launching the first world war he was convinced that the war was not simply about entangling alliances and a dead archduke it was a sensible way to restore the codes of honor and moral purpose that he had celebrated in his historical novels that year he unleashed a spate of propaganda declaring fear not for our sword will not be broken nor shall it ever drop from our hands in the holmes story his last bow which is set in the detective tells watson that after the storm has cleared a cleaner better stronger land will lie in the sunshine though conan doyle was too old to fight many of his relatives heeded his call to arms including his son kingsley the glorious battle conan doyle envisioned however became a cataclysm the products of scientific reasonmachines and engineering and electronicswere transformed into agents of destruction conan doyle visited the battlefield by the somme where tens of thousands of british soldiers died and where he later reported seeing a soldier drenched crimson from head to foot with two great glazed eyes looking upwards through a mask of blood in a chastened conan doyle realized that the conflict was evidently preventable by that time ten million people had perished including kingsley who died from battle wounds and influenza after the war conan doyle wrote a handful of holmes stories yet the field of detective fiction was changing the allknowing detective gradually gave way to the hardboiled dick who acted more on instinct and gin than on reason in the simple art of murder raymond chandler while admiring conan doyle dismissed the tradition of the grim logician and his exhausting concatenation of insignificant clues which now seemed like an absurdity meanwhile in his own life conan doyle seemed to abandon reason altogether as one of greens colleagues in the baker street irregulars daniel stashower relates in a book teller of tales the life of arthur conan doyle the creator of holmes began to believe in ghosts he attended seances and received messages from the dead through the power of automatic writing a method akin to that of the ouija board during one session conan doyle who had once considered the belief in life after death as a delusion claimed that his dead younger brother said it is so grand to be in touch like this one day conan doyle heard a voice in the seance room as he later described the scene in a letter to a friend i said is that you boy he said in a very intense whisper and a tone all his own father and then after a pause forgive me i said there was never anything to forgive you were the best son a man ever had a strong hand descended on my head which was slowly pressed forward and i felt a kiss just above my brow are you happy i cried there was a pause and then very gently i am so happy the creator of sherlock holmes had become the st paul of psychics conan doyle claimed to see not only dead family members but fairies as well he championed photographs taken in by two girls that purported to show such phantasmal creatures even though as one of the girls later admitted i could see the hatpins holding up the figures ive always marvelled that anybody ever took it seriously conan doyle however was convinced and even published a book called the coming of fairies he opened the psychic bookshop in london and told friends that he had received messages that the world was coming to an end i suppose i am sherlock holmes if anybody is and i say that the case for spiritualism is absolutely proved he declared in a headline in the sunday express asked is conan doyle mad for the first time green struggled to rationalize his subjects life in one essay green wrote it is hard to understand how a man who had stood for sound common sense and healthy attitudes could sit in darkened rooms watching for ectoplasm green reacted at times as if his hero had betrayed him in one passage he wrote angrily conan doyle was deluding himself one thing richard couldnt stand was conan doyles being involved with spiritualism edwards said he thought it crazy his friend dixon smith told me it was all conan doyle he pursued him with all his mind and body greens house became filled with more and more objects from conan doyles life longforgotten propaganda leaflets and speeches on spiritualism an arcane study of the boer war previously unknown essays on photography i remember once i discovered a copy of a duet with an occasional chorus gibson said it had a great red cover on it i showed it to richard and he got really excited he said god this must have been the salesmans copy when green found one of the few surviving copies of the beetons christmas annual with a study in scarlet which was worth as much as a hundred and thirty thousand dollars he sent a card to a friend with two words on it at last green also wanted to hold things that conan doyle himself had held letter openers and pens and spectacles he would collect all day and all night and i mean night his brother scirard told me green covered many of his walls with conan doyles family photographs he even had a piece of wallpaper from one of conan doyles homes obsession is by no means too strong a word to describe what richard had his friend nicholas utechin the editor of the sherlock holmes journalsaid its selfperpetuating and i dont know how to stop green confessed to an antiques magazine in by his house resembled the attic at poulton hall only now he seemed to be living in a museum dedicated to conan doyle rather than to holmes i have around forty thousand books green told the magazine then of course there are the photographs the pictures the papers and all the other ephemera i know it sounds a lot but you see the more you have the more you feel you need and what he longed for most remained out of reach the archive after dame jean died in and no papers materialized at the british library he became increasingly frustrated where he had once judiciously built his conjectures about conan doyles life he now seemed reckless in to the shock of doyleans around the world green wrote a paper claiming that he had proof that conan doyle had had a tryst with jean leckie his delicately beautiful second wife before his first wife louisa died of tuberculosis in though it was well known that conan doyle had formed a bond with leckie during his wifes long illness he had always insisted i fight the devil and i win and to maintain an air of victorian rectitude he often brought along chaperones when he and leckie were together green based his allegation on the census which reported that on the day the survey was taken conan doyle was staying at the ashdown forest hotel in east sussex so too was leckie conan doyle could not have chosen a worse weekend on which to have a private tryst green wrote yet green failed to note one crucial fact also contained in the census reportconan doyles mother was staying in the hotel with him apparently as a chaperone later green was forced to recant in a letter to the sherlock holmes journal saying i was guilty of the capital mistake of theorising without data still he continued to lash out at conan doyle as conan doyle once had at sherlock holmes edwards recalled that in one conversation green decried conan doyle as unoriginal and a plagiarist he confessed to another friend ive wasted my whole life on a secondrate writer i think he was frustrated because the family wasnt coming to any agreement smith said the archive wasnt made available and he got angry not at the heirs but at conan doyle last march when green hurried to christies after the auction of the papers was announced he discovered that the archive was as rich and as abundant as hed imagined among the thousands of items were fragments of the first tale that conan doyle wrote at the age of six illustrated logs from when conan doyle was a surgeon on a scottish whaling ship in the eighteeneighties letters from conan doyles father whose drawings in the asylum resembled the fairies that his son later seized upon as real a brown envelope with a cross and the name of his dead son inscribed upon it the manuscript of conan doyles first novel which was never published a missive from conan doyle to his brother which seemed to confirm that greens hunch had been right and that conan doyle had in fact begun an affair with leckie jane flower who helped to organize the papers for christies told reporters the whereabouts of this material was previously unknown and it is for this reason that no modernday biography of the author exists meanwhile back at his home green tried to piece together why the archive was about to slip into private hands once more according to greens family he typed notes in his computer reexamining the trail of evidence which he thought proved that the papers belonged to the british library he worked late into the night frequently going without sleep none of it however seemed to add up at one point he typed in bold letters stick to the factsafter another sleepless night he told his sister that the world seemed kafkaesque several hours before green died he called his friend utechin at home green had asked him to find a tape of an old bbc radio interview which green recalled quoted one of conan doyles heirs saying that the archive should be given to the british library utechin said that he had found the tape but there was no such statement on the recording green became apoplectic and accused his friend of conspiring against him as if he were another moriarty finally utechin said richard youve lost it one afternoon while i was at my hotel in london the phone rang i need to see you again john gibson said ill take the next train in before he hung up he added i have a theory i met him in my hotel room he was carrying several scraps of paper on which he had taken notes he sat down by the window his slender figure silhouetted in the fading light and announced i think it was suicide he had sifted through the data including details that i had shared with him from my own investigation there was mounting evidence he said that his rationalist friend was betraying signs of irrationality in the last week of his life there was the fact that there was no evidence of forced entry at greens home and there was the fact perhaps most critically of the wooden spoon by greens hand he had to have used it to tighten the cord like a tourniquet gibson said if someone else had garroted him why would he need the spoon the killer could simply use his hands he continued i think things in his life had not turned out the way he wanted this christies sale simply brought everything to a head he glanced nervously at his notes which he strained to see without his magnifying glass thats not all he said i think he wanted it to look like murder he waited to assess my reaction then went on thats why he didnt leave a note thats why he took his voice off the answering machine thats why he sent that message to his sister with the three phone numbers on it thats why he spoke of the american who was after him he must have been planning it for days laying the foundation giving us false clues i knew that in detective fiction the reverse scenario generally turns out to be truea suicide is found to have been murder as holmes declares in the resident patient this is no suicide it is a very deeply planned and coldblooded murder there is however one notable exception it is eerily enough in one of the last holmes mysteries the problem of thor bridge a story that green once cited in an essay a wife is found lying dead on a bridge shot in the head at pointblank range all the evidence points to one suspect the governess with whom the husband had been flirting yet holmes shows that the wife had not been killed by anyone rather enraged by jealousy over her husbands illicit overtures to the governess she had killed herself and framed the woman whom she blamed for her misery of all conan doyles stories it digs deepest into the human psyche and its criminal motivations as the governess tells holmes when i reached the bridge she was waiting for me never did i realize till that moment how this poor creature hated me she was like a mad woman indeed i think she was a mad woman subtly mad with the deep power of deception which insane people may have i wondered if green could have been so enraged with the loss of the archive that he might have done something similar and even tried to frame the american whom he blamed for ruining his relationship with dame jean and for the sale of the archive i wondered if he could have tried in one last desperate attempt to create order out of the chaos around him i wondered if this theory however improbable was in fact the least impossible i shared with gibson some other clues i had uncovered the call that green had made to the reporter days before his death saying that something might happen to him a reference in a holmes story to one of moriartys main henchmen as a garroter by trade and a statement to the coroner by greens sister who said that the note with the three phone numbers had reminded her of the beginning of a thriller after a while gibson looked up at me his face ghastly white dont you see he exclaimed he staged the whole thing he created the perfect mystery before i went back to america i went to see greens sister priscilla west she lives near oxford in a threestory eighteenthcentury brick house with a walled garden she had long wavy brown hair an attractive round face and small oval glasses she invited me inside with a reticent voice saying are you a drawingroom person or a kitchen person i shrugged uncertainly and she led me into the drawing room which had antique furniture and her fathers childrens books on the shelves as we sat down i explained to her that i had been struggling to write her brothers story the american had told me there is no such thing as a definitive biography and green seemed particularly resistant to explication richard compartmentalized his life his sister said there are a lot of things weve only found out since he died at the inquest his family and most of his friends had been startled when lawrence keen who was nearly half greens age announced that he had been richards lover years ago no one in the family knew that green was gay his sister explained it wasnt something he ever talked about as west recalled other surprising fragments of greens biography travels to tibet a brief attempt at writing a novel i tried to picture him as best i could with his glasses his plastic bag in hand and his wry smile west had seen her brothers body lying on the bed and several times she told me i just wish before falling silent she handed me copies of the eulogies that greens friends had delivered at the memorial service which was held on may the day conan doyle was born on the back of the program from the service were several quotes from sherlock holmes stories i caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain he appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge his career has been an extraordinary one after a while she got up to pour herself a cup of tea when she sat down again she said that her brother had willed his collection to a library in portsmouth near where conan doyle wrote the first two holmes stories so that other scholars could have access to it the collection was so large that it had taken two weeks and required twelve truckloads to cart it all away it was estimated to be worth several million dollarsfar more in all likelihood than the treasured archive he really did not like the idea of scholarship being put second to greed west said he lived and died by this she then told me something about the archive which had only recently come to light and which her brother had never learned dame jean conan doyle while dying of cancer had made a lastminute deed of apportionment splitting the archive between herself and the three heirs of her former sisterinlaw anna conan doyle what was being auctioned off therefore belonged to the three heirs and not to dame jean and though some people still questioned the morality of the sale the british library had reached the conclusion that it was legal green also could not know that after the auction on may the most important papers ended up at the british library dame jean had not allotted those documents to the other heirs and had willed many of them to the library at the same time the library had purchased much of the remaining material at the auction as gibson later told me the tragedy is that richard could have still written his biography he would have had everything he needed two questions however remained unclear how i asked west did an american voice wind up on her brothers answering machine im afraid its not that complicated she said the machine she continued was made in the united states and had a builtin recorded message when her brother took off his personal message a prerecorded american voice appeared i then asked about the phone numbers in the note she shook her head in dismay they added up to nothing she said they were merely those of two reporters her brother had spoken to and the number of someone at christies finally i asked what she thought had happened to her brother at one point scirard lancelyn green had told the london observer that he thought murder was entirely possible and for all my attempts to build a case that transcended doubt there were still questions hadnt the police told the coroner that an intruder could have locked greens apartment door while slipping out thus giving the illusion that his victim had died alone wasnt it possible that green had known the murderer and simply let him in and how could someone even in a fit of madness garrote himself with merely a shoelace and the help of a spoon his sister glanced away as if trying one last time to arrange all the pieces then she said i dont think well ever know for sure what really happened unlike in detective stories we have to live without answers david grann is a staff writer at the new yorker his stories have appeared in the new york times magazine the atlantic monthly and the new republic where he previously served as managing editor his work has also been excerpted in several collections including the best american sports writing and the best american crime writing coda ever since i was a boy i have read the holmes stories enthralled by them critics have long tried to determine the source of their hold on the popular imagination some have argued that it is because of the spell of their logic or the dialogue between holmes and watson or the victorian mood they evoke but for me it was simply the thrill of the chasethat the game was indeed afoot as holmes always put it with delight when i started this story i inevitably found myself approaching it in the same fashion here at last i thought was a mystery worthy of holmes and initially as i went about my reporting piecing together each clue i could feel that same sense of wonder i had as a boy when say i discovered in the adventure of the speckled band that the suspect had killed his stepdaughter with the deadliest snake in india but the more i spoke with richard lancelyn greens family and friends the more i was reminded of another sensation one that rarely intrudes in the sherlockian game grief indeed by the end it occurred to me that i had never been investigating a mystery but a tragedy clive thompson the virus underground from the new york times magazine this is how easy it has become mario stubs out his cigarette and sits down at the desk in his bedroom he pops into his laptop the cd of iron maidens number of the beast his latest favorite album i really like it he says my girlfriend bought it for me he gestures to the fifteenyearold girl with straight dark hair lounging on his neatly made bed and she throws back a shy smile mario sixteen is a secondaryschool student in a small town in the foothills of southern austria he didnt want me to use his last name his shiny shoulderlength hair covers half his face and his sleepy green eyes making him look like a very young languid mick jagger on his wall he has an enormous poster of anna kournikovawhich he admits sheepishly his girlfriend is not thrilled about downstairs his mother is cleaning up after dinner she isnt thrilled these days either but what bothers her isnt marios poster its his hobby when mario is boredand out here in the countryside surrounded by soaring snowcapped mountains and little else hes bored a lothe likes to sit at his laptop and create computer viruses and worms online he goes by the name second part to hell and he has written more than one hundred and fifty examples of what computer experts call malware tiny programs that exist solely to selfreplicate infecting computers hooked up to the internet sometimes these programs cause damage and sometimes they dont mario says he prefers to create viruses that dont intentionally wreck data because simple destruction is too easy anyone can rewrite a hard drive with one or two lines of code he says it makes no sense its really lame besides which its mean he says and he likes to be friendly but stilljust to see if he could do ita year ago he created a rather dangerous tool a program that autogenerates viruses its called a batch trojan generator and anyone can download it freely from marios web site with a few simple mouse clicks you can use the tool to create your own malicious trojan horse like its ancient namesake a trojan virus arrives in someones email looking like a gift a jpeg picture or a video for example but actually bearing dangerous cargo mario starts up the tool to show me how it works a little box appears on his laptop screen politely asking me to name my trojan i call it the clive virus then it asks me what id like the virus to do shall the trojan horse format drive c yes i click shall the trojan horse overwrite every file yes it asks me if id like to have the virus activate the next time the computer is restarted and i say yes again then its done the generator spits out the virus onto marios hard drive a tiny k file marios generator also displays a stern notice warning that spreading your creation is illegal the generator he says is just for educational purposes a way to help curious programmers learn how trojans work but of course i could ignore that advice i could give this virus an enticing name like britneyspearsweddingclipmpeg to fool people into thinking its a video if i were to email it to a victim and if he clicked on itand didnt have uptodate antivirus software which many people dontthen disaster would strike his computer the virus would activate it would quietly reach into the victims microsoft windows operating system and insert new commands telling the computer to erase its own hard drive the next time the victim started up his computer the machine would find those new commands assume they were part of the normal windows operating system and guilelessly follow them poof everything on his hard drive would vanishemail pictures documents games ive never contemplated writing a virus before even if i had i wouldnt have known how to do it but thanks to a teenager in austria it took me less than a minute to master the art mario drags the virus over to the trash bin on his computers desktop and discards it i dont think we should touch that he says hastily computer experts called the year of the worm for twelve months digital infections swarmed across the internet with the intensity of a biblical plague it began in january when the slammer worm infected nearly servers in ten minutes clogging bank of americas atm network and causing sporadic flight delays in the summer the blaster worm struck spreading by exploiting a flaw in windows it carried taunting messages directed at bill gates infected hundreds of thousands of computers and tried to use them to bombard a microsoft web site with data then in august a worm called sobigf exploded with even more force spreading via email that it generated by stealing addresses from victims computers it propagated so rapidly that at one point one out of every seventeen email messages traveling through the internet was a copy of sobigf the computersecurity firm mig estimated that the worldwide cost of these attacks in including cleanup and lost productivity was at least billion though such estimates have been criticized for being inflated the pace of contagion seems to be escalating when the mydooma email virus struck in late january it spread even faster than sobigf at its peak experts estimated one out of every five email messages was a copy of mydooma it also carried a nasty payload it reprogrammed victim computers to attack the web site of sco a software firm vilified by geeks in the open source software community you might assume that the blameand the legal repercussions for the destruction would land directly at the feet of people like mario but as the police around the globe have cracked down on cybercrime in the past few years virus writers have become more cautious or at least more crafty these days many elite writers do not spread their works at all instead they publish them posting their code on web sites often with detailed descriptions of how the program works essentially they leave their viruses lying around for anyone to use invariably someone does the people who release the viruses are often anonymous mischiefmakers or script kiddies thats a derisive term for aspiring young hackers usually teenagers or curious college students who dont yet have the skill to program computers but like to pretend they do they download the viruses claim to have written them themselves and then set them free in an attempt to assume the role of a fearsome digital menace script kiddies often have only a dim idea of how the code works and little concern for how a digital plague can rage out of control our modern virus epidemic is thus born of a symbiotic relationship between the people smart enough to write a virus and the people dumb enoughor malicious enoughto spread it without these two groups of people many viruses would never see the light of day script kiddies for example were responsible for some of the damage the blaster worm caused the original version of blaster which struck on august was clearly written by a skilled programmer who is still unknown and at large three days later a second version of blaster circulated online infecting an estimated seven thousand computers this time the fbi tracked the release to jeffrey lee parson an eighteenyearold in minnesota who had found slightly altered and rereleased the blaster code prosecutors claim parson may have been seeking notoriety or he may have had no clue how much damage the worm could cause he did nothing to hide his identity and even included a reference to his personal web site in the code he was arrested and charged with intentionally causing damage to computers when his trial begins probably this spring he faces up to ten years in jail a few weeks later a similar scene unfolded another variant of blaster was found in the wild this time it was traced to a college student in romania who had also left obvious clues to his identity in the code this development worries security experts because it means that viruswriting is no longer exclusively a highskill profession by so freely sharing their work the elite virus writers have made it easy for almost anyone to wreak havoc online when the damage occurs as it inevitably does the original authors just shrug we may have created the monster theyll say but we didnt set it loose this dodge infuriates security professionals and the police who say it is legally precise but morally corrupt when they publish a virus online they know someones going to release it says eugene spafford a computerscience professor and security expert at purdue university like a collection of young dr frankensteins the virus writers are increasingly creating forces they cannot controland for which they explicitly refuse to take responsibility wheres the beer philetoastr wondered an hour earlier he had dispatched three friends to pick up another case but they were nowhere in sight he looked out over the controlled chaos of his tiny onebedroom apartment in smalltown bavaria most of the virus writers i visited live in europe there have been very few active in the united states since because of fears of prosecution philetoastrs party was crammed with twenty friends who were blasting the punk band deftones playing cards smoking furiously and arguing about politics it was a saturday night three girls sat on the floor rolling another girls hair into thick dreadlocks the hairstyle of choice among the crowd philetoastr himselfa twentyoneyearold with a small silver hoop piercing his lower lipwears his brown hair in thick dreads philetoastr is an online handle he didnt want me to use his name philetoastrs friends finally arrived with a fresh case of ale and his blue eyes lit up he flicked open a bottle using the edge of his cigarette lighter and toasted the others a tall blond friend in a jacket festooned with antinike logos put his arm around philetoastr and beamed this guy he proclaimed is the best at visual basic in the virus underground thats love visual basic is a computer language popular among malware authors for its simplicity philetoastr has used it to create several of the two dozen viruses hes written from this tiny tourist town he works as an assistant in a home for the mentally disabled and in his spare time runs an international viruswriters group called the ready rangers liberation front he founded the group three years ago with a few bored high school friends in his even tinier hometown nearby i met him like everyone profiled in this article online first emailing him then chatting in an internet relay chat channel where virus writers meet and trade tips and war stories philetoastr got interested in malware the same way most virus authors do his own computer was hit by a virus he wanted to know how it worked and began hunting down viruswriters web sites he discovered years worth of viruses online all easily downloadable as well as primers full of coding tricks he spent long evenings hanging out in online chat rooms asking questions and soon began writing his own worms one might assume philetoastr would favor destructive viruses given the fact that his apartment is decorated toptobottom with anticorporate stickers but philetoastrs viruses like those of many malware writers are often surprisingly mild things carrying goofy payloads one worm does nothing but display a picture of a raised middle finger on your computer screen then sheepishly apologize for the gesture hey this is not meant to you i just wanted to show my payload another one he is currently developing will install two artificial intelligence chatagents on your computer they appear in a popup window talking to each other nervously about whether your antivirus software is going to catch and delete them philetoastr said he was also working on something sneakier a keylogger its a trojan virus that monitors every keystroke its victim typesincluding passwords and confidential email messagesthen secretly mails out copies to whoever planted the virus anyone who spreads this trojan would be able to quickly harvest huge amounts of sensitive personal information technically viruses and worms are slightly different things when a virus arrives on your computer it disguises itself it might look like an outkast song heyyamp but if you look more closely youll see it has an unusual suffix like heyyampexe thats because it isnt an mp file at all its a tiny program and when you click on it it will reprogram parts of your computer to do something new like display a message a virus cannot kickstart itself a human needs to be fooled into clicking on it this turns virus writers into armchair psychologists always hunting for new tricks to dupe someone into activating a virus all virusspreading one virus writer said caustically is based on the idiotic behavior of the users worms in contrast usually do not require any human intervention to spread that means they can travel at the breakneck pace of computers themselves unlike a virus a worm generally does not alter or destroy data on a computer its danger lies in its speed when a worm multiplies it often generates enough traffic to brown out internet servers like air conditioners bringing down the power grid on a hot summer day the most popular worms today are mass mailers which attack a victims computer swipe the addresses out of microsoft outlook the worlds most common email program and send a copy of the worm to everyone in the victims address book these days the distinction between worm and virus is breaking down a worm will carry a virus with it dropping it onto the victims hard drive to do its work then emailing itself off to a new target the most ferocious threats today are network worms which exploit a particular flaw in a software product often one by microsoft the author of slammer for example noticed a flaw in microsofts sql server an online database commonly used by businesses and governments the slammer worm would find an unprotected sql server then would fire bursts of information at it flooding the servers data buffer like a cup filled to the brim with water once its buffer was full the server could be tricked into sending out thousands of new copies of the worm to other servers normally a server should not allow an outside agent to control it that way but microsoft had neglected to defend against such an attack using that flaw slammer flooded the internet with fiftyfive million blasts of data per second and in only ten minutes colonized almost all vulnerable machines the attacks slowed the system in bellevue washington a seattle suburb to such a degree that operators had to resort to a manual method of tracking calls philetoastr said he isnt interested in producing a network worm but he said it wouldnt be hard if he wanted to do it he would scour the web sites where computersecurity professionals report any new software vulnerabilities they discover often these security white papers will explain the flaw in such detail that they practically provide a road map on how to write a worm that exploits it then i would use it he concluded its that simple computerscience experts have a phrase for that type of fastspreading epidemic a warhol worm in honor of andy warhols prediction that everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes in computer terms fifteen minutes is a really long time says nicholas weaver a researcher at the international computer science institute in berkeley who coined the warhol term the worm moves faster than humans can respond he suspects that even more damaging worms are on the way all a worm writer needs to do is find a significant new flaw in a microsoft product then write some code that exploits it even microsoft admits that there are flaws the company doesnt yet know about virus writers are especially hostile toward microsoft the perennial whipping boy of the geek world from their somewhat selfserving point of view microsoft is to blame for the worm epidemic because the company frequently leaves flaws in its products that allow malware to spread microsoft markets its products to less expert computer users cultivating precisely the sort of gullible victims who click on disguised virus attachments but it is microsofts success that really makes it such an attractive target since more than percent of desktop computers run windows worm writers target microsoft in order to hit the largest possible number of victims by relying so exclusively on microsoft products virus authors say we have created a digital monoculture a dangerous thinning of the internets gene pool microsoft officials disagree that their programs are poor quality of course and it is also possible that their products are targeted because it has become cool to do so theres sort of a natural tendency to go after the biggest dog says phil reitinger senior security strategist for microsoft reitinger says that the company is working to make its products more secure but microsoft is now so angry that it has launched a counterattack last fall microsoft set up a million fund to pay for information leading to the capture of writers who target windows machines so far the company has announced bounties for the creators of blaster sobigf and mydoomb the motivations of the top virus writers can often seem paradoxical they spend hours dreaming up new strategies to infect computers then hours more bringing them to reality yet when theyre done most of them say they have little interest in turning their creations free in fact percent of all malware never successfully spreads in the wild either because it expressly wasnt designed to do so or because the author was inept and misprogrammed his virus though philetoastr is proud of his keylogger he said he does not intend to release it into the wild his reason is partly one of selfprotection he wouldnt want the police to trace it back to him but he also said he does not ethically believe in damaging someone elses computer so why write a worm if youre not going to spread it for the sheer intellectual challenge philetoastr replied the fun of producing something really cool for the top worm writers the goal is to make something thats brandnew never seen before replicating an existing virus is lame the worst of all possible insults a truly innovative worm philetoastr said is like art to allow his malware to travel swiftly online the virus writer must keep its code short and efficient like a poet elegantly packing as much creativity as possible into the tight format of a sonnet one condition of art he noted is doing good things with less when he gets stuck on a particularly thorny problem philetoastr will sometimes call for help from other members of the ready rangers liberation front which includes mario another friend in another country whom philetoastr has never actually met is helping him complete his keylogger by writing a few crucial bits of code that will hide the tool from its victims view when theyre done theyll publish their invention in their groups zine a semiannual anthology of the members best work the virus scene is oddly gentlemanly almost like the amateur scientist societies of victorian britain where colleagues presented papers in an attempt to win that most elusive of social currencies street cred in fact i didnt meet anyone who gloated about his own talent until i met benny he is a member of a a superelite cadre within the virus underground a handful of coders around the world whose malware is so innovative that even antivirus experts grudgingly admit theyre impressed based in the czech republic benny cleancut and wideeyed has been writing viruses for five years making him a veteran in the field at age twentyone the main thing that im most proud of and that no one else can say is that i always come up with a new idea he said ushering me into a bedroom so neat that it looked as if hed stacked his magazines using a ruler and level each worm shows something different something new that hadnt been done before by anyone bennythats his handle not his real nameis most famous for having written a virus that infected windows two weeks before windows was released hed met a microsoft employee months earlier who boasted that the new operating system would be more secure than ever benny wrote but says he didnt release the virus specifically to humiliate the company microsoft he said with a laugh wasnt enthusiastic he also wrote leviathan the first virus to use multithreading a technique that makes the computer execute several commands at once like a juggler handling multiple balls it greatly speeds up the pace at which viruses can spread benny published that invention in his groups zine and now many of the most virulent bugs have adopted the technique including last summers infamous sobigf for a virus author a successful worm brings the sort of fame that a particularly daring piece of graffiti used to produce the authors name automatically replicating itself in cyberspace when antivirus companies post on their web sites a new alert warning of a fresh menace the thrill for the author is like getting a great book review something to crow about and email around to your friends writing malware as one author emailed me is like creating artificial life a virus he wrote is a humble little creature with only the intention to avoid extinction and survive quite apart from the intellectual fun of programming though the virus scene is attractive partly because its very social when philetoastr drops by a viruswriters chat channel late at night after work the conversation is as likely to be about music politics or girls as the latest in worm technology theyre not talking about virusestheyre talking about relationships or ordering pizza says sarah gordon a senior research fellow at symantec an antivirus company who is one of the only researchers in the world who has interviewed hundreds of virus writers about their motivations very occasionally malware authors even meet up facetoface for a party philetoastr once took a road trip for a beeraddled weekend of coding and when i visited mario we met up with another austrian virus writer and discussed code for hours at a bar the virus community attracts a lot of smart but alienated young men libertarian types who are often flummoxed by the social nuances of life while the virus scene isnt dominated by those characters it certainly has its shareand they are often the ones with a genuine chip on their shoulder i am a social reject admitted vorgon as he called himself a virus writer in toronto with whom i exchanged messages one night in an online chat channel he studied computer science in college but couldnt find a computer job after sending out four hundred resumes with no friends not much family and no girlfriend for years he became depressed he attempted suicide he said by walking out one frigid winter night into a nearby forest for five hours with no jacket on but then he got into the viruswriting scene and found a community i met a lot of cool people who were interested in what i did he wrote they made me feel good again he called his first virus firstborn to celebrate his new identity later he saw that one of his worms had been written up as an alert on an antivirus site and it thrilled him kinda like when i got my first girlfriend he wrote i was god for a couple days he began work on another worm trying to recapture the feeling i spent three months working on it just so i could have those couple of days of godliness vorgon is still angry about life his next worm he wrote will try to specifically target the people who wouldnt hire him it will have a spidering engine that crawls webpage links trying to find likely email addresses for humanresource managers like ca for example then it will send them a fake resume infected with the worm he hasnt yet decided on a payload and he hasnt ruled out a destructive one this is a revenge worm he explainedfor not hiring me and hiring some loser is not even half the programmer i am many people might wonder why virus writers arent simply rounded up and arrested for producing their creations but in most countries writing viruses is not illegal indeed in the united states some legal scholars argue that it is protected as free speech software is a type of language and writing a program is akin to writing a recipe for beef stew it is merely a bunch of instructions for the computer to follow in the same way that a recipe is a set of instructions for a cook to follow a virus or worm becomes illegal only when it is activated when someone sends it to a victim and starts it spreading in the wild and it does measurable damage to computer systems the top malware authors are acutely aware of this distinction most every viruswriter web site includes a disclaimer stating that it exists purely for educational purposes and that if a visitor downloads a virus to spread the responsibility is entirely the visitors bennys main viruswriting computer at home has no internet connection at all he has walled it off like an airlocked biologicalweapons lab so that nothing can escape even by accident virus writers argue that they shouldnt be held accountable for other peoples actions they are merely pursuing an interest in writing selfreplicating computer code im not responsible for people who do silly things and distribute them among their friends benny said defiantly im not responsible for those what i like to do is programming and i like to show it to peoplewho may then do something with it a young woman who goes by the handle gigabyte told me in an online chat room that if the authorities wanted to arrest her and other virus writers then they should arrest the creators of guns as well one of the youngest virus writers i visited was stephen mathieson a sixteenyearold in detroit whose screen name is kefi he also belongs to philetoastrs ready rangers liberation front a year ago mathieson became annoyed when he found members of another viruswriters group called catfishvx plagiarizing his code so he wrote evion a worm specifically designed to taunt the catfish guys he put it up on his web site for everyone to see like most of mathiesons work the worm had no destructive intent it merely popped up a few cocky messages including catfishvx are lamers this virus was constructed for them to steal someone did in fact steal it because pretty soon mathieson heard reports of it being spotted in the wild to this day he does not know who circulated evion but he suspects it was probably a random troublemaker a script kiddie who swiped it from his site the kids he said shaking his head just cut and paste quite aside from the strangeness of listening to a sixteenyearold complain about the kids mathiesons rhetoric glosses over a charged ethical and legal debate it is tempting to wonder if the leading malware authors are lyingwhether they do in fact circulate their worms on the sly obsessed with a desire to see whether they will really work while security officials say that may occasionally happen they also say the top virus writers are quite likely telling the truth if youre writing important virus code youre probably well trained says david perry global director of education for trend micro an antivirus company you know a number of tricks to write good code but you dont want to go to prison you have an income and stuff it takes someone unaware of the consequences to release a virus but worm authors are hardly absolved of blame by putting their code freely on the web virus writers essentially dangle temptation in front of every disgruntled teenager who goes online looking for a way to rebel a cynic might say that malware authors rely on clueless script kiddies the same way that a drug dealer uses thirteenyearolds to carry illegal goodspassing the liability off to a hapless mule youve got several levels here says marc rogers a former police officer who now researches computer forensics at purdue university youve got the guys who write it and they know they shouldnt release it because its illegal so they put it out there knowing that some script kiddie who wants to feel like a big shot in the virus underground will put it out they know these neophytes will jump on it so theyre grinning ear to ear because their baby their creation is out there but they didnt officially release it so they dont get in trouble he says he thinks that the original authors are just as blameworthy as the spreaders sarah gordon of symantec also says the authors are ethically naive if youre going to say its an artistic statement there are more responsible ways to be artistic than to create code that costs people millions she says critics like reitinger the microsoft security chief are even harsher to me its online arson he says launching a virus is no different from burning down a building there are people who would never toss a molotov cocktail into a warehouse but they wouldnt think for a second about launching a virus what makes this issue particularly fuzzy is the nature of computer code it skews the traditional intellectual question about studying dangerous topics academics who research nuclearfission techniques for example worry that their research could help a terrorist make a weapon many publish their findings anyway believing that the mere knowledge of how fission works wont help al qaeda get access to uranium or rocket parts but computer code is a different type of knowledge the code for a virus is itself the weapon you could read it in the same way you read a book to help educate yourself about malware or you could set it running turning it instantly into an active agent computer code blurs the line between speech and act its like taking a gun and sticking bullets in it and sitting it on the counter and saying hey free gun rogers says some academics have pondered whether virus authors could be charged under conspiracy laws creating a virus they theorize might be considered a form of abetting a crime by providing materials ken dunham the head of malicious code intelligence for idefense a computer security company notes that there are certainly many examples of virus authors assisting newcomers he has been in chat rooms he says where i can see people saying how can i find vulnerable hosts and another guy says oh go here you can use this tool theyre helping each other out there are virus writers who appreciate these complexities but they are certain that the viruses they write count as protected speech they insist they have a right to explore their interests indeed a number of them say they are making the world a better place because they openly expose the weaknesses of computer systems when philetoastr or mario or mathieson finishes a new virus they say they will immediately email a copy of it to antivirus companies that way they explained the companies can program their software to recognize and delete the virus should some script kiddie ever release it into the wild this is further proof that they mean no harm with their hobby as mathieson pointed out on the contrary he said their viruswriting strengthens the immune system of the internet these moral nuances fall apart in the case of virus authors who are themselves willing to release worms into the wild theyre more rare for obvious reasons usually they are overseas in countries where the police are less concerned with software crimes one such author is melhacker a young man who reportedly lives in malaysia and has expressed sympathy for osama bin laden antivirus companies have linked him to the development of several worms including one that claims to come from the al qaeda network before the iraq war he told a computer magazine that he would release a virulent worm if the united states attacked iraq a threat that proved hollow when i emailed him he described his favorite type of worm payload stolen information from other people he wont say which of his viruses he has himself spread and refuses to comment on his connection to the qaeda worm but in december on a discussion board for virus writers melhacker urged other writers to try to make it in the wild and to release their viruses in cybercafes presumably to avoid detection he also told them to stop sending in their work to antivirus companies mathieson wrote a critical post in response arguing that a good virus writer shouldnt need to spread his work virus authors are in fact sometimes quite chagrined when someone puts a dangerous worm into circulation because it can cause a public backlash that hurts the entire virus community when the melissa virus raged out of control in many internet service providers immediately shut down the web sites of malware creators virus writers stormed online to pillory the melissa author for turning his creation loose we dont need any more grief one wrote ifyou ask cyberpolice and security experts about their greatest fears they are not the traditional virus writers like mario or philetoastr or benny for better or worse those authors are a known quantity what keeps antivirus people awake at night these days is an entirely new threat worms created for explicit criminal purposes these began to emerge last year sobig in particular alarmed virus researchers it was released six separate times throughout and each time the worm was programmed to shut itself off permanently after a few days or weeks every time the worm appeared anew it had been altered in a way that suggested a single author had been tinkering with it observing its behavior in the wild then killing off his creation to prepare a new and more insidious version it was a set of very wellcontrolled experiments says mikko hypponen the director of antivirus research at fsecure a computer security company the code is high quality its been tested well it really works in the real world by the time the latest variant sobigf appeared in august the worm was programmed to install a back door that would allow the author to assume control of the victims computer to what purpose experts say its author has used the captured machines to send spam and might also be stealing financial information from the victims computers no one has any clue who wrote sobig the writers of this new class of worm leave none of the traces of their identities that malware authors traditionally include in their code like their screen names or greetz shoutout hellos to their cyberfriends because criminal authors actively spread their creations they are cautious about tipping their hand the fbi is out for the sobig guy with both claws and they want to make an example of him david perry notes hes not going to mouth off dunham of idefense says his online research has turned up anecdotal evidence that the sobig author comes from russia or elsewhere in europe others suspect china or other parts of asia it seems unlikely that sobig came from the united states because american police forces have been the most proactive of any worldwide in hunting those who spread malware many experts believe the sobig author will release a new variant sometime this year sobig was not alone a variant of the mimail worm which appeared last spring would install a fake popup screen on a computer pretending to be from paypal an online ecommerce firm it would claim that paypal had lost the victims credit card or banking details and ask him to type it in again when he did the worm would forward the information to the worms stillunknown author another worm called bugbearb was programmed to employ sophisticated passwordguessing strategies at banks and brokerages to steal personal information it was specifically designed to target financial institutions said vincent weafer senior director of symantec the era of the stealth worm is upon us none of these pieces of malware were destructive or designed to cripple the internet with too much traffic on the contrary they were designed to be unobtrusive to slip into the background the better to secretly harvest data five years ago the biggest danger was the chernobyl virus which deleted your hard drive but the prevalence of harddrivedestroying viruses has steadily declined to almost zero malware authors have learned a lesson that biologists have long known the best way for a virus to spread is to ensure its host remains alive its like comparing ebola to aids says joe wells an antivirus researcher and founder of wildlists a longestablished virustracking group they both do the same thing except one does it in three days and the other lingers and lingers and lingers but which is worse the ones that linger are the ones that spread the most in essence the long years of experimentation have served as a sort of darwinian evolutionary contest in which virus writers have gradually figured out the best strategies for survival given the pace of virus development we are probably going to see even nastier criminal attacks in the future some academics have predicted the rise of cryptovirusesmalware that invades your computer and encrypts all your files making them unreadable the only way to get the data back will be to pay a ransom says stuart schechter a doctoral candidate in computer security at harvard one night on a discussion board i stumbled across a few virus writers casually discussing this very concept antivirus companies are writing research papers that worry about the rising threat of metamorphic wormsones that can shift their shapes so radically that antivirus companies cannot recognize theyre a piece of malware some experimental metamorphic code has been published by zombie a reclusive russian member of the a viruswriting group and mobilephone viruses are probably also only a few years away a phone virus could secretly place am calls to a toll number sticking you with thousanddollar charges that the viruss author would collect or it could drown in phantom calls as marty lindner a cybersecurity expert at certcc a federally financed computer research center puts it the skys the limit the profusion of viruses has even become a nationalsecurity issue government officials worry that terrorists could easily launch viruses that cripple american telecommunications sowing confusion in advance of a physical style attack paula scalingi the former director of the department of energys office of critical infrastructure protection now works as a consultant running disasterpreparedness exercises last year she helped organize purple crescent in new orleans an exercise that modeled a terrorist strike against the citys annual jazz and heritage festival the simulation includes a physical attack but also uses a worm unleashed by the terrorists designed to cripple communications and sow confusion nationwide the physical attack winds up flooding new orleans the cyberattack makes hospital care chaotic they have trouble communicating they cant get staff in its hard for them to order supplies she says the impact of worms and viruses can be prodigious this new age of criminal viruses puts traditional malware authors in a politically precarious spot police forces are under more pressure than ever to take any worm seriously regardless of the motivations of the author a young spaniard named antonio discovered that last fall he is a quiet twentythreeyearold computer professional who lives near madrid last august he read about the blaster worm and how it exploited a microsoft flaw he became intrigued and after poking around on a few virus sites found some sample code that worked the same way he downloaded it and began tinkering to see how it worked then on november as he left to go to work spanish police met him at his door they told him the antivirus company panda software had discovered his worm had spread to computers when panda analyzed the worm code it quickly discovered that the program pointed to a site antonio had developed panda forwarded the information to the police who hunted antonio down via his internet service provider the police stripped his house of every computerincluding his roommatesand threw antonio in jail after two days they let him out upon which antonios employer immediately fired him i have very little money he said when i met him in december if i dont have a job in a little time in a few months i cant pay the rent i will have to go to my parents the spanish court is currently considering what charges to press antonios lawyer javier maestre argued that the worm had no dangerous payload and did no damage to any of the computers it infected he suspects antonio is being targeted by the police who want to pretend theyve made an important cyberbust and by an antivirus company seeking publicity artificial life can spin out of controland when it does it can take real life with it antonio says he did not actually intend to release his worm at all the worm spreads by scanning computers for the blaster vulnerability then sending a copy of itself to any open target antonio maintains he thought he was playing it safe because his computer was not directly connected to the internet his roommates computer had the internet connection and a local networka set of cables connecting their computers together allowed antonio to share the signal but what antonio didnt realize he says was that his worm would regard his friends computer as a foreign target it spawned a copy of itself in his friends machine from there it leapfrogged onto the internetand out into the wild his creation had come to life and like frankensteins monster decided upon a path of its own clive thompson lives in new york city he is a contributing writer for the new york times magazine he is also a columnist for the online magazine slate and writes regularly for wired details discover and new york magazine in his spare time he publishes a blog about science and technology coda the thing that surprised me most about the virus scene is how much it was like a scientific society all these teenagers worldwide staying up all night researching new programming techniques then writing long reports they gave away for free just to prove they could bust a hard problem one sixteenyearold in austria showed me a meticulous article hed written on a programming techniqueand it was five thousand words ten times longer than any paper hes required to write for school this is partly why itll likely be impossible for authorities to ever extinguish virus writing thats not for a lack of trying in fact since i published the article two authors of the most virulent worms of have been caught jeffrey lee parsons an american eighteenyearold who released a blaster worm received one and a half years in jail while a german of the same age sven jaschan was charged for releasing the infamous sasser worm new worms are still appearing every weekand now theyre starting to invade mobile phones the next great frontier of internetconnected devices jonathan miles punch drunk love from mens journal the best bar fight i ever witnessed took place in a tiny shitkicky bar in wyoming somewhere along the road between sheridan and gillette outside there was a faint skein of april snow on the ground inside it was hawaiian night the bar was festooned with tropical knickknackery and paper palm trees grass skirts were free for the taking and the ownersa saltymouthed blonde and her motherwere forcing everyone to wear leis including me i was in the company of a canadian poet and a wyoming painter fellow artistsinresidence at a foundation down the highway wed been snowbound for a few weeks and like loggers emerging from a long stint in a lumber camp we were itchy for a bit of fun some hot whiskey some social chainsmoking a smile from a hardfaced girl perhaps a clumsy twostep and maybeyou never knowthe spectacle of a goodnatured latenight fistfight it was a perfect place for all that a singerguitarist with a drum machine mixed merle haggard and joan jett into his sets an old indian in new blue wranglers and a belt buckle the size of a rpm record tore up the dance floor with all seven of the women present with the exception of the ownermother who chose to dance solo with an oversize chefs knife raised above her head as if baiting criticism or suitors or both besides us the only other nonlocals in the bar were three itinerant sheepshearers from new zealandtwo drunk louts and a girl i got the full story only later allegedly one of the kiwi sheepshearersa short stout vinegary guytook to throwing roasted peanuts at the head of a local boy one peanut after the other the local boy had some tragic namei swear everyone pronounced it art fart though it must surely have been art vart in any case skinny art fartclad in a grass skirt with an impromptu bikini top made from coconut shells and twine over his shirt finally tired of being pelted with bar peanuts said words to that effect to the kiwi sheepshearer who was also i should note wearing a grass skirt and like that the fight was on smart money was on the kiwi hed started it had some solid farm muscle on him appeared to have piss for brains and unlike art fart wasnt sporting coconut titties but chalk one up for the us of a after the typical cussandshove windup art fart threw a lankyarmed punch that sent the kiwi buckling to the floor hula skirt and all there may have been some subsequent tusslinga crowd swiftly circled them blocking my viewbut the decisive blow had been struck the fight officially ended as i recall when the salty blonde charged from behind the bar with a pistol though i wouldnt swear to that in a court of law maybe she just threatened gunplay we have to get out of here said my poet companion with a smile i refused and there in that bar as the kiwis hustled their frothy countryman outside and into the giant rv that was their home during sheepshearing season and as art fart ordered a victory round i tried to explain to him knuckleheadedly what im about to attempt to explain just as knuckleheadedly to you the spectacle of a good bar fight properly executed and healthily ended is not merely annoying boorishness the best of theman admittedly minor sliceare shaded with the elements of high art think ballet with its orchestrated stepwork and opera with its epic heartonthesleeve passions or any kind of gladiatorial drama naturally these overlofty comparisons apply to boxing matches and runofthemill fistfights too but the bar fight has a sublimity all its own because its fueled by alcohol its usually a rank amateurs game with all the unpredictability this implies and unlike boxing and most angry fistfights its sometimes lacquered with a gloss of comedy flying peanuts grass skirtsthat sort of thing for millennia saloons have served as comfortable petri dishes for sex and violence i am either too honest or too unsophisticated to suggest that one can exist without the other there is a mammalian side to all of us on occasion it rears its head snarls makes a mess acts the fool howls at the moon gives or gets a black eye before we get rolling here though i feel it necessary to clarify my terms and to set a few ground rules when i say bar fight i mean this oneonone handtohand combat that occurs inside a saloon or just outside its door except in those rare instances when a life is at stake weapons have absolutely no place in a proper bar fight in short no knives chairs bottles derringers swords or mounted billfish a possible urban myth i once heard in australia had a man attacking another with a marlin yanked off the wall and absolutely no throwing opponents through plateglass windows lets call this last one the charles barkley rule to dishonor barkleys throwing of a man through the window of an orlando bar in after the man had thrown a glass of ice at the nba star its hard not to secretly admire barkley however for his reply when asked if he had any regrets i regret he said that we werent on a higher floor a proper bar fight pits one man or womanbut wow are those fights scary against another with the only outside involvement coming from pals or patrons attempting to stop the fight holding a guy down while your friend pummels him is evil bullshit pummeling a guy while your friend holds him down is evil bullshit squared the proper bar fight ends quickly though there are exceptions like john waynes epic brawl in the quiet manbut then thats a movie but when its over its over injuriesbroken noses fingers hands ribs and jaws along with assorted bruises and the famed cauliflower earare an obvious and common consequence but their seriousness should never be dismissed the rallying cry that a friend reported hearing a fighter bellow in a tennessee roadhousecmon ill cripple yeis okay to utter but forbidden to enact the casualties in barroom fights are staggering william burroughs wrote in naked lunch and its true type bar fight into google and the results are sobering bar fight leaves dead in guatemala student dies trying to stop bar fight bar fight ends in stabbing outside local club five men shot after bar fight in michigan for the record these grim variations and extensions fall far outside this essays beery scope however faint and friable it may be i prefer to maintain a line in the sand between behavior that is merely bad and that which is sociopathic the history of bar fighting is as far as i can discern almost wholly undocumented though a few historical tidbits can be found glittering amid the archival dust the origins of the phrase the real mccoy for instance are said perhaps apocryphally to be traceable to a turnofthecentury saloon fight as the story goes an obnoxious drunk accused thenwelterweight boxing champ norman selby aka kid mccoy of being a fraud mccoy inventor of the notorious corkscrew punch that muhammad ali later claimed as his own promptly and definitively beat the stuffing out of his accuser who weakly admitted as he clambered back upright that hed been laid out by the real mccoy without bar fights too the history of the american west would be one very long episode of little house on the prairie one of the enduring western myths is that gunfights were staged quite formally as cowpoke variations on european duels more often if not always they were standardissue saloon brawls that spilled out onto the street and resulted in the snapcracklepop of gunfire beyond that however the history of bar fighting remains locked among the men young and old who trade their smoky stories in private twisting the fights origins and outcomes to suit their egos andor bleary memories the guys who get beat up always deny they started anything an exbouncer from maine told me and if they got beat up by two guys its ten in the retelling despite this hazy history however i think its fair to make a few assumptions the first is that the original bar fight surely happened within hours or days of the appearance of the first bar the scientific basis for this will be explored shortly the second is that no culture in which alcohol is publicly served is immune to them even tibetan buddhistswidely if perhaps inaccurately considered to be more violenceaverse than we hayseed americanshave their share of bar brawls in tibets kham province fights between tibetan and chinese drinkers are said to be commonplace several years ago in the tibetan capital of lhasa a fingernail discovered in a dish in a chinese restaurant sparked a giant brawl during which wine bottles were hurled at policemen trying to restore order stray fingernails are not typically fuel for fights in the united states but then we do not suffer from the sorts of geopolitical tensions that would cause one to suspect a restaurant of serving human flesh in a similar vein we are also not prone to bar fights caused by soccer club rivalries as in europe though college football rivalries seem to take up a little of that slack suffice it to say that bar fights are not a product of globalization when it comes to latenight scraps we are the world the third assumption is that the unwritten chronicle of bar fights features a cast of mostly men though women of a certain flinty temperament are also prone to bar fighting in my lifetime ive witnessed two girlongirl brawls and both scared the bejesus out of me girls are not indoctrinated by pop culture or society with the vague code of fighting that usuallyand i stress the word usuallykeeps boys from pulling hair or gouging eyes the term catfight is popularly applied to these fights and its an apt analogy as with battling cats there is rarely anything you can do to stop these fights and its best from my experience to simply run for cover when one breaks out this isnt to suggest that such fights arent worth witnessing if youre accustomed to ladies of a genteel sort theres a worldupsidedown element to them and they can sometimes have the frightening appeal of shark week on the discovery channel im told that many men take pleasure in the spectacle of females fighting though this fetish falls outside my sphere of kinks some overly redblooded men also get turned on by car wrecks or christina aguilera disaster i guess can have a certain pervy allure young men are the predominant combatants in any saloon fight since the tempers of older men take much longer to come to a boil regarding alcohol and youth plato warned it is wrong to add fire to fire tim sylvia the former heavyweight champ of the ultimate fighting championship league told me that he used to pick fights in maine bars when he was nineteen or twenty just to prove my masculinity young men feel they have much to prove older men as a very general rule tend to feel more comfortable in their skins this is not to suggest however that old men are immune to beer tempers many years ago in a deep south beer joint a whitehaired man of about seventy threatened to kick my ass because he suspected i was a beer spy the full story emerged after id denied the charge and was able to calm him down he claimed hed found a condom floating in a capped bottle of budweiser hed notified anheuserbusch he said and theyd agreed to ship him a free case of bud if he would just send them back the bottle in question i told em thatd be fine so long as either mr anheuser or mr busch called me to apologize he said and lookit i told em theyd have to call me at night because i aint about to sit by the phone all damn day because id been alone at the bar scribbling away at some piece of writing or other hed assumed i was a spy dispatched by anheuserbusch to find and reclaim that dread bottle im not sure what i would have done if the old man had actually attacked mehard to envision a happy outcome there in the end though he apologized and fetched me some homegrown beefsteak tomatoes from his truck which to this day are the best tomatoes ive ever eaten if you ask a bartender the cause of a justfought brawl during that excited hush that settles upon a saloon in the moments after the combatants have been tossed chances are hell answer they were just drunk and chances are hell be right bartenders ive found usually are the science behind this is rather simple by depressing the central nervous system alcohol acts as a disinhibitor making us feel more freewheeling and incautious this is why after four of five drinks you have the courage to approach the laughing blonde in the dizzyingly seethrough blouse but also why you might feel sturdy enough to take on the sixfootsix meathead who wont stop wagging his tongue through his fingers at your girlfriend we call that beer muscles says sylvia the ufc champ recent scientific research has added an interesting wrinkle to the alcoholviolence connection according to a study published in the january issue of the medical journal alcoholism clinical and experimental research acute administration of alcohol can induce a rapid increase in testosteronefour times the normal amount in some casesin the brains of rodents the implications for human behavioral and endocrine pathology seem clear the more you drink the more your social inhibitions dissolve but also the more your testosterone amountsthe dipstick level of your cojones so to speakmay rise a chalkboard equation then might look something like this choh ethyl alcohol negative inhibitor neurotransmitter abilities x testosterone levels popeye on a shore leave bender giving bluto a big black shiner for goosing olive oyls skinny little rump argh argh argh scientific evidence notwithstanding that bartender would be only half right if mere drunkenness were the cause of barroom brawls happy hour at tgi fridays would be the most dangerous sixty minutes on the planet youd have to step over bodies just to order a tom collins if you liken a bar fight to say an exploding can of gasoline then bloodstream alcohol is surely the gasoline theres no disputing that but for every such explosion theres a spark that makes it go boom as seneca wrote drunkenness does not create vice it merely brings it into view whats the most common spark to answer that we have to first divide bar fights into two distinct categories one well call psycho fights plainly put these are fights that happen because someone in a saloon is a psychotic asshole and they include fights prompted by outoftheblue utterances like whatthefuckyoulookinat or yougotaproblemwithme psycho fights dont actually require a cause the presence of the psycho is cause enough a lot of guys go out looking for fights says sylvia theyre pissed off at something their wife or girlfriend did or about something that happened at work when that guy is looking for a fight he cant be talked out of it bullies are bullies and theyre always uninteresting our interest here lies more in the causes of the second category of bar fights which i hesitate to call rational fights since of course no violence is rational especially after seven coors lights and two shots of cuervo lets just call them nonpsycho fights in order to gauge the top three causes of nonpsycho fights i surveyed a wide swath of bartenders barflies bouncers lawmen and other folks with some connection to saloon life some of the answers were too local for my purposes him one upstate new york bartender said cocking a thumb at a surly solo drinker while others like the topthree list i received from a retired mississippi lawman had a ring of poetry to them women property lines and dogs the other list that could double as a country music album title went like this drunks women and drunk women fully tabulated nonetheless my survey results broke down as follows cause number one women who are present in the bar cause number two women who are not present but vividly remembered cause number three old grudges that dont officially involve women but might involve them if you scratch down deep enough cause one includes acts of chivalryprotecting a womans safety or honorbut also encompasses acts of rabid jealousy eg pummeling your exgirlfriends date cause two is so closely related to cause one that an argument could be made to merge them but there is a distinction in the first case the fights start suddenly with the attacks unplanned a lout insults your date you take a swing your ex strolls in with a bumblefuck insurance salesman you take a swing or conversely you an insurance salesman but certainly no bumblefuck walk into a bar with a hot divorcee on your arm only to find yourself suckerpunched by her redeyed ex but cause two produces a slightly different kind of fight one generated by unhealed romantic wounds by conflicts that have simmered for a while to the unschooled observer a fight that breaks out in a bar because some guy took offense at the song another guy played on the jukebox might seem random and ridiculous if youd known that the guy who played the song had stolen the other guys girlfriend a halfdecade before and that the song hed played was the aerosmith ballad that had been on the radio when the poor fella first unsnapped her bra that night by the lake it might make more sense the season of love is that of battle darwin wrote the roots of these fights run deep which leads us smoothly into cause three old grudges you see this less in big cities than you do in small towns where the tight confines of the county limits mean that youre forced to come facetoface on a regular basis with the dickhead who fouled you in that high school district finals game way back when a foul that though the referee didnt call it caused you to a miss the gamewinning shot b lose your chances for a college scholarship c lose your cheerleader girlfriend and d go to work for your father at the grain mill and marry ol brenda who got fat as a house after the kids were born and never does nothing but watch dr phil and complain about the way your boots smell years later that same dickhead beats you in a casual game of pool and its all too much to take you snap pool tables by the way were a popular survey answer notable alsorans included politics athletic allegiances and yep jukeboxes not long ago at the dunes saloon in michigans upper peninsula i ran into the novelist jim harrison who offered me this theory most bar fights can be traced back to someones dog getting shot twenty years before some urbanites among you might cry bullshitits difficult though amusing to imagine two fellows tussling over a dead bird dog in manhattans clubbut i can attest to its limited accuracy several years back in mississippi a man shot and killed my german shorthair pointerlong story not worth rehashing but if i ever come across that bastard in a saloonwell i swear ill knock him halfway to next tuesday i have warned my wife and lawyer of this pledge along with the owner of the bar where this knocking is most likely to occur none of them approves but the bar owner is a dog lover so i suspect hell overlook any damages a dirty truth most bar fights are just noisy nonevents the average barroom brawl lasts about two to five seconds according to peyton quinn a former bouncer in problem bars who now operates rocky mountain combat applications training in lake george colorado where he instructs bouncers and other security types in the finer points of fistfighting literally its the school of hard knocks bar fights are generally very sloppy affairs says quinn once that adrenaline rush hits people tend to lose fine motor control and just flail at each otheroften ineffectually ufc champ sylvia seconds that judgment in bar fights you dont see strategic fighting at all he says just a lot of haymaking usually the guy who gets in the first punch is the winner the typical bar fight then can be easily choreographed its a sucker punch that may or may not be followed by a second punch but rarely a third a number of fights go quickly to the floor and become dusty wrestling matches this often happens when the victim of a sucker punch dazed and weakened tries to ward off any further blows by tackling his opponent punches thrown in close quarters dont have much oomph to them so the tackler attempts to give himself a respite via sloppy grappling this isnt a recommended tack however personally i hate to fight on the ground quinn wrote in a bouncers guide to barroom brawling his primer on bar fighting for one thing if a guy has any buddies or you have some enemies around they will often start kicking your head and ribs while youre on the floor and otherwise preoccupied by and large however bar fights are settled by a single punch one angry whap to the head that defines and decides the evening which is not to suggest of course that there arent variations smart bar fighters says sylvia hit their opponents smack in the nuts best place to strike he counsels goofy types who are destined to fail attempt intricate martialarts moves something quinn strenuously discourages some guys pull hair and bite mike tysons chomping of evander holyfields ear may have been a freakish anomaly in the boxing ring but in a particularly rabid bar fight cest la vie i might also add two intriguing variants on bar fighting tactics that ive come across in my readings during americas frontier days a noteworthy fighting technique was to get your opponents bottom lip between your thumb and fingers and then yank it down like a stuck window shade halfsevering the lip from the face this is obviously an abomination and has no place here except as a gruesome point of interest a description of the other tactic appears in raleigh trevelyans recent biography of sir walter raleigh as a young rakehell raleigh grew tired of a bold impertinent fellow in a tavern and after popping him one sealed up his mustache and beard with wax to my mind this facialhair waxing clearly violates bar fight decorum but it is kind of funny i like to think that i was once involved in the perfect bar fight this was about eight years ago in mississippi back when i was spending nine or ten hours a day in a secondstory saloon on the town square a time in my life for which i bear a certain hungover nostalgia my opponent in this case was my best drinking pal a longhaired south carolinian a year or two my junior the cause of the fight was naturally a womanin this case one present in the bar for a while shed been my girlfriend and then she wasnt a change in status that i seemed unable to reconcile in my head no one else had much liked her and the judgment of pals was that by splitting with her id escaped a grim futurea judgment endorsed adamantly by the south carolinian yet i was drunk moony unsure secondguessing my fate as old tom waits songs crackled on the bars hifi an hour shy of last call the ex approached me in the bar and forgive me i thought this might be my one thumphearted chance to woo her back thats when the south carolinian appeared butting into the conversation in a way that i might liken to a circus clown crashing a middle east peace conference scram i told him he scrunched up his face and made nonsensical noises the exgirlfriend whod long lamented my lack of maturity as well as my choice in friends rolled her eyes and made motions to leave i mean it i told him he crossed his eyes and stuck his tongue out to one side i grabbed him by the neck he grabbed me by the neck we began throttling each other muttering mean curses no punchesjust throttling growling bared teeth i dont recollect how long this went on but at some point we looked up simultaneously to see the entire bar population frozen in a baffled stare watching us choking each other and the ex nowhere to be seen we looked at each other sighed shrugged dropped our chokeholds took two stools at the bar and bought each other beers weve pledged to finish that fight and perhaps someday we will in the meantime though we drink in peace jonathan miles is a contributing editor to mens journal and field stream and writes regularly for the new york times book review his work has twice been included in the best american sports writing anthologies a longtime resident of oxford mississippi he now lives in warwick new york and is at work on a novel coda this essay was actually assigned as punishment for punching a mens journal editor at a staff party at an east village saloonthe magazine journalism equivalent i suppose of having to write i will not punch my editors one hundred times on the blackboard i wont bore you with the details of the scuffle though i will note the following a tequila was involved and b truth to tell the editor had it coming let me add that this is strenuously unusual behavior for me i am a happy drinker more prone to sloppy hugs than frothy fistthrowing but again when you mix tequila with a blowhard editor things can sometimes fall apart my starkest memory of the evening is the sound of the locks clicking shut on the door after id been ejected from the bar they seemed to go on forever as a fresh transplant to new york from the south i didnt know a door could have that many locks naturally there were consequences for one thing i had to write this essay bad behavior has always fascinated me though the subject of bar brawling arrived with its own set of difficulties the line between bad behavior and sociopathic behavior in this case is terribly thin i have zero interest in the kinds of fights bullies engage in to puff up their frail sense of machismo thats just violence for violences sake and it happens all too frequently and odiously around the world what interested me instead were the kinds of amateur bar fights ignited by overdoses of passion plus liquor that is to say bar fights fought by otherwise reasonable or semireasonable people for concrete or semiconcrete reasons broken hearts political differences grudges and slights that sort of thing obviousness aside i wondered why does liquorand a bar settingprompt people to violence what exactly causes people to snap and why do so many of them rip off their shirts before fighting as to my essays happy presence in these pages i must confess that it rarely occurred to me to think of bar fightingat least of the amateur one or twopunch black eyeresulting variety i tried to focus onas a crime though i suppose it certainly is the ideal bar fight should be quick and for the most part painless enough to never require police attention but true its assault and battery no matter how loose and saggy the punches im reminded of the time ten years or so ago when i was fired as a reporter for a small mississippi daily for listing a mans legendary bootlegging past in his obituary huffily the publisher informed me that the paper was not in the habit of noting peoples crimes in their obituary but bootlegging isnt a crime i protested its aservice i believe my newspapering career ended at that very precise moment i no longer touch tequila by the way a pal of mine smartly calls it felony juice nor do i punch people i am however still inexorably drawn to saloons where folks do both as they say one thing at a time lawrence wright the terror web from the new yorker for much of spains modern history the organization that has defined its experience with terror is eta which stands for euzkadi ta azkatasuna basque homeland and liberty eta which was founded in has a clear political goal it wants to set up a separate nation comprising the basque provinces in northern spain and parts of southern france although eta has killed some eight hundred people it has developed a reputation for targeting almost exclusively politicians security officials and journalists over the years the terrorists and the spanish police have come to a rough understanding about the rules of engagement they dont commit attacks on the working class and they always call us before an explosion telling us where the bomb is situated an intelligence official in the spanish national police told me recently in madrid if they place a bomb in a backpack on a train there will be a cassette tape saying this bag is going to explode please leave the train and so on march when the first reports arrived of mass casualties resulting from explosions on commuter trains spanish intelligence officials assumed that eta had made an appalling mistake at am as a train was about to enter madrids atocha station three bombs blasted open the steel cars sending body parts through the windows of nearby apartments the station is in madrids center a few blocks from the prado museum within seconds four bombs exploded on another train five hundred and fifty yards from the station the bombs killed nearly a hundred people had the explosions occurred when the trains were inside the station the fatalities might have tallied in the thousands a quarter of a million people pass through atocha every workday the trains at that hour were filled with students and young office workers who live in public housing and in modest apartment complexes east of the city many were immigrants who had been drawn by the spanish economic boom as emergency crews rushed to the scene two more bombs demolished a train at the el pozo del tio raimundo station three miles away by then jose maria aznar the prime minister had learned of the attacks which were taking place at the end of an uneventful political campaign the conservative popular party which aznar headed was leading the socialists by four and a half points in the polls despite the overwhelming opposition of the spanish population to the countrys participation in the war in iraq it was thursday morning the election would take place on sunday at am one minute after the el pozo bomb a final bomb went off on a train at the suburban santa eugenia station emergency workers arrived to find mangled bodies littering the tracks the spanish had never seen anything like thisthe worst eta atrocity in killed twentyone shoppers in a barcelona grocery store at santa eugenia there were so many wounded that rescue crews ripped up the benches in the waiting area to use as stretchers in all there were a hundred and ninetyone fatalities and sixteen hundred injuries it was the most devastating act of terrorism in european history except for the bombing of pan am flight over lockerbie scotland aznar who survived an eta car bomb in had made the elimination of the group his biggest priority his security forces had decimated etas ranks but they were aware that remnants of the organization were attempting to stage a retaliatory attack in madrid the previous christmas eve police had arrested two eta commanders who had planted backpack bombs on trains and in february the civil guard intercepted an eta van that was headed to the capital carrying eleven hundred pounds of explosives a top spanish police official a political appointee told me that authorities had planned a major strike against eta for march the last official day of campaigning such a blow might have boosted aznars party at the polls eta however had seemingly struck first at am police in alcala de henares received a call from a witness who pointed them to a boxy white renault van that had been left that morning at the train station at the beginning we didnt pay too much attention to it an investigator told me then we saw that the license plate didnt correspond to the van even that clue though struck a false note when eta operatives steal a car they match it with license plates from the same model car it had been years since eta had made such an elementary mistake the lack of warning the many casualties the proletarian background of many of the victims and etas quick disavowal of the crime all suggested that there was reason to question the assignment of blame the police no longer considered eta capable of carrying off such an elaborate attack moreover the telephones of known eta collaborators were bugged the bad guys were calling each other saying was it us its craziness a senior intelligence official said that afternoon detectives looked more carefully at the white van they collected fingerprints and under the passenger seat they found a plastic bag with seven detonators matching the type used in the bombings there were cigarette butts a womans wig and a placido domingo cassette in the tape player was a different recordingit bore arabic inscriptions and turned out to be koranic recitations for religious novices by that time police had learned that the explosive used in the bombings was goma which eta no longer used we told the government that there was something odd that it was possibly not eta the intelligence official told me that evening however aznar called the editors of spains newspapers eta is behind the attacks he assured them then he called jose luis rodriguez zapatero his socialist opponent to tell him about the van with the arabic tape at the same time he insisted that there is no doubt who did the attacks the case broke open in the middle of the night when a young police officer sorting through belongings recovered from the trains opened a sports bag and discovered twentytwo pounds of goma surrounded by nails and screws two wires ran from a blue mobile phone to a detonator it wasnt clear why the bomb had failed to explode police officers realized that a chip inside the phone would contain a record of recently dialed numbers by tracing these calls they were quickly able to map out a network of young arab immigrants many of whom were known to spanish intelligence data stored on the chip revealed that a calling plan had been set up at a small telephone and copy shop in lavapies a workingclass neighborhood near the atocha station the store was owned by jamal zougam a moroccan who had previously been under surveillance because of alleged connections to al qaeda he was soon arrested information began leaking to the public about the direction of the investigation by friday afternoon demonstrators were standing in front of the atocha station holding signs that linked the tragedy to the war in iraq it was clear that the election would swing on the question of whether islamists or eta terrorists were responsible for the bombings that day the interior minister angel acebes insisted publicly that eta was the prime suspecteven trough the police were now certain that eta was not directly involved at twilight some eleven million spaniards assembled around the country to protest the violence in rainy madrid the umbrellas stretched for miles down the paseo del prado the anger and grief of the marchers were compounded by confusion about the investigation i walked with a million people in madrids streets diego lopez garrido a socialist deputy in the spanish congress told me many people were saying who is the author of these attacks and they wondered why is the government lying to us the day of the bombings analysts at the forsvarets forskningsinstitutt a norwegian think tank near oslo retrieved a document that they had noticed on an islamist web site the previous december at the time the document had not made a big impression but now in light of the events in madrid it read like a terrorist road map titled jihadi iraq hopes and dangers it had been prepared by a previously unknown entity called the media committee for the victory of the iraqi people mujahideen services center the document which is fortytwo pages long and appears to be the work of several anonymous authors begins with the proposition that although coalition forces in iraq led by america could not be defeated by a guerrilla insurgency individual partners of the coalition could be persuaded to depart leaving america more vulnerable and discouraged as casualties increased and the expenses became insupportable three countriesbritain spain and polandformed the european backbone of the coalition poland appeared to be the most resolute because the populace largely agreed with the governments decision to enter iraq in britain the war was generally deplored before the war in february about a million people went out on a huge march filling the streets of london the document notes this was the biggest march of political protest in the history of britain but the authors suggest that the british would not withdraw unless the casualty count sharply increased spain however presented a striking opportunity the war was almost universally unpopular aznar had plunged his country into iraq without seeking a consensus unlike other coalition leaders if the disparity between the government and the people were at the same percentage rate in britain then the blair government would fall the author of this section observes the reason aznar had not yet been ousted the author claims was that spain is an immature democracy and does not have a firm tradition of holding its rulers accountable rightwing spanish voters also tended to be more loyal and organized than their leftist counterparts moreover the number of spanish casualties in iraq was less than a dozen in order to force the spanish government to withdrawn from iraq the resistance should deal painful blows to its forces the writer proposes it is necessary to make utmost use of the upcoming general election in spain in march next year we think that the spanish government could not tolerate more than two maximum three blows after which it will have to withdraw as a result of popular pressure if its troops still remain in iraq after these blows the victory of the socialist party is almost secured and the withdrawal of the spanish forces will be on its electoral program once spain pulled out of iraq the author theorizes the pressure on tony blair the british prime minister to do the same might be unbearable and hence the domino tiles would fall quickly the document specifies that the attacks would be aimed at spanish forces within iraqthere is no call for action in spain nonetheless the authors reading of the western political calendar struck the norwegian researchers as particularly keen the relation between the text and the bombings is unclear thomas hegghammer a researcher at forsvarets forskningsinstitutt told me but without the text we would still be asking is this a coincidence that day hegghammer forwarded a copy of the document to haizam amirah fernandez a colleague at madrids real instituto elcano amirah was shocked until now the announced goals of al qaeda had been mainly parochial directed at purging the islamic world especially saudi arabia of western influences overturning the established arabic governments and restoring the clerical rule of the ancient caliphate and purifying islam by returning it to the idealized time of the prophet in an audiotape aired on the arabic satellite channel al jazeera in february osama bin laden the leader of al qaeda had identified jordan morocco nigeria pakistan saudi arabia and yemen as the most qualified regions for liberation iraq was notably absent from his list and yet he offered no political platformno plan for instance for governing saudi arabia on the morning after the revolution as for the rest of the world bin ladens goals seemed to be motivated mainly by revenge in he had decreed that it was the duty of every muslim to kill americans and their allies the spectacular violence that characterized al qaedas attacks was not a means to a goalit was the goal success was measured by the body count not by political change the internet document suggested that a new intelligence was at work a rationality not seen in al qaeda documents before the mujahideen services center whatever that was appeared to operate as a kind of islamist think tank the person who put together those chapters had a clear strategic vision realistic and well thought out amirah says he told hegghammer this is political science applied to jihad although the document was posted on the internet in december the authors note that a draft had been written in september in october assassins shot a spanish military attache in iraq jose antonio bernal gomez near his residence in november seven spanish intelligence agents were ambushed and murdered south of baghdad photographs of the killers standing on the agents bodies circulated on islamist web sites another internet document soon appeared titled message to the spanish people signed by the information commission for the help of the iraqi people department of foreign propaganda which threatened more attacks return to your country and live peacefully it demands or else the battalions of the iraqi resistance and its supporters outside of iraq are able to increase the dosage and will eclipse your memory of the rotten spies variations in the arabic transcriptions of english words in the jihadi iraq document suggested to amirah that writers of various nationalities had drafted it for instance in some cases the t in tony blairs name was transcribed with the arabic tabut in the section about spain the author used the dha which is more typical of the moroccan dialect also characteristic of morocco is the use of arabic numerals the style used in the west in place of the numbering system that is common from egypt to the persian gulf those clues plus certain particularly moroccan political concerns expressed in the document such as the independence movement in western sahara suggested that at least some of the authors were diaspora moroccans probably living in spain the link between the internet document and the bombings soon became clearer there is a reference early in the document to abu dujana a companion of the prophet who was known for his ferocity in battle his name had been invoked by other jihadis notably in the suicide bombings at the j w marriott hotel in jakarta in august on saturday evening a television station in madrid received a call from a man speaking spanish with a moroccan accent who said that a videotape had been placed in a trash bin near the citys main mosque we declare our responsibility for what has occurred in madrid exactly two and a half years after the attacks on new york and washington a masked speaker on the videotape said he identified himself as abu dujan alafghani the military spokesman for al qaeda in europe he continued it is a response to your collaboration with the criminal bush and his allies you love life and we love death which gives an example of what the prophet muhammad said if you dont stop your injustices more and more blood will flow until this tape appeared even those investigators who were arguing that the train bombings were perpetrated by islamic terrorists not eta had been troubled by the fact that there were no martyrs in the attacks it is a trademark of al qaeda to sacrifice its killers this practice has provided a scanty moral cover for what would otherwise be seen simply as mass murder but when the investigators saw that the man calling himself abu dujan alafghani was dressed in white funeral robes they realized that suicide was on the horizon the al qaeda cell in spain is old and well established mohamed atta the commander of the september attacks came to spain twice in the second time was in july for a meeting in the coastal resort of salou which appears to have been arranged as a final goahead for the attacks after september spanish police estimated that there were three hundred islamic radicals in the country who might be affiliated with al qaeda even before then members of the spanish cell had been monitored by police agencies as is evident from the abundant use of wiretaps and surveillance information in indictments that were issued in november when eleven suspects were charged with being al qaeda membersthe first of several terrorist roundups and yet according to spanish police officials at the time of the madrid attacks there was not a single arabicspeaking intelligence agent in the country al qaeda was simply not seen as a threat to spain we never believed we were a real target a senior police official said thats the reality at four oclock on saturday afternoon sixty hours after the attacks and the day before the elections interior minister acebes announced the arrest of jamal zougam and two other moroccans still he continued to point at eta but by now the socialists were publicly accusing the government of lying about the investigation in order to stay in power polls opened the next morning at nine thirtyfive million people voted more than percent of the electorate percent more than expected many were young firsttime voters and their votes put the socialists over the top as jose luis rodriguez zapatero declared victory he again condemned the war in iraq and reiterated his intention to withdraw troops four days later the abu hafs almasri brigades a group claiming affiliation with al qaeda sent a bombastic message to the london newspaper alquds alarabi avowing responsibility for the train bombings whose turn will it be next the authors taunt is it japan america italy britain saudi arabia or australia the message also addressed the speculation that the terrorists would try to replicate their political success in spain by disrupting the november us elections we are very keen that bush does not lose the upcoming elections the authors write bushs idiocy and religious fanaticism are useful the authors contend for they stir the islamic world to action on april two weeks after the election a security guard for the ave spains highspeed train line discovered a blue plastic bag beside the tracks forty miles south of madrid inside the bag were twentysix pounds of goma four hundred and fifty feet of cable had been draped across the security fence and attached incorrectly to the detonator had the bomb gone off when the ave passed byat a hundred and eighty mph carrying twelve hundred passengers the results could have been far more catastrophic than those of march spanish citizens asked themselves if the bombings of march had accomplished the goals set by al qaeda what was the point of april gustavo de aristegui is one of the leaders of the popular party in spains basque country for years he represented donostiosan sebastian the regions capital in the spanish congress a lawyer and former diplomat aristegui has been preoccupied for many years with the rise of islamic terror his father was spains ambassador to lebanon and was killed in beirut in when syrian forces shelled his diplomatic residence al qaeda has four different networks aristegui told me in madrid the day after the socialists took power first there is the original network the one that committed which uses its own resources and people it has recruited and trained then there is the adhoc terrorist network consisting of franchise organizations that al qaeda createdoften to replace ones that werent bloody enough in countries such as the philippines jordan and algeria the third network aristegui said is more subtle a strategic union of likeminded companies since february when osama bin laden announced the creation of the world islamic front for jihad against crusaders and jewsan umbrella organization for islamist groups from morocco to chinaal qaeda has expanded its dominion by making alliances and offering funds hamas is in or almost in aristegui said bin laden is trying to tempt hezbollah to join but they are shia and many sunnis are opposed to them finally there is the fourth networkimitators emulators who are ideologically aligned with al qaeda but are less tied to it financially these are the ones who committed madrid aristegui said until the madrid attacks the al qaeda operationsin dhahran nairobi dar es salaam aden new york washington jerba karachi bali mombasa riyadh casablanca jakarta and istanbul had been political failures these massacres committed in the name of jihad had achieved little except anger grief and the deaths of thousands soon after september al qaeda lost its base in afghanistan and along with that its singular role in the coordination of international terror new groups such as the bombers in madrid were acting in the name of al qaeda and although they may well have had the blessings of its leaders they did not have the training resources or international contacts that had bolstered the previous generation of terrorists some operations such as the attack on western compounds in riyadh which killed mainly muslims were such fiascos that it appeared that al qaeda was no longer able to exercise control al qaeda is not a hierarchical organization and never was marc sageman a psychiatrist a former cia case officer and the author of understandingterror networks told me it was always a social movement the latest converts to the cause didnt train in afghanistan and they approach jihad differently these local guys are reckless and less well trained but they are willing to kill themselves whereas the previous leaders were not sageman said moreover as the spanish attacks showed the new generation was more interested in committing violence for the sake of immediate political gain the kind of shortterm tactical thinking displayed in the jihadi iraq document and the march bombings is decidedly out of step with al qaedas traditional world view in which history is seen as an endless struggle between believers and infidels it is the mindset of fundamentalists of all religions this war is eternal and is never finally won until the longedfor day of judgment in this contest the first goal is to provoke conflict bold violent deeds draw the lines and arouse ancient resentments and are useful even if they have unsought consequences polarization is to be encouraged radical simplicity being essential for religious warfare an al qaeda statement posted on the internet after the march bombings declared being targeted by an enemy is what will wake us from our slumber seen in this light terrorism plays a sacramental role dramatizing a religious conflict by giving it an apocalyptic backdrop and madrid was just another step in the relentless march of radical islam against the modern secular world had the madrid cell rested on its accomplishment after march al qaeda would properly be seen as an organization now being guided by political strategistsas an entity closer in spirit to eta with clear tactical objectives april throws doubt on that perspective there was little to be gained politically from striking an opponent who was complying with the stated demand the government had agreed to withdraw troops from iraq if the point was merely humiliation or revenge then april makes more sense the terrorists wanted more blood even if a second attack backfired politically the socialists could hardly continue to follow the terrorist agenda with a thousand new corpses along the tracks april is comprehensible only if the real goal of the bombers was not iraq but spain where the islamic empire began its retreat five hundred years ago spain is a target because we are the historic turning point aristegui said after this they are going to try to hit rome london paris and the united states harder than they did before juan aviles a history professor at madrids autonomous university and an adviser to the civil guard told me from our western point of view it doesnt make sense that the killings of atocha are meaningless in spain we expect eta to behave in certain ways with al qaeda the real dimensions of the threat are not known and that produces uneasiness in the weeks after the march attacks spanish police combed the immigrant neighborhoods outside madrid carrying photographs of suspects we didnt have them perfectly located but we knew they were in leganes a police official told me leganes is a bland suburb of fivestory red brick apartment complexes the wide streets are lined with evenly spaced adolescent oaks in the mornings the sidewalks are full of commuters rushing for the trains then the place is vacant except for grandmothers and strollers in the evenings the commuters return and close their doors at three oclock on the afternoon of april the day after the discovery of the bomb on the ave tracks police approached an apartment building on calle carmen martin gaite they saw a young moroccan man with a baseball cap on backward who was taking out trash he yelled something in arabic then ran away at an impressive pace he turned out to be a track champion the police did not catch him and he remains at large a moment later voices cried out allabu akhbar and machinegun fire from the second floor of the apartment house raked the street scattering the cops over the next few hours the police tactical unit grupo especial de operaciones evacuated the residents of nearby apartments tanks and helicopters moved in and the siege of leganes began inside the apartment were seven young men most of them were moroccan immigrants who had come to europe seeking economic opportunity they had gone through a period of becoming westernizedthat is to say they had been drinkers drug dealers womanizers they hung out in cybercafes they folded into the ethnic mix of urban madrid but they also lived in the european underground of islamic radicalism whose members were recruited more often in prison than in the training camps of afghanistan their leader was sarhane ben abdelmajid fakhet who was thirtyfive years old and had a round fleshy face and a patchy beard he was a realestate agent who had come to madrid eight years earlier on a scholarship to study economics his boss told the spanish press that fakhet was a wonderful salesman who held the record for the number of apartments sold in a month yet he did not talk to his coworkers or make friends with other spaniards he remained sequestered in his muslim world he was very soft and well educated moneir mahmoud aly elmessery the imam at the principal mosque in madrid told me the mosquea massive marble structure built with saudi moneyis the center of muslim cultural life in the spanish capital it overlooks the m one of the main freeways feeding into madrid when fakhet was a student he worked in the restaurant that is attached to the mosque and he sometimes came to messerys weekly religion class in the beginning the imam noticed that fakhet spoke familiarly to women as well as to men then for three or four years i sensed that he had some extremist thoughts messery recalled after class fakhet would ask telling questions such as whether the imam believed that the leaders of the arab countries were true believers or if islam authorized the use of force to spread the religion last year he married a sixteenyearold moroccan girl who veiled her face and dressed entirely in black including gloves his performance at work declined and he eventually stopped showing up altogether according to police he attended meetings with a small group of fellow muslims at a barbershop in madrid where the men would drink holy water from mecca police believe that this ritual was aimed at absolving the men of the sin of suicide which is condemned by islam soon after the attacks of september the imam had a dream about fakhet sarhane was in his kitchen cooking on the stove he recalled i saw what he was cooking was a big pot of worms he tried to give me a plate of the food to eat i said no i said please clean the kitchen days later the imam confronted fakhet this is a message from god the imam said to him the kitchen is the thought and the thought is dirty fakhet didnt respond hes a very cold person the imam told me fakhet was not the only young man in the m mosque who had taken a turn toward extremism amer azizi a thirtysixyearold moroccan who was a veteran of jihad in bosnia and afghanistan had been indicted in spain for helping to plan the september attacks he was accused of setting up the july meeting between atta and other conspirators in salou among people who frequented the mosque azizi had the reputation of being a drug addict although he attended some classes on islam along with fakhet in june when the arab countries ambassadors to spain came to the mosque to mourn the death of the syrian dictator hafez alassad azizi insulted them yelling why do you come to pray for an infidel police charge him with being a senior member of al qaeda and the leader of the moroccan islamic combat group which was responsible for five bombings in casablanca in may he fled spain just before his indictment another of fakhets friends was jamal ahmidan a drug dealer who police say financed the march bombings with seventy pounds of hashish messery blamed an islamist cleric in londonabu qatada a radical palestinian from jordan who emigrated to britain as a refugee in after september police in hamburg found eighteen tapes of abu qatadas sermons in mohamed attas apartment there british authorities arrested him in october but he still wields great authority among islamists around the world the imam told me it was as if there were black hands behind a curtain pushing these young men at six oclock in the evening on april three hours after the start of the leganes siege a handwritten fax in arabic signed by abu dujan alafghani arrived at abc a conservative daily in madrid referring to the bomb found beside the ave tracks the day before the author argues that it failed to explode because our objective was only to warn you and show you that we have the power and capacity with the permission of allah to attack you when and how we want the letter demanded that spain withdraw its troops from both iraq and afghanistan by the following sunday otherwise we will turn spain into an inferno and make your blood flow like rivers on the surface the fax represented another turn toward tactical political thinking more likely it was an attempt to salvage a bungled operation outside the leganes apartment the police attempted to negotiate but the cornered terrorists cried out we will die killing phone calls that they made to relatives during the siege confirmed their intentions they also attempted to call abu qatada in londons belmarsh prison apparently seeking a fatwa that would morally sanction their suicide instead of turning off the electricity and waiting them out the police decided to storm the apartment they ordered the terrorists to come out naked and with your hands up one of the occupants responded come in and well talk at pm the police blew the lock on the door and fired tear gas into the room almost immediately an explosion shattered the apartment killing the terrorists and a police officer the blast was so intense that it took days before the authorities could determine how many people had been in the apartment the body of jamal ahmidan was hurled through the walls and into a swimming pool one of the seven bodies still has not been identified in the ruins police found twentytwo pounds of goma and two hundred copper detonators that were similar to those used in the train bombings they also found the shredded remains of a videotape these fragments were painstakingly reassembled to the point where police could view the final statement of fakhet and two other members of the cell which called itself the brigade situated in al andalus unless spanish troops left iraq within a week the men had declared we will continue our jihad until martyrdom in the land of tariq ibn ziyad al andalus is the arabic name for the portion of spain that fell to muslim armies after the invasion by the berber general tariq ibn ziyad in it includes not only the southern region of andalusia but most of the iberian peninsula for the next eight hundred years al andalus remained in islamic hands you know of the spanish crusade against muslims and that not much time has passed since the expulsion from al andalus and the tribunals of the inquisition fakhet says on the tape he is referring to when ferdinand and isabella completed the reconquest of spain forcing jews and muslims to convert to catholicism or leave the iberian peninsula blood for blood he shouts destruction for destruction were these the true goals of al qaeda were the besieged terrorists in leganes simply struggling to get spain out of iraq or were they also battling to regain the lost colonies of islam in other words were these terrorists who might respond to negotiation or appeasement or were they soldiers in a religious fight to the finish that had merely been paused for five hundred years less than a month after osama bin laden and his chief lieutenant dr ayman alzawahiri had appeared on al jazeera we will not accept that the tragedy of al andalus will be repeated in palestine zawahiri said drawing an analogy between the expulsion of the moors from iberia and the presentday plight of the palestinians the use of the archaic name al andalus left most spaniards nonplussed we took it as a folkloric thing ramon perezmaura an editor at abc told me we probably actually laughed this january bin laden issued a message to the muslim people which was broadcast on al jazeera he lamented the decline of the islamic world it is enough to know that the economy of all arab countries is weaker than the economy of one country that had once been part of our world when we used to truly adhere to islam that country is the lost al andalus the muslims who were expelled from al andalus took refuge mainly in morocco algeria and tunisia some families it is said still have the keys to their houses in cordoba and seville but the legacy of al andalus persisted in spain as well up until the victorian era the country was considered to be more a part of the orient than of europe the language the food and the architecture were all deeply influenced by the islamic experiencea rival past that catholic spain in all its splendor could never bury in modern arabic literature al andalus is seen as the lost paradise manuela marin a professor at the consejo superior de investigaciones cientificas in madrid told me for spain the history of al andalus has a totally different meaning after all what we know as spain was made in opposition to the islamic presence on the peninsula only recently have people begun to accept that islam was a part of spain although many spanish historians have painted moorish spain as something other than paradise for jews and christians for muslims it remains not only a symbol of vanished greatness but a kind of alternative vision of islamone in which all the ills of presentday islamic societies are reversed muslim tourists including many heads of state come to spain to imagine a time when islam was at the center of art and learning not on the fringes the alhambra is the number one islamic monument malik a ruiz callejas the emir of the islamic community in spain and the president of granadas new mosque told me recently back when in paris and london people were being eaten alive by rats in cordoba everyone could read and write the civilization of al andalus was probably the most just most unified and most tolerant in history providing the greatest level of security and the highest standard of living imams sometimes invoke the glory of al andalus in friday prayers as a reminder of the price that muslims paid for turning away from the true faith when i asked moneir elmessery of the m mosque if the madrid bombers could have been motivated by the desire to recapture al andalus he looked up sharply and said i can speak of the feeling of all muslims it was a part of history we were here for eight centuries you cant forget it ever the fear that the moors would one day return and reclaim their lost paradisethrough either conquest or immigrationhas created a certain paranoia in spanish politics construction of the mosque in granada was delayed for twentytwo years because of the intense anxiety surrounding the growing islamic presence in spain joined the european union generous eu subsidies ignited an economic boom drawing thousands of young men from north africa the muslims are young and male and they come by themselves mohammed elafifi the director of press relations at the m mosque told me two years ago when i visited him they dont speak spanish and they dont have much information about spain and they arrive with a different religion at the time afifi placed the number of arab immigrants in spain at three hundred thousand now the number of arabicspeaking immigrants is five hundred thousand not including half a million illegals the spanish government has encouraged official immigration from south america at the expense of north africa but smugglers in highspeed power boats make nightly dropoffs on the ragged spanish coastline and the frequent discovery of corpses washing up on the beaches testifies to the desperation of those who did not quite get to shore muslim immigration is transforming all of europe nearly twenty million people in the european union identify themselves as muslim this population is disproportionately young male and unemployed the societies these men have left are typically poor religious conservative and dictatorial the ones they enter are rich secular liberal and free for many the exchange is invigorating but for others europe becomes a prison of alienation a muslims experience of immigration can be explained in part by how he views his adopted homeland islamic thought broadly divides civilization into dar alislam the land of the believers and dar alkufr the land of impiety france for instance is a secular country largely catholic but it is now home to five million muslims should it therefore be considered part of the islamic world this question is central to the debate about whether muslims in europe can integrate into their new communities or must stand apart from them if france can be considered part of dar allslam then muslims can form alliances and participate in politics they should have the right to institute islamic law and they can send their children to french schools if it is a part of dar alkufr then strict muslims must not only keep their distance they must fight against their adopted country the internet provides confused young muslims in europe with a virtual community those who cannot adapt to their new homes discover on the internet a responsive and compassionate forum the internet stands in for the idea of the ummah the mythologized muslim community marc sageman the psychiatrist and former cia officer said the internet makes this ideal community concrete because one can interact with it he compares this virtual ummah to romantic conceptions of nationhood which inspire people not only to love their country but to die for it the internet is the key issue gilles kepel a prominent arabist and a professor at the institut detudes politiques in paris told me recently it erases the frontiers between the dar allslam and the dar alkufr it allows the propagation of a universal norm with an internet sharia and fatwa system kepel was speaking of the islamic legal code which is administered by the clergy now one doesnt have to be in saudi arabia or egypt to live under the rule of islamic law anyone can seek a ruling from his favorite sheikh in mecca kepel said in the old days one sought a fatwa from the sheikh who had the best knowledge now it is sought from the one with the best web site to a large extent kepel argues the internet has replaced the arabic satellite channels as a conduit of information and communication one can say that this war against the west started on television he said but for instance with the decapitation of the poor hostages in iraq and saudi arabia those images were propagated via webcams and the internet a jihadi subculture has been created that didnt exist before because the internet is anonymous islamist dissidents are less susceptible to government pressure there is no signature kepel said to some of us who have been trained as classicists the cyberworld appears very much like the time before gutenberg copyists used to add their own notes into a text so you never know who was the real author gabriel weimann a senior fellow at the united states institute of peace has been monitoring terrorist web sites for seven years when we started there were only twelve sites he told me now there are more than four thousand every known terrorist group maintains more than one web site and often the sites are in different languages you can download music videos donate money receive training weimann said its a virtual training camp there are two online magazines associated with al qaeda sawt aljihad voice of jihad and muaskar albattar camp albattar which feature howto articles on kidnapping poisoning and murdering hostages specific targets such as the centers for disease control in atlanta or fedwire the moneyclearing system operated by the federal reserve board are openly discussed we do see a rising focus on the us weimann told me but some of this talk may be fakea scare campaign one of the sites has been linked directly to terrorist acts an editor of sawt aljihad issa bin saad aloshan died in a gun battle with saudi police on july during a raid on a villa in riyadh where the head of paul m johnson jr the american hostage was discovered in the freezer the importance of the internet in the case of madrid is disputed among experts yes the internet has created a virtual ummah olivier roy an expert on political islam at the french centre national de la recherche scientifique wrote to me recently the web sites seem to attract the lonely muslim cybernaut who does remain in a virtual world but madrids bombers used the internet as a tool of communication their leaders had personal links with other al qaeda members not virtual ones thomas hegghammer the norwegian investigator divides the jihadi internet community into three categories first you have the message boards he explained in a recent email there you find the political and religious discussions among the sympathizers and potential recruits the most important message boards for al qaeda sympathizers are al qalah the fortress al sahat the fields and al islah reform these boards hegghammer wrote provide links to the information hubs where new radicalislamist texts declarations and recordings are posted you often find these among the communities at yahoo lycos and so on hegghammer continued there are many such sites but the main one is global islamic media it was at this site that hegghammer discovered the jihadi iraq document finally you have the mother sites which are run by people who get their material directly from the ideologues or operatives they must not be confused with the myriad amateur sites usually in english set up by random sympathizers or bored kids hegghammer pointed to several key sites associated with al qaeda including al faruq he who distinguishes truth from falsehood and markaz aldirasat walbuhuth alislamiyyah center for islamic study and research al faruq is difficult to place geographically and organizationally but it seems closer to the afghanistanbased elements of al qaeda hegghammer wrote markaz aldirasat concentrates on saudi arabia these sites move continuously hegghammer wrote sometimes several times a day to avoid being hacked by intelligence agencies or freelance internet vigilantes one of al qaedas first sites al neda was operating until july when it was captured by an american who operates pornography sites the internet jihadis now cover themselves by stealing unguarded server space jihad videos have recently been discovered on servers belonging to george washington university and the arkansas department of highways and transportation last march in pakistanjamal ismail a reporter for abu dhabi tv showed me how he monitors the al faruq site each day he receives an email with a link which leads him to the new address like several other jihadi sites the al faruq site announces itself with a white stallion racing across the screen which is the al qaeda logo every few days it announces a new name but it is the same web site with a new look he told me it concentrates on iraq saudi arabia and afghanistan in midjuly i asked ismail via email if there was any discussion of the upcoming american presidential election the department of homeland security had just announced contingency plans to postpone the election in the event that al qaeda attempts to disrupt it there is no new article like the spanish one but we are all expecting people to talk about it ismail said sageman said that he had seen vague statements along the lines of well do to the us the same as we did to spain but nothing specific or authoritative i went to yahoo groups and typed in jihad there were a hundred and ninetytwo chat groups registered under that category with my arabicspeaking assistant nidal daraiseh i checked out which had members on march the day after the train bombings a message titled the goals of al qaeda in attacking madrid had been posted by a writer calling himself gallant warrior echoing a theme that is frequently repeated on these sites the writer noted that by carrying out its threat to spain al qaeda proved that its words were matched by actions al qaeda has sent a message to the crusading people do not think that death and fear are only for the weak muslims aznar the american tail has lost and great fear has spread among the people of the countries in alliance with america they will all be vanquished thank god for letting us live this long to see the jihad battalions in europe if anyone had predicted this three years ago one would have said he was dreaming another site i visited was unusual in having a number of female correspondents a writer named murad chastised those who condemned the madrid bombings you pity the deaths of those nonmuslims so quickly if muslims had died in their lands in the manner the writer discusses would he have cried for them a woman named bint aldawa responded brother murad islam does not allow the killing of innocent people a man who called himself salahuddeen entered the discussion we have said that we are against the killing of civilians anywhere but the enemies of god kill muslim civilians every day and do not feel shame they should drink from the same bitter cup though these sites have become an ideological home for many muslims for most arab immigrants europe has provided comfort and support while at the same time allowing them the freedom to maintain their islamic identities three moroccan immigrants died on the trains on march one was a devout thirteenyearold girl sanae ben salah for whom the m mosque was said to have been her second home another mohamed itabien twentyseven was an illegal immigrant who taught arabic classes at a mosque in guadalajara he was the sole source of support for his family including eleven siblings most of whom lived in a tiny town in morocco where there were no telephones the third osama elamrati was a builder who was engaged to a spanish woman europe has given us opportunities our own countries didnt give us mustapha elmrabet the head of the moroccan workers and immigrants association told me in madrid our children are in school and we are working thousands of families in morocco can live with the money we get here when i asked mrabet if al andalus was part of the lure for moroccan immigrants he said nobody with common sense could talk about going back to that its madness its a disease under aznar relations with morocco deteriorated to the point where in the countries broke off diplomatic relations over various problems including territory disputes immigration and the flow of drugs into europe through spain according to the united nations morocco exports twelve billion dollars worth of marijuana each year eventually the governments returned their ambassadors without resolving the disputes that had led to the rupture when twelve suicide bombers struck in casablanca in may killing fortyfive people one of their targets was a restaurant called casa de espana spain is the bridge between the islamic world and the west haizam amirah fernandez said when we met in a conference room at madrids real instituto elcano shortly after the train bombings think of that other bridge to the east turkey both have been hit by jihadist terroristsin the same week in istanbul on march two suicide bombers attacked a jewish club killing one person and injuring five others the whole idea is to cut off these bridges amirah said if the goal is to polarize people muslims and infidels that is a way of doing it jihadists are the most fervent defenders of the notion of a clash of civilizations one evening i went to a pub with some spanish cops there is this legend that spain and the arab world were friends a senior investigator said he nodded toward the waitress and the customers at several nearby tables here in the bar are five arabs sitting next to you nobody used to think it was strange now people are reacting differently he paused and said they want to smell the jasmine of al andalus and pray again in the granada mosque can you imagine the mentality these sobs have on a splendid april day in paris i went to lunch with gilles kepel the arabist scholar and jeanlouis bruguiere the doughty french counterterrorism judge despite the beautiful weather the men were in a gloomy frame of mind i am seriously concerned about the future bruguiere said as we sat at a corner table under an arbor of lilacs that shed blossoms onto his jacket his armorplated peugeot was parked on the street and his bodyguards were discreetly arrayed in the restaurant i began work on this in against the popular front for the liberation of palestine the armed islamic group of algeria these groups were well known and each had an understandable structure the majority were sponsored by statessyria libya iraq now we have to face a new and largely unknown organization with a loose system and hidden connections so it is not easy to understand its internal functioning it appears to be composed of cells and networks that are scattered all over the world and changing shape constantly bruguiere pointed to the istanbul bombings in november and the march bombings in madrid as being the opening salvos in a new attack on europe they have struck in the east and in the south he said i think the next stop will be in the north london or paris kepel suggested the principal target is london bruguiere declared chechnya is playing a larger and more disturbing role in the worldwide jihad bruguiere said at present al qaeda and its affiliates operate on a rather lowtech level but in chechnya many recruits are being trained to exploit the technical advantages of developed countries some of these groups have the capacity for hijacking satellites he told me capturing signals beamed from space terrorists could devastate the communications industry shut down power grids and paralyze the ability of developed countries to defend themselves in all the islamist actors in madrid were identified bruguiere said his own investigations had led him to the spanish capital that june he quickly informed the spanish police that jamal zougam the owner of the phone shop was a major contact for jihad recruits in europe and morocco but zougam was not apprehended french and spanish authorities have a long history of disagreement over the handling of terrorism with the spanish accusing the french of giving sanctuary to eta terrorists bruguiere said that when he arrived in madrid he found that the islamic threat was underassessed the spanish police had made him wait a year before allowing him to interview zougam after bruguiere went back to paris the spanish police put zougam under surveillance and searched his apartment finding jihadi tapes and videos the authorities briefly renewed their interest in him after the casablanca bombings but once again there was insufficient evidence to arrest him i asked bruguiere if he thought that the madrid attacks represented an evolution in al qaedas operational ability or suggested that the organization had lost control he said that al qaeda was now little more than a brand a trademark but he admitted that he had been surprised it was a good example of the capacity and the will of these groups to adopt a political agenda the defeat of the late government and the agreement of the new government to withdraw troopsit was a terrorist success the first time we have had such a result later kepel and i discussed the reason that europe was under attack the future of islam is in europe he said it has a huge muslim population either we train our muslims to become modern global citizens who live in a democratic pluralistic society or on the contrary the islamists win and take over those muslim european constituencies then were in serious trouble i doubt whether anyone can seriously suggest that spain has not acted in a way that suggests appeasement ramon perezmaura the editor at abc told me shortly after zapatero had announced plans to withdraw spanish troops from iraq in may without waiting to see if un peacekeeping troops would become involved perezmaura recalled a recent lunch he had had with the iranian ambassador to spain mortez alviri according to perezmaura alviri said that miguel angel moratinoszapateros pick for foreign ministerhad approached the iranians to negotiate with moqtada alsadr the radical shiite cleric whose militia was engaged in savage urban warfare with coalition troops moratinos has denied this according to perezmaura alviri passed moratinoss message along and less than a day after zapatero announced the withdrawal sadr said from najaf that spanish troops would be allowed to leave iraq unmolested that was a false promise american and spanish forces had to shoot a path through sadrs militia in najaf which repeatedly attacked them on april the voice of osama bin laden spoke again this is a message to our neighbors north of the mediterranean containing a reconciliation initiative as a response to their positive reactions bin laden said on the arab satellite channel al arabiya now it was the al qaeda leader who cast himself in the role of a rational political actor it is in both sides interest to curb the plans of those who shed the blood of peoples for their narrow personal interest and subservience to the white house gang he proposed a european committee to study the justice of the islamic causes especially palestine the reconciliation will start with the departure of its last soldier from our country bin laden saidnot indicating if he was referring to iraq afghanistan or the entire muslim world the door of reconciliation is open for three months from the date of announcing this statementfor those who want reconciliation we have given them a chance stop shedding our blood so as to preserve your blood it is in your hands to apply this easy yet difficult formula you know that the situation will expand and increase ifyou delay things peace beupon those who follow guidance from bin ladens perspective he was offering to bring europe into an unsettled middle ground called the dar alsulh this is the land of the treaty where muslims live as a peaceful minority european leaders rejected bin ladens proposal almost immediately seeing it as a ploy to aggravate the tensions in the western alliance its the weirdest thing in the world a senior fbi official told me it shows hes on the ropes desperate bin ladens truce offer immediately became a topic of discussion on the islamist web sites this initiative should be considered a golden opportunity to the people of europe read a posting by global islamic media on do not find it strange if after a while a year or so you will hear about secret negotiations by one country and representatives of al qaedathe organization has come to represent the islamic ummah and speaks in its name it appears that we are returning to the days of the caliphate on another site islahtv a writer calling himself ya rab shahada oh god martyrdom picked up on the theme the sheikh speaks these words as the caliph of the muslims and not as a wanted manthis is the sign to begin the big strike onamerica anotherwritersaid herewehavethe landsof al andalus wherethe trains were struck the sheikh is isolating america nowand it will be seen who will choose peace from those who chose suicide a writer calling himself adlomari added the sheikh has proved to the world that europe does not want peace with muslims and that it wants to be a partner in the crusader crimes against muslims the coming days will show that events in europe are coming if it does not respond to the sheikhs initiative tomorrow is near the fact that bin laden was addressing nations as an equal showed a new confidence in al qaedas ability to manipulate the political future exploiting this power will depend in part on convincing the west that al qaeda and bin laden remain in control of the worldwide islamist jihad as long as al qaeda is seen as being an irrational unyielding death cult the only response is to destroy it but if al qaedaamorphous as that entity has becomehas evolved into something like a virtual islamist state that is trying to find a permanent place for itself in the actual world then the prospect of future negotiations is not out of the question however unlikely or repellent that may sound to americans after all the spanish government has brokered truces with eta which has killed four times as many people in spain as al qaeda has and the accelerated withdrawal of spanish troops from iraq following the train bombings has already set a precedent for accommodation which was quickly followed by the dominican republic honduras and nicaragua last year germany paid a sixmilliondollar ransom to algerian terrorists and the philippines recently pulled its fifty troops out of iraq in order to save a hostage from being beheaded on july immediately after the philippine hostage was freed new warnings appeared on the internet from a body called the tawhid islamic group promising terror attacks against poland and bulgaria unless they withdrew their troops from iraq although leaders of both countries immediately rejected the demands opinion polls showed that popular sentiment was turning against the countries presence in iraq another threat allegedly from abu musab alzarqawis group tawhid and jihad warned japan that queues of cars laden with explosives were waiting unless japanese humanitarian troops left iraq also in july the abu hafs almasri brigades posted a communique on the internet ordering italians to overthrow their prime minister silvio berlusconi we are in italy and not one of you is safe so long as you refuse our sheikhs offer the message said get rid of the incompetent berlusconi or we will truly burn italy the internet warriors have been emboldened although it is impossible to know how seriously to take their threats appeasement is a foolish strategy for dealing with al qaeda last year many saudis were stunned when the terrorist group struck western compounds in riyadhshortly after the united states had announced that it would withdraw troops from saudi arabia fulfilling one of bin ladens primary demands the saudis now realize that al qaeda wont be assuaged until all foreigners are expelled from the arabian peninsula and a rigid theocracy has been imposed yet some of the countries on al qaedas hit list will no doubt seek to appease terrorists as a quick solution to a crisis intelligence officials are now trying to determine who is the next target and are sifting through chatter in search of a genuine threat we see people getting on the internet and then they get on their phones and talk about it a senior fbi official told me we are now responding to the threat to the us elections the idea of attacking before election day the official said was born out of madrid earlier this year an international task force dubbed operation crevice arrested members of a bombmaking ring in london during the investigation officials overheard statements that there were jihadis in mexico awaiting entry into the united states that coincided with vague warnings from european imams about attacks before the elections as a result of this intelligence surveillance of border traffic from mexico has been increased even though al qaeda has been weakened by the capture of key operatives such as khalid sheikh mohammed the architect of the attacks it is hardly defunct there is a replacement for mohammed named abu faraj the fbi official said if there is an attack on the united states his deputy hamza rabia will be responsible hes head of external operations for al qaedaan arrogant nasty guy the official continued the most dangerous thing now is that no one is in control these guys dont have to go back to bin laden or zawahiri for approval one of the most sobering pieces of information to come out of the investigation of the march bombings is that the planning for the attacks may have begun nearly a year before in october several of the suspects met in istanbul with amer azizi who had taken the nom de guerre othman al andalusiothman of al andalus azizi later gave the conspirators permission to act in the name of al qaeda although it is unclear whether he authorized money or other assistanceor indeed whether al qaeda had much support to offer in june italian police released a surveillance tape of one of the alleged planners of the train bombings an egyptian housepainter named rabei osman sayed ahmed who said that the operation took me two and a half years ahmed had served as an explosives expert in the egyptian army it appears that some kind of attack would have happened even if spain had not joined the coalitionor if the invasion of iraq had never occurred the real problem of spain for al qaeda is that we are a neighbor of arab countriesmorocco and algeriaand we are a model of economy democracy and secularism florentino portero a political analyst at the grupo de estudios estrategicos in madrid told me we support the transformation and westernization of the middle east we defend the transition of morocco from a monarchy to a constitutional monarchy we are allies of the enemies of al qaeda in the arab world this point is not clearly understood by the spanish people we are a menace to al qaeda just because of who we are lawrence wright is the author of five books of nonfiction most recently twins and one novel gods favorite he is also a screenwriter the siege and noriega gods favorite he has been a staff writer for the new yorker since coda since i have been working on a history of al qaeda so i was in afghanistan when the bombs went off in madrid on march one of the fascinating details that did not get published in the article concerned the origin of the legend of al andulus the islamic camelot washington irving americas first internationally famous author arrived in spain in to write a biography of christopher columbus while he was in the country he befriended the gypsies who were living in the ruins of the alhambra and he drew from them stories of the moorish reign published in irvings book the alhambra was an immediate international success capturing as it did the splendid sense of decay and lost glory that so animated the nineteenthcentury romantic sensibility the myth of al andalus that of an islamic empire of tolerance and justice encompassed by a superb appreciation of beauty in all its manifestations in art and nature was created in part by the same man who had drawn so imaginatively upon the ghost stories and fairy legends of upstate new york irving was so associated with the boom in spanish tourism that followed that he returned ten years later as the american ambassador he eventually published a twovolume biography of the prophet mohammed craig horowitz anatomy of a foiled plot from new york magazine on a rainsoaked saturday morning nine days before the start of the republican convention at madison square garden an egyptian known as dawadi left his house on staten island to pick up two friends they had plans to spend the day together and to take care of a little business dawadi wore a baseball cap pulled down over his eyes he looked as if he were heading out to do some weekend errands he drove to rossville a middleclass staten island neighborhood where he picked up james elshafay an unemployed nineteenyearold tottenville high school dropout the two men greeted each other warmly though they had known each other for less than a year dawadi had become a mentor to the naive sometimes confused younger man mature welleducated and religious dawadi was some would say even a father figure for elshafay who had grown up in a house with just his mother and an aunt driving cautiously toward queens in the heavy rain the two men passed the time discussing the best way to handle the days primary activitya careful examination of the herald square subway station in preparation for planting a bomb after considering a variety of targets they had decided on the subway station now they needed detailed information to put together a plan they wanted to know the number and location of cops on the platforms at different times of the day which areas were covered by video cameras since the likeliest place to hide a bomb was a garbage can they needed to know how many there were where they were located and when they got emptied and they needed to find the best path to go in and then get out quickly after planting the device when they reached thirtyfourth avenue in astoria shahawar matin siraj a twentytwoyearold pakistani national came down from his apartment and got in the car siraj who entered the united states illegally nearly six years ago was wearing a dorag and baggy jeans he had said when they planned their recon maneuvers that he wanted to disguise himself he didnt want to look arabic in english so thickly accented it can make him difficult to understand he said he wanted to look hiphop like a puerto rican on the way to midtown the three men made small talk and then the conversation shifted to the verrazanonarrows bridge though they had already decided that blowing up the verrazano would be better left for some time in the futureit would be very difficult they believed to put a bomb on the bridge without being seenthey nevertheless passed the time in a lively backandforth about the best place to plant explosives on the bridge to ensure the destruction of the entire span finally the trio parked on madison avenue and thirtieth street to make sure they didnt attract attention they decided to split up do what they needed to do and meet back near the car when they finished they went their separate ways and each man descended into the thirtyfourth street subway station using a different entrance six days later two of the three were arrested for plotting to blow up the thirtyfourth street subway station siraj was quietly picked up a couple of blocks from islamic books and tapes the shop on fifth avenue in bay ridge where he worked elshafay was sitting on the steps of the noor al mosque on richmond terrace when he was taken into custody with nary a voice raised dawadi as it turned out was a confidential informant working for the nypd he had spent more than a year on the case first building a relationship with siraj and then with elshafay with his identity now revealed he disappeared from the arab muslim community in bay ridge the largest one in the city with some thirty thousand members as abruptly as he had become a part of it identifying getting close to and ultimately arresting siraj and elshafay two lone terrorists with no connections to al qaeda or any other international organization who were motivated by all of the jihad chatter crackling in the air was a direct result of much of the work that has been done by the nypd since these kinds of homegrown lonewolf incidents start way below the level the federal government would focus on says david cohen the nypds deputy commissioner for intelligence if we werent doing it nobody would be cohen who was once the number four spook at the cia is sitting with his back to a brick wall in the half king a funky outoftheway pub on the far west side in the twenties its afternoon and the place is libraryquiet but cohens routine level of suspicion is so highly evolved that when i ask if hed like to sit out back in the pubs garden he shakes his head gardens have ears he says cryptically police commissioner ray kelly cohen and other highranking members of the department like to talk about the international intelligencegathering capabilities that have been developed since nypd detectives are now posted in cities around europe and the middle east but the listening posts that have been established in neighborhoods throughout the city while decidedly less glamorous are probably of greater value a crudely planned locally developed attacklike the one cops believe they thwarted with the arrests of siraj and elshafaycould still cause plenty of death destruction and panic and may now be what keeps kelly and his inner circle awake at night kelly says the arrests of siraj and elshafay are proof that the investment made in the nypds intelligence division has paid off yes we want to work with other agencies and yes we have detectives placed overseas he says but in new york city were on our own we have to protect our own turf global events he argues give people like elshafay and siraj permission to think the way they think we have an overarching concern about the lone wolf the unaffiliated terrorist he says thats why this case is so important to me according to several sources close to the investigation elshafay is in the process of pleading guilty and making a deal with the us attorneys office in brooklyn it is still unclear whether siraj will plead or fight the charges neither defendants lawyer responded to repeated requests for comment shahawar matin siraj first came to the attention of the police departments intelligence division nearly a year and a half ago someone in bay ridge phoned in a report to a terrorist hotline the nypd had set up after that there was a young man who regularly engaged in virulent antiamerican tirades he worked at a muslim bookstore located next to the islamic society of bay ridge which encompasses a thriving community center a nursery school and one of the most active mosques in the city the turnout for fridayafternoon prayers regularly exceeds one thousand men filling the mosque and forcing many others to participate via loudspeakers out on the street siraj was worth keeping an eye on intelligence officers believed because of the tenor of his rhetoric and because he was apparently careful about when he spoke his mind he wasnt some hothead who shot his mouth off to whoever came into the bookstore siraj vented only in front of people he believed he could trust after getting reports about siraj for months the cops decided as cohen puts it to send assets to that location specifically they assigned dawadi their informant to develop a relationship with siraj to become his friend and gain his confidence the odd seduction began last year during ramadan dawadi started going to the bookstore and the mosque occasionally talking to siraj but always careful not to push things and scare his target away slowly over four or five months siraj began to open up to his new friend at the same time detectives investigated siraj and his family and a picture began to emerge a native of karachi pakistan siraj entered the united states illegally in though the cops arent certain they believe he came across the border from canada his mother father who also works at the bookstore which is owned by an uncle and eighteenyearold sister were already here legally not long after sneaking across the border siraj was arrested for assault the charges were eventually dropped but he was arrested again for assault this past june in a case involving an altercation in front of a store he worked hard to present himself as a tough guy telling dawadi and others that hed left pakistan after killing two people he also claimed that hed been shot by one of his victims before killing him though cops have been unable to verify his story siraj was easy to anger and often lost his temper during his months with dawadi it was critical for us to determine if siraj was connected to anyone overseas says one detective who worked the case its an interactive process we watch who he hangs around with how he deals with people and in particular we look at his general level of sophistication things like whether he takes his own countersurveillance measures during the first six or seven months of the operation dawadi would hang around the bookstore hed occasionally drive siraj home after work and they would have long conversations about islam there was some radical talk but nothing beyond banal mostly boilerplate hostility but the urgency of the rhetoric and the momentum for acting on it picked up dramatically when siraj introduced dawadi to his friend james elshafay in april only nineteen elshafay is the americanborn product of an irishamerican mother and an egyptian father who split up when he was very young overweight sloppylooking and on medication for anxiety elshafay has been treated for psychological problems a comic moment on policesurveillance video taken the day the suspects conducted their reconnaissance of the subway shows him standing in the rain after emerging from the station eating a falafel with the filling oozing out the sides and onto his hands cops describe him as lost not in school not working and in some state of turmoil about his identity his only friend other than siraj seemed to be his mother who cops say coddled him and drove him everywhere september was a turning point for elshafay after there was a lot of antiarab sentiment being expressed around the city one detective says james saw people he grew up with and went to school with on staten island carrying signs that said on the front god bless america and on the back kill arab babiesand he felt the police didnt do anything about it when he was introduced to dawadi in april he had an extraordinarily ambitious handwritten wish list of possible targets to attack in addition to the thirtyfourth street subway station the list included the station at fiftyninth and lexington a fortysecond street station the verrazano bridge a staten island jail and three police precincts on staten islandthe rd in tottenville the th in st george and the nd in new dorp elshafay also had a crudely drawn map of the targets that he gave to siraj who then showed it to dawadi are you crazy dawadi said when siraj unfolded the map youd better get rid of that siraj stuck it between some volumes on a shelf in the bookstore elshafay had begun to develop a vague interest in his islamic heritage about a year and a half ago growing a beard and starting to pray regularly after their meeting dawadi nourished his growing piety it was an easy way for them to bond they went to the mosque and prayed together dawadi took him to a shop on atlantic avenue to buy his first kufi he bought him an english translation of the koran he recommended books for elshafay to read like those by abu hanifah a seminal islamic scholar who died in and is considered one of the greatest imams in muslim history soon siraj began discussing the merits of various kinds of explosives and showed dawadi some cds he had that contained bombmaking instructions he also talked more heatedly about blowing things up and doing harm to us military personnel and lawenforcement officers i want at least one thousand to two thousand to die in one day siraj said at one point in june nypd intelligence officers decided that the suspects had crossed a boundary to make sure they got what they needed to make a case and to prevent an attack dawadi began to wear a wire to record his conversations with the two detectives also instructed dawadi to tell siraj and elshafay that he was a member of a muslim brotherhood which would support them and offer whatever assistance they needed to pull off an attack as july approached siraj talked about his willingness to do jihad im going to fuck this country very bad he said fifth avenue in bay ridge between sixtyfifth and ninetysecond streets is one of those colorful new york commercial strips that exist as a kind of takenforgranted testament to the extraordinary diversity of the city on one short stretch there is the chinese pagoda a restaurant whose sign also features large arabic script the killarney pub is right next to an arabic boutique which is down the street from musab bin omayer a grocery store celebrating a renovation and in every window recently not just those of the cleopatra restaurant and the jerusalem hair stylist were signs marking the end of ramadan across from the baraka restaurant is a fivestory whitebrick building that houses the islamic society of bay ridge i met zein rimawi one of the societys founders and a current board member on the street in front of the building the society is a multipurpose community organization that includes what is now one of four mosques in bay ridge a palestinian with six brothers who comes from a small town about twentyfive miles northwest of jerusalem rimawi has a round pleasant face covered by a closecropped beard he owns an aquarium store and is the only one in his family to have moved to the united states why did i come to america he asks without pausing for an answer wed moved inside to a meeting room on the third floor every one of my brothers has his own house his own car and he can send his kids to college i dont have a house i dont have a car i came here for justice for freedom these were the most important things but now i dont see it so what did i accomplish what do i have rimawi speaks calmly in modulated tones but his anger and disappointment are palpable as he talks the spirited singing voices of a prek class rise to fill the room from one floor below us of course we are angry we have been targeted he continues as he takes off his jacket put on the tv and you get sick from it you see afghanistan and its a war against the muslims iraq its a war against the muslims palestine its a war against the muslims chechnya a war against the muslims everywhere you look its the same thing now even in the sudan but the deeper hurt has come closer to home he knows shahawar matin siraj and his family the imam asked him to help when siraj was arrested and rimawi spent some time checking the reputations of the lawyers being considered he was instrumental in their decision to stay with the courtappointed counsel rimawi reflects the general feeling in the community when he argues that the case against siraj and elshafay is simply one more example of lawenforcement officials unjustly arresting muslims for publicrelations value the bush administration needs to keep arresting muslims he says they must be able to say see we stopped another terrorist we found another sleeping sic cell we are protecting you from the terrorists an affable man with generally moderate views rimawi believes that as long as the government keeps telling people over and over that the terrorists are going to strike again soon the arrests will continue if later it turns out theyre not guilty who cares its the idea of it i believe in that we are being targeted the first cell they arrested in detroit they are free now in albany free now they said there was a mistake in the translation gimme a break rimawis passion is not diminished at all when i tell him elshafay has apparently pleaded guilty innocent or not is not the point he says if you take a young man like that and tell him you are religious and you are experienced and clever and you work him for a year and you keep talking to him and telling him we have to do this its easy for that young man to say yes lets do it of course that would happen doing this they could arrest most young muslim people the cops however are adamant that this was not as cohen puts it in any way about leading a horse to water our ci was very careful to let the suspects take the lead and do the talking from the beginning rimawi watched as dawadi tried to ingratiate himself in the community he says the informant came to the mosque and introduced himself as a religious man he told everyone his father was a wellknown author of islamic books in egypt when he heard the call for prayer he would start to cry rimawi says shaking his head almost in disbelief when someone would read the koran he would start to cry he was a very good actor though the cops dismiss the notion out of hand rimawi believes that dawadis original target was the imam not siraj he says dawadi tried to get close to the sheik he told the religious leader he was a realestate developer but because he was new to the community people didnt trust him he asked the sheik to be his partner he told him he wouldnt have to do anything other than let dawadi use his name and he would split the profits when the imam turned him down for the second time rimawi says and told dawadi not to come see him anymore he turned his attention to siraj no doubt part of rimawis frustration over the case is the bitter irony that for years the board members of the islamic society of bay ridge have worked enthusiastically and energetically to be good neighbors to become an integral part of the community though rimawi says he has not personally experienced any hostility or hate he compares the situation for american arabs now to that of blacks in the fifties and sixties i wish i could leave he says finally turning out the lights my wife and children went to palestine and jordan recently i told them find a place you like and well move back but my kids were born here they dont want to go on mondayaugust two days after siraj elshafay and dawadi conducted their reconnaissance of the thirtyfourth street subway station the men got together in brooklyn to give real shape to their attack plan playing out his role dawadi said the brotherhood had approved their mission and directed them to conceal the bombs which dawadi would get from the brotherhoodin backpacks in the midst of the session siraj who had from the beginning been the most vocal about his desire to commit an act of terror and had tried to project the fafade of a tough guy seemed to get cold feet suddenly he told his companions he didnt want to handle the bombs he would help with the planning he would go with them to thirtyfourth street but he didnt want to actually go down into the subway with the explosives i am not ready to die he said there was silence for a bit when siraj finished talking one of the detectives says then very calmly james says ill do it ill place the bombs in the subway energized by his decision to be the pivotal player in the plot elshafay then said he had an idea hed dress like an orthodox jew to put the explosives in place hed put on side curls and a long black coat he would go in the thirythird street entrance and come out on thirtyfourth and they could pick him up there warming to this image siraj suggested putting the bombs in a macys bag jews shop at macys he offered by this time days before the start of the republican convention the cops were taking every precaution they had the suspects under twentyfourhour surveillance and were working closely with the us attorneys office to make sure they were getting all the elements they needed for an airtight case then early in the morning on august one of the lead detectives got a call at home to get to the nypds counterterrorism bureau in brooklyn as quickly as possible the decision had been made to move on the suspects since siraj had an assault case pending against him the cops used it as a lure they called and asked him to come to the th precinct in bay ridge at three oclock to get the case closed out he said fine but when he left work at islamic books and tapes that friday afternoon he was headed in the opposite direction not taking any chances the cops grabbed him in his pocket was the original handdrawn map of targets that elshafay had first given him back in aprilthe one he had hidden among the volumes in the bookstore elshafay was also called by the cops and told there was a traffic accident they needed to talk to him about his mother dropped him at the mosque on staten island where the cops arrested him before they put him in the patrol car he asked if he could have a cigarette theres no question in our mind that they would have played this out completely says cohen if they couldnt get the explosives or if they just got frustrated they had other options all it takes is an ak and a desire to become a martyr well they have no options now craig horowitz has covered politics crime and the new york police department for more than a decade as a contributing editor at new york magazine horowitz who has written more than forty cover stories for new york magazine is at work on his first novel coda the arrest of the wouldbe subway bombers took place barely fortyeight hours before the opening of the republican convention in new york as a result it was for the most part a oneday news event while under different circumstances the successful undercover police operation might have been a significant ongoing story given the timing it was swallowed up by convention coverage consequently police department brass couldnt have been more eager when i approached them about doing a piece that examined the undercover operation they were so eager in fact they did something they never dothey gave me access and details against the wishes of the us attorneys office the accused terrorists hadnt even been indicted yet and the us attorneys office was taking great pains to insure that nothing interfered with the successful prosecution of the suspects this included a ban on talking to the media but the cops desperately wanted this story told three years ago when ray kelly became new york citys police commissioner he revamped the nypd to deal with the dangers of a post world he created a counterterrorism unit he hired talent from the cia and the military and he vowed that fighting terrorism would be just as important as fighting street crime however when youre battling street crime success and failure are easy to measure murder goes up or goes down rapes increase or they decrease but how do you effectively measure the terrorist acts that didnt happen the ones all the painstaking work may have prevented in fact most of the successes will never be made public telling the story of the arrests of james elshafay and shahawar matin siraj gave the nypd an unusual opportunity to get the word out justin kane and jason felch to catchan oligarch from san francisco magazine the strange and epic case of the united states of america versus pavel ivanovich lazarenko which this spring asked twelve bay area residents to decide whether the former prime minister of a country six thousand miles away had broken the nations laws more than a decade ago actually began one cool night in january when fbi special agent bryan earl paid a visit to a small dumpster in sausalito earl is not the type to skulk under cover of darkness a smoothfaced man with hints of gray at his temples gentle blue eyes and a profound sincerity he looks more like a tax accountant than one of louis freehs or robert muellers bluesuited special agents his pious demeanor hints at his mormon upbringing on the quiet side of las vegas and its easy to picture him wandering around mexico in a suit and tie with a small black name tag on his chest and the book of mormon under his arm as he did twenty years ago not the first man you would imagine in the fbi he is the first man you would want working therethe embodiment of god family and country at age thirtytwo tired of practicing corporate law in dc he had sent an application to the fbi on a whim and then surprised himself by joining up a year later as a rookie fresh out of quantico he found himself in san francisco eventually part of the fbis local tenmember eurasian organized crime squad investigating financial fraud and moneylaundering schemes linked to the former soviet union and in some cases the infamous red mafiya earl enjoyed being part cop part missionary spreading the gospel of the american legal system among former communists for whom the distinction between politics business and crime had fallen with the berlin wall in late earl had been handed the name of peter nikolayevich kiritchenko a sausalito businessman whom ukrainian authorities had asked the fbi to check out it was a routine foreign police request the kind earls supervisor would later say that most fbi agents would fulfill and forget according to the ukrainians kiritchenko had come up in the early stages of a ukrainian investigation into the justdeposed prime minister pavel lazarenko at the time ukraine was a new ally of the united states helping reduce the dangerous stockpile of nuclear weapons in the former soviet union and nobody wanted to endanger the fragile relationship that had been forged with ukraines autocratic president leonid kuchma lazarenko was kuchmas biggest political rival many ukrainians considered the investigation into the upstart presidential challenger to be a politically motivated ploy but earl pushed on by january he had pieced together an outline of peter kiritchenkos story three years earlier kiritchenko had uprooted his life as a middleaged ukrainian commodities trader in warsaw to move his wife daughter and business to the bay area a compact man with sandy blond hair cheeks ruddy from vodka and a taste for excess kiritchenko stuck out in san franciscos russianspeaking community he drove a burgundy bentley and on a twoacre lot high atop tiburon was building a mediterraneanstyle mansion with a degree view of three bridges that he dubbed shangrila his neighbors knew him from his petition asking the city to let him install a shooting range in the basement meanwhile he had invested about million in local real estate snapping up a sausalito condo two small san francisco apartment buildings and over eighty undeveloped acres in tiburon the ukrainian earl thought was worth a closer look at pm one weeknight that january earl tucked his young child into bed kissed his wife good night and slipped into jeans and a sweatshirt from his home in the city he drove north across the golden gate bridge into the hulking darkness of the marin headlands following the necklace of lights to the sausalito shoreline from bridgeway he turned onto harbor drive and pulled his standardissue domestic sedan into the empty parking lot of the brown threestory office building at one harbor drive in a dumpster at the back of the lot he found a single trash bag with the days detritus from kiritchenkos office he tossed it in his trunk and drove away no search warrant needed by eleven earl was home in bed the trash cover as agents call it became earls nightly routine every weekday morning for eighteen months he would bring the bag thirteen floors up the elevator of the phillip burton federal building on golden gate avenue and dump its contents on his desk occasionally earl felt silly taking off his suit jacket to sift through garbage like a tenderloin hobo his colleagues ribbed the rookie for the mess he made but it was fruitful the trash yielded clues envelopes from something called european federal credit bank a postit note with the word dugsbery scrawled on it envelopes bearing the return addresses of some of san franciscos most respected banks all of it suggested to earl that the ukrainians could be rightthere appeared to be a multimilliondollar pipeline between ukraine and the bay area among san franciscos thirty thousand russianspeaking emigresmany of whom are jews and political refuseniks who arrived as refugees over the past thirty years and congregate in the bakeries churches and restaurants along geary boulevardonly a small number have attracted the attention of the eurasian organized crime squad in the s the kgb released thousands of hardcore prisoners from the soviet gulags where they had formed tightknit criminal clans and allowed them to emigrate across the globe over time these clans evolved into the sophisticated russian mafiya operating multinational drug prostitution and insurance and welfare fraud rings among other enterprises the california department of justice has reported that russian criminal groups are operating in california including approximately three hundred former soviet union crime figures and associates in the san francisco bay area many are from the ukraine members of an offshoot of the odessa mafiya the bay area one of the worlds banking hubs as well as home to many russianspeakers has become a favorite place for the mafiya to launder some of its global take much of the eoc squads work involved tracking that money down for example as earl staked out kiritchenkos dumpster by night by day he was helping investigate a young russian emigre alexander lushtak who had bilked the local russian community out of millions with an elaborate ponzi scheme that promised taxfree returns of up to percent lushtak pleaded guilty in june to money laundering during his trial according to one published report an fbi memo emerged claiming lushtak had laundered as much as half a billion dollars of russian organizedcrime money through his bank account in new york but not all the russian loot that has flooded into san francisco comes from the mafiya as the soviet union collapsed stateowned industries were divvied up among politicians crooks and entrepreneurs these new oligarchs built a wild west capitalist economy in which paytoplay was the rule government contracts international trade deals the rights to natural resourcesevery potential profit came at a price later as the young countries tried to impose the rule of law on the chaotic system the oligarchs responded by spiriting their politically embarrassing fortunes out of the country and into banking systems where they couldnt be touched it was an influx for which earl was prepared his course work in international and soviet law at columbia university law school and experience in financial litigation made him an immediate asset to the squad and he began taking russian classes earl knew that investigations into complex financial crimesconsidered among the fbis most challenginghew to a single axiom follow the money the scraps from kiritchenkos office that earl riffled through each day were threads in a dense web of holding companies offshore corporations and beneficial trusts it looked designed to disguise something but what was this smalltime trader hiding it was no secret that kiritchenko advertised his ties to pavel lazarenko handing out goldembossed business cards reading adviser to the prime minister in photos lazarenkowho was said to have accumulated up to a billion dollars despite earning about five thousand dollars a year in government salarytowered over the crowds gathered to see him an unnerving glare on his fleshy face he was a bear of a man about sixfootthree counting his full starchy head of hair the prime minister had begun his career driving a tractor on a collective farm but by age twentyfour pasha as his friends called him had already become the powerful director of a state farm in the soviet republic of ukraine by thirtythree he headed all agriculture in his home region of dnepropetrovsk even the fall of the soviet union in did not slow lazarenkos rise a year after ukraine declared its independence he was appointed governor of dnepropetrovsk and by lazarenko had moved to kiev to accept the premiership the second most powerful man in a nation of fifty million he was fortythree he had an aura recalls olena prytula a leading ukrainian journalist prytula came to stanford university on a fellowship this year and was one of the few ukrainians to cover lazarenkos trial she first met lazarenko in at a ceremony outside of kiev commemorating the soviet victory over germany he looked like the devil to me i thought this man is capable of killing someone she says he would say something and everyone would do it immediately all of the journalists called him haziain master kiritchenko always called lazarenko not pasha but pavel ivanovich the use of the formal patronymic made it clear who held the power but kiritchenkos connection to the ukrainian leader wasnt just business at the same time earl began investigating lazarenko had flown from ukraine to san francisco to attend the christening of kiritchenkos first granddaughter during a simple ceremony at st nicholas cathedral a cozy russian orthodox church on fifteenth and church streets pavel lazarenko was named the childs godfather afterward at a party kiritchenko hosted at the nowdefunct mediterranean restaurant splendido in embarcadero center the two men traded toasts thanking each other for years of business success after the toasts lazarenko and kiritchenko began singing together there had been much wine and vodka but the song was not a drunken one it was an old ukrainian song soft and heartfelt a song about neverending loyalty more than best friends they were brothers says a ukrainian who was there yet as earl spent the summer investigating kiritchenko lazarenko safely outside us jurisdiction remained in the background that changed however when an obscure company called dugsbery incorporated closed a deal with marin county real estate agent nan allen to purchase a million novato estate once occupied by comedian eddie murphy rumor had the buyers as russians dugsberyearl had seen the word scrawled on a postit note in kiritchenkos trash from the public record hed discovered it was a shell company owned by kiritchenko with a single account at westamerica bank kiritchenko was already building his shangrila why would he need an even bigger mansion with twenty rooms five swimming pools two helicopter landing pads a fullsized ballroom goldplated doorknobs and a master bedroom larger than entire nob hill apartments the answer was in the news back in ukraine the godfather was in a fight for his life now he had a hideout just in case earl was eager to explore the ukrainian connection himself in december he boarded a commercial flight to kiev with martha boersch an assistant us attorney with the san francisco organized crime strike force who had been assigned to work with him just days earlier like earl boersch was well suited to the case and a lot less green a graduate of berkeleys boalt law school she had been a government prosecutor for six years had already won a number of complex fraud cases and was lead attorney on lushtaks ponzischeme prosecution she also spoke russian on the flight earl updated boersch a month earlier his findings had been included in an fbi memo requesting help from swiss authorities who were investigating lazarenkos and kiritchenkos numbered swiss bank accounts it was titled simply re peter kiritchenko russian organized crime and laid out the fbis ideas while living in warsaw kiritchenko had been involved in myriad criminal schemes including moving millions in stolen ukrainian government funds he disguised the money as trade in ferrous metals wheat and sunflower seeds he was also suspected of selling prefabricated houses made in elk grove california to the ukrainian government at almost a percent markup using falsified invoices earls most intriguing find however came from a discarded fedex envelope from european federal credit bank the offshore bank based in antigua had been cofounded by someone earl and boersch knew well ponzi schemer alexander lushtak it was now chaired by alex liverant a ukrainian jew who had immigrated to san francisco in when eurofed needed capital earl had learned kiritchenko became its primary investor and was now sharing a business address with liverant under kiritchenkos watch eurofed began opening us dollar correspondent and investment accounts in san francisco financial institutions big and small merrill lynch bank boston robertson stephens hambrecht and quist pacific bank and commercial bank of san francisco the memo concluded that millions of dollars have been obtained illegally and that kiritchenko was using eurofed to minimize his tax exposure in the us it was a classic moneylaundering case boersch thought moving the proceeds of certain illegal activities through us financial institutions with the intent to conceal their origins but there was one huge twist the money wasnt the proceeds of crimes committed here the alleged frauds all had taken place in ukraine that didnt matter boersch argued read liberally the criminal code implied that anyone in the world who committed fraud or extorted money could be charged with money laundering if they ever brought that money here this was a daring approachso daring it had never been tried in us courts armed with their novel legal theory boersch and earl arrived jetlagged at the kiev airport for what they thought would be a lowprofile trip to meet with ukraines government investigators and confirm their ideas about kiritchenko they were greeted by a crowd of people waving signs and chanting free lazarenko boersch and earl were stunned when their hosts explained that while they had been in the air the swiss investigators tracking lazarenkos assets had charged the presidential challenger with money laundering in switzerland since lazarenko had left office the previous year under a haze of allegations the swiss and a team of about fifty ukrainian investigators had dogged him even as his opposition party won a bloc of seats in parliament the swiss were expected in kiev any moment the turn of events transformed the factfinding trip into a multinational swap meet with the swiss ukrainian and american investigators exchanging leads in their overlapping investigations boersch and earl spent their days bundled in winter clothes in an unheated interrogation room interviewing potential witnesses the witnesses explained how lazarenko used his political power to direct government contracts for housing to kiritchenko from the swiss the pair soon learned that before kiritchenko had invested close to million in eurofed lazarenko had asked for million in cash from his swiss accounts before settling on withdrawing two million bearer checks earl is a family man through and through and he missed his kidshed just had his secondduring his trip but he was picking up russian and also enforcing criminal law in an exotic foreign locale which he loved it was snowy and there were beautiful parks big trees he says in dnepropetrovsk id go run in the mornings freezing cold my ukrainian people thought i was crazy on the drive back from the provincial capital to kiev he says everybody was out ice fishing and wed stop by these little markets and look at all these big fish it was an experience at night the ukrainians hosted elaborate sixhour banquets to celebrate the historic cooperation for a country whose criminal corruption makes it the epicenter for global badness in the words of a former state department official teaming up with the fbi was a sign of acceptance the vodka toasts continued to midnight and earl who doesnt smoke or drink was obliged to attend his fascination with two things russian began to wane its a gamelets see who can outdrink whobut i dont think they enjoy it he says and the pickled food its their history how they preserved stuff but its horrible soon after earl returned home he found his investigation turned on its head lazarenkos wife tamara son oleksandr and twin daughters katya and lessia had moved into the novato mansion with the ukrainians legal vise closing in the oligarch was feathering his nest earl put lazarenkos name on an fbi watch list that would alert him the moment the former prime minister stepped on a plane to the united states the call came just a month later as kuchmas anticorruption campaign came to fruition ukraines parliament voted to revoke lazarenkos immunity from prosecution the politician fled to athens and on february boarded a plane bound for jfk international airport earl knew he was coming before lazarenko had fastened his seat belt suddenly the routine police request had exploded into the biggest case in the eurasian organized crime squads history and one of the highestprofile cases within the fbi when ins agents briefed by earl greeted lazarenko at the arrival gate the imperious ukrainian immediately requested political asylum he would take his chances on americas legal system rather than ukraines or switzerlands on the face of it lazarenkos application for political asylum had some validity he had been running for president as a reformer against a brutal autocrat who wanted him in jail or dead some ukrainians suspected lazarenkos only crimes were failing to share his profits with kuchma and then having the audacity to use that money to run against him for president in audiotapes secretly recorded by a bodyguard of the president and first released in november kuchma can be heard mentioning lazarenko as an oligarch whose demise might conveniently satisfy the american government which was pushing him to do something about the countrys rampant corruption who from the oligarchs an aide asks who embarrasses you most of all whom can i give to the american intelligence the same tapes revealed kuchma authorizing the sale of stealth radar to saddam hussein and allegedly ordering the death of a top ukrainian journalistthe cofounder of olena prytulas publicationwho was later found beheaded in a forest outside kiev lazarenko was no saint but some observers wondered if the united states had been conned into doing kuchmas dirty work lazarenkos arrival meanwhile threw the us government into a tizzy ukraine was calling for his head and the swiss were preparing to file for his extradition while the state department madly debated the options lazarenko was detained until his asylum petition was considered at his own request he was transferred to marin county jail so he could be closer to his family he was eventually moved to the camp parks federal correctional institution in the contra costa county town of dublin for earl and boersch lazarenkos surprising appearance was also problematic he had always been a secondary concern in the investigation most of the evidence earl had accumulated against kiritchenko implicated lazarenko but there was not enough for an indictment against either of them still the endgame was on earls swiss colleagues had gathered enough evidence to include kiritchenko in their case against lazarenko and asked the agent to present the extradition warrant one morning at am earl knocked on the door of shangrila finally coming facetoface with a blearyeyed kiritchenko after eighteen months his covert investigation had just become overt earls victory was tempered by a decision by the bureau of prisons which over the objections of earl and boersch put peter kiritchenko and pavel lazarenko in the same jail cell at camp parks two miles from downtown dublin and thirty long miles from shangrila for six months the two men would spend all day together plotting a defense their confinement was a classic example of what game theory calls with good reason the prisoners dilemma given two prisoners both implicated heavily in a case the best group outcome is achieved if they refuse to cooperate with the prosecution but while sticking together may save them both each prisoner knows the surest ticket to freedomor a favorable plea bargainis to betray the other under these psychologically grueling conditions paranoia set in though the available evidence indicates that lazarenko had not met with earl or boersch to discuss cooperating kiritchenko believed he was about to be betrayed and did the only rational thing he asked for a meeting with earl and boersch earl did not want to give up on prosecuting kiritchenko whom the fbi not only suspected of masterminding the money laundering but was investigating for deeper connections to russian mafiya but kiritchenko was what the case against the bigger fish needed an eyewitness who could put a human face on the complex financial transactions for a jury the governments ultimate offer hinted at just how badly it needed him he would cop to one felony count of interstate transportation of stolen property for which he would be allowed to appeal any sentence over thirtyseven months but when it was all over he and his wife and daughter would go back to their enviable lives unscathed and with guaranteed green cards to boot apart from a million voluntary restitution hed be allowed to keep everything he owned his million shangrila all his businesses and other propertiesincluding a million condo in los angelesand his yacht after accepting the offer kiritchenko packed up his belongings and walked out of the cell with lazarenko watching he had won his freedomand broken his brotherhood by telling earl where the money had come from and gone itwas quite a tale as the soviet union crumbled kiritchenko a lowlevel communist functionary had rushed into the void left by the central government hoping to set up a small importexport company to trade in the resourcerich dnepropetrovsk region he learned that the regional governor lazarenko controlled everything and demanded a cut of the business done on his turf on january kiritchenko met with lazarenko in a warsaw hotel the two walked to a nearby financial institution called american bank in poland and the trader gave the governor to open a dollar account it was a down payment kiritchenko said as they left the bank lazarenko told him i work with everyone fiftyfifty for the next five years kiritchenko faithfully sent half of his profits to lazarenko who in return made kiritchenko a very rich man when earl and boersch heard that story they saw the potential underlying crime under ukrainian law as long as they could convince a jury that the lowly commodities trader had been in that moment victimized by the allpowerful politicians scheme it was extortion alone that seemed enough to pursue the moneylaundering charge yet the rest of kiritchenkos story complicated matters for it was not a victims tale he quickly became lazarenkos partner often traveling between marin county and europe to serve as bagman well acquainted with european banking he opened swiss bank accounts making sure money from lazarenkos rapidly growing wealth was flowing smoothly out of ukraine the two men flew together to panama to purchase panamanian passports for to allow them to travel on the downlow to switzerland to meet with their bankers and to hawaii and canada to vacation with their families it was a deal so sweet that kiritchenko forgot to stop paying lazarenko when he was booted out of office when lazarenko became a political hot potato kiritchenkos importance to his patron only grew he told earl and boersch now the safety of lazarenkos wealth depended on him with investigators breathing down lazarenkos neck switzerland was no longer a haven thats when kiritchenko approached liverant the coowner of eurofed and bought a discreet place to stash money after a quick trip to antigua to check out eurofeds books kiritchenko paid million for twothirds of the bank soon the two million checks withdrawn from the swiss accounts poured through the bahamas and into eurofed earl and boersch thought they had more than enough they approached robert mueller who was then head of the us attorneys office in san francisco and presented their case muellers reply go ahead indict the grand jury indictment of pavel lazarenko came down in may charging him in a sweeping conspiracy to launder what eventually became million through san francisco financial institutions it would be an international prosecution the likes of which had never been seen the last time the government had put a former head of state on trial armed forces had invaded panama in operation just cause to capture general manuel noriega this time the government enlisted a bay area jury to call a former prime minister to account even so the prosecutions case shared elements of a foreign invasion it represented a zealous expansion of american jurisdiction across the world if lazarenko was convicted it would give us attorneys the authority to judge whether anyone anywhere had committed fraud or extortion under their own nations legal code and then to hold them accountable in us courts as long as their money had moved through ubiquitous dollar accounts the worlds crooks and their cronies werent the only ones watching lazarenkos case anyone in america who moves large sometimes mysterious sums for a living including investment bankers and realestate brokers had a stake in the outcome its illegal to deliberately ignore the tainted source of a deposit so far the fbi and irs have worn kid gloves on such willful blindness cases never once criminally charging a us bank in a moneylaundering case still finance watchers have wondered if the winds could shift in this case the citys bankers were never called to testify yet in august the justice department launched a criminal probe into a washington dc banks possible role in laundering money for former chilean dictator augusto pinochet and other foreign officials lazarenko would not go down without a brawl the millions in his eurofed accounts had been frozen in antigua but he still had hundreds of millions hidden out of the united states reach and spent it freely from jail he hired a string of the bay areas top defense attorneys to argue the united states was overstepping its bounds craftily dragging out the trials approach each time he changed horses over the course of three and a half years university of san francisco law school dean joseph russoniello east bay defense attorney cristina arguedas who assisted on the o j simpson case and harold rosenthal who handled the billionaire boys club case all came and went eventually lazarenko assembled a dream team dennis riordan rosenthals partner and ranked among the nations best appellate lawyers was in charge of motions and legal arguments from behind thick oversized glasses daniel horowitz a deathpenalty lawyer and occasional tv commentator conducted depositions of foreign witnesses in ukraine and across europe then three months before the trial began doron weinberg a tough and preeningly confident civil rights attorney turned whitecollar defense attorney came on to argue the case in court yet center stage belonged to lazarenko during opening statements this past march the twelve bay area jurorsinitially ten women and two menoften glanced furtively at him trying to figure him out lazarenko sitting perfectly upright on the other side of the court was dressed impeccably in an understated black suit during recesses he stood outside in the hall chest thrust forward and hands clasped behind his back drawing his linebackers frame over his gaggle of supporters with whom he consulted in russian lazarenkos wife had returned to ukraine and his twin daughters appeared rarely but his two aides and translators both named yuriy one fat the other skinny were there so was his son oleksandr a thuggishlooking twentysomething with slick black hair who was often mistaken for a bodyguard but no member of lazarenkos posse drew more whispers than oksana tsykova a blonde with striking russian features and a growing belly who translated for lazarenko at the defense table a family friend of lazarenkos whod migrated from ukraine to the bay area she was in her third trimesterwhenthetrialbeganandgavebirthdaysbeforetheverdict she would not confirm or deny that they were lovers lazarenko looked like a free man and in a way he was nine months earlier hed been allowed to post his frozen eurofed accountsthough he no longer had control of themas an essentially illusory million bail so he could be released into house arrest in a twobedroom san francisco apartment at an undisclosed location if lazarenko appeared commanding earl was tired and nervous hed spent six of the previous twelve months overseas away from his kids missing much of his youngest childs kindergarten year in preparation for the trial now he would work seven long days a week until it ended six years of digging were at stake wary of legal proceedings that turn into personal dramas the prosecution approached the trial with dry factuality their opening was simple and straightforward boersch stood behind a podium and recited the spare tale of how million made it from ukraine to the united states all she asked the jurors to do was follow the money in doron weinbergs opening argument he conceded many of the factsthe bank records the account balances the elk grove prefabs what he offered was an alternate story the money wasnt criminal proceeds it came from deals made by people unfamiliar with capitalisms rules lazarenko wasnt laundering money he was protecting it from a rival who would do anything to keep a westernminded reformer from impeding his reelection and when lazarenko fled to the united states earl and boersch were waiting with a case handed to them by kuchma and reliant on the testimony of a betrayerkiritchenko this story of foreign intrigue was no stretch testimony was given in russian ukrainian greek macedonian french and dutch witnesses testified via videotape recorded at foreign dispositions that were often not under oath under us law tens of thousands of pages of foreign documents were introduced into evidence from their war room a rented twolevel apartment in opera plaza on van ness avenue lazarenko and his defense team had formulated a threepronged strategy attack the political roots of the case attack the worrisome precedent and attack peter kiritchenko they worked eighteenhour days sandwiching five hours in the courtroom with long stretches spent poring over transcripts and motions the effort was paying off just days into the trial earl and boersch seemed listless wearied by weinbergs relentless crossexaminations and it seemed at times by their own stultifying task earl sat at the foot of the prosecution table running the computer that displayed exhibits boersch and her team of attorneys reviewed transcripts while the videotaped depositions they had taken earlier played on the big screen almost every day earl and boersch tangled with the sprawl of the trial trials had featured foreign records and witnesses before but never to the extent this one did earl had interviewed potential witnesses during five separate trips to ukraine but many simply refused to appear if we say to somebody will you come to the united states and they say no then were sol shit out of luck earl said showing uncharacteristic frustration fortunately for the prosecution its star witness lived on the other side of the golden gate bridge three weeks into the trial the man lazarenko once called brother climbed the steps of the witness box reluctantly he scanned the packed gallery nervously avoiding lazarenkos cold gaze for the next five days kiritchenko dutifully told in russian the story he had given earl and boersch more than four years ago at times he stumbled into the traps weinberg set to impeach his credibility and he even refused to concede that the deals he and lazarenko did in ukraine were wrong but earl thought the defense failed to turn kiritchenko into a liar it might have appeared to be begrudging and it probably was but it was who he is he didnt pretend to be something he wasnt yet the chinks in the prosecution were growing their star witnesss penchant for blurting out the unflattering truth came to a head as he described the day after hed cut his deal with the government when he was released from prison kiritchenko packed his belongings and turned to lazarenko to say goodbye he embraced his friend and gave him a kiss on the cheek and you hugged him and kissed him on the cheek weinberg asked softly during his crossexamination i kissed him that was a judas kiss kiritchenko burst out in reply the crowded courtroom let out a collective gasp the defense had turned the tide the final week of the prosecutions case was a parade of disappointment reticent witnesses had left earl and boersch holding a weak hand and the droning of the videotaped depositions reduced what was initially a capacity crowd to a few hardy souls it was dali on downers the courtroom clock dripping off the wall and into a horizonless tedium the coup de grace came at the hands of a motion to dismiss written by the silvermaned riordan on may judge martin j jenkins threw out twentyfour of the fiftythree counts in the indictment coming down hard on the prosecution for overreaching the scope of the limited ukrainian law that existed at the time it is simply inconceivable to try someone for something that wasnt criminal at the time and place it was committed jenkins told boersch lazarenkos victory was imminent nearly seven weeks into the trial martha boersch and bryan earl appeared ready for the trial to end earls hopes for a conviction were tied precariously to the tangled paper trail hed accumulated the defense meanwhile hammered away at kiritchenkos credibility their threepronged strategy narrowed to a singleminded smear campaign lazarenkos team trotted out ukrainian after ukrainian to testify to the heartfelt friendship between the partners painting kiritchenko as a traitor and liar who had every incentive to turn on lazarenko in the end weinberg argued to the jury it all comes down to this do you believe peter kiritchenko beyond a reasonable doubt the answer came at am on thursday june after deliberating for about twentyfour hours over four days the jurors filed into the packed courtroom the foreman handed the verdict to a us marshal who passed it to judge jenkins he examined it without expression and gave it to his courtroom deputy she stood and read guilty guilty guilty she said it again and again twentynine times in all guilty on all counts and all underlying crimesthe jurors had checked every box on the verdict form lazarenko did not flinch as the verdict was read when the deputy had finished he turned to weinberg and asked where shall i go now weinberg wasnt sure the verdict left confusion in its wake though earl boersch and the rest of the prosecution team quietly accepted congratulations from colleagues who had crowded the courtroom to hear the jurys decision they knew enough to downplay the results by checking every box on the verdict form the jurors had affirmed what appeared to be incompatible theories about what crimes had been committed in ukraine their subsequent refusal to talk to anyone rare in legal circles left everyone wondering whatbeyond exhausted sighswent on during deliberations i dont think this jury had any idea what it was charged with deciding says weinberg and the speed with which the jurors returned the verdict made it hard to disagree and i dont think the united states should be able to impose its view of financial law on the world the defense attorney wasnt alone the precedent if upheld invites a jury to say this just generally looks sleazy says robert weisberg a stanford law professor and expert in whitecollar law it makes prosecutors the moral arbiters of world capitalism but bryan earl was characteristically cleareyed in defending what the government had done we werent out fishing he came to us and he brought his money and he brought himself and he bought a big house and tried to set up his hiding place in the united states earl says with sincerity that doesnt strike me as us trying to impose our will on somebody else in earls mind he was just doing his duty to his country enforcing the laws on the books never mind the precedent or the political fallout but the agents priorities were back in evidence when mueller now head of the fbi phoned earl to congratulate him on securing one of the fbis top convictions ever mueller spoke to a colleague of earls complimented their work and asked to talk to earl but the agent was at his daughters kindergarten graduation where hed asked not to be bothered epilogue pavel lazarenko is still under house arrest in a san francisco apartment government arguments that he should return to jail were rejected he will be sentenced this fall and could face as many as fifteen years doron weinberg and dennis riordan will have many avenues to appeal the convictionthe appeal will begin in and are confident they will make him a free man lazarenkos novato mansion was put on the market for million peter kiritchenko lives in the million condo he owns in beverly hills he will also be sentenced this fall but according to the terms of his plea agreement should face a sentence of no more than thirtyseven months the ukrainian presidential election will take place october president leonid kuchma will not run for reelection but his handpicked successor is expected to square off with a young and popular westernstyle reformer the opposition has promised a revolution if kuchma does not deliver a fair election martha boersch announced she was leaving the us attorneys office she will join the san francisco offices of jones day where she will specialize in whitecollar defense us attorney kevin v ryan a successor of robert mueller in san francisco vowed to prosecute other corrupt public officials at home and abroad using boerschs legal theory and tougher moneylaundering laws passed as part of the patriot act bryan earl still lives in san francisco and works on the eurasian organized crime squad but is interested in joining the fbis international programs to help fellow agents coordinate and assemble similar transnational investigations justin kane is now a freelance writer in washington dc he wrote and reported to catch an oligarch with the support of the center for investigative reporting where he was an intern and an associate his work has also appeared in the financial times the san francisco chronicle and radio free europe he is a graduate of swarthmore college jason felch wrote and reported this story as fellow at the center for investigative reporting in san francisco he has written for the new york times magazine the washington post and legal affairshe is a staff writer at the los angeles times coda shortly after this story was published in october the dioxinscarred reformer viktor yuschenko rode a wave of popular support to triumph pavel lazarenko watched the orange revolution unfold on satellite television from his undisclosed bay area apartment where under house arrest he still awaits sentencing the western media portrayed the bloodless revolution as the victory of democracy over the thuggish postsoviet regime of leonid kuchma and his lackey viktor yanukovych but there are no angels in ukraine yuschenkos first act as president was to appoint a former lazarenko crony yulia tymoshenko as his prime minister in the months after the first fraudulent election tymoshenkos moviestar looks and firebrand speeches in kievs independence square had made her a hero of the orange revolution yet only nine months earlier lazarenkos us prosecutors had cast her as ukraines kenneth lay they argued that she had paid lazarenko an million bribe in exchange for state naturalgas concessions the deal had made tymoshenko at least million with estimates running into the billions and earned her the moniker hazova princessa the gas princess the us charges connected to the bribe were dismissed because no harm to the ukrainian state could be proved but there is no denying the two were close partners during lazarenkos war with kuchma tymoshenkos capital helped fund lazarenkos opposition party when lazarenko fled ukraine she faced the wrath of kuchma who opened a corruption probe into her business activities allegations of bribery money laundering corruption and abuse of power briefly landed her in jail though formal charges were never filed as recently as russian officials issued international arrest warrants for her accusing her of bribing russian defense ministry officials in the mids like lazarenko tymoshenko has dismissed the allegations as political moves by a rival bent on her destruction but even yuschenko who first hired her five years ago to help fight corruption in the energy industry admitted then you need a crook to catch a crook today she is almost equally beloved and despised by ukrainians percent of whom backed yanukovych to supporters she is ukraines joan of arc to critics she is the devil in dolce gabbana her appointment suggests that despite the revolution dismantling ukraines entrenched oligarchyparticularly one created by statesanctioned corruptionwill take more than merely dethroning kuchma for lazarenko however tymoshenkos appointment to the office he once held may be his salvation as this book went to press his defense team had submitted a motion for a new trial arguing that key documents and witnesses suppressed by kuchmas government during the trial may now be available they may be right in her new role tymoshenko will oversee the ukrainian investigators that once hounded her and lazarenko ukraines general prosecutor who provided much of the evidence against lazarenko recently said he embraces the arrival of the orange revolution and closed an investigation into tymoshenko days after she was named prime minister lazarenkos attorneys believe that if their client is given a new trial he almost certainly would go free aided by the glowing publicity of ukraines electoral saga instead of the cast of excommunists who filled the witness box jurors would see lazarenkos old allies in a new light fresh from the victorious battle for democracy that may be optimistic but the story of pavel lazarenko isnt over yet bruce porter a long way down from the new york times magazine you could hear the corrections officer jingle his chain and turn his heavy folger adam key in the lock before the door swung open and jay jones came walking into the visiting room its a big space with a lot of chairs but no exterior windows so jones had no way of knowing the sun shone brightly outside and highup clouds were drifting over the grassland west of oklahoma city dressed in forestgreen pants and shirt with white socks and black shoes he looked more like the guy who comes to fix your dishwasher than an inmate of a federal institution this was the transfer center of the united states bureau of prisons the transportation hub for thousands of state and federal convicts passing through each year on their way from one prison to another jones was part of the cadre or group of inmates who dish up the meals cut the grass and generally keep the facility running i had last seen him six months before on june in an upscale subdivision south of tulsa where he wished goodbye to his wife and his daughter and his soninlaw standing on the steps of their house he had changed considerably since then his ruddy face had acquired the proverbial jailhouse pallor he was down about twenty pounds owing to his distaste for prison food and he wasnt as quick to smile as he had been the previous spring jones who is sixtytwo was starting a fiveyear sentence for conspiracy in what amounted to corporate fraud his former company commercial financial services or cfs had occupied fiftyone floors of the cityplex towers on the outskirts of tulsa which vied with the bank of oklahoma headquarters as the tallest building in the city its business involved buying bad creditcard loans from commercial banks like chase citibank and mbna then chasing down cardholders and getting them to pay the money they owed the idea was to collect more money than cfs paid the banks for the debt cfs also bundled the loans into securities and sold these as bonds to raise the cash to buy more accounts the crime jones pleaded guilty to involved devising a scheme to make it appear as if the company was doing a better job collecting on the bad loans than it actually was which would encourage investors to keep buying the bonds when the truth came out bond sales evaporated the company went bankrupt its fourthousandodd employees lost their jobs and bondholders were left with more than billion in nearworthless paper at his sentencing jones stood before the judge in federal district court in tulsa looking solemn and contrite and said that he was sorry for what he had done he apologized to the investors apologized to his former employees to the members of his family and to any others whom he had harmed either emotionally or financially and for sure there is no argument that jones was sorry for getting caught in private moments however he betrays a bitterness over his treatment by the government the veiled conviction that his transgression wasnt serious enough to deserve prison i did what i did and theres a certain punishment that goes along with that whether i realized it at the moment or not is kind of immaterial he said a few months before going to jail speaking in the tight hurriedup twang characteristic of rural oklahoma i certainly knew it was nefarious a little wormy unethical make no mistake about that but criminal whether i thought that or not i cant remember but i was certainly willing to take the risk fraud honestly the first time i ever looked at that squarely in the face in that light was when the government brought it up here it seemed like i was being a good soldier saving the company but when i was talking to the government about that they said no you did it because of greed they said no you continued the deception the fraud to be able to continue selling the securitizations what happened to jones and cfs received little play outside tulsa and the financial trade press but this kind of story has certainly become a familiar narrative on the american business scene bright prospect starts off in career works hard to build successful enterprise then one day as if contracting a moral virus turns from solid corporate citizen into closet criminal and the startling thing about it is that until that news photo showing him being led away by federal marshals the telltale overcoat draped over his handcuffs not even the people who counted themselves as his most intimate acquaintances would have suspected a thing some of these defendants of course are coldblooded criminals underneathpsychopaths with mbas as a whitecollar criminaldefense lawyer you occasionally meet people who just spend their lives going from one fraud to another and essentially rip people off whenever they can and dont care how many people they hurt says benjamin brafman a defense lawyer in manhattan whose client list has ranged from doctors lawyers and corporate executives to michael jackson and associates of the gambino crime family of brooklyn other kinds of businessclass fraudsters he says become so successful and powerful that they cant imagine that the laws applying to others are also meant for them ive met people in different professions who are simply stunned by the suggestions that they are subject to prosecution that they could end up in jail and the government would have the temerity to take them on in most of the cases he has handled though neither of the characterizations apply its my experience that the preponderance of individuals caught up in criminal investigations in the whitecollar arena are not what people would call evil they do not get up that morning and decide today im going to commit a crime most of these are normal people who end up just getting caught in something that spins out of control as a rule he has noticed the more unassailable a persons background the harder it is for him to take the fall the boilerroom shark the mafia interloper in the business worldthey seem capable of accepting punishment as just a disagreeable cost of doing business but brafman says when a person with an impeccable history with no prior experience in the criminaljustice system suddenly finds himself under investigation or under indictment his world completely collapses around him its much worse than being told you have a terminal illness because when youre told you have a terminal illness everyone who loves you rallies around you and all of your friends and family offer support and compassion and help because they recognize they might soon lose you but if youre suddenly indicted youre a pariah you bring embarrassment and shame into your home and into your extended family you lose your business you lose your money you have the possibility of going to prison the life support you counted on for your entire existence begins to disappear its a terrible terrible thing ive seen middleaged people in my office grow old in front of my eyes and i dont think anyone ever recovers from the experience i met jay jones in late january several months before he had to report to prison and that winter and into the spring we spent a lot of time talking and driving around rural oklahoma in his powder blue cadillac deville he liked the deville for the wideexpanseitgavehimbehindthewheelandwedroveinitto visit some of the milemarkers in his lifedown to shawnee where he and his wife jennifer began their marriage to muskogee where he had started up the company with his business partner bill bartmann the driving helped distract him from thinking about what lay ahead trying to be helpful a friend had given him a handbook called down timea guide to federal incarcerationwritten by an exinmate who counsels whitecollar defendants it told about a monthly spending limit at the commissary the three hundred monthly phone minutes and the rules on visitation but it said little to ease the anxieties that ranked uppermost in joness mind he had seen the prison movies would the guards down there be nasty to him what about the other inmates would he be safe one morning we headed up to blackwell in the wheatgrowing area near the kansas line where jones spent his boyhood and where he hadnt visited in several decades a thick wet snow was falling so you couldnt tell where prairie left off and sky began blackwell loomed in the distance by virtue of its grain elevators shooting up at the south end of town driving onto main street jones was taken by how many of the old brickfront stores had gone out of business or had been replaced by curio shops offering up relics of the towns past no more sears no more jc penney a single walmart can pretty much clean out half of one of these little towns he said jones came from humble origins and started out in the workaday world while still in his teens his father spent most of his adult life as a route man for wilson foods taking meat orders from smalltown butchers he died of a heart attack at age fiftyseven while fixing up the camper truck he planned to take on fishing trips during retirement to earn extra money the whole family would go out on weekends picking pecans at local orchards joness younger brother joe about half his size climbed up to shake down the nuts so the others could scrabble for them on the ground unlike his straightarrow brother jay admits to taking a few financial shortcuts as a boystealing change out of the newspaper racks on main street charging a carton of cigarettes at the corner store supposedly for his mother then selling them to his friends jay was more the adventurous one more willing to go the route take the risk said joe now a preacher who teaches physical education at a college in lawton oklahoma i was more one in the hand is worth two in the bush his was lets shake the bush and see what comes out their boyhood differences persisted into later life our folks grew up in the depression and raised both of us that the object of life was to find a big company a stable environment find something that is solid and stay with it said jay whose cheerful jokey personality tends to mask the real thoughts churning around in his head joe pretty much has done that and i did for a long time too worked for wilson foods for thirteen years and had a pretty decent job but i just came to the conclusion one day that people who did well financially were those who had their own business and i figured if i was ever going to do anything id better get on with it and so i did and its been a roller coaster ever since after failing at several different ventures jones ran into bartmann a lawyer who had moved to oklahoma from des moines and had gone bankrupt selling oil pipes together they started cfs in and in the next decade made it into a huge financial success in addition to his regular salary of millionand that was tax free since every april the company also covered whatever he owed the irsjones took an annual distribution from company profits to the tune of several millions more and since cfs was a partnership and jones owned percent of the company on paper his net worth added up to between million and billion in those months before prison when he wasnt sleeping well and his eyes would blink open at two or three in the morning jones would sometimes kill the time until dawn by taking a sorry inventory of the material riches in his life that were now lost he would think about the million fourteenthousandsquarefoot dream house that he and his wife had started building south of tulsa as conceived it had granite walls and huge gables a main staircase inspired by the one in tara from gone with the wind and two artificial ponds connected by a waterfall to people driving past it would have looked as if someone had managed to airlift in a fullblown chateau from one of the wine regions of france it didnt look that way at the moment to be sure right then it sat forlornly in a field of mud its siding wrapped in tar paper and its windows open to the rain and the snow around it was a chainlink fence with a big padlock on the gate and a sign advising people that the us government had a lien on the property he also thought about those trips in the companys million fifteenpassenger gulfstream giv which he ordered up for spurofthemoment vacations for his wife and two grown daughters and their husbands and two or three other couples as well fly to paris and the caribbean to bulls games in chicago frontrowcenter seats put it all on the company tab as a business expense give all that money to the government it would only waste it most frequently he and jennifer flew to las vegas where they both gambled heavily joness game of choice was craps and he could easily drop in a weekend her husband playing craps is a picture that jennifer still keeps in her head she loved the way he would try to make a point bent out over the table his fist shaking with the dice and a foot flailing loose in the air i find it hard to describe what it was like jones said about being so suddenly so rich it was the realization when you walked into a store no matter what kind of store it was not that you could just buy anything you wanted but that you could buy the whole store it was a feeling i dont know if power is the right word more id say awe another thing feeding on his mind those nights was how he might have provided his life story with a more positive ending aside from the criminality involved the downfall of cfs had its roots in the companys very success in the late nineties it grew so fastfrom fewer than two hundred employees in to twenty times that number just three years laterthat it lost the personal touch on the telephone that had produced such a high rate of return back in the early days when he and bartmann were calling debtors they developed a patter that was sweet as peaches jones recalled first you get into their minds let them know youre there and youre not going away then you get into their hearts create a friend im here to help you not hurt you harass you we dont want to see you suffer i been there myself i know how it feels then after you get into their minds and their hearts you get into their pocketbooks the ability cfs developed to wheedle money out of former deadbeats had generated an a rating for the bonds it sold to investors that meant more money so cfs could buy more loans but with collections beginning to flag in early it needed the bond money even more not only for new loans but also to pay the interest and principal on previous bond issues that could no longer be covered by loan collections in essence cfs embarked on a gardenvariety ponzi scheme borrowing hundreds of millions from new investors to pay off old ones hoping somehow that collections would pick up in time to cover the difference as a stopgap measure cfs started selling off some of its loans to a firm in chicago to make it appear to investors that its collectors were still reaching their monthly goals that september however the chicago company announced that it would buy no more loans and cfs suddenly faced disaster what happened next is the thing jones now regards with deepest regret although he founded the company with bartmann his main task as vice president had been to devise the computer program that rated the collectability of the loans once that was done he largely stayed on the sidelines came into work when he wanted practiced his guitar in the office he recalled here i am sitting out there fat and happy ive got millions in the bank and many more millions in the company and a gazillion dollars as far as net worth i mean cash unencumbered when i was worrying about the cost of the house we were planning the accountants told me you fool youre worth so much money you dont have to worry so in late september of ninetyseven somehow i became aware the chicago company is not going to buy any loans this month bill had this amazing ability to convince you to do something before youi have a hard time describing thisbut he could in some manner plant a thought in your mind to make it your idea before he proposed the idea or even brought it up hes a great thinker and somehow i became aware we are not going to reach our goals in september and if we dont i thought at the time in all probability its going to destroy our bond rating so i said hell i got the money in the bank ill buy em and bill says you cant do that youre an insider and i said what if i find somebody to do it for me and he said maybe bartmanns attorney did not return calls that very day jones recalls he phoned a lawyer friend down in shawnee and got him to set up a straw corporation called dimat into which jones fed money from his share of cfs profits so that the company could begin purchasing loans from cfs as a replacement for the firm in chicago the scheme provided camouflage for a year to the tune of million in bogus loan purchases then in october an anonymous letter arrived at standard and poors one of the rating firms that had been giving cfs bonds their a rating the letter revealed that dimat was really a sham corporation and that all its purchases of cfs loans were a ruse paid for by money from cfs itself to give investors a false picture of the companys financial health virtually instantly the market for cfs bonds dried up with no cash coming in the company defaulted on payments to previous bondholders bankruptcy ensued and by the following july cfs was no more needless to say this was not the way jones thought things would turn out in his mind the dimat scheme was only a temporary arrangement to give cfs managers time to get collections up to their previously high level the choice was certainly mine whether i fully realized it or not at the time jones told me that first time when it started the company wasnt in that bad trouble but as it got further i should have recognized that if wed quit after the first two times if we did that there would still have been no harm no foul we could have simply said guys weve missed the projections here we could have said were going home and youve got to figure out what to do i wouldnt have liked that it wouldnt have been great for investors but certainly there would have been no criminal activity a blizzard of investor suits rained down on jones and bartmannas well as its whiteshoe law firm mayer brown and platt in chicago which had advised cfs on how to sell bonds based on nothing but deadbeat debt and also chase securities which had vouched for and sold many of those bonds the workings of the fraud however proved so complicated that it took the us attorneys office in tulsa three more years until the end of to sort things out at that point bartmannwho owned percent of the company and insisted that he knew nothing about the dimat scam that it was joness idea alonewas indicted on fiftyeight counts including conspiracy bank fraud mail fraud wire fraud and money laundering all of which added up to a possible seven hundred years in prison jones on the other hand was allowed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy as part of his agreement to testify against bartmann whose trial was set for the fall of in joness mind it was bartmanns fault anyway that the company had ended up selling more bonds than it had the capacity to pay off a takenoprisoners entrepreneur and a mesmerizing salesman bartmann harbored a streak of grandiosity remarkable even given the brash and bold style of oklahomas business world on outoftown trips he traveled with an entourage of armed security men who talked in code words over secret servicestyle radiophones and for one company outing he chartered a fleet of boeing s to fly some three thousand cfs employees and their spouses to las vegas for the weekend gave them each to spend at the tables and then strode onstage for a pep rally at the thomas and mack arena dressed as julius caesar instead of selling a bond issue for say million if we had sold it for million the company would still have prospered and grown not as dynamically but the collection goals would have been achievable jones said but nooo we cant do that bartmann had bought and sold stuff his whole life and if he could sell something for ten youd be a fool to take five my former partner if i had to describe him in three or four words it would be he always tended to take a bridge too far if bartmann was the one who steered the company into choppy water it was jones who proposed breaking the law to get it out an action the government insisted came out of pure avarice when it comes to looking out for himself jones seems to allow a degree of moral wiggle after he had to stop construction of his dream house he bought a gothic stone structure in south tulsa for in cash and then put it in his wifes name should any of those angry investors persist in coming after him for recompense after he gets out of prison he also shielded himself by making jennifer go through a divorce of convenience last spring and asked the judge to set alimony at a month if a court ruled that the alimony took precedence over joness enormous debts the first he might someday make each month could effectively be his his daughter holly thirtysix a graduate of oklahoma state university who for a while worked as a midlevel manager at cfs says that she thinks there was also a psychological dimension to why her father did what he did something deeper than avarice what he did was totally plausible to me said holly who lives in dallas with her husband and who gave birth to joness first granddaughter shortly after he went to prison i had seen some of the fights dad and bill had had dad ended up doing nothing they excluded him from everything future planning he sat there and watched tv and played his guitar as humble as he is hes just like any other person who likes to think hes important i can see my dad would do this for bill by virtue of the fact that here was his chance to say hey im doing something im making a difference im helping to save the company maybe some of thats true but jones also admits that along with saving the company he had this other idea of taking over those million in cfs loans himselfthe ones that he had bought surreptitiously through dimatand setting up a junior version of cfs in nevada as his own company handy to the gambling casinos he even formed a shell corporation for this purpose called card services of nevada the plan was that id leave cfs and it pretty much stayed as that throughout the whole period then one day that anonymous letter bubbles up winter passed into spring a lushly green period in eastern oklahoma and jones was trying to keep himself busy he bought a smoker which he used for practice in barbecuing great slabs of meat thinking that maybe he would open a ribandcountrymusic place after he got out of prison he also worked on a list of things he had long wanted to do but had never found the time forseeing the chicago cubs play at wrigley field taking a rafting trip down the snake river in idaho jennifer meanwhile often sat alone at home not holding up so well for one thing she had acquired a bad case of paranoia imagining that out of anger over her husbands coming testimony bartmann was devising ways to harm the jones family she feared that people hired by bartmann were following her while she was out on shopping trips returning home she was sure a bartmann intruder had been in the house and had moved things around in the kitchen to frighten her her doctor put her on klonopin and paxil and she took ambien so she could sleep she was also drinking more than her daughters thought was useful and she began to see a psychotherapist im still feeling numb so i cant tell sometimes if i have any feelings at all she said dr ferraro says i need to make more concrete plans about what my life is going to be like after jays gone he says what i want you to do for us is to think of ways youre going to live but sometimes i just get to cryinglike i missed an appointment with dr ferraro because all i did that day was i didnt get out of bed just spent the day crying whatever its ups and downs her married life ranked as a definite improvement over what she had been through as a child growing up in shawnee the family lived next door to the sinclair filling station run by her father who was a fearsome drinker and a womanizer and had wreaked havoc on the family right until he committed suicide in his garage via carbon monoxide fumes a brother she had been close to died in an automobile accident her sister was murdered by her husband with a shotgun at the end her family had dwindled down to just her mother and her i went from my mothers house when i was eighteen to marry jay jones and i have never been alone my whole life she said that spring i dont want to live in this house by myself its just so big and im terrified of being alone there are so many places for people to hide along with her fears of being alone jennifer nurses a deep and growing anger at her husbandnot quite so much for how he wrecked their lives as for not telling her about his crime until the day after he made his plea bargain with the government and knew he was going to prison when this first unfolded for me i didnt understand a lot about what happened because i couldnt really understand what cfs did in the first place said jennifer who talks in a littlegirl voice that is sometimes hard to hear the three of us sat in their family room forsythia bloomed all over their yard and miss celie their fluffy maltese pranced around the inchthick white carpet in front of a giant tv set really i dont know what you did jay she said gazing at her husband across the room if i had to tell people what my husband did for a living this is what i would say he bought loans at a certain percentage and sold them for more thats all i could tell you and jay did not tell me about what happened until the night before he had an appointment with his lawyer who was going to tell me about it the next day but somehow jay blurted it out that night that he was in trouble he told me the details but all i can remember taking from that is he did something wrong i always told him when he went with bill bartmann youve got to tell me ive got to be in on the decisions and he never told me because if he had told me if anything had been suggested that was improper in any way i would have said no i really believe thats why i was always left out of everything i know it was the reason after his case hit the front page of the tulsa worldjay more or less went directly to ground he stopped attending services for instance at the harvard avenue christian church a modern brick edifice where his younger daughter terri taught preschool and where he usually sat front and center with his wife on sundays singing loud enough for everyone to distinguish his voice its kind of like someone dies he said what do you say sorry for your loss i just didnt want the people i would come into contact with to have to come up with some kind of statement like that his minister the rev stephen wallace was one of the few people the us attorney allowed jones to talk to about details of his plea bargain and jones went to see him right after he knew it was all going to be made public mainly what i did was listen and ask how can we be helpful to jennifer and the daughters wallace told me the jones family was also on the churchs telecare list which meant they would get called every now and then to see if they wanted a prayer said for them in absentia jones wasnt his first congregant to run afoul of the law by any means but wallace found this sort of counseling somewhat challenging how do you show mercy on the one handyoure a caredfor person youre an important person in gods eyes god sees us all as preciousbut at the same time say that what they did was wrong it was hurtful to a lot of people sometimes people are willing to accept that kind of thing and sometimes not they say i didnt do anything and a lot of times you dont know what really did happen but since jays consistently said i messed up here it made it easier we could move on to a message of forgiveness and grace and then repentance as the reporting date closed in jay and jennifer began to peel away their early hopes that some kind of miracle would keep him from going away on may of last year when the federal judge put his imprimatur on the sentencing deal jennifer relinquished her illusion that maybe he would get some sort of housearrest arrangement quite to the contrary she learned unlike the state variety federal sentences are served in full with no possibility of parole the most jones could hope for was a percent reduction for good behavior which meant the earliest he would be out was the end of september in a letter sent to his lawyer joness doctor tried to get him special consideration saying he was deeply concerned about what prison might do to his health he had suffered two heart attacks after all in and the last around the time he learned of the anonymous letter to the rating agencies and was taking three different medications for high blood pressure joness lawyer robert nigh a former public defender who represented timothy mcveigh in the unsuccessful appeal of his death sentence recommended against sending the letter on to the bureau of prisons their likely response would be to assign jones to a special medical facility out of state which would make family visits difficult neither was jones getting any comfort from his prison handbook which suggested that his agreement to testify for the government at the bartmann trial in september would not exactly endear him to the other inmates the onlyi guess disturbing would be the right wordthing out of the whole book that i saw would be and its just something ill have to deal with i guess is they dont like rats he said early in june as we drove the deville down to check out a barbecue place outside of shawnee one thing the author seems to focus on is keep to yourself mind your own business leave everything alone and dont rat anyone out which is understandable but i guess ill just have to risk that and i could justify that by saying i guess id rather get the expletive beat out of me four or five times than i would spending another fifteen or twenty years in jail on friday june with just three more days to go before prison jones announced that he would like to put on his special electric blue porter wagoner suit and his highcrown white cowboy hathis tom mix hat he calls itand drive up to play country music that night in chelsea fifty miles north of tulsa jones has played the guitar ever since he was a boy mostly songs from the fifties and sixties dealing with loss heartbreak and premature death of girlfriends and close relatives his suit had been tailormade by the famous manuel of nashville sewn with thousands of sequins in a gambling motif with cards and dice and dollar signs it cost and was in the style of the one manuel had made for wagoner to wear at grand ole opry shows he had worn it only three or four times since he bought it in which was obvious that night from the difficulty he had buckling his trousers jones would play country music anywhere they allowed him to but he particularly liked going up to chelsea because hardly anyone knew him there the gig was at the civic center near the burlington northern railroad tracks where every friday night thirty or forty farm couples many in their seventies and eighties gather for potluck supper and to push and pull one another around the dance floor jones usually plays backup rhythm but this time he stepped up to the mike to employ his thin reedy voice in service of a bluegrass song that started off theres a cabin in the pines in the hills of carolineand a blueeyed girl is waiting there for me during a smoking break outside he took some ribbing about how porter wagoner must be missing his suit by now when the lead guitarist in the group who hits more than seven feet in his boots and cowboy hat slipped jones a piece of paper with his name and address on it and said quietly out of anyones hearing you write me a letter and ill write ya back june started with a blinding rainstorm that for half an hour forced cars on the freeways encircling tulsa to pull off to the side jennifer had taken two ambiens the night before but still didnt manage to sleep jones was awakened at am by the cat pouncing on his chest the prison wanted him there by noon and i volunteered to drive him the two hours down to oklahoma city because friends had advised it would be too wrenching for the family to drop jones off holly wasnt there because the doctor said that she was too close to her delivery date to travel up from dallas jays younger daughter terri twentynine arrived with her husband jay q and a dozen krispy kreme doughnuts while jones attended to a list of last things to do yes he fitted a fresh propane tank onto the cooker out on the deck yes he canceled his cell phone and he told jennifer where to go in case of a tornado get down into that little closet in the basement where she keeps miss celies dog food he says the whole house can blow away and that room will still be standing terri started reading out of the prison manual daddy it says to take your eyeglasses and a lot of change for the vending machine sweetheart they dont let you have money yes they do and you can take your wedding ring and jennifer cut in to tell him not to forget his medicine mom i dont know if you can take your medicine terri said this made jennifer start to cry he has to take his medicine no he can take his eyeglasses he can take his bible or a religious medal and he can take his wedding ring as long as it doesnt have any stones and thats it as it neared am jones wanted to get going get it over with he hates goodbyes jennifer if it comes down to it and you have a choice to make between taking the advice of some psychologist or your daughters take your daughters advice they know you better jennifer wasnt hearing much because she was sobbing uncontrollably oh jay she said you know this is the first time i havent had to pack for you when youre going somewhere they hugged for two or three minutes at the front door and then jones broke off and got in the car and waved home for jones now is an eightfootbyfourteenfoot room in f pod on the seventh floor of the transfer center a newly constructed highrise near the will rogers world airport it has orange brick walls and tall slit windows eight inches wide that from a distance look like the loopholes in a medieval castle he sleeps in the top bunk and shares a toilet and writing desk with his cellmate a fiftysixyearold whitecollar offender also from tulsa following the advice in his handbook jones doesnt want to say what crime he committed like jones permanent members of the service cadre are doing time mostly for nonviolent offensesparole violators on drug charges counterfeiters child pornographersand no fighting is tolerated the only major fight on joness pod so far occurred one morning when he was awakened by two inmates trading blows just outside his door spattering blood all over the dayroom floor from what jones heard it was over a piece of chicken smuggled in from the kitchen both men were taken immediately to the special housing unit or hole and shortly thereafter transferred to a higherlevel institution for a time joness job was in the prison library where he photocopied pages for inmates law cases and wheeled around the book cart he regarded it as the highlight of his day taken up otherwise by watching tv and playing endless rounds of bridge and pinochle with three of the older inmates recently he was reassigned as an orderly on the smoke deck an outdoor area covered with razor wire where he picks up butts and wipes down tables his family sends him books but he never got much pleasure out of reading weekends are the hardest because of the utter boredom he says you dont work but you get up at the same time because you can only sleep for so long and then theres nothing to do his spirits rose considerably last august when the chaplain issued him an old guitar to practice with in his room so he could play along with the hymns during the thursday and sunday services he lost the guitar though when he was transferred to the tulsa county jail for the bartmann trial and it was given to someone else adding to his disappointment was the fact that unlike jones bartmann ended up getting off without any punishment the government put up fiftythree witnesses and spent thirtyeight trial days laying out its case but besides what jones had to say its evidence was all circumstantial after a week of deliberation the jury decided that the us attorney had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that bartmann knew anything about the dimat scam they voted to acquit joness testimony for the government was covered heavily in the tulsa paper which meant it got all over the prison a few of the inmates now snub him in the cafeteria but not many he says the rat issue is one that doesnt bother me he says there is a certain population very small maybe ten percent that that would bother but the people who have a problem with it are generally not the people i would care very much about anyway joness visits from family membersspread among jennifer and his daughters and his brother joe they average one every weekend also come with a certain amount of discomfort depending on the guards mood of the day jones may or may not be required to strip naked after the visit and bend over in a duck squat so that anything secreted in his anal cavity would drop out onto the floor the one plus side of prison is that he is now getting a full nights sleep better than i have for four years he says after all ive got no worries anymore the only worries you have are the ones you create and its hard to create one in here its a very controlled very organized environment anticipation of the unknown was a factor before and now that thats been realized theres nothing left it is what it is and you learn to live with it as for jennifer to the general surprise of her family she seems to be doing just fine ive enjoyed myself going to movies out to dinner she said last december as miss celie still pranced about on the plush carpet outside there was a forsale sign on the lawn and jennifer had been looking for a smaller place near hollys in dallas i wondered what it would be like being without a man but its kind of fun she said do you know every strong relationship that i had with another woman jay has always made fun of she now sees dr ferraro only every other thursday and misses no more appointments because she is in bed crying right now were going through my hate for my husband she said i love him but i get so mad at himthinking what he did just boggles my mind sometimes dr ferraro suggested that when the time is right i write jay a letter and tell him how i feel sometimes when i go see him i want to tell him yes its hugs and kisses and love right here but i cant tell you how i feel in front of the inmate population and the guards sometime weve got to discuss that this is a big and brandnew experience for me i dont have as much animosity toward bill as i did when you get down to it jay has to accept responsibility for his actions and he cant blame it on somebody else he says im sorry i dont know why i did it he can say that all he wants but i think he thinks everything is hunkydory which it isnt you know i love him and im not going to leave him its just that saying im sorry sometimes is not enough bruce porter is the author of blow a story about the rise and fall of a cocaine smuggler that was made into the movie starring johnny depp and penelope cruz he writes frequently about guns drugs and prisons for the new york times magazine and on different subjects for gourmet and other magazines he teaches at the columbia university graduate school of journalism where he is special assistant to the dean and he lives with his wife and daughter in the cobble hill section of brooklyn coda my editor thought that hanging out with a corporate miscreant in the months before he goes off to prison would make for a good story and one that no one had written yet the reason no one had as i quickly found out was that none of these guys would talk to a journalist lawyers warned their clients that for an executive to talk openly about his crime would not sit well with his soontobe fellow inmates and their wives and children had faced humiliation enough at school and the country club to now have the story spread all over the newyork times magazine then one day in january i got a call from jay jones down in tulsa oklahoma hed heard i was looking for a corporate crook to follow and said that he might fill the bill in that hed perpetrated a fraud at his company that had cost investors more than billion the story had been all over local papers so he had nothing left to hide and it was six months before he had to report to the federal prison in oklahoma city to begin his fiveyear stretch being gregarious as well as the sort who couldnt abide sitting around doing nothing he felt that talking to me might at least do to fill up his remaining time when he picked me up at the tulsa airport in his cadillac deville i knew right away wed get along fine one oldcar freak to another so for two or three days every month id fly down and wed drive that deville around rural oklahoma visiting the little towns where he had spent a threadbare childhood wed eat at outoftheway barbecue places and jay would fantasize that after finishing his sentencehed be sixtyseven by thenhe was going to open up a rib joint of his own talked about a special rub he thought might bring in the crowd and he played country guitar at friday night dances where id push old ladies around the floor as jay sang winsome songs in his highpitched voice about the simple life that had long disappeared i also drove jay down to the prison on the final day his wife and two grown daughters having been advised that wishing goodbye at the gates would be too filled with pain the last i saw him was when the correction officer rolled open the chainlink fence at the inmate entrance and put his hand on jays arm and said to me you can go now sir and they disappeared behind the walls a little while ago i got word from jays daughter holly that hes getting along okay except for the bland food and the tremendous lack of activity and recently they gave him back the prison guitar for accompanying the hymns sung at weekly chapel services the deal was he could keep the instrument in his cell to practice on and if sound could travel all the way up to new york city im sure right now that along with the church music id be hearing him sneaking in a few of those sad songs about the days gone by jeff tietz fine disturbances from the new yorker united states border patrol operations above the texas stretch of the rio grande often begin with a single tracker on foot staring at the earth in the border patrol tracking is called cutting sign cutting is looking sign is evidence no technology is involved trackers look for tread designs printed in the soil and any incidental turbulence from a footfall or moving body they notice the scuff insignia of milling hesitation at a fence and the sudden absence of spiderwebs between mesquite branches and the lugubrious residue of leaked moisture at the base of broken cactus spines the dry time is a stopwatch the best trackers know whether scatterings of limestone pebbles have come off human feet or deer hooves they particularly value shininessa foot compresses the earth in one direction which makes it shine and wind quickly unsettles this uniformity so highshining groups are irresistible lowlight cameras and nightvision goggles and thermalimaging scopes and seismic sensors are useful along the river but in the brushland north of it pretty much the only thing to do is follow illegal immigrants on foot nearly every southern border patrol station maintains a network of footprint traps called dragstwelvefootwide swaths of dirt that are combed every day with boltedtogether tractor tires ballhitched to the back of an suv agents monitor drags endlessly and follow foreign prints into the brush one morning just after dawn i was out with an agent named mike mccarson he was driving a customized ford f down a ranch road cutting a drag that ran alongside it the rio grande was close the sky was unusually congested the drag and the ranch road extended out of sight through mesquite and pricklypear cactus and purple sage and huisache and whitehorn all semiaridly dwarfish the horizon was visible everywhere driving about eight mph mccarson leaned out the window a bit his hinged sideview mirror folded flush with the door mccarson is fortythree he has been tracking illegal immigrants for eighteen years he works out of the border patrols brackettville station which is about twenty miles northeast of the rio grande and thirty miles east of the town of del rio brackettvilles hundred and twenty agents are responsible for a twentyfivehundredsquaremile rectangle of mesquite flat and limestone breaks no more than forty agents are ever in the field at once one per ninety square miles federal guidelines recommend that undocumented aliens be apprehended at least five times before theyre charged with illegal entry and held for trial but brackettvilles agents rarely detain people unless theyve been caught more than fifteen times on any given trip an illegal immigrants odds of eluding brackettvilles defenses are extremely good immigrants can angle in from anywhere along a fiftymile stretch of the rio grande and overpowering numbers of people often cross the river simultaneously brackettville doesnt have the personnel to track more than five groups at once its just the luck of the draw which ones we chase mccarson told me as we drove we generally dont even work groups as small as three four people or groups that happen to have crossed real early the night before i spent many days with mccarson cutting drags and trails and meandering through mesquite in the f he is a big sauntering freewheelingly mouthy guy who says tars for towers and boocoo for beaucoup a word he uses a lot sometimes as a noun theres boocoos of trails through there mccarson instinctively registers the happenstance ambient comedy of ordinary life sometimes with a falsetto arcofjoy cackle he likes to stop for lunch on hillsides and in old seminole cemeteries and he can be precipitately melodramatic now the seasoned journeyman agent will see the totality of circumstances in his area and know precisely whats normal activity and whats not mccarson is married but doesnt have kids which may partly explain his widely entrepreneurial imagination he owns a scuba business on lake amistad hes a partner in a san angelo realestate venture hes a successful selftaught stock picker on the drag we were seeing a lot of overlapping clovenhoof sign like combinations of the alphabets last four letters agents have found sign of people crawling across drags on their hands and knees long chutelike impressions and sign of people tiptoeing across drags shoetip abbreviations and sign of people walking across drags backward in socks blunted images kicked soil revealing the true direction of travel someone once walked across a drag on his hands profound torqued handprints the man was followed from the drag to a railroad siding where the prints transformed themselves into elongate gouges in the embankment stones running hard hed jumped a freight sometimes illegal immigrants will survey drags until they find a particularly rocky stretch and cross there stepping only on stable rocks as if they were fording a stream if yielding terrain frames the rocks they leave almost no sign ideally a tracker will find fresh prints on a drag follow them until he can establish a line of travel and radio in the groups drag coordinates its heading and its tread profile then another agent will cut the group on a drag some miles north or northeastall the sheltering towns and safe houses and freight tracks and pickup points lie that wayand either catch it or radio in a revised line allowing a third agent to leap up to the group in practice its often impossible to categorically identify a group establish a line or get a forward cut because the surest way to identify a group is by its distinct assembly of tread patterns trackers use a lexicon of soles super chevron racetrack wishbone eight ball propeller tetris basket weave kmart special rifle sights flintstones hourglass running w matchstick when i was out with mccarson the radio regularly issued sole descriptions a diamondwithinadiamond heel with an instep logo an island running w with a slash in the middle and a fine line a beetle pincer in the toe the increasing complexity of sneakersole designs frequently creates neologisms regions and sometimes stations have their own dialects a sole dominated by lugs in the shape of a z is a zebar in brackettville and a zorro in del rio we cut a blank stretch for a while its gonna be a little quiet mccarson said we havent had much moon the moon is a prime instrument of navigation because it illuminates without stark exposure illegal immigrants also use the sun stars and diverse landmarks a few minutes later mccarson stopped the truck well we got some crossers he said the prints were shallow and had been scrambled by superimposition it took mccarson about thirty seconds to disentangle the tread designs and stride lengths and foot sizes i couldnt find a discrete print group of five he said running w matchstick heavylug boot fine wire mesh starintheheel waffle they were here last night theyre fresh but theyre not smokinhot fresh when the ground is retaining moisture like this and you dont have much wind the sign can hold its shape for a long time but i see a little better color in our prints than in theirs foot pressure concentrating moisture in the soil darkens prints the clock of evaporation steadily lightens them i couldnt see any color difference they could be anytime last night mccarson said and weve had the correct amount of moisture over the correct amount of time to make the ground about like concrete so theyre not leavin much sign if drag prints arent decisive trackers examine a groups sign along the first stretch of trail wary of the corrosive or stabilizing effects of weather and terrainhilltop wind withers prints damp arroyos embalm themand noticing things like insect crossings and preservative soil composition and raindrop cratering every leftbehind object is a potential timekeeper there are rare unambiguous tokens jettisoned cans of beans that ants havent yet noticed sunlit kleenex still clammy with mucus fresh bread crusts on a hot clear day but most often agents encounter noncommittal objectsdesiccated bread crusts in full sun which could be two or ten hours old swinging the shepherds cane he uses as a tracking aid mccarson started cutting just beyond the drag was a strip of mesquite scrub and then freight tracks on a high gravel embankment in the scrub the prints disappeared abruptly as if the group had been choppered out but mccarson read a carnival of sign through the scrub and followed a sequential displacement of gravel up the embankment he pointed to a railroad tie and kept going possessed by the live trail he couldnt pause to explain i sat down and studied the tie it looked like every other tie i began shifting position relative to the obfuscated sun eventually three stacked ws of discoloration collectively the size of a halfdollar shimmied into view on the other side of the tracks mccarson was standing in front of a fence methodically locating the crossing point with his cane beyond the fence the mesquite gave way to scrofulous pastureland the wind picked up and a stopstart drizzle began any moderately heavy rain melts sign toughens vegetation and hardens the arid earth mccarson walked along the edge of the scattershot grasses for a while hesitant and then accelerated he was mainly scrutinizing stalks of buffalo grass and curly mesquite grass and king ranch bluestem the group had pressed the grasses forward now at a vestigial angle the stalks reflected the light more directly like opened compact mirrors whitening it mccarson described this effect later for the moment my experience remained completely secondhandeven after he had amplified the sign by walking right over it my glances fell nowhere i could see that moisture had strengthened and limbered up the grasses instead of breaking and lying inert after receiving their footblows which makes for the brightest reflection they had been rebounding in slow motion for many hours and had nearly regained their posture although adhering rain droplets now pulled them down like sinkers and a jittery wind ceaselessly repositioned them under the dingy droppeddown clouds the reflective power of the grass was negligible and the rainy light shrank the color differences the mesquite thickened the grasses faded out the static of drizzle hardened the ground and corroded the sign this is some tough cuttin mccarson said neutrally the terrain was too stingy for prints but the walkers had scored the earth with the soles of their shoes and mccarson was following the scuff marks which were often the size of fingernail clippings and about as much lighter than the surrounding earth as a no pencil is lighter than a no in cow shit or antprocessed dirt or hoofcrushed earth mccarson found fractional footprints largely dismantled by drizzle and generally separated by a quarter mile they were about the size of suit buttons for retracing purposes he marked them by scraping a line in the adjacent dirt with his cane he kept moving and held the silence of his concentration but there was satisfaction in the absoluteness of the stroke and the granular conclusive sound itself shhhick the ground was still hardening the rainerosion got worse mccarson slowed occasionally bending down a little and poking something diagnostically with his cane but he never crouched and almost never came to a full stop well were just suckin on the hind teat on this one he said a minute later he said oh by god thats them and accelerated down an alley of spectral sign five minutes later he slowed again the odds of following these five are pretty slim in these ground conditions he said were losin so much time just tryin to stay on the sign we wont really catch em unless we take a risk so we held their line and walked fast down numberless seemingly uninstructive trails mccarsons trail choices appeared to be random but he was sensing the path of least resistance relating it to the groups hypothetical line of travel and behavioral tendencies and occasionally seeing candidate sign a few times where the ground turned permissive we swept perpendicularly back and forth hoping for trapped sign after fifteen minutes mccarson said he was beginning to doubt the trueness of the line we walked windingly for maybe a mile suddenly mccarson stopped reached down and picked something up all the quick walking had reminded me that we were operating in undifferentiated wilderness the size of two rhode islands mccarson stood and opened his palm in it was an aspirinsize mud clot distinguished by a solehoned ridge with a strict curvature he handed it to me and kept going a ludicrously deteriorated trail of disturbance had nonetheless held its integrity in mccarsons eyes for about five miles the clot seemed talismanic but we never got a forward cut the weather didnt improve and the trail died we never know who were gonna catch mccarson told me on the way back to the station the weather plays a tremendous role you get into drought conditions and you can run groups until you lose daylight and never stall out a hard rain and you lose all your sign its just shithouse luck if we catch em our real effectiveness is in actin as a screenin mechanism were a deterrent which is not something you can really see out in the field and some agents that might not love tracking get really hung up on that they cant get over it and they turn into sorry disgruntled agents what this job boils down to is desireyou started with a hundred sets of tracks on your drags and youre trying to get ten its not a factory jobtheres no boss youre not stamping out x number of product what determines that you should try to catch those ten when ninety are already gone i know what you really wanna ask which you havent asked it yet is how many get away well they all get away thats the answer eventually they all get away mccarson grew up working on his grandfathers ranch outside comstock which is about fifty miles northwest of brackettville the ranch didnt keep him entirely busy as soon as he was old enough he began hiring himself out to bigger local ranches where he worked through the daylight hours and then traded money at cards and dice in bunkhouses until he could spend it in town on his day off he never felt a desire to leave southwest texas he studied government at angelo state university but by the time he graduated livestockraising in the region had lost most of its commercial viability mccarson had always liked the gunslinging look of comstocks border patrol agents and noticed that they often worked without supervision thats what really did it mccarson told me because i liked to hunt and fish and it looked more like huntin and fishin than workintheyd give you a vehicle and you were on your own when he began tracking he saw immediately that his hunting skills were almost useless for following people border patrol trainees learn to track informally and opportunistically tailing journeymen on live trails and asking questions as circumstances permit mccarson augmented the process by walking exhausted stilllegible trails whenever he could as far as he could which is generally encouraged but not frequently undertaken because agents have to do it on their own time everything you need to know about tracking i can explain in about two sentences he told me youre evaluating the ground for the difference between the disturbance made by humans and the disturbance made by any other force after that its all practice its all just looking a planetary difference in vision separates great trackers from ordinary trackers at brackettville mccarson and about a dozen other trackers occupy a paramount plane theres just a certain level you get to where you cant say whos better mccarson says and i cant even tell you what that level is as far as particular signits just if theres something there well see it one slow day after driving the length of a blank drag mccarson gave me a concentrated lesson we parked at the edge of a ranch road in the adjacent dirt dayold prints held faintly for a while and then disappeared into mesquite mccarson checked the angle of the sign and pointed at the horizon toward the groups destination then he pointed at a deer trail i can see all kinda sign through there he said and strolled off to make a cellphone call but there was nothing to see vacant inflexible earth sparse mesquitebranch detritus mesquite leaves in inconsistent profusion various and occasional flat squareinch plantsbeggarslice horehound hedge parsleyand rare tufts of short grasses all color fell along a drastically shortened mustardoliveash continuum the longer i went without seeing anything the harder i looked at tiny things close by and the more obdurately flawless they seemed mccarson ambled back you wanna see more but you aint he said thats the maximum the earths gonna give you he aimed his cane at some beggarslice i got close and saw that several stalks had been nudged forward and now leaned at a slight angle maybe thirty degrees from their natural posture mccarson pointed to two seedpods the size of ball bearings which had exploded under downward pressure he pointed to a halfinch mesquite twig that listed a little its bark at the contact point was a fineparticulate smear he pointed to a piece of ground the size of a playing card half the stalks in a tuft of buffalo grass were stabbing ardently forward and the adjoining earth had also been compressedonce spherical granules and clods of soil urged down toward two dimensionsand this compression was continuous and equivalent in degree through the two mediums of grass and earth these pygmy symbols were all within six feet but they were isolated camouflaged and enclosed by a lot of pristine terrainthey didnt relate to one another directionally mccarson waited for a moment while my eyes struggled to absorb them and then strolled off my eyes didnt absorb anything i was afraid to move and contaminate the sign id been immobilized by tininess from somewhere in the brush mccarson said into his cell phone did those spearguns come in yet after a while he came back and pointed to a small area in a patch of mesquite leaves which are very thin i couldnt see anything the leaves appeared to be flush with the ground then i got to within a few inches and noticed that they hovered microns above it as if theyd been levitated by some exceptionally weak force static electricity raising arm hairs or surface tension holding water above a glass rim mccarsons areahe kept his cane trained on itwas composed of undamaged leaves that were truly flush with or partially embedded in the earth the compacted region was a few inches long and about the width of a shoe sole see those dingleberry bushes mccarson said they were the size of pingpong balls and from a distance i couldnt tell that theyd been crushed in two dimensions they retained their fundamental color and some unbroken seeds and a remnant network infrastructure the way roadkilled toads can look like living toads minus a dimension up close i saw fine fragmentation and a uniformity of flatteninga broad pad of compressionthat only a shoe not an angular hoof or a puncturing paw could have made sign cutting is overwhelmingly hushed and uneventful but the screen of the ground shows action trackers find bits of skin and sock on the fishhook spines of horsecrippler cactus and watch the stride transformation and inexorable decline in mobility as the injury worsens they watch as groups exhaust themselves and start resting more frequently and as disoriented or fractious groups splinter the day after a moonless night the ground shows walkers equivocally chafing their way through mesquite thickets agents watch as weak people stop so that everyone else can go on and as they later stand up and try to keep going or give up and try to get caught very occasionally in summer the ground leads brackettville agents to corpses death in the brush is notable for the attempts that dying people make to undress a dehydrated overheated body swells as death approaches so the dying remove their shirts and shoes and socks and unbuckle their belts they seem to find comfort in order folding items of clothing and arranging their belongings they prefer to die under the boughs of trees on their backs after a few nights sleeping in the brush people emanate an odor of campfire smoke and sweat that can float for hours over an abandoned campsite in wetter weather the smell of canned sardines persists for a day cutting trails agents step over shit and piss and blood and spit they find handkerchiefs pocket bibles bottles of pert plus and photographs of daughters with notes on the back te extrano regresa a casa pronto te amo isela they find messageboard graffiti on water tanks por aqui paso costa chelo felipe l miguel and the roasted remains of emus doves jackrabbits and javelinas the great majority of illegal immigrants are adult men but sometimes agents find diapers and tampons and tiny shoes as trackers move through diffuse fields of abandoned objects fixing the age of the sign they assure themselves that theyre walking through a groups recent past they want to walk right into its present they want the sign to turn into its authors on live trails the metamorphosis feels imminent because it always could be groups stop unpredictably if your group lays up at the right time youll find yourself disconcertingly deep in a marginal trail yet two minutes from an arroyo filled with snoring the people youre chasing might appear on the other side of every rise you crest because sign is so shifty and strongly insinuating its hard to avoid equating the trail with the people it evokes trackers say theyre running or chasing a trail they say they just caught a trail they say that trail got away the language of tracking treats the sign at the leading edge of a trail as the group itself after cutting a trails frontier trackers say things like theyre in this pasture or theyre right there trying to find a good spot to jump the fence or simply theyre here when you start to see sign everything unrelated to the trail vacates your mind sign cutting is a vigil with no clear object the sign mediums continuously reconstitute themselves you often find valuable dominant indicators but you have to will yourself to remain receptively nonpartisan otherwise youll steadily grow blind to divergent marks and terrain changes will instantly cloak the trail eventually the microworld entrances every plant has distinct attitudes and behaviors beyond the obviousthe way it holds its berries carries and orients and discards its leaves shrivels and responds to wind bends with the weight of raindrops soil classes reorganize themselves uniquely after a rain rocks erode and array themselves in singular patterns and color and form at that scale are infinitely variable a cluster of scruboak leaves is a thousand shades but every medium has beneath its variability a composite architecture and a native range of hues and this is what you have to see because divergence from it is sign if you remain rigidly zoomed in you pick up the endless variations and they hypnotize you and veil the composite you cant memorize precise schemes of coloration and structurealthough the best trackers hold in their heads very good approximations of the hybrid aesthetics of scores of terrain typesbut you can learn to see how particular facets of unadulterated landscape acquire a range of colors and shapes over time so that when you look at a pasture or stream bank or anthill you grasp its physical essence and all its natural deviations and interloping shapes and colors quickly declare themselves to you when rain liquefies the ground beneath branch litter the twigs sink and the liquid soil adheres to the million unique contours of wood and bark and stiffens into a perfect seal later running the trail after the ground has hardened almost beyond compressibility youll unconsciously seek out broken seals millimeterwide earthworks of shattered crust after about an hour and a hundred confirmed sightings the trails autonomous sign began to cohere first it was a stirring paraphrase of recent movement and then an expression of willfulness pressed into the ground the overarching intent of a journey this filled me with an almost violent exultation whose energy was instantly focussed on the next span of information i couldnt help experiencing sympathetic sensations id see a sneakercracked branch and feel it breaking underfoot id see a recently embedded rock and feel my sole bending over it mccarson gradually taught me to look for the identifying rhythm of the trail group size and behavior correspond to a certain frequency of potential sign the potential is realized according to the receptivity of the terrain if two people walk fast and abreast of each other over hard ground while concealing their sign theyll leave transparent traces if fifteen people ingenuously plod singlefile over impressionable earth theyll basically plow a new road our linear group of five was mainly concerned with speed they didnt brush out on drags or attempt to walk along the hard edges of animal trails they didnt bother to avoid printtrapping sandy soil they didnt stop and they left nothing behind without quite realizing it i began to think of them as professionals moving wordlessly in a kind of improvisational accord ultimately i began to see disturbance before id identified any evidence a piece of ground would appear oddly distressed but i couldnt point to any explicit transformation even up close i couldnt really tell so i didnt say anything but i kept seeing a kind of sorcerous disturbance it didnt seem entirely related to vision it was more like a perceptual unquiet after a while i pointed to a little region that seemed to exude unease and asked mccarson if it was sign yup he said really i said really yup mccarson said mccarson experienced this phenomenon at several additional orders of subtlety in recalcitrant terrain after a long absence of sign hed say theres somethin gone wrong there id ask what and hed say i dont knowjust disturbance but he knew it was human disturbance and his divinations almost always led to clearer sign once we were cutting a cattle trailgrazing cows had ripped up the sign which had been laid down with extreme faintness and mccarson pointed to a spot and said im likin the way this looks here im likin everything about this he perceived some human quality in a series of superficial pressings no wider than toadstools set amid many hoofcompressions of powerfully similar sizes and colors and depths i could see no aberration at all from five inches or five feet it was a cow path but mccarson liked some physical attribute and the relative arrangement and general positioning of the impressions maybe he could have stood there and parsed the factorsprobably although you never stop on live trailsbut he wouldnt have had any words to describe them because there are no words a few days later some agents were chasing a group of twelve who had crossed the river well after midnight they had incised their tread marks on many powderedup roads and dragsthe chief identifier was a motion wave with lugs around it in a horseshoe in the heeland tracking conditions in the brush were good so at all points the line of travel was easy to establish and forward cuts came quickly as mccarson drove fast down ranch roads in quest of cuts the radio transmitted updates i got em here at this deer blindthey got a real good shine on em theyre crossing another road right herehold on theres some fresh toilet paper i got em laid up here in a real new jacala branch shelter that illegal immigrants sometimes makeand i got their campfire still real warm around the fire were slick peach pits and cans with sardine juice in thema scene so vibrant it was like seeing the group disappear around a corner this is lookin like one of those rare storybookendin trails mccarson said just clickclickclickclick two cuts later we were at the trails apex where six border patrol suvs and about ten agents had converged the sign described a sudden dispersal into opaque brush the group had heard its pursuers and taken off the agents were staring contentedly into meshes of mesquite a greenandgold border patrol helicopter appeared and dropped to about twelve feet above the thicket raucously rotorwashing everything it nosed around the mesquite for about three minutes and then the pilots voice came stereophonically out of everyones radio saying the group was thirty yards away prone beneath an absurdly undersized camouflage tarp the junior agents surrounded the hiding place and yelled instructions twelve depleted men crawled out the agents told them to sit in a row perfunctorily searched them and began discussing transportation arrangements the captives were all young men without speaking they moved from vigilance to dejection to resignation they received permission to eat and pulled out cokes and canned corn and tuna and slices of wonder bread and plastic jugs of biologically tinted water when i was in southwest texas i watched brackettville agents catch twentysix people in five groupsall except this one by sensor or routine observation or accident every capture was quiet no running no resistance in eighteen years mccarson has drawn his gun two times he has never fired it the captured groups were representative no one had drugs or warrants or enough previous captures to justify detention and criminal charges the illegal immigrants were all adult men seeking work tired and disinclined to flee the chances of escaping after visual contact are slim and the turnaround time is fastthe del rio sector runs a daily shuttle back to ciudad acuna after the capture and patdown agents and immigrants in a momentary common languor stood around and talked sparingly about the weather or the river level or noteworthy episodes from the immigrants voyage we just got lost an older man with a bronchial cough told me one cold dawn after he and his four underdressed companions loitering at a highway intersection had been searched and ushered into a border patrol suv the starsthe stars were our map at night but look at the clouds look at the sky it was impervious and had been for the past two nights once i lay on my stomach in a mesquite thicket waiting with two agents for a group of four that had tripped a sensor the agents yelled and leaped forward only when the men were within ten feet the group seized up and went submissively slack in a single motion after the patdown one man began ruefully emptying from his pockets a collection of pretty rocks for some reason the agents and i looked away walking back to the truck the men began heedlessly climbing a barbedwire fence one of the agents gave them a patient lesson in how to scale it another time a guy whose group had been spotted from the air sociably handed an agent a big rattle and said hed killed a sixfoot snake the agent examined the rattle deferentially shook it said thats a big snake returned the rattle walked the group of men to his truck and locked them in the back now mccarson and a few other senior agents were leaning against an suv watching the junior agents who were watching the detainees finish their food i was thinking that as trackers follow illegal immigrants often right at the mesmerizing limit of what they can detect theyre mustering up the emotions and sensations of mercurial imaginary travelers and then the imaginary is suddenly alienatingly replaced by the real men physically homogenized by days in the brush all with the same propulsive need its a need no border patrol tracker will ever be able to identify with before the twelve men finished eating mccarson walked back to his truck and radioed brackettville to see if anything else was pending jeff tietz is a contributing writer at rolling stone his work has appeared in the new yorker harpers and the atlantic monthly coda one day a friend of mine called and told me to read an essay on tracking that had incongruously appeared on the oped page of a newspaper it was a very short essay but its author had fit in many of the elements that make tracking wondrous i saw that the craft was ancient and sophisticated and beautiful i also recognized the possibility that its tiny mechanics could be shown in action as smugglers ran south shooting over their shoulders as trails led to corpses as trackers racing after guides repeatedly overcame improvised subterfuges the facts i learned in brackettville were dispiriting chasing live trails usually involved a mute guy hurrying randomly through the middle of nowhere he would be understandably very hardpressed to explain what he was doing he would also be very unlikely to catch anybody himself because many widely dispersed agents collaborated on apprehensions apprehensions tended to be sedate and perfunctory realtime chases between smugglers and trackers almost never occurred the chance of discovering a dead body in terrain with shade and seasonal streams and windmill wells was basically zero i went out with border patrol agents for probably ten full shifts asking questions all the time i learned a lot about strategy and logistics but systematic instruction in sign cutting is a foreign idea in the border patrol and incompatible with chasing people i took my besidesthepoint notes home and began working hard to make myself believe in them after a few weeks of extracting staged action and pretend insights from my notebooks i was forced to admit that i hadnt actually seen anything i needed to go back and get lessons ten days however was right at the limit of bureaucratic tolerance it also seemed improbable that the border patrol would pull its best trackers off live trails andor give away many hours of senioragent manpower in order to provide me with intensive training the only thing i could think of was to try and get permission to go out with mccarson again perhaps by claiming that i needed just a few more facts for my story and then pester him for special instruction on slow days it worked and before long came the moment when for no knowable reason multiple pieces of sign appeared to me as a single constellation stephen j dubner the silver thief from the new yorker sometime during the early hours of january a great deal of sterling silver vanished from a mansion near rhinebeck new york the mansion known as edgewater was built in and for decades was the home of a family named donaldson its current owner is richard jenrette a retired financier whose hobby is preserving historic homes jenrette takes his hobby seriously he once tracked down the last living donaldson descendant who had moved to the south of spain and persuaded her to repatriate the familys original silver to edgewater this included a flatware set decorated with the donaldson crest a raven perched on rocks and a dozen teaspoons each engraved with a sign of the zodiac a bow to the victorian interest in astrology and a playful means of marking the seating arrangement all of these items were stolen as were a toddy ladle and a fish server luncheon knives and demitasse spoons a chocolate pot and a sixpiece tea setmany of which were designed by such fine silver makers as tiffany gorham and martinguillaume biennais the mansion also had gilbert stuart paintings and antique porcelain but these had not been taken and some of the lesser silver was left behind furthermore the alarm had not been tripped the burglar had gingerly pried the wooden molding from the glass panes of an exterior door removed the glass and shimmied inside thereby failing to break the alarm contacts on the door jenrette who was at his winter home in st croix when his caretaker phoned with the news speculated that the burglar had some kind of inside connection or had at least visited the mansion edgewater was occasionally open to tour groups and jenrette had recently held a fundraising party for hillary clinton that drew several hundred people he wondered if perhaps one of the guestsor more likely some guests hardup nephew or brotherinlaw who had been told of the partyhad broken into the grand remote house along the hudson river that night there was another burglary ten miles south of edgewater at wilderstein the former home of daisy suckley who was a distant cousin and close companion of franklin d roosevelt suckley gave the president his famous scottish terrier fala again the haul was silver and the job was equally meticulous the method of entry was the same wilderstein had an interior motion detector which somehow had been evaded the state troopers in rhinebeck realized that they were dealing with a specialist the burglar left no fingerprints or clues there wasnt much to do except alert the antiques publications the auction houses and the times which ran a brief article about the burglaries nearly two weeks later cornell abruzzini a police detective in greenwich connecticut was having his morning coffee when a colleague stopped by with the times article doesnt this sound like the silver guy you nailed he asked abruzzini read the article then called rhinebeck and said with barely an introduction i know the guy whos doing your burglaries abruzzini told tom fort the trooper who was handling the case the name of the thief blane nordahl but nordahl had in recent years used various aliases which included david price and robert demiani abruzzini advised fort to check the local motels for all three names on his tenth try at a super several miles south of rhinebeck the trooper got lucky a man called david price had paid cash for a room miraculously the clerk had done what motel clerks are supposed to do with a cash customer taken down information on his cara cadillac sevilleand photocopied his drivers license the picture on david prices license was of blane nordahl he had checked out more than a week earlier several months ago i drove out to greenwich to talk with cornell abruzzini about nordahl abruzzini is a wellspoken fortyfiveyearold who pronounces his last name with brio as if it were an exotic dessert trim with deepset eyes he is bald on top but has dark hair on the sides and a thick beard which has an auburn tinge that night he wore jeans a black sweatshirt and black reeboks he was working a freelance job as a night watchman for an antiques show at greenwichs aging civic center i arrived after midnight and we sat in the lobby at a card table shivering a bit the pipes clanking as we paged through fastidiously organized threering binders that abruzzini has devoted to nordahls case police reports crimescene photographs silver inventories copies of phony drivers licenses abruzzini is considered the ranking expert on nordahl a fact that both pleases and irritates him he is proud of the investigative work he did that led to nordahls arrest in for six burglaries in greenwich yet nordahl seems impossible to stop after completing a prison term he inevitably returns to stealing he has been arrested more than a dozen times for burglary its like watching the same bad movie again and again abruzzini told me abruzzini had interviewed nordahl extensively after the arrest for the greenwich burglaries the silver thief i learned was thought to have stolen at least ten million dollars worth of silver in more than fifteen states though abruzzini is not the sort of policeman who thinks it fitting to compliment a criminal he eventually allowed that nordahl was the most accomplished burglar he had encountered which in greenwich is not empty praise and easily the most distinctive nordahl who is fortythree had a standard method he scouted his locales through architectural digest or the robb report or by calling realestate agents hed tell them that he was hoping to buy a big old home in a settled neighborhood and ask where he should look during a daytime drive he took note of houses that were set back from the road after a nap at his motel and a light dinner he set out at about midnight he parked in unremarkable locations as nordahl once told abruzzini during an interview you have to park where it fits in if it doesnt fit in then you cant park there he often walked several miles through forest or back yards and considered several dozen houses before choosing one nordahl carried two nylon duffelbags an empty one for the silver and a smaller one filled with screwdrivers a carpet knife wire cutters a wood chisel nail pullers a flashlight a white cotton rag duct tape and a wonder bara piece of thin black steel that can pry open almost anything nordahl was good with his tools abruzzini told me and he was patient one night in greenwich he said nordahl spent two hours creating a hole in the door his reward flatware for a hundred and ten people and an exquisite tea service all the while nordahl wore nippletipped cotton gardening gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints after collecting the silver he passed the two duffelbags through the door opening then climbed out he examined the silver for makers marks discarded anything that wasnt worth carrying and hid the bags near a roadunder a bush if possibleon his way back to his car one job he did here he parked four or five miles away abruzzini said how he finds his way to and back its amazing if i gave the same task to seveneighths of the cops in town they couldnt do it within hours of a burglary the silver was on its way to nordahls fence in new york he preferred to deliver it himself to insure top dollar but whenever he was beyond driving distance of new york he sent it by ups malcolm x who as a young man was a burglar in boston offered an account of his former trade in his autobiography i had learned from some of the pros and from my own experience how important it was to be careful and plan he wrote burglary properly executed though it had its dangers offered the maximum chances of success with the minimum risk if you did your job so that you never met any of your victims it first lessened your chances of having to attack or perhaps kill someone and if through some slipup you were caught later by the police there was never a positive eyewitness the average burglar however is lazy sloppy haphazard unimaginative and thus unsuccessful nordahl was none of these but over time his methodology had become as distinctive as a signature thats why nordahl became the prime suspect in the rhinebeck burglaries the moment abruzzini read about them no thief was born as good as nordahl abruzzini told me a thief had to evolveand foul upalong the way if i wanted nordahls complete history abruzzini said i should speak with a retired detective in central new jersey named lonnie mason he had known nordahl for twenty years abruzzini added and he still lived a few miles from where nordahl began his career lonnie and mary mason their four children and a stout german shepherd named lexy live in a yellow clapboard house in avonbythesea new jersey mary is an accountant with the united states treasury department lonnie fifty is now a stayathome dad he keeps his old police files upstairs in dogeared brown folders he has a thick neck a bulky chest and a bristly brush cut and he wears steel aviator glasses while we spoke in the living room masons tenyearold son chris sat worshipfully at his fathers feet mason sunk deep in a big corduroy recliner occasionally yanked the lever a nervous habit mason was a cop for twentyeight years the last fourteen of which were spent as an investigator in the monmouth county prosecutors office monmouth is a pastoral coastal area known for horses old money and colonial tastes perfect for a silver thief mason has arrested blane nordahl twice he spoke of him the way someone might speak of a roguish relativegeneral disapproval moderated by grudging admiration mixed with a sense that you can never be rid of him the first thing mason told me about nordahl was that he had once tried to help him reform i said blane if you ever want to use your knowledge in a positive way id work with you i said you could work in the insurance industry in the area of silver you could work with alarm systems if you want to team up go into a business we could turn this into a crimeprevention program what did he say i asked he said i dont think so nordahl grew up in minnesota and wisconsin mason told me and his parents divorced when he was young his father david became a successful artist who moved to santa fe painting realist apache scenes his work has been collected by steven spielberg and michael jackson his mother sharon held waitressing and office jobs and now lives in indiana as a boy blane was shuttled between the two of them initially he was a good studenthis family thought that he might become an architectbut sometime in high school he lost interest he began cutting class and smoking pot more than anything he was in a hurry to make money so he quit school during the eleventh grade in to take a construction job but he couldnt stay out of trouble his family gave him two choices become a cop or join the navy in his early naval training nordahl won a series of awards and spoke of becoming a navy seal he was eventually posted to earle naval weapons station in colts neck new jersey but in he was arrested for his first burglary the navy later charged him with desertion and he was discharged nordahls first crimes were undisciplined mason told me and bore little resemblance to his mature work he was a common house thief taking whatever was available he usually worked during the afternoon and he visited the same towns repeatedly worse yet he had partners he tied up with a group of guys and started doing jobs mason said after he did the jobs and they rolled over on him when they got caught he decided to go solo nordahl came to consider burglary both a profession and an art he once told a detective that an alleged accomplice doesnt have the brains or the talent or the ambition to be a good burglar taking crime seriously had a bracing effect on nordahl he stopped using drugs and gave up alcohol cigarettes and even caffeine he tried to eat well and he worked out constantly only five feet four inches tall he built himself a gymnasts body strong shoulders skinny hips muscular legs he began to focus on sterling silver this was perhaps nordahls smartest move mason told me in terms of risk versus reward breaking into a home to steal a television set is foolish stealing jewelry requires venturing upstairs into the bedroom but silver is kept downstairs in the dining room or in a butlers pantry far from sleeping homeowners nordahl started spending hours in the library studying the makers vintages and hallmarks of antique silver like a baseball scout lonnie mason liked to keep track of emerging criminal talent when nordahl was arrested in for some burglaries a few towns over mason tried to interview him but nordahl wouldnt talk so mason began to investigate him and learned that the closest thing nordahl had to a fixed address was camden new jersey a ragged city across the river from philadelphia and an hours drive from monmouth county in the spring of there was a rash of silver burglaries in rumson new jersey and mason was called in to consult with the local police at the time most of nordahls robberies took place on thursday nights so on the following thursday evening mason had sixteen men assigned to him for an overnight stakeout they blanketed a twoblock area of rumson by friday morning with no sign of nordahl mason was relieved i thought thank god mason told me maybe he saw one of our guys and called it off just after mason got home and went to bed his boss phoned he said can you tell me why i authorized all this overtime because he hit three houses last night and i said well what section because i know one section he didnt hit my boss gave me the addresses and it was the twoblock radius we were in mason learned to recognize the signs of nordahls presence if someone climbed a telephone pole and snipped the alarm wires that was nordahl later when he got better at evading alarms he abandoned this method if a burglar had somehow stolen the silver without disturbing the pair of rottweilers inside that was nordahl it is the whiff of a persons sweat triggered by adrenaline that agitates a dog but nordahlwhose mother had bred alaskan malamutes was oddly affectless from soil samples taken outside victims homes mason learned that nordahl sometimes used a chemical solution to determine whether the stolen silver was sterling or plate several months after the failed stakeout in rumson mason was sent to investigate a burglary in the town of little silver the burglar had entered an unlocked kitchen window and taken only the sterling mason called for a tracking dog and his forensics man even though he had little hope of finding anything but beneath the open window lay a soft garden bed the burglar had stepped in the dirt climbed through the window and landed on the kitchen counter the result was a muddy sneaker print on the counter i know you cant lift it mason told the forensics man but i want you to photograph that thing for the next three hours until you get a good picture an arrest warrant for nordahl was issued thanks to masons earlier legwork he knew that nordahl was staying at a motel in camden we went down there that night found out what room he was in then called and pretended we were the manageryou know are you checking out tomorrow mason told me we knew he was in there i had the camden county fugitive unit with me and they look like the front line for the eagles we went and we hit the doorand he wasnt in the room finally i see blane hiding behind the door so i reach around with my left handi have my gun outand i grab him i go to holster my weapon he comes out from behind the door he grabs my arm and now were wrestling well we flipped and we went over the tv it looked like something out of a cartoon he went skidding across the rug with me on his backhe got this big rug burn on his cheek and we came to rest on a pair of sneakers i said nah couldnt be we rolled over the sneaker and it had the same tread persuaded by the sneaker print nordahl accepted a plea bargain he served two and a half years of a fiveyear sentence when he was released he returned to stealing but he added an important precaution to his routine after each nights work he would take his sneakers his clothes his gloves and his tools and toss them into a lake or a dumpster mason told me that nordahl had made him a better cop mason had clearly made nordahl a better burglar sometimes he now wore shoes two sizes too large with extra socks so the police couldnt even match his size in december nordahl stole nearly a quarter of a million dollars worth of silver from four homes in essex fells new jersey a tiny town about twentyfive miles west of manhattan in the coming months he continued to work in new jersey the oldmoney fringes of philadelphia and westchester county in new york but according to lonnie mason and to police in various jurisdictions he also began to travel more extensively the outskirts of boston and baltimore much of the loveliest colonial silver is in those areas grosse pointe michigan kennebunkport maine new castle delaware and winnetka illinois in the winter he could be found in miami and palm beach he couldnt help boasting about his abilities and spoke openly of the wonderful movie his life could make starring bobby never robert de niro mason had tried to warn nordahl that he wouldnt be so quick and nimble forever he said he didnt have to be quick anymore because he was so good mason told me he said by the time you get to the scene im out of the state nordahl continued to rob homes in monmouth county on one job he took the silver but left behind a thousand dollars in cash that lay on the diningroom table mason took this as a taunt if an economist were to analyze nordahls operation he might well be impressed economics is at root the study of incentives and nordahl had rationally concluded that the incentives for stealing silver easily trumped the incentives to stop he was essentially a oneman economy and he had pinpointed a valuable yet abundant commodity perhaps most important nordahl had found a weakness in the criminaljustice system robbery was a shrinking discipline burglary rates have fallen by half since the early nineteeneightiesand the jail sentences were light a psychiatrist however might argue that nordahl was driven by an irrational compulsion one former girlfriend of nordahls told me that he was fixated on stealing every night he got high off it she said he liked going into houses when people were sleeping he said its more exciting to go into a house when people are there and get away with it lonnie mason also described nordahls behavior as an addiction this is what he exists for and its all about his infatuation with money mason argues that silver was particularly appealing to nordahl because it connotes the sort of family that passes along precious things from one generation to the next a family that was distinctly unlike nordahls own as mason sees it nordahl remained embittered by his parents divorce he resented his father and became extraordinarily close to his mother when mason got hold of nordahls phone records he was astonished by the number of calls between the two nothing gave nordahl greater pleasure mason believes than stealing a rich mans silver and turning it into cash that he could shower on his motherwho while unhappy about her sons calling appreciated his devotion converting silver into money was the most inefficient part of nordahls scheme according to mason nordahl once revealed that his fence paid him between and percent of the silvers book value for many years he fenced his silver to a man who lived in weehawken new jersey and kept a small jewelry shop in the diamond district of manhattan the former girlfriend i spoke with said that nordahl earned about seven thousand dollars a day which seems high until one considers that he rarely took a night off the size of nordahls assets is unknown a proper assessment would require help from the irs which mason once tried to enlist unsuccessfully nordahl is clearly not a miser a receipt trail constructed by the fbi showed that he once spent nearly twentyfive thousand dollars in just three months and this was only a fractional report covering some of nordahls credit cards but no cash in to catch a thief cary grant plays a retired cat burglar who lives in a mountainside french villa while serving an elegant lunch to an insurance agent he explains why he stole oh to live better to own things i couldnt afford to acquire this good taste which you now enjoy to judge by his receipts nordahls spending was more prosaic much of his discretionary spending took place at walmart and walgreens during one sixweek stretch he spent at walmart alone his clothing came from mens wearhouse and todays man there were charges of and for adultvideo rentals and a bill for from als pawnarama in lake park florida the exgirlfriend told me that nordahl could be remarkably generous she had lost custody of her young son and nordahl paid her legal fees to try to get the boy back nordahl tended to take up with junkies from the camden areawomen who had children but no job someone who could travel with him according to lonnie mason nordahl often supplied a woman with drugs to keep her compliant she never accompanied him on his latenight work but the next dayhemight driveher past thegrand gatedhousesthathehad robbed early one sunday morning in may silver valued at was stolen from ivana trumps house on vista drive in greenwich a few nights later a house on pecksland road several miles to the north lost in silver most of it francis i by reed barton the community was rattled by these burglaries and the police felt pressed to catch the thief cornell abruzzini who had been on the greenwich burglary squad for two years by this time was placed on the case he immediately recognized these breakins as the work of the thief who had committed three other robberies in greenwich the previous summer abruzzini had never seen such clean crime scenes at one house the burglar made a tidy stack of the door molding he had pried off to gain entry abruzzini learned that similar burglaries had recently taken place in east hampton the police there put him in touch with lonnie mason who told the story of blane nordahl and guessed that the greenwich jobs were his work the stack of door molding was classic nordahl mason told abruzzini he was a neat freak and kept his socks arranged perfectly in their drawer mason was eager to help abruzzini catch nordahl but warned that it would be difficult to gather sufficient evidence to arrest him nordahl was so practiced that he was virtually untouchable unless he was caught in the act a week after the ivana trump burglary mason called back nordahl was staying at a super in stamford he told abruzzini with a longtime onandoff girlfriend from new jersey named luanne mason knew this because after years of chasing nordahl he had managed to turn luanne into a confidential informant she was not always a reliable informantat the time she was a drug addict who regularly went back on her wordand she had returned to living in motels with her catburglar boyfriend but at least she had checked in with mason now mason suggested that it was time to scare her into submission the greenwich police staked out the super in stamford one night they saw nordahl and luanne packing up the car although they didnt have enough evidence to arrest nordahl they confronted the pair and handed luanne a cell phone lonnie mason was on the other end oh shit she said luanne you have two choices here mason told her you can either stay on tour with blane and get indicted down the road or you can go with these cops and cooperate luanne started to cry nordahl glared at her mason knew that luanne had a tenyearold son back in new jersey and he told her to think about him not nordahl she cried some more then ended the phone call and climbed into the police car what are you doing nordahl said he warned her that shed be in trouble without him luanne told me since he had her heroin ill get it from the police luanne said a few months later on august nordahl did one more silver burglary in greenwichjust for spite he later admitted to abruzzini luanne meanwhile had started to talk mason used a clever ploy to cement her cooperation he drove to her house and showed her a photograph that had been in nordahls possessiona picture of a blond woman in a white dress posing in front of the manhattan skyline that son of a bitch luanne said she dug out a picture and showed it to mason an identical image except with luanne in it both photographs were taken on a promenade in weehawken she told mason just down the street from the home of nordahls fence now luanne began to provide the greenwich police with many details about nordahl how he obtained fake ids for example by placing counterfeit documents in a toaster oven to artificially age them with the promise of luannes testimony cornell abruzzini was able to get a warrant to arrest nordahl for six greenwich burglaries nordahl must have realized that he was being aggressively pursued because mason couldnt track him anywhere in new jersey he wondered if perhaps nordahl had sought safe haven with his mother in indiana he asked the fbi to put her home under surveillance mason soon got word that nordahl had been spotted driving toward his mothers home his truck full of drywall apparently he was renovating her house fbi agents told mason that they would take nordahl into custody and mason tried to warn them that they were dealing with an escape artist ill never forget it mason recalled it was a rainy nasty day they said we chased him in the front door of his moms house and out the back and hes in a wooded area we have him cordoned off we have helicopters up we got dogs here its nineteen degrees and its going to snow he cannot survive in the woods for any length of time i said how long have you been out there he said oh about fortyfive minutes i said im telling you right now blane is gone blane is probably ten miles away right now call me back when you find out i was right next day i get a call youre not going to believe this he was at a bank withdrawing money by the time we were talking to you on the phone the fbi flagged the credit card that nordahl had used to buy the drywallit was issued to one of his aliasesand began tracing his movements he made it to wisconsin and did some shopping in sparta the town where he went to junior high school and the last place where hed lived within the law the police issued a teletype describing nordahls vehicle which an offduty officer spotted at a walmart inside nordahl was buying fourteen sterilite storage containers and two boxes of trash bags more police officers arrived in the parking lot and they arrested him as soon as he stepped outside the police inventoried nordahls belongings in his vehicle and in his motel room and found among other items nationwide motel directories a video titled how to create a new birth certificatea rubber stamp that read original document and a book called how to launder money he had been traveling with two cats one white and one black named romeo and juliet a series of receipts from various animal clinics suggested that he was a devoted pet owner not surprisingly he had no sterling silver and no piles of cash nordahl spent only three months in a wisconsin jail before his extradition back east but it was long enough for him to earn a bad reputation he was always shouting for the tv to be turned up louder and other inmates complained that he kept the water in his cell running all night this was because he was trying to escape at night he used a spoon to try to dig through his cell wall then patched the growing hole with toothpaste he told a prisoner named dennis that he had three or four million dollars waiting for him in various banks and promised to pay dennis fifty thousand dollars if hed help him break out nordahl explained that he planned to make his move on a sunday afternoon because the green bay packers were on a playoff run and the guards might be distracted by the game he also said he would kill dennis if he tried to stop him instead dennis ratted him out and nordahl was moved to a new cell nordahls arrest was big news in the towns that hed visited during his most recent spree ivana trump had not been the only highprofile victim in palm beach nordahl had robbed the home of curt gowdy the retired sportscaster in east hampton police suspected that he had made a run at steven spielbergs house but was put off by a motion detector it was also widely reported erroneously that he had burgled bruce springsteens home in monmouth county some newspapers began calling nordahl the burglar to the stars although nordahl never knew or cared whose home he was entering he discovered that he had stolen from trump only when he got back to his motel and found her last name stamped on two dinner plateswhich turned out to be pewter it soon became evident that despite the efforts of lonnie mason and cornell abruzzini nordahl wasnt going to be spending much time in prison none of the cases against him were strong the police had no forensic evidence no silver no record of his cash proceeds nor was any prosecutor eager to go to trial with a heroin addict as the star witness nordahl also knew that some three dozen police departments in nine states were anxious to shift their unsolved burglaries from open to closedcase files robert eisler a criminal attorney in deal new jersey represented nordahl at the time if youre in law enforcement and youve got some cold cases eisler told me youll give your kidney just to get somebody to say i did that eisler whose clients are typically bikergang members armed robbers and sexual predators saw an opportunity to craft a deal that would make everyone happy blane harms nobody aside from the fact youll never see your greatgreatgreatgrandfathers knife and fork again eisler said the people who lost their silver felt violated but most of them were adequately reimbursed it was really the insurance companies that suffered mostand who can work up much sympathy for them in september eisler and nordahl signed off on a deal with federal prosecutors that encompassed according to abruzzini a hundred and fortyfour recent burglaries nordahl agreed to hold proffer sessions with police officers from the various jurisdictions and describe his burglaries so that they could officially clear their cases in exchange nordahl pleaded guilty only to the interstate transport of stolen property nordahls plea agreement called for him to help the fbi trap his fencewho nordahl hinted might have mafia ties nordahl now free on ball was supposed to visit the fence in new york while wearing a wire but he could not get the fbis attention nor could eisler mason or abruzzini im getting collect calls from blane saying these guys aint using me whats the deal abruzzini told me meanwhile blane goes back to his old tricks and starts clobbering them in baltimore he may have been working for the feds during the day but he was doing his own work at night in november nordahl was arrested again in baltimore with burglary tools but no silver and was finally sent to prison he was released in april and placed under federal probation abruzzini and mason assumed that nordahl would resume his burglaries but there wasnt much they could do about it it was only in february after abruzzini learned of the rhinebeck burglaries that he suspected nordahl was active again he began helping the rhinebeck troopers track nordahl as it turned out the united states marshals in camden nordahls home base were also looking for him because he had failed to report to his probation officer the marshals soon captured nordahl outside a dunkin donuts shop in mount laurel driving a green cadillac seville and he was sent to a federal prison in elkton ohio he intimated to the authorities that he had intentionally violated his probation a man like him could hardly be expected to take a ninetofive job and report regularly to a probation officer now he would max out his prison term and be set free with no constraints last november after nearly two years of refusals nordahl agreed to be interviewed he was due to be released from the elkton prison in ten days but he had recently received some bad news a grand jury in poughkeepsie new york had indicted him for the two rhinebeck burglaries a helpful document had been found in the cadillac handwritten directions to one of the rhinebeck mansions that document along with the photocopy of nordahls fake drivers license from the super had given the police enough information to move forward still there was no forensic evidence tom fort the state trooper in rhinebeck told me to expect a signature crime prosecution one of our arguments is the fact that blane and only blane could have committed these burglaries he said nordahl seemed to view the indictment as more of a nuisance than a threat theyre grabbing at straws hoping to make a bale of hay he told me my belief is that basically ive been charged based on my past we were sitting on blue office chairs in a concreteblock conference room nordahl was not handcuffedelkton is a minimumsecurity prisonand he wore all khaki including an insulated jacket several sizes too large his hair was thinning but otherwise he looked surprisingly boyish he was buff and trim with good color smooth skin clear bluegreen eyes but he sat stiffly hands in his pockets and didnt smile once during our conversation as nordahl sees things the police are as deceptive as criminals society as a whole always thinks that cops are being honest and the truth is theyre very dishonest he said police say things to cover their own ass or theyll say things to go ahead and establish something if thats the piece that they need they wont lie about everythingjust about one thing or two things when i mentioned cornell abruzzini nordahl said this fucking guys a clown he had surmised that it was abruzzinis grandjury testimony that resulted in the rhinebeck signature crimes indictment nordahl reminded me that his guilty plea was for the transportation of stolen property not for the hundredplus burglaries he had spoken about in his proffer sessions in his view it was improper for abruzzini to establish his signature by citing those discussions those negotiations that process is not a public record but theyve made it a public record nordahl said its very illegal to do that these guys dont know that i understand the law as well as i do he wasnt interested in discussing the details of his burglaries i dont want to give something inadvertently or otherwise and somehow it comes back to bite me in my ass he said i passed along a message from richard jenrette the owner of the edgewater mansion jenrette had said that if i ever interviewed nordahl i should tell him that jenrette had traveled across the atlantic to obtain the mansions silver and wondered if there was any chance that nordahl might locate it he responded with a stony glare i asked him about his childhood when i was really young i was basically athletic he said but then once my parents got divorced my mom kind of moved around a bunch that kind of stopped everything he added i learned to work with my hands in school i took drafting and sheet metal and carpentry and things like that and i built great big tree fortsifyoulearn at a young age then you have an ability to visualize things you have a natural abilitya natural balance you know a coordination he said that he had never been afraid during a burglary to be honest with you i dont think anybody who breaks the law no matter what it is is really thinking about the other side of the coin he said i asked nordahl if he took particular pleasure in stealing from the wealthy a lot of this stuff they dont even use he said its more of a trophy almost not trying to rationalize it but i can see feeling sorry for somebody who gets robbed of their paycheck and that paycheck was necessary to pay for food he added i dont commit crimes where someone walks up to an old lady who collects welfare and shes getting twenty dollars out of her atm thats absurd he said of his crimes there certainly have been times probably i felt guilty and there have been other times i probably didnt i wanted to know what became of the silver he stole i told him that as i understood it the better pieces were exported to europe for resale but lesser pieces were melted down well that would be speculation he said i wouldnt know lonnie mason had told me that nordahl would sometimes lose himself eyes bugged out when he discussed his burglaries in detail but the story that made his eyes bulge on this day wasnt really about his skill as a thief it was something that happened in monmouth county in this was in my younger days of doing things differentlyin the daytime he told me he had robbed two homes but had found little of value as he was approaching another house he was spotted by a police car nordahl ran a few blocks and jumped into a thick row of hedges he took off his white shirt curled up and covered himself with dirt police officers swarmed the area nordahl could hear them close by the one thing you never do is look at somebody if you know theyre coming by he said i close my eyes and i dont think about them the police finally left several hours later at pm nordahl broke into a few more houses but came up empty so im like well fuck this im going to make some money still he found a big house on the edge of a marsh and decided to camp out until everyone was asleepbut nordahl dozed off when he woke up in the morning he decided to break in anyway but as soon as he came out into the open police cars arrived he doubled back toward the marsh and could hear police officers chasing him and a helicopter in the near distance the ground was mucky and flat but he found a small ridge and burrowed underneath it policemen were stomping all around him and the helicopter was overhead im thinking theyve got to be able to see me time goes by and nothing happens one cop stepped on nordahls leg i thought now hes going to say all right buddy get up nothing happened nordahl stayed hidden until it was dark again and the police left at that point i decided well im not going to do anything more tonight i went to the train station and caught a train to new york he leaned back and sighed i began to think that perhaps it wasnt the stealing that was the thrill for nordahl so much as the escaping he said if you were being chased by a bear your adrenalines going to be pumping you know what i mean later you might not really say gee that was fun but at the same time if nothing else really was going on it might have added flavor to the day as long as you got away from the bear but of course if you got caught by the bear you know its another story nordahl later said that he was tired of living on the run my whole plan was to go on with a real life now he said i have no visions of being some criminal for my life thats not cool my whole thing is i want to get into real estate remodelling homes things like that he added of course i want to be married of course i want to have kids of my own someday ive been distant from my own family and i need to reconnect you need to be a part of their lives and so forth and this doesnt let you be a part of someones life earlier i asked if anyone visited him in prison no he said mason and abruzzini had warned me that nordahl always talked about changing his ways blane couldnt go straight if you snapped a chalk line for him abruzzini said luanne his exgirlfriend had also told me that he would never stop hell be seventyeight with a goddam cane walking down the street stealing silver she said nordahl insisted that if he could leave jail tomorrow he would not return to burglary i really dont think so he said i think ive got to put all that behind me i guess when youre young and so forth if your life is mundane a burglary can throw something in there but then you start to realize that the mundaneness of life sometimes has value three weeks later nordahl did walk out of jail the beneficiary of bureaucratic oversight he had been moved from the federal prison to a nearby ohio county jail to await extradition to new york for the rhinebeck burglaries but before the extradition was arranged a judge allowed him to post bond the ohio authorities apparently had not been informed of his recidivist history or of his propensity for flight in rhinebeck tom fort sent a sheepish email to the dutchess county assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the case on at am nordahl posted a k bond and was released from the columbiana county jail in ohio he is scheduled for a hearing at the ohio court but i think we can probably forget about him appearing forts guess was right abruzzini and mason were both furious at how sloppily the case had been handled the bail bondsman tried calling the phone number that nordahl had given him but it was a fake nordahls mother who had wired the cash required for bailswore to the bondsman that she was as shocked as he was by her sons disappearance robert eisler the lawyer suggested to me that nordahl would tap into his savings and disappear perhaps to a tropical island mason and abruzzini predicted that he would go looking for silver immediately my gut feeling is hes back in camden mason told me hes got a number of safe houses there criminals and junkies he throws them money when hes around so they can buy their stuff and they let him stay he added blane is a creature of habit in my opinion hell have done a job by this weekend on a friday morning less than two weeks after nordahl jumped bail the police in princeton borough new jersey were called to investigate a meticulous burglary of sterling silver a week later several similar thefts were reported in bergen county just across the river from manhattan these were followed by burglaries in concord and wellesley massachusetts neither mason nor abruzzini had any reason to get involved abruzzini had no more greenwich cases to clear mason was no longer a cop but just as nordahl left his signature on his crimes mason and abruzzini wanted to leave their signatures on the nordahl case and the detectives went back to work their collaboration had not always been easy abruzzini as smooth and fastidious as greenwich itself approaches his job like a clinician he likes to draw diagrams and flow charts depicting a criminals activity mason is more intuitive a believer in street smarts and grunt work but now the two men combined their strengths mason became the lead general in the nordahl manhunt while abruzzini coordinated the efforts of various detectives police officers in several states went looking for any paper trail that nordahl might have generateda rental car parking tickets motel checkins they studied surveillance tapes from motels near the various silver burglaries they watched the homes of his girlfriends around camden mason suggested a replay of the flipthegirlfriend trick the police caught up with lisa the blond woman in the photograph that mason had shown luanne back in lisa had recently violated probation herself so the police picked her up in camden for questioning the manhunt had by now yielded a motel surveillance video of nordahl with another woman when the police showed a photo still of the video to lisa she cursed the woman was her best friend lisa began to talk nordahl had stayed with her after jumping bail in ohio and he had gone back to stealing and was flush with cash she told the police that nordahl was now fencing his silver with some russian mobsters on canal street once we have that exact location well go in there show blanes picture mason told me in midjanuary well say we know hes fencing here and when we arrest him hes facing a life term and hell turn on you within a week well find blane in a drum in the east river because thats how these guys play mason said he would be comfortable with that outcome im cold and calloused he said the bottom line is blanes gotten away too many times maybe this would be the fitting end to a life in crime masons reply stunned me he had never struck me as remotely hardhearted i knew that he had grown tired of pursuing nordahl i began to think too that mason who had offered to help nordahl turn straight was disappointed in him months earlier i had asked mason what other kind of work nordahl might be suited for with his mind mason said i honestly dont think theres anything blane cant do if mason was right about the russian mobsters then it was the police who saved blane nordahls life lisa told them that nordahl had occasionally stayed in philadelphia with her sister and her brotherinlaw the police had lisa and her sister set nordahl up call him tell him everything was okay there and invite him to come by nordahl drove up that night in a black ford explorer and circled the block he parked approached the house and once inside was set upon by three cops a dozen more waited outside he fought hard and wound up in a philadelphia jail cell with a face like a smashed tomato and the sour knowledge that the police had been helped by his close friends in the coming weeks various police jurisdictions began to fight over the right to prosecute nordahl he entered his jailhouselawyer mode hoping once again to roll up the assorted charges into a single light plea but on march he was finally extradited to poughkeepsie at his arraignment the dutchess county prosecutor said he planned to argue that nordahl should serve twentyfive years to life if convicted for the rhinebeck burglaries nordahl flushed when he heard this later after he was photographed and fingerprinted at the trooper barracks i tried to ask him a few questions now is not a good time for me was all he would say for months i had put off calling nordahls mother sharon fitzsimmons who now works as an accountant in a state prison in indiana the police warned me that if nordahl found out that i had called her he would stop talking to meand that fitzsimmons would never talk anyway but now i tried her hes not a completely bad person she told me hes a very likable person i think his big problem was intelligence and no common sense i just wish this would all come to an end the last time i talked to him about what he was doingthis was a few years backhis response was that its an excitement thing he said he got bored so i said well why dont you take up skydiving i said were not wealthy people but well back you up well support you morally well be there for you lonnie mason once told me about his hunch that nordahl had walled up his savings inside his mothers house when he renovated it and i asked fitzsimmons if this was true she laughed hard ive heard it all youve probably got cans of money buried in your backyard you think with six dogs they wouldnt have dug something up she told me what a good and smart and interesting kid blane had been but mostly she talked about how disappointed she was what ive had to do is basically realize these are his decisions she said ive told him i cant help him anymore hes over forty now and his decisions are his own although blane had always written to her regularly fitzsimmons said he rarely discussed his troubles but his recent letters have a different edge to them she told me hes concerned that its going to be a life thing i think basically hes scared hes saying he wants to get on the right path now for good then she opened a recent letter and read me a bit i dont want to die in jail and i dont want you or dad to pass away without seeing my life change she paused then said ive never heard that from him before the letter was only a slightly different version of the story that nordahl had pitched to me recentlyand to cornell abruzzini and to his lawyer and probably to half a dozen others but i didnt need to tell that to his mother she sounded as if she didnt believe him either stephen j dubner is the author of the new york times bestselling freakonomics with steven d levitt turbulent souls a catholic sons return to his jewish family and confessions of a heroworshiper he is now working on a book about the psychology of money and another book about jewish ethics most of his journalism has appeared in the new york times magazine but also in the new yorker time new york and elsewhere coda it only took two years to write this article i made my first phone calls in march of i was finishing up a book that concerned pittsburgh so i was in the habit of reading the pittsburgh papers every morning in the postgazette one day was an article about some silver burglaries that if pattern held were likely committed by a certain blane nordahl who had just been arrested outside of philadelphia a quick search of the philly papers yielded a few more articles so my first conscious act in writing this story about burglary was to burgle the work of those journalists in pittsburgh and philly to them apologies and thanks i got to work trying to reconstruct the past few years of nordahls life i was happy to save string see how things turned out what i really wanted was an interview with nordahl himself which took forever to arrange finally he agreed then he changed his mind then he changed his mind again but with conditions by the time i finally sat down with him at a federal prison in ohio i knew more about nordahl than i know about some of my own siblings this isnt as strange as you might think there are eight of us and some of the facts are pretty murky nordahl was without question one of the dullest interviews ive ever conducted his story was terrific but he wasnt the guy to tell it he was too arrogant too paranoid too controlling the story came from lonnie mason and cornell abruzzini from bobby eisler and tom fort generous gentlemen each of them and a small army of others early one morning soon after nordahl jumped bail went on a burglary tear and got busted again lonnie mason called me he said that two of nordahls friendsthe people he was staying with when he was arrested and who had in fact set him upwere killed in a onecar crash police suspected the brake line was cut mason thought that nordahl had arranged from jail to have them killed to eliminate potential witnesses he couldnt ever prove it knowing lonnie hes probably still trying a few months after this article was published law order criminal intent ran an episode based on nordahl lonnie and i both happened to be watching during commercials we chatted on the phone we couldnt believe how thoroughly they had lifted the story every detail every twist every idiosyncracy it made sense of course a story about a thief which began in thievery should surely end in thievery it was a good episode one of my favorites philip weiss stalking her killer from new york magazine at on a tuesday afternoon i stood on the south side of montague street in brooklyn watching the social security offices waiting for dennis to come out i wasnt sure what he looked like i had a number of photographs of him at age twentyfour a thickly built blond guy with thinning hair and broad heavy planes in an intelligent face bearded introverted but what use were the pictures they were from dennis had lately turned fifty having gotten a primer from a privateeye friend about tailing people i followed a few fiftyish dennises down the street none of them seemed right then it got to be and i was heading home myself when a man came out of the office door and everyone else on the rushhour block seemed to vanish most of his hair was now gone but the beard was still there and so was the inward intensity the determined anonymity denniss oddball spirit was so distinct and strong that it had passed unchanged from the old pictures i carried he wore jeans and a tshirt carried a knapsack wore photogray glasses as he had worn jeans and a tshirt and carried a knapsack and worn photogray glasses twentysix years before on the night that deb in one of her last acts had knocked his glasses off breaking them he had left them in the blood on the floor of her hut got on his bike bicycled off into the darkness he looked like what he had been then a peace corps volunteer i followed him down the street and into the subway then lost him id first heard of dennis more than twentyfive years ago in i was twentytwo and backpacking around the world when id crashed with a peace corps volunteer in samoa named bruce mckenzie he said that a year or so back in the kingdom of tonga a tiny island nation in a crook of the dateline a male peace corps volunteer had killed a female volunteer there had been some kind of triangle he was a spurned or jealous lover he had stabbed her many times the american government had moved heaven and earth to get him out of tonga bruce didnt know any names but he said the case had caused considerable friction between the peace crops and pacificisland governments and hearing this by the light of a kerosene lamp with the heavy rain clattering on the roof i formed a romantic idea of a story out of maugham or conrad of something terribly wrong that had unfolded in an outoftheway place a true idea as things would turn out i returned to the story several times in the intervening years learning the killers name dennis priven and something of the government machinations that had given him his freedom it became an occasional obsession something that nagged at me all my adult life the victims name was deborah gardner she was twentythree a natural girl in a seventies way with a laidback pacific northwest vibe in tonga in she rode her bicycle everywhere by herself at night even when people told her she shouldnt she didnt wear makeup she put her thick dark hair up in a rubber band at night and took it down in the morning washed her clothes by stamping on them barefoot in a basin with a jethro tull tape going she decorated her oneroom hut with tapa cloth and native weavings and lay on her bed all afternoon reading heinlein or hesse her hut was on the outskirts of nukualofa tongas capital city alongside the home of a gangling humorous californian named emile hons who was friendly with dennis deb taught science and home economics at the leading educational institution in the country tonga high school people said she was the prettiest girl in the peace corps she dressed modestly in denim skirts and mens buttondown shirts but men still noticed her big laugh and the way her body moved there were seventy other volunteers in the country and sometimes it seemed like every guy in the capital wanted to go out with her she had dated two new yorkers ethnic exotics to her own westernmixed lutheran background and then a third new yorker had wanted to date her too she was polite to dennis priven he lived a mile or so away from her and taught chemistry and math at the leading methodist high school most volunteers were wary of him he was the best poker player on the island and took everyones money and they did not understand why he didnt look anyone in the eye and carried a large seahorse dive knife with him everywhere still he had a few close friends drawn to him by his humor and intelligence he succeeds at what he wishes to do volunteer barbara williams wrote home about dennis since he has a beard and usually wears cutoff blue jeans the tongans think hes sloppy which he isnt keeps his desk bookshelves home very nearly neat as a pin the students are scared of him not knowing that beneath that gruff exterior lies a tender heart of the sort that rescues fair damsels in distress hed hate to think so though disliking sentimentality all in all hes too good to wastei keep wanting to match him up with some fluffy little wisp of a girl with a will of iron theyd live happily ever after dennis pined for the voluptuous girl with the kelty backpack from washington state one night he awkwardly invited deb to come over to his house for dinner and she accepted his friends helped him put the meal together emile thought of it as a highschool gambit and other friends of dennis also saw the date in highschool terms perhaps implicit in the planning was a judgment of debdennis was a serious soul deb was a party person hed be good for her the dinner went badly dennis had high expectations and had gotten deb a gift spending real money he was full of awkward feeling and the situation became unpleasant she ran out of his house got on her bicycle rode into the night when deb saw a former boyfriend frank bevacqua later she was upset he must have spent one hundred dollars on this dinner doesnt he know i dont want to go out with him you have to tell him that over the next few months denniss thoughts about deb became more sinister it upset him that she skinnydipped in violation of tapu or taboo the word is originally tongan and did not thank him enough after he had put in a sink for her she found it impossible to escape him he came to her school on his bike every day to visit even after her viceprincipal had told him that he was not welcome there and though his behaviorthe knife he always carried some bizarre and menacing statementsdrew the official attention of the small peace corps staff he somehow managed to hang on into the last months of his twoyear service in part to escape him deb applied for a transfer to another island then in october the peace corps held a dance for a new group of volunteers and that night seemed to unhinge dennis deb got drunk and fell twice on the dance floor and then emile took her home accompanied her into her hut five nights later dennis arrived there himself he had his dive knife with him and also a syringe a metal pipe and two jars containing cyanide later his friends would learn that he intended a surgical murder in which he would club deb with the pipe and make her unconscious then destroy her but deb started fighting him fending off his knife with her hands leaving horrible wounds ultimately dennis stabbed her twentytwo times her tongan neighbors discovered him dragging her out the front door he jumped on his bicycle and fled into the dark and the neighbors brought her to the hospital in the back of an old green truck doctors worked valiantly but the damage to her aorta and carotid artery was so severe she would have died if vaiola hospital had been the mayo clinic denniss plan called for him to kill himself as he told friends later but he changed his mind about that part at midnight he bicycled to the house of a friend paul boucher and the two of them went to the police station why have you come here asked the tongan detectives i have tried to kill myself he said he had taken an overdose of darvon and feebly cut his wrists do you know miss deborah gardner asked chief inspector fakailo penitani no was she a friend of yours i have nothing to say two days later emile brought debs body home to the united states debs parents were divorced her mother living in tacoma her father in anchorage they came together at the funeral for the first time in years and though they were disturbed when a peace corps official said that the government would have to pay for denniss defense they accepted the policy dennis had done it he was locked up and was going to be for a long time in the weeks to come the peace corps threw itself completely behind dennis a volunteer was in a primitive jail facing hanging the future of the tongan program was at risk the womans shellshocked parents did not show up in the country and no one in the united states knew about the case the peace corps was careful to keep it that way even when it reported the case to vice president nelson rockefeller so that he could send condolence letters to the gardners the message was oblique she died shortly after her arrival at the hospital nothing about a murder and though policy called for immediate announcement of volunteer deaths the peace corps waited nineteen days till november the day of the presidential election carter over ford the story was buried over the next three months the peace corps did all it could to make the nightmare in tonga go away it brought in tongas most famous lawyer from new zealand to represent him it summoned a psychiatrist from hawaii who testified that dennis was a paranoid schizophrenic dr kosta stojanovichs words were translated into tongan as doubleminded for a jury of seven tongan farmers none of whom had graduated from high school there was no counterexpert there wasnt a psychiatrist in all the kingdom and the tongan government could not afford to bring one in and though the prosecution tried to demonstrate that the murder grew out of a jealous triangle peace corps witnesses proved elusive on this score even emile said that his relationship with deb was brothersister the jury went out for twentysix minutes before rendering an insanity verdict and crown solicitor tevita tupou complained bitterly to the king it appeared to me that all pity was with priven and none was shown to the dead girl the peace corps effort may have been made to try and save the name of the movement from the embarrassment of one of their members being convicted of murder i find this very strange justice if this was the case the worst was yet to come the tongan police minister was for keeping dennis at the tongan prison farm but the king and other members of the cabinet deferred to the americans the state department gave a letter to the prime minister promising that dennis would be hospitalized involuntarily in washington till he was no longer a danger to himself or others and that if he made any effort to escape his fate he would be arrested these were misrepresentations sibley the hospital the state department cited only accepted voluntary commitments and when he got back to washington in january dennis refused to go in peace corps lawyers then desperately called the washington police who said that they had no power to arrest dennis at last under pressure from the peace corps his parents and the two friends who had brought him back dennis agreed to see a psychiatrist at sibley zigmond lebensohn reached an opposite conclusion to stojanovichs back in tonga dennis wasnt psychotic he was shy and sexually inexperienced and had suffered a situational psychosis he had been led on by a pretty girl who then slammed the door for this kind of guy that triggered everything everything went kaflooey lebensohn later told me he could not commit him after the case ended in a story went out among teachers and doctors and policemen and schoolchildren back in tonga dennis priven was dead he stepped off the plane in the united states and someone from the girls family her uncle or brother came up and shot him on the tarmac the story went around like wildfire people wanted to believe it the story satisfied a deep social understanding that if somebody killed someone it would catch up with him he would die but dennis didnt die he was free he went home moved into his parents coop in sheepshead bay he got a clean discharge from the peace corpscompletion of serviceand a month later applied for a new passport and reportedly got it he rejoined his brooklyn college fraternity poker game though the frat brothers joked that you should keep sharp objects away from him once a group of buddies confronted him about tongadid that really happen dennis shrugged he said it had happened it was a long story his family came apart miriam his sickly mother died a year after his return sidney his printer father moved to florida with a new wife dennis and his older brother jay a coach at boys and girls high stopped speaking he was the eternal peace corps volunteer he wore his beard heavy and rode his bicycle everywhere he didnt look people in the eye he married a hispanic woman in the early nineties by he was divorced still living in the apartment he had grown up in he worked at social security as a top computer manager area systems coordinator he made a year id spent years thinking about dennis even dreaming about him it had become more than a writing projectone that id started several times over the decades it was something approaching a mission deb gardner was alive in me in a sense i was surprised at how much anger i felt over the injustice done to her by priven and her own government in the late nineties id taken the story up in earnest going to tonga several times and finally toward the end of my reporting i approached him i wrote him a letter saying i was writing a book about the events in tonga in and wanted his help a few days later i was standing outside the sheepshead bay subway station trying to chart his movements when i got a call on my cell phone it was dennis he wanted to meet me this will be short he said workmen were eviscerating broadway at prince the jackhammers were going girls walked by in their slip dresses from the coffee bar at the front of dean and deluca i saw a girl whose lace underwear showed above her wrap skirt and thought about how these women would have seemed to the kids in debs peace corps group tonga sixteen with their long dresses to wear in a conservative christian society id spent years preparing to meet dennis in my knapsack i had documents from new zealand the analyses the government had done for the tongans on deb and denniss clothing twentysix years before i wanted to be ready if he said he was innocent dennis arrived promptly at noon he was the man id seen in brooklyn a few days before with dark glasses and a fixed lowered oxlike expression we shook hands and dean and deluca suddenly felt tight as a closet he gave a tilt of his head and we went out do you go by the standard journalistic ethics he said turning onto prince yes why soeverything i tell you is going to be offthe record okay and i interpreted that in the strictest way everything i tell you not anything he asked me or showed me we spent the afternoon together as we talked we walked up and down lower manhattan sticking to the big avenues in some ways he was the most important person in the story and i didnt understand who he was there were two theories about him one was the anybodycansnap theory that an old colleague of his gay roberts had told me in new zealand in his second year in tonga dennis was isolated and unhappy and one bad thing after another had happened till hed snapped gay saidit might happen to anyone then there was the evilgenius theory that the tongan police minister akauola and debs former boyfriend frank bevacqua subscribed to dennis was a poker player hed planned this to a faretheewell playing lawyers and governments and shrinks off each other dennis walked beside me now and then giving the faintest smile the same untelling mug that people had watched during his nineday trial he stared straight ahead through darkbrown armani glasses but now and then i got a glimpse of his eyes deepset dark big liquid holes i couldnt say what he was thinking though when i told him the gay roberts theory he went to a plateglass window and traced a big circle on it with his finger and then stuck his finger in the middle of the circle his beard was shaved neatly around his mouth and cheeks but his shoulders in a cutoff champion tshirt were hairy and he had a funny walk in his jeans shorts his manner was so sensitive that it sometimes seemed feminine there was that tenderness barbara williams had seen now and then he reached out and grabbed me to stop me from walking into traffic and the sense his friends had had in tonga that he would do anything for you was mine a couple of times he stopped me in a brotherly way to tug the zipper up on my knapsack it was his mind that was most interesting it was strange and it could go anywhere and he was funny when we hit union square he pulled out a folded piece of paper and read me a proposal he said i could convey his terms to my editors so i will report its fuzzy outline here dennis had no interest in my book coming out but if i waited a few years to publish he would tell me everything i should have anticipated such a gambit emile had described to me a chilling visit to dennis in jail after the murder when dennis had unfolded a grand doublejeopardy scheme in which emile wouldcomeforwardatthelastminuteofthetrialandtaketherap freeing dennisafter which dennis would come forward during emiles trial in this way dennis had theorized they would both go free what i told dennis was that he should come forward because of the havoc the case had left in the minds of a hundred or so people who knew about it the idea that a person could kill someone and walk away from it i reminded him of what tongans had said to him many times that he must apologize to the girls family and ask their forgiveness i reminded him of the scene in crime and punishment where raskolnikov confesses to sonya the prostitute and says what should i do and sonya says go to the crossroads and kiss the ground in four directions and say i have sinned and god will give you life again it was my own form of bluff the gardners didnt want to talk to dennis if dennis went to deborahs mother in idaho on bended knee wayne would know what to do with him and it wasnt listen wayne wanted dennis imprisoned or hanged back in tonga he wanted justice i didnt tell dennis that what was his idea of justice anyway id learned that he was too interior a person to believe in justice his imagination too crazy and elaborate he lacked any superego this was just some misunderstanding that had happened between a couple of people she deserved it he had said in tonga and maybe he still believed that and in that sense he seemed to me evil he had treated the murder and his release as a form of accomplishment not something to be regretted hed maintained a poker face for three months in tonga he had almost killed himself with hunger strikes two or three times so as to be kept in the jail in downtown nukualofa near his friends rather than at the isolated prison farm and while emile had refused to play the doublejeopardy game other friends had helped him hed made a kind of confession to barbara williams in order to gain admission back into the human family but barbaras loving expectation that he would be incarcerated in a mental hospital meant nothing to him another friend had given him a bible that he had read thoroughly in jail and he had then told dr stojanovich that he was debs jesus christ and savior and she was possessed by the devilor he had allowed stojanovich to say as much on the stand then in the states dennis had told dr lebensohn that deb had led him on and crushed him two different stories each the key to its respective legal doorway believing it pointless to cite a larger social good i appealed to denniss grandiosity i said that what he had pulled off was actually a stunning addition to the annals of crime there was a brilliance to it a negative brilliance for sure but most surprisingly the story was unsung i was going to change that didnt he want to help okay if im as smart as you say i am then how come its not me with the big house by the lake in seattle youre as smart as bill gates you just care about different things i said id pictured this encounter for years and always with explosive scenes he did get angry a couple of times and i had the underlying sense that he was deeply dissociated but all in all it was a civilized meeting he was a free man in soho we were two middleaged cerebral new yorkers lost in conversation tied together by intense feelings about a beautiful loner of a woman whom he had prevented from ever growing old and whose crystalline girlhood had trapped me too in seventies amber we went back to dean and deluca i got a bottle of juice and he got a lemonade and we walked south i want to show you my pictures i said we sat on a rusted iron stoop on grand street and i showed him one hundred or so of the images id collected he flipped impassively through the pictures of deb broke down when he saw a picture of his old friend paul boucher lost it for a few minutes had to walk off down the street the narcissistic monster only thinking about his own bloody life then he carefully drew something from his knapsack hed brought along a stiff card with a blue edge his membership in the royal nukualofa martini club a group founded by expatriates in it was an artifact from before deborah before his life had fallen apart in the months that followed our meeting dennis was to quit his job at social security and change his phone number again having gotten away with murder twentyeight years ago he was condemned to preserve that terrible achievement he was still on his bicycle rushing into the dark forever he could put the thing away in a box but the box never went away for the time being though dennis put away his card and i put away my pictures of deb we got our knapsacks on had a moments small talk then he headed toward broadway i headed toward lafayette he didnt look back im sure of that but then neither did i philip weiss is a newyork author this piece is drawn from his book american taboo a murder in the peace corps he has worked for many years as a journalist writing a column in the new york observer he has been a contributing writer to the new york times magazine harpers and esquire he is at work on a book about the army in australia and new guinea during the second world war coda investigating the murder of deborah gardner took me four years for those years it was the most important thing in my life as it had to be if i were going to dig out the facts in the case i was willing to go anywhere to talk to anyone who had information about what had happened in tonga in i visited tonga ten times new zealand half a dozen timesaustralia three times in addition to half the states the book that came out of that reporting ended an oral legend that had eaten at people in the south pacific and the united states by documenting a shady and shameful episode of politicized murder in which the peace corps and state department worked to free a disturbed young american peace corps volunteer who had stalked and then killed another volunteer on a remote island it was a great story and im embarrassed to say that it took me a long time to get around to it the peace corps volunteer who told me about the murder so long ago in didnt know deborahs name nor the name of her killer dennis priven but he conveyed an awareness of a distant drama and justice that i could never get out of my head over the years i made halfhearted efforts to learn more i found out that the government had suppressed the case and that the killer had been freed in the united states not four months after the murder i found out that deb gardner was a spirited and generous person poe said that the death of a beautiful young woman was the most poetical topic in the world and i was not about to disagree in april i finally saw her photograph and i stopped wondering about what had happened and committed myself to investigating the case that project caused pain to a number of people even debs family whom the peace corps had lied to about the case but it was worth it a burden was lifted from people who were close to the matter and had always needed to say something including a number of tongans who had fought for deb it appears now that there will be some official action in the case norm dicks the congressman from deb gardners home district in washington state has called for an investigation the us attorneys office in seattle is looking into the matter though he has indicated that it may be too late for an indictment to which debs father wayne at last fully engaged by the case has responded soi have to stomp my own snakes the peace corps has continued to circle the wagons it meets all inquiries about the gardner matter with bromides about how much it mourns deborah gardner it has made no real effort to look at the facts and recommend changes in policy or maybe even offer an apology to the gardner family dennis priven continues to live in brooklyn new york he has made no statement about the case debra miller landau social disgraces from atlanta magazine he wore his dead uncles underwear so he wouldnt have to buy his own then spent freely on tailored suits hed tell his wife to keep the airconditioning off to keep the bills at bay and would tightly budget groceries then turn around and throw luxurious dinner parties his former inlaws say hed tell new acquaintances his father worked in the hearst publishing empire then deny it when the truth came out that his dad was a typesetter who struggled to make ends meet a south boston kid who grew up playing stickball in his bluecollar neighborhood james sullivan made it his lifes mission to become something or someone else eager to shed his workingclass roots sullivan a onetime macon liquor distributor married an atlanta socialite made millions and began grasping at the rungs of whatever social ladder he could reach in the fulton county district attorneys office indicted james sullivan for his alleged role in the shooting death of his wife lita at the time of the indictment sullivan simply vanished for four years he led authorities on an international manhunt that went from atlanta to florida costa rica panama venezuela and finally thailand at the top of the fbis most wanted list sullivans photo flashed around the world his biographical sketch portrayed a man who loved the good life who frequented fancy resorts and restaurants most likely with an attractive woman on his arm the fbi also noted that sullivan was likely to be spotted swiping condiments from restaurants he visited what drove a man who buried his fortune in complex offshore accounts to burrow away sugar packets and swipe saltshakers fear hed lose everything or was his penurious personality ingrained reflecting a hardscrabble upbringing the conflict between sullivans social aspirations and his scabrous persona will be front and center early next year when he stands trialagainfor allegedly masterminding and financing litas death as the facts of litas death and her tumultuous relationship with james are examined once more it is certain that her onetime husbandand the man sitting at the defense tablewill be scrutinized just as hard macon growing up in the irish catholic roughandtumble streets of dorchester a south boston neighborhood sullivan learned early that if he ever wanted out hed have to be shrewd smart and different despite his workingclass roots young sullivan gained an impressive education he went to high school at the academically challenging boston latin school and won an academic scholarship to college of the holy cross in worcester massachusetts he graduated with an economics degree in and later studied finance at boston university three years after completing school he married catherine murray and the couple had four children in short order sullivan worked in the comptrollers department at jordan marsh a boston department store and later at peat marwick and mitchell accounting firm sullivan moved to macon in when his childless uncle frank bienert asked him to help run crown beverages a successful wholesale liquor distribution company bienert founded in in macon sullivans swagger charm and ambition helped him carve a niche among the citys movers and shakers although many maconites found his brashness offensive to their oldboy approach to business sullivan gained headway in the community by working with the chamber of commerce and charitable organizations when bienert died in sullivan became the sole heir to the distributorship less than a year later he and catherine divorced citing irreconcilable differences she got custody of the kids one thousand dollars a month in child support and moved back to their home near boston james vincent sullivan and lita lavaughn mcclinton met in early when she was working as an assistant manager at t edwards an upscale clothing

an odd union jim was white an outsider rough around the edges she was from a prominent politically active africanamerican family in atlanta a former debutante polished and trim lita went to private schools and cotillions a social girl who made friends easily she had recently graduated with a degree in political science from spelman college he was thirtyfour and she ten years younger always

lived in macon and lita in her hometown atlanta they began dating he brought her gifts took her to dinner and dancing movies and basketball games the relationship blossomed and a few months later sullivan proposed jo ann and emory mcclinton litas parents had misgivings about sullivan from the start jim was not readily accepted by members of our family says jo ann who has been a member of the georgia legislature since but lita wanted to marry him and as a parent well you cant see into the future you cant see whats going to happen emory a retired regional civil rights compliance director for the federal highway administration and now on the board of the georgia department of transportation says he was immediately suspicious of sullivans arrogance and selfaggrandizing he worried about the tenyear age difference and the stress a mixedrace couple had to endure lita had already accepted jamess proposal when she found out about his exwife and children of course we were shocked recalls jo ann thats just the beginning of his deceit his lies adds emory on december lita and sullivan married in a small ceremony in macon not long before sullivan surprised lita over drinks and dinner with

moved permanently to macon the sullivans moved into a spacious columned mansion overlooking the ocmulgee river at nottingham drive in the mostly white affluent neighborhood of shirley hills they filled the home with louis xvi furniture gorham silver and baccarat crystal although he was making a decent living as the owner of crown beverages the couple lived beyond their means spending to keep up with the society in which they both aspired to belong the interracial marriage provoked mixed reactions in macon even prompting disapprovers to throw garbage on the sullivans lawn lita knew how to persevere no stranger to racial tension she grew up in the thick of the civil rights movement born in atlanta in she was the eldest of three children along with her siblings valencia and emory jr lita was one of the first black students to attend st pius x high school even though he was a northerner and she a black woman the sullivans attended fundraisers and charitable events and became embedded in macons upper echelons lita worked with the american heart association counseled unwed mothers and helped in the macon beauty pageants under litas tutelage georgia court of appeals judge yvette miller was the first africanamerican woman to be crowned miss macon in to outsiders the marriage seemed happy but inside that house on nottingham things were starting to fall apart the generosity sullivan first showed lita began to wane in december six years into their marriage lita found a christmas card sent to jim from a woman signed missing your kisses at christmas jim was away in florida and lita was distraught she hadnt wanted to believe the rumors that hed been seeing other women but she couldnt deny this overt confirmation lita later testified that she drove to the return address on the envelope and waited for the woman to come home her worst fears were realized when the woman confirmed shed been having an affair with sullivan since the summer devastated lita went to atlanta and met with lawyer john taylor an acquaintance and friend of the sullivans he suggested she confront sullivan and when she did he denied the allegations even getting angry that shed ever accuse him of infidelity she wanted to trust sullivan wanted to make the marriage work and sullivan agreed that he did too taylor suggested the couple sign a postnuptial agreement one that would supersede the prenup and supposedly give lita more financial security should the marriage dissolve the postnup gave her a week plus for three years if they ever divorced again without examining the details lita signed the agreement its validity and whether she was coerced into signing would become a contested topic later despite her instincts to leave shed come from a home where family values and loyalty meant everything she stuck with the marriage west palm beach in sullivan sold crown beverages for million the workingclass kid from boston had hit the big time now free of the distributorship james sullivan was eager to get out of macon and he purchased a beachfront mansion for million built in the s by swiss architect maurice fatio the home was considered historic and sat overlooking the ocean like a beacon of wealth lita never even saw the house before they moved she later said i did not intend ever to make palm beach my home as i was not accepted in the social community there i stated to my husband on many occasions that i did not want to live in palm beach when my husband purchased the palm beach home he did so over my objections and i told him i would never make it my permanent residence during the move from macon to west palm beach sullivan met truck driver tony harwood an event that would later change the course of both their lives at first they were just two guys shooting the breeze while movers packed the truck a ladys man who wore tight jeans cowboy boots and a pack of lucky strikes rolled in his tshirt sleeve harwood had been around the block hed done time in a north carolina prison first for burglary later for escape something about him got sullivan talking he told me he had a problem with an exwife and she was going to take him through the hoop harwood later told the georgia bureau of investigation gbi he said he really needed somebody to take care of her get her out of the way i said ill take care of her for you for he kind of looked at me and said you have somebody that can do it and i just winked at him sullivan later mailed harwood a certified check for to harwoods home a doublewide trailer in finger north carolina sullivan told him the rest would come later harwood waited in west palm sullivan then fortytwo focused intently on climbing the fickle and complex social ladder although his red brick and coquina mansions address at south ocean boulevard gave sullivan clout he realized acceptance in the palm beach social sphere would require cunning he played tennis took flying lessons hobnobbed over cocktails and hosted extravagant parties he won a coveted appointment on the citys landmark preservation commission and thought hed secured a firstclass ticket to the jet set but what he didnt realize is that the palm beach elite mistrusted a man with new money especially it seemed one with a black wife sullivan frequently went out alone or ever more frequently with other women lita began finding clues of sullivans ongoing affairs when shed confront him hed respond by cutting off her finances they had vicious fights so bad sometimes that the police were called to break it up sullivan became increasingly cheap with lita telling her to keep the airconditioning turned off giving her a pittance for groceries or gas lita grew depressed and reclusive she saw a psychologist to figure out ways to save her marriage but by then it seemed hopeless in she convinced sullivan to buy a second home in atlanta so lita could go back when she wanted to they bought a fourbedroom townhouse on slaton drive in buckhead in the mid s on august as their tenyear anniversary approached lita gathered her gumption while sullivan was out she rented a uhaul trailer hitched it to the back of her mercedes sl and packed it full of her belongings the sullivans maid would later testify that lita packed canned goods paper products household items antiques plus more than twenty cartons of crystal porcelain and sterling silver a few days later she filed for divorce atlanta once free of palm beach lita enjoyed her life in atlanta she cherished close friends having her family near she dated some men and entertained at her townhouse she worked for different charities and was heavily involved in arranging decorations and entertainment for the new years crescendo ball for cystic fibrosis held at the ritzcarlton buckhead the only constantly hovering cloud was her divorce new lawyers new motions new court dates new fears though she had almost no contact with sullivan their lawyers volleyed back and forth sullivan had attacked her character alleging that she was an adulteress a thief and a drug addict he said he found dollar bills with cocaine residue sitting in the curve of a shoehorn in her medicine cabinet said she stole two diamonds that were hidden in the bottom of a shoe closet it was one thing after another her lawyer even had her taking monthly urine tests so they could refute the drug allegations in court she often feared someone was spying on her and that shed been followed in march litas longtime friend and former spelman classmate poppy marable discovered that her husband marvin marable had wiretapped poppys phone listening in on her conversations many of which were with lita poppy filed for divorce from her husband who was later indicted on invasion of privacy charges according to the fbi sullivan a friend of marvin marables later admitted that hed received copies of the tapes sent to him in a big box to his palm beach home on january a judge was going to address a pretrial motion on division of property and determine the validity of the sullivans postnuptial agreement judged in her favor lita stood to get half of sullivans assets slaton drive buckhead on january litas mother and sister valencia were visiting lita and discussing the upcoming trial sullivan had scheduled to have someone take a video inventory of everything in the atlanta home that day but lita got a call canceling the appointment that night lita grabbed a bite to eat with a friend at r thomas deluxe grill later poppy and her young daughter came over to spend the night to be with lita before the trial though the women planned to stay up chatting they fell asleep late while watching tv january began as an unspectacular day one of those postholiday days when the chilly wet air and steady drizzle keep one in bed a little longer than usual that morning a friday two men drove up to the botany bay flower shop then located on peachtree at pharr road about half a mile from litas house they drove a white toyota one guy came in and said he wanted a dozen roses he didnt care what color the clerk randall benson felt anxious and hurried he worried that he was going to get robbed and so only wired five of the twelve roses the customer told benson to leave the shops sticker off the box so the clerk tied it with a pink ribbon he let out a sigh of relief when the men left it was just after am armed with the white long flower box a tall white balding man wearing a green work jacket and gray pants stood on litas stoop looked around and rang the doorbell at slaton drive lita woke up that day in her buckhead townhouse likely nervous about the coming afternoon she was due in superior court at pm to hear the important pretrial ruling the trial was due to start in just ten days maybe lita didnt have time to think about anything that day except perhaps that it was odd that the doorbell was ringing so early in the morning she put on her housecoat went downstairs and answered the door it was am lita must have seen the flower box because she opened the door wide unsuspecting of anything more than an earlymorning delivery she took the box she must have immediately noticed the man held a gun because she instinctively lifted the box to her face did she have time to think did she have time to taste fear neighbors heard two shots one bullet veered wildly into the family room the other hit litas temple on the right side of her head the man fled on foot like a bat out of hell said a neighbor who almost hit him with her car i walked up and the door was ajar it was probably opened six to eight inches and i really didnt want to go in there but i knew i had to litas neighbor bob christenson later told police i opened it up and lita was lying in the foyer i immediately went in and into the kitchen which was just a few feet away and called nineoneone and then came back to see if i couldif i could make her more comfortable but it was obvious to me that she was in pretty bad shape poppy and her daughter were still upstairs when the shooting occurred hysterical poppy called litas parents poppy called me and she was screaming and crying saying litas been shot says jo ann mcclinton i was getting dressed to go visit my mother in the hospital i called emory and he got there before i did jo ann pauses as she recounts that day they were putting her in the ambulance when i drove up emory drove his car and i followed to piedmont hospital we were there a short time when they pronounced her dead jo anns voice trails off and she says quietly and thats when emory said that son of a bitch did it we knew right away it had something to do with jim forty minutes after the shooting at am sullivan accepted a collect call at his palm beach home from a pay phone at the northbound rest stop on in suwanee about thirtyfour miles from litas house the call lasted a minute on january three days before the shooting three men checked into the howard johnson motor lodge at roswell road and i at am they registered under phony names and were driving a white toyota southern bell phone records later revealed that a call was placed at am from room to sullivans house in west palm beach sullivan called the room back at am minutes later he called litas neighbor bob christenson and asked what did you hear this morning did you hear any loud knocking policelater figuredthatthe murder wasplanned forthatday january and that lita must have not answered the door the shooter needed a way to gain entry in sullivans day planner fbi special agent todd letcher who described sullivan as a meticulous notetaker later found a notation on january it said get flowers in a phone call to a friend a few days after the murder sullivan described the gun that killed litaa mm semiautomatic pistol but information about the gun was never publicly disclosed intentionally withheld by atlanta police west palm beach on the morning of the shooting sullivans lawyer called him to announce that lita was dead that day sullivan lunched with a business associate at about pm he dined with his girlfriend south koreanborn hyosook choi suki rogers at jos a posh french restaurant later according to prosecutor brad moores authorities found a note in sullivans diary that said suki and i celebrate with champagne and caviar at jos another note scrawled on december a month before the shooting simply said pistol eight months after litas death sullivan married suki rogers her fourth marriage his third a recent divorcee sexy suki was reportedly as ambitious as sullivan and together they made progress on the palm beach social circuit it didnt take long before the life hed so carefully crafted started to crack in march three years after litas death sullivan got into a threecar fender bender while driving his rollsroyce his drivers license had been revoked in due to more than a dozen traffic violations rather than dealing with the fines he took the matter to court and said suki had been the one driving the traffic cop told the court that suki wasnt even in the car sullivan was convicted of two counts of perjury and sentenced to house arrest for a year confined to his home except for tennis court therapy prescribed by his doctor during that year still seeking clues into litas death federal agents searched his house and found four guns including a sawedoff shotgun convicted on felony charges for firearms possession sullivan was sentenced to spend the remaining nine and a half months of his house arrest in the palm beach county jail by this point suki had filed for divorce at her divorce trial she testified that after they got arrested for perjury sullivan admitted his role in litas death in choppy english she explained he turned the tv high he say anybody can listen to this conversationso he tell me he hired person to kill litahe said lets sell this house as soon as possible and he say we go anywhere you want anywhere in the world she later told lawyers he mention in georgia in countryside you can hire those people for nothing you can do anything you want to have done while in jail sullivan got into a jailhouse scuffle with convicted robber paul obrien who broke sullivans nose fulton county in january federal agents indicted sullivan on interstate murderconspiracy charges in atlanta sullivan spared no expense in hiring ed garland and don samueltwo of the top criminal defense lawyers in the country the duos long list of clients include baltimore ravens linebacker ray lewis acquitted of involvement in a postsuper bowl buckhead bar brawl that left a man dead larry gleit cfo of the nowdefunct gold club who walked away with a misdemeanor charge in his federal racketeering case and jim williams protagonist in the nonfiction tale midnight in the garden of good and evil acquitted of murder in his fourth trial the federal charge of interstate murder conspiracy by using interstate commerce to commit murder put the onus on the federal government to prove interstate nexus despite the circumstantial evidenceprimarily the collect call sullivan received the day of litas shootingprosecution could never prove the content of the phone conversation judge marvin shoob dismissed the case for insufficient evidence on november west palm beach though a free man back in palm beach sullivan was reduced to riding around town on his twelvespeed peugeot bicycle he became reclusive now shunned by the palm beach social circuit one neighbor said sullivan had lost weight and looked visibly stressed that his face was gaunt and he looked almost like a ghost sullivan sold the palm beach mansion for million and moved to a more modest place in nearby boynton beach in the mcclintons and their lawyer brad moores took sullivan to west palm beach civil court in a wrongful death suit in civil court judgments are based on the weight of evidence whereas in criminal court a defendant has to be deemed guilty beyond a reasonable doubt a few days before that case went to trial sullivan fired his lawyers opting to represent himself i think it was a strategic decision says moores lawyerless saying that he lacked the funds to get proper representation sullivan hoped the jury would sympathize with him in his opening address to the jury sullivan pouted and said something else that is terrible and that is to be wrongly accused of murder to have to live through that and with that is another form of death another form of murder of the spirit he added to be a husband and to lose your wife violently is the worst thing that can happen to a husband because sullivan represented himself he questioned jo ann and emory on the witness stand emory mcclinton said it was horrible being questioned by the killer of your daughter the jury heard testimony from suki and paul obrien the convicted robber who had broken sullivans nose in jail obrien told the court that sullivan confessed to arranging litas murder and that the only thing he couldnt account for was the collect call made from the interstate it didnt take long for the jury to reach its verdict on february sullivan was found guilty and ordered to pay the mcclintons million in compensatory and punitive damages the mcclintons were elated for us it was never about the money says jo ann we wanted jim to be held accountable for what he did to our daughter sullivan now quick to hire lawyers appealed devastating to the mcclintons in the florida supreme court overturned the verdict ruling that the court case hadnt been filed soon enough unlike in criminal cases where there is no statute of limitations on murder civil court has a twoyear statute for wrongful death and those two years had long passed moores counterappealed arguing that the statue shouldnt apply when sullivan concealed his involvement in the shooting you shouldnt be able to beat the system because youre clever and fraudulent says moores finally the florida supreme court agreed with us in the court reinstated the guilty verdict the decision prompted a wave of media attention after a story about sullivan appeared on tvs extra authorities got a break in early a woman in texas belinda trahan called atlanta police and told them she recognized sullivan her exboyfriend phillip anthony tony harwood was the same truck driver sullivan had met when he first moved to west palm beach she told the gbi that harwood had met sullivan in a florida diner shortly after litas death she saw sullivan slip harwood an envelope full of money the final payment it was a link authorities desperately needed fulton county in may sullivan and harwood were indicted by a fulton county grand jury for the murder of lita mcclinton sullivan with harwood in custody authorities called sullivans lawyers to get him to surrender but by then sullivan had disappeared in september the state issued its intent to seek the death penalty against tony harwood in harwood pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter with an agreement to testify against sullivan when he eventually got to trial in exchange harwoods sentence was reduced to twenty years he sits in the georgia state prison in reidsville thailand for nearly eighteen years sullivan has been a prime suspect in litas murder at the top of the fbis mostwanted list for four years sullivan led investigators on an international manhunt throughout central america to eventually thailand in americas most wanted ran a segment on sullivan and incredibly someone in thailand recognized him he was living in chaam a luxury condo community about miles south of bangkok he lived with chongwattana reynolds a thai divorcee he had met in west palm beach more than fifteen years after litas shooting thai police arrested sullivan and took him to lard yao prison on the outskirts of bangkok there his lawyers fought extradition hoping to use international laws to avoid the death penalty thai prisons are notoriously crowded places amnesty international says that more than fifty inmates are held in cells built for twenty that the prisons are plagued by rats disease and rotting food and that guard brutality is rampant on his two visits to see sullivan in thailand samuel says the situation was better than hed feared i never had the sense that the conditions were so bad that it would shock the consciousness says samuel it appeared to be in all respects humane reynolds visited him often during his more than eighteen months of incarceration on one such visit samuel said the couple got married making reynolds sullivans fourth wife by virtue of his parentage sullivan has dual citizenship in both the united states and ireland like other western european countries ireland opposes the death penalty and the extradition of irish citizens to any country that enforces capital punishment when the thai courts denied the citizenship motion sullivans lawyers appealed to the thai supreme court saying that prosecuting sullivan for litas death was a case of double jeopardygeorgias constitution states that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice samuel says that because sullivan was already prosecuted unsuccessfully in the case which was dismissed for insufficient evidence he should not be tried again again the thai courts denied the appeal in march extradition was finally granted and a disheveled sixtytwoyearold sullivan limped off the plane at hartsfield before being transported to the fulton county jail sullivan wore handcuffs and shackles a facemask and a single shoe he was being difficult reported us marshal richard mecum he obviously didnt want to come back scott page one of three us marshals who traveled with sullivan from thailand said the fugitive read newsweek the whole way while grumbling profanity at the notion of returning to atlanta a few days after sullivans arrival fulton county district attorney paul howard jr served sullivan notice of the states intent to seek the death penalty against him sullivans lawyer don samuel said sullivans foot had swollen on the flight over that the facemask was just a precaution in light of sars he said that sullivan has a serious dental problem one that the lawyers are struggling to get fulton county to address while he was incarcerated in thailand samuel admitted sullivan did get into a fight samuel says sullivans defense is simple he didnt do it he is not guilty samuel argues that sullivan did not flee that he just happened to move at the time of his indictment that he had left the country long before there was a warrant for his arrest apparently he was unaware that he was the target of an international manhunt today samuel contends that the states case is no better than it was in when it was thrown out for insufficient evidence his contention is that sullivan will get off that some day hell walk out a free man that thought makes the mcclintons blood boil the mcclintons lawyer brad moores says that when sullivan fled to costa rica in he hired a private banker in palm beach who worked with a swiss bank to hide sullivans money in offshore accounts those monies were funneled through a corporate trust account established in the small country of liechtenstein all statements from the corporation nicola resources were sent to sullivan in thailand moores says a lawyer in liechtenstein managed the funds and sent sullivan money whenever he needed it hes still a pretty wealthy individual says moores neither the mcclintons nor their lawyers have ever seen a dime from the million judgment they won in which is now calculated at million due to accrued interest moores is on a hunt to find sullivans wellhidden money while the mcclintons believe in sullivans constitutional right to a lawyer they think he shouldnt be able to use the money from the florida lawsuit to pay for his highpriced criminal lawyers jo ann calls it blood money while moores calls it a lawsuit one thats pending against samuel and garland for accepting funds from sullivan that they knew were subject to the judgment district attorney paul howard jr believes sullivan should be courtordered to pay his civil court judgment it is really obscene that you could take somebodys life profit from it and then use the proceeds from it to defend your life in a trial involving that same person he said howard looks forward to the trial which could start in early ive talked to a lot of people in our county he says i was surprised when sullivan was returned that so many people ive never met would just walk up to me and say we want you to make sure he understands that you just cant get away with something like that in fulton county howard says the fact that sullivan was living in luxury basically vacationing offends a lot of people and that anyone familiar with the case over the past seventeenplus years wants to see it resolved i think weve waited long enough atlanta in the living room of emory and jo ann mcclintons stately home on east lake drive where they have lived for nearly thirty years photographs of lita are as prevalent as photos of valencia emory jr and the mcclintons two grandchildren portraits of ancestors line the walls the home is furnished with antiques and heavy brocaded furniture in a bowl the generous buds of their giant magnolia sit submerged in water talk radio murmurs in the background after fiftythree years of marriage they are the kind of couple who finishes each others sentences they have been best friends since they met in seventh grade at their parochial high school though its nearly eighteen years ago they remember that january day when they lost their oldest daughter they remember her funeral held at h m patterson and son on spring street at tenth sullivan didnt come nor have they ever heard from him catherine sullivans first wife who died last year sent her condolences the mcclintons have kept in touch with sullivans four children who they say gave up on their father a long time ago they lament how they were never able to go through litas things because sullivan was considered next of kin he was able to get a judge to enjoin anyone from entering the townhouse sullivan had the locks changed on her condo before they could search for clues or take keepsakes their daughter would have wanted them to have sullivan never contacted them after litas death but because he was still legally litas husband they had to seek his permission to have her cremated their devotion to their lost daughter and the need to bring her alleged killer to justice never wavers their tenacity and commitment have kept sullivan in the media he should have known says emory wearing shorts and a green tshirt with sneakers and white athletic socks pulled halfway up his calves hes a tall man with a gentle but determined voice he should have known that we would not let him get away with this for the mcclintons january will always be a gray drizzly day determined to shake the hand of justice when it finally arrives they know they will never feel vindication there is no end the memories and dreams are nothing compared to embracing your child closure does not have a meaning to me says jo ann theres no such thing as closure because our daughter is dead and that can never be erased or changed to lose a child there is never closure because in the scheme of things you never think your children will predecease youthat isnt in the computer at all we might fill in the missing pieces but we will never have closure fulton county jail he attained riches mansions and fancy cars he had wives and mistresses friends and social status he had charm and he had dreams now sullivan sits in a prison cell his tousled hair a dull gray his body bent and strained from the burden of age he has a family he no longer knows a fortune he cannot spend his shadow on the prison walls is only the dimmest reminder of that determined boy who played stickball in the street debra miller landau is an awardwinning travel writer whos penned eight books for lonely planet publications born in canada she started writing about crime when she researched the lives of canadas most infamous serial killers she is a contributing editor at atlanta magazine coda i get a strange sensation when i think that james sullivan sits in a jail cell just a few miles from my house even with atlanta traffic i could get in my car and be there in ten minutes id like to look in his eyes to see if theres fire to see if hes still running away from himself that workingclass kid he despised so much it made him lead a life stranger than fiction what it would be like to talk to him would he be a crushed aging man would he still be charming would he feign dignity and plead innocence does he sit alone in the jailhouse yard or does he have pals buddies with whom he commiserates for a man who fought his whole life for control how does he stand it waiting for his lawyers to pass motion after motion exploring the tiny cracks in the law those little openings that give him a window of hope as the months tick by with legal acrobatics and new extensions delaying the trial details of sullivans segmented life come slapping him in the face just a few months after this article appeared in atlanta magazine district attorneys in both atlanta and macon announced their intent to exhume the remains of sullivans uncle frank bienert whose death by heart failure left sullivan the liquor distributorship that eventually made him a millionaire did sullivan have a hand in his uncles death if so was it the trigger the justification for everything that followed while combing through old court archives in florida reading about sullivans life of riches i wondered how a guy like this could allegedly hire a trucker to kill his wife its a desperate story not about one mans fall from grace but one mans desperate attempt to get there its past lightsout at the fulton county jail as i sit at my desk writing this in the prison darkness does sullivan think about those heady days in the liquor distributorship does he long to be sipping martinis at the palm beach parties does he almost twenty years after her death remember litas face i wonder as his death penalty trial approaches if he fears death or if his tightly woven cloak of invincibility continues to help him sleep at night neil swidey the selfdestruction of an md from the boston globe magazine the kid was born into medicine he was on track to becoming one of bostons next great spine surgeons taking his place alongside his father among the citys medical elite but on this day in january the fortythreeyearold sits on the dark bench in the dimly lit gallery of middlesex superior court in cambridge watching the parade of career criminals take their familiar positions wearing expressions of defiance or boredom look in his eyes however behind the boxy glasses and you can see flashes of bewilderment how did i get here he watches as a paunchy guy charged with conspiring to kill a cop asks the court officer if he can give the large weeping woman in the front row a kiss and my lottery tickets before being led away and then the clerk calls out his number case number thirtyeightdavid arndt as the prosecutor and the defense lawyer take their positions before the judge arndt advances to his designated spot in front of a tattered computer printout that reads defendant stooping his sixfoottwo frame a little so his right hand can reach the railing he is wearing a brown pinstriped suit a taupe trench coat hangs over his left arm his appearance has rebounded from the unshaven sunkeneyed mess that was on display in his mug shot last summer though his physique is still a ways from the chiseled rippled showpiece it was before everything fell apart the pretrial hearing is over in just a few minutes and he pulls his trench coat close to his chest and exits the courtroom you follow him into the hallway and call to him dr arndt the words stop him in his tracks dr arndt for the better part of a decade that wasnt just his name it was his identity the domineering surgeon cutting his pathloved by some loathed by others but respected that identity has been confiscated along with everything else he valued so muchstanding status power now hes just another david standing in a criminal courtroom wondering what his future holds he turns to look when he hears the words but he recognizes you throws up his hands to block his ears shakes his head and walks away you suspect hell come back when youd met a week earlier in another court in another county hed walked away then as well at his lawyers instruction only to return and demand that you hold off on writing about him to do otherwise he told you in his sonorous voice would be to engage in murdochstyle journalism you found it surprising that this man given what he so infamously did in his operating room not to mention what hes accused of doing in the weeks and months that followed would choose to deliver a lecture about professional standards on this day in cambridge he returns again and the lecture is more expansive and comes with a reading list are you familiar with janet malcolms piece in the newyorker entitled the journalist and the murderer he asks it was published in two parts do you know her work you shake your head no you should he says you ask him how he came across the article i read he says narrowing his eyes didnt you take any journalism courses thats when for the first time you begin to understand the experience many of his former colleagues have described to you now youre the lowly scrub nurseor even the seasoned superior whose competence is being so pointedly challenged by dr david arndt and just as they have explained it he does it in a way that suggests he has no choice but to do it and that he is confident in the end you will appreciate being made aware of just how far youve fallen short of his expectations theres an intensity to david arndt that never seems to slacken a way in which he seems both hyperaware of his very public collapse and oblivious to it overnight the highoctane harvardtrained arndt became the doctor who left his patient on the operating table so he could go to the bank to cash a check in an instant that summer of the news went national but the profound professional embarrassment would turn out to be only the beginning within two monthsarndt would be charged with statutory child rape indecent assault and drug possession he would file a poverty motion the surgeon in one of medicines most lucrative specialties asking the court to pay his costs and then in a separate case nearly a year later he would face one more charge this one for possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute his downfall is almost operatic in its tragedy says grant colfax a harvardtrained doctor who was once one of arndts closest friends as arndt prepares to stand two separate criminal trials colfax is like many of the people who knew him well and are now left scratching their heads their emotions oscillate between two poles theres the lingering disbelief that such a brilliant and compassionate doctorsome say the most brilliant and most compassionate they had ever knowncould seem to selfdestruct in such a spectacularly public way then perhaps more troubling theres that voice inside them which had been muffled deep for so long the one that kept telling them it was only a matter of time before david arndts selfabsorption and sense of invincibility finally got the best of him david carl arndt was born on october in new haven kenneth arndt was attending yale medical school and living in student housing with his wifeanne many of the other med students werent even married yet never mind parents the couples baby became an immediate attraction for kens classmates from the time he was extremely small david was a very bright guy says jack barchas one of kens good friends at yale and now chairman of psychiatry at weill cornell medical college in new york and he just radiated happiness wed go over there for brunchlox and bagelsand here was this little kid always interacting when david was almost two the arndts packed up for boston so ken could do his residency in dermatology at massachusetts general hospital they had another child a daughter ken would begin climbing the ranks of boston medicine joining the faculty of harvard medical school and eventually becoming chief of dermatology at beth israel hospital years later anne a psychologist would also join the harvard med faculty friends describe the couple as charming warm stylish and smart growing up in newton david stood out extremely bright no doubt about that tall too kathy sias was his neighbor and one of his best friends she ate dinner with his family accompanied them on ski trips to their place in new hampshire longhaired david was intense and intellectual but fun to be around what did they do together a lot of drugs she says chuckling just about everybody in our clique did during those days she and other friends say david who attended weeks junior high school in newton and the private cambridge school of weston was always pushing limits he kept a boa constrictor as a pet says sias they also say anne and ken seemed hipper and easier for teens to talk to than other parents in the neighborhood but sias says that as she spent more time with the family she changed her mind they were as uncluedin to teenagers as most parents but they thought they were more clued in she says his father was remote his mother thought she knew everything because she was a psychologist oh its just a phase she would say about anything going on with david through their attorney stephen r delinsky ken and anne arndt declined to comment for this story and david declined to talk beyond his brief conversations outside of the courtroom dr arndts parents respect love and admire him very much and are deeply concerned that your proposed article about david will seriously compromise his ability to achieve justice delinsky wrote the couple are confident that when all the facts are presented in court david will be found not guilty in both cases though david would eventually become comfortable in his homosexuality its not surprising that his teenage years were more difficult looking back i think he was aware of it but i dont think he wanted to be sias says if he had admitted that he was gay he would have probably lost a big part of his circle of friends he dated girls including sias for about a week and a half she says we went back to being best friends after logging time at the university of massachusetts at amherst from to arndt left the state for san francisco he immediately soaked up the ethos of the citypart tiedyed haightashbury hippie part tales of the city free spirit the son of harvard faculty members enrolled in a university without walls college called antioch west the downtown school awarded students course credit for their life experience it no longer exists he quickly earned a bachelors degree and became a mental health counselor working with the homeless who in the parlance of san francisco were housed in homeless hotels arndts living quarters werent much better on april arndt married a woman from india named shobha hundraj nagrani they would file for divorce four years later and it became official in december many of his friends say they knew little about the circumstances surrounding the marriage what they did know about arndt during this period was that he was into writing literature the arts scene he was passionate smart insightful alive and arrogant one of a kind says harvey peskin who was a professor in san francisco state universitys clinical psychology graduate program when arndt enrolled in what set him apart was the way he put everyone around him especially the professor on notice professors tend to believe that students have to work to earn their respect peskin says david felt that the professor was the one who had to earn the right to have his respect as the yearlong class wore on peskin who had initially been irritated by arndts chutzpah found himself wanting to pass his brilliant students test david arndt has that effect on people i dont think his behavior changed much peskin says but i think i changed but arndt would begin changing in other ways one day in he walked into a san francisco clinic where stephen m goldfinger a psychiatrist who oversaw mental health services for the homeless was presiding over a case conference afterward they talked and soon they were dating and then living together goldfinger was thirtytwo arndt twentythree arndt earned his masters degree and turned in his tiedye for extensive travel throughout asia gourmet cooking and an intensified focus on his career he began contemplating medical school and took some supplemental premed classes it was around this time that jack barchas got a call from ken arndt barchas was then the director of a prestigious research laboratory at stanford his old yale med school pal told him that david was living in california and for the first time was thinking about pursuing medicine ken its probably easier for me to talk to him about it than you barchas said have him come see me as it turned out barchass lab had just been given a very early and crude mri machine which the researchers were about to experiment with using rats arndt volunteered to help in no time he had all but taken over the project he was like a navy seal barchas recalls just willing to do it and not waiting to be told arndt suggested to barchas that they write an academic paper about their findings when it was published the name of david arndt was listed first followed by a bunch of respected researchers with actual titles after their names years later when barchas was serving with ken arndt on the editorial board of the journal of the american medical associationand he would ask about david ken would say its all coming together for him in david arndt came home he made his way to the hallowed ground of harvard medical school where his father one of the nations top dermatologists was a heavyweight if relations between him and his parents had been strained during some of his time in san francisco they appeared to be back on track but david didnt advertise his connections occasionally a classmate would notice the authors name on their dermatology textbook kenneth a arndtany relation to you yeah thats my father david would reply casually and no one who saw david in classwith his burning intelligence and remarkable selfpossessionwould question whether he had the goods to get into harvard on his own soon after arndt joined the medical schools class of steve goldfinger joined the harvard faculty they shared a gracious victorian in jamaica plain that was well appointed with the artwork they had collected together on their travelsbalinese puppets burmese wall hangings borneo masks they frequently had arndts med school friends over for dinner or cocktail parties what those friends saw was a couple that seemed to enjoy life and each others company they had a couple of dogs and a garden that goldfinger faithfully tended to this is not the average med student experience most of us came as unformed characters having spent all of our time studying to get to harvard says timothy ferris a classmate of arndts who is now a primary care doctor at massachusetts general hospital we came as receptors of knowledge not producers david immediately stood out as someone who appeared to have a fully formed character he could do the work he was confident most medical students were still so afraid that they spent all their time studying david was organizing parties he had a life he had a car he had a nice house while the rest of us were putting our personal lives on hold for four to eight years david had balance he was where we all hoped to be the fact that he was gay only added to that the most mysterious part of us our sexualityand here is a guy who has it all figured out not that there werent moments that gave his friends pause grant colfax appreciated arndts tremendous warmth and easy ability to talk intelligently about literature politics life like most of arndts friends he found something magnetic about him but he had some clear character flaws colfax says to my dearest friend he was outwardly rude and uninterested he couldnt even exude the bare social graces she asked me how can you be friends with such a jerk i saw what she was saying but he had always been really kind to me and fun to be around a few years into med school arndt accompanied colfax to a gym near campus david was totally dismissive of the whole thing colfax recalls then overnight he had to be the best and so david arndt who up until this point had stood out only by what he said also began to stand out by how he looked his nondescript physique was soon gone he became even more toned as his weight training intensified during his general surgery internship at beth israel hospital on a warm spring day in alexandra page a med school friend and fellow intern had brunch with arndt and goldfinger afterward arndt showed her the new gym he had just switched to we went inside she remembers and it was just flush with attractive young men its only looking back now that page can recognize that visit as a sign of trouble ahead goldfinger she says was a wonderful guy incredibly bright and interesting but he wasnt an adonis the relationship with goldfinger would last through arndts first year of residency but friends detected a change in arndts priorities starting with his surprising choice of residency he had always talked about neurosurgery but when he didnt get into the harvard neurosurgery residency program he decided against pursuing the field elsewhere and switched gears he secured a spot in orthopedic surgery at harvard in medical circles neurosurgery has the reputationfair or notof attracting the intellectuals and orthopedics the jocks arndts interest in fixing other peoples bones and muscles dovetailed with his growing concern with developing his own the breakup with goldfinger came in the summer of they had been together for almost eleven years their lives were interwoven arndt had found someone new and wanted out he moved into an apartment in the south end goldfinger had an exhaustively detailed legal agreement drawn up providing for the division of their art collection arrangements for the care of their dogs and a financial settlement for more than a decade goldfinger would argue he had paid for nearly all of arndts living travel and entertainment expenses but not his tuition the expectation had been that arndt would absorb more of their shared costs after he entered private practice so the most controversial provision in the agreement was this beginning in arndt would be required to pay goldfinger percent of his income over the next fifteen years not to exceed arndt signed the agreement given the punishing schedules that doctors in training are forced to endure its not uncommon for personal relationships to become casualties but what arndts friends did find curiousalarming evenwas the way he handled the breakup here david is a very good friend of mine i was not as close to steve but clearly david was the one responsible for the breakup and david had absolutely no insight into it says grant colfax it was all about his problems it was shocking to me he and other friends began to pull back from their relationship with arndt then there was the whiplash of seeing the guys arndt dated right after goldfinger he ran around with all these barbie doll boys says colfax who is also gay and is now the director of hiv prevention studies with the san francisco department of public health is that any different from a straight man who gets divorced in middle age and runs around with trophy wives no but it was something that was disturbing to me it was as though his friends were seeing a david arndt version a betterlooking package but one that lacked the charm of the original release he once told me im like dorian gray i just get better looking as i get older colfax recalls it takes a certain personality to just state that and i thought it was an interesting literary reference considering what the novel was about the central character in oscar wildes the picture of dorian gray manages to defy age and remain youthfully handsome but he loses his inner compass in the end dorian gray pays dearly for his vanity if david arndt sounds a little too intense a little too arrogant ask yourself this arent those exactly the qualities you want in a surgeon because this is what his arrogance looked like for most of his time in the operating room an intolerance for error an eagerness to take on the toughest cases a fearlessness about confronting anyonebe it an orderly or a chief of surgerywho he thought was underperforming even as an intern he would routinely challenge the attending physicians interns are supposed to always back down but not david recalls alexandra page the rest of us were like you go man as an orthopedic surgical resident arndt would finish a grueling shift at massachusetts general hospital and then instead of going out for a beer with his coworkers would head back to brigham and womens to check on a patient he had treated during his last rotation sigurd berven one of arndts fellow residents recalls a memorable case a teenager was rushed to the emergency room with multiple fractures to his spine and pelvis he had jumped from the roof of a tall building arndt operated on him but that was only the beginning of his care david was the only person who figured out why he jumped says berven now a faculty member and spine surgeon at the university of california san francisco turns out the boy had just been outed at school this says berven was typical arndt care no matter who the patient was sure he complained a lot but the physicians who get angry who are difficult to get along with are almost invariably the physicians who really care berven says he compares arndt to eriq la salles dr benton character on er and wonders if his friends intense compassion ultimately became an unmanageable source of stress in the face of all the defects and demands of medicine theres no precedent for somebody surviving in the field who cared as much as david cared but heres another way to view arndts commitment his determination to stay involved in patients care even after they had ceased to be his patients he didnt necessarily know where to draw the line says stephen lipson who was chief of orthopedics at beth israel during arndts residency maybe that surplus of compassion and of selfcenteredness came from the same place he wanted to be in charge lipson says lipson had known ken arndt since their residency days at massachusetts general hospital and thought the world of him now here they were both chiefs at beth israel both watching their own sons follow in their footsteps lipsons son was several years behind david at harvard medical school ken and i had a real kinship he says lipson found david to be a superior surgeon in the or and intellectually stimulating outside of it so he took him under his wing while david would soar to great heights it would be prove to be a bumpy flight david wanted nothing but exceptional results says lipson a softspoken fiftysevenyearold who now works at harvard vanguard medical associates but he says arndts interpersonal skills didnt always measure up whether he was twisting around language to confuse people or tearing into them if a nurse was doing something and he didnt like the way it was being donea dressing change medications or whateverhe might bark at them no you shouldnt do this its wrong do it this way he wanted to run the show some nurses would go away crying lipson would take him aside tell him to cool it but he would just commit the same flaw another time lipson says he could not turn himself off from being himself lipson was particularly troubled by one area of arndts behavior that arose as his residency progressed some male orderlies and nurses were complaining that arndt had made what they felt were inappropriate comments to them he says i had to warn him not to pursue sexual interactions with other male staff lipson recalls otherwise it was going to be a problem and he could be chastised and reported to the administration but still but still david arndt was an extremely gifted surgeon lipson found him fun to teachhe would do research on his own push relentlessly for higher performance from everyone especially himself although some of his patients were put off by his manner most loved himthey could tell he genuinely cared about what happened to them and around this time friends say arndt began talking about needing to get his personal life back in order so he could be a good role modelfor his son arndt told friends that the boy had been born during his early days in san francisco but that it was only after the boy was in his teens and wrote to arndt that the connection was revived arndt kept a picture of him proudly updated his friends on the teens achievements in school one time when arndt was visiting california grant colfax got a chance to meet the boy and his two female parents things were coming together at work as well as the capstone to arndts residency lipson advocated for him to be named chief resident at beth israel in given his fathers longstanding connections there it felt like home for david lipson still envisioned arndt becoming one of bostons next top spine surgeons if he could just keep himself in check he helped arrange for arndt to do his fellowship in spine surgery the branch of orthopedics that is closest to neurosurgery at tulane university school of medicine in new orleans when arndt returned to boston and began working at harvard vanguard and at a private group practice lipson sent him a steady supply of referralsa crucial lifeline for a young doctor starting out in an overdoctored place like boston lipson and his wife jenifer had always enjoyed socializing with ken and anne arndt at hospital functions theyre a nice jewish couple lipson says and so are we still his wife sensed trouble in his continued advocacy for david and cautioned him to keep his distance lipson would hear none of it i wanted to have to do with him he says but my wife said hes out of control which in the end i think was true you want warning signs they were there in fact the year was packed with them though many of the people who worked with david arndt wouldnt find out about them until much later when arndt returned from new orleans stephen lipson asked his protege about his experience arndt told him it went great neglecting to mention the federal law he had broken while he was there on may alfredo fuentes submitted a passport application under a false name and arndt filed a supporting affidavit fuentes had been arndts domestic partner for several years and he had moved with arndt from massachusetts to new orleans but fuentes was a venezuelan who was in the states illegally the fraudulent passport application arndt would say later was their attempt to head off deportation three months later in the early morning hours fuentes was sitting on a bedroom couch talking to a man named roger volzer in volzers provincetown home on cape cod after volzer got up to blow out some candles arndt who had been staring at the men through a window used his surgeons hands to rip out a screen and climb into the house according to the provincetown police report volzer would tell police that arndt punched him in the head pushed him out of the bedroom and then threw a chair at him arndt was charged with assault and battery burglary and malicious destruction of property volzer eventually decided not to press charges in exchange for arndts agreeing to pay him and to attend weekly angermanagement counseling christopher snow volzers attorney says arndts supporters lobbied his client telling him a conviction could derail a promising medical career but if arndt dodged a bullet he hardly acted grateful during their meetings says snow in the if looks could kill category he was a murderer he acted if the proceedings were an incredible invasion on his otherwise important life he had absolute contempt for the fact that someone might have the audacity to hold him accountable for his bizarre and destructive behavior in the end snow has saidarndt paid only and failed to follow through on counseling in the fall of arndt pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor passport violation in federal court in louisiana he was sentenced to three years probation and fined but because he had renewed his medical license a few months earlier he would not have to report that conviction to massachusetts authorities until his next renewal period two years later the fines and legal fees meanwhile were adding up his breakup agreement with goldfinger the one that required arndt to pay percent of his income to his former partner was slated to go into effect in so just when arndt had finished up his lengthy medical training and was about to start making some real money the median salary for spine surgeons was more than according to the medical group management associationthe financial vise was beginning to tighten arndt argued in court filings that the goldfinger agreement should be invalidated because he had signed it under duress the case slogged through the courts and arbitration until a superior court judge upheld it in goldfinger would never collect a dime even with so many distractions arndt seemed able to wall off his personal problems from his professional work james a karlson chief of orthopedics at mount auburn hospital had known arndt since residency and practiced with him both at harvard vanguard and in their foursurgeon group practice arndt had privileges at most of bostons top hospitals but began focusing his attention on mount auburn when the veteran spine surgeon there started to cut back karlson says there were a few lowlevel concerns about arndt such as tardiness but no indication of his mounting personal problems he had certain problems that we didnt pick up on karlson says should we have could we have is a better question the care of raymond lavalleedavidson offered a few clues in the summer of arndt operated on his back at new england baptist hospital lavalleedavidson says arndt told him the surgery would take about eight hours it took eighteen and even after that arndt told him he had been unable to finish the job because lavalleedavidson suffered serious complications it wasnt until december that followup surgery was scheduled at mount auburn just after six oclock on the morning of surgery he was being prepped by hospital staff and about to be anesthetized i had asked them to hold off because i had a few questions i wanted to ask dr arndt before i went under the fortyfouryearold recalls four and a half hours later hospital staff told him they had been unable to locate arndt and so lavalleedavidson got dressed and made the fourhour drive back to his home in skowhegan maine four days later he says he got a call from arndt saying he had overslept lavalleedavidson who says that initially he found arndt to be probably one of the most compassionate people i have ever met is now among arndts former patients suing him for malpractice early on the morning of july charles algeri a former waltham cabdriver with a history of back problems arrived at mount auburn hospital and was prepped for fusion surgery on his lumbar spine algeri says arndt arrived late and unshaven with dark circles under his eyes he said his car had been towed because he had parked in a bus stop algeri says like most of the cases arndt took on the surgery for algeri would be a complex allday affair according to state investigative reports and interviews with some of the people involved this is what happened the first incision was made around am in the or during the afternoon arndt twice asked the circulating nurse to call his office and ask if bob had arrived by the second call the receptionist informed the nurse that bob was arndts code name for his paycheck and told her to tell arndt the check would be delivered to him there just before pm leo troy one of arndts fellow orthopedic surgeons from their private practice was passing by the front desk near the operating room when a secretary asked him if he could take the check to arndt in the or troy had a few minutes before he was scheduled to operate on another patient so he had planned to look in on arndt anyway he went into the or handed arndt the check and then observed the surgery for a couple of minutes then arndt asked him if he would watch his patient for about five minutes at the time arndt was about seven hours into the surgery algeri was under anesthesia and had an open incision in his back its not unusual for surgeons doing long procedures like this one to step out to use the bathroom although he is not a spine surgeon troy says he had assisted arndt before and was qualified to close up the patient in an emergency arndt then turned to a salesman from a medical device suppliersales reps often sit in on complex surgeries in case there are questions about the equipmentand said lets go a few minutes later a nurse walked into the or and asked where arndt was told he had stepped out for a few minutes she said i bet he went to the bank she had apparently overheard arndt talking about it earlier troy and the rest of the or staff were incredulous they tried paging arndt hospital administrators were notified the decision was made to wait for arndt to return and if he didnt come in a timely manner to try to find a spine surgeon from another hospital troy who calls arndt an excellent surgeon says he never had any doubt that he would return and he did thirtyfive minutes later he admitted he had gone to the bank and the or staff said he seemed surprised that they would be upset with him he finished the surgery about two hours later mount auburn suspended arndts privileges the next day and after an internal review process the suspension was reported to the state medical licensing board this has got to be a joke nancy achin audesse said after the report hit her desk it was july audesse is the executive director of the massachusetts board of registration in medicine by the summer of she was more than familiar with the name david arndt the boards yearplus investigation into arndts conviction on the passport violation was wrapping up he would get a formal reprimand he told the board he had no choice but to lieif he didnt he said his partner would have been deported to venezuela where he said wealthy homosexuals are persecuted and killed he was always presenting himself as the victim audesse says still the reason for his suspension from mount auburn was so outlandish that she was convinced someone was putting her on he left his patient in the middle of surgery to go cash a check at the bank after doing a round of interviewsarndt told an investigator he had some overdue bills and needed to get to the bank before it closed at pmthe medical board voted on august to suspend his license audesse issued a press release at am the following day she was sitting in her dentists chair getting extensive work done at am she called her assistant who was panicked you have to get in here now she told audesse this place is crawling with tv news crews this story went national so fast audesse recalls i did sixteen straight interviews numb and drooling in the public the jokes spreada harvard doctor and he never heard of direct deposit and then the conjectureoverdue bills who insists on cash these days besides drug dealers and bookies as for arndts patient algeri had no idea what had happened until he got a call from mount auburn officials the day before the news was going to break told that arndt had left him during surgery to go to harvard square algeri a sixfootfive pound guy who sports a boston bruins baseball cap a goatee and a ready laugh replied what for a cappuccino he watched the media circle around arndt for a week before coming forward with his lawyer marc breakstone who later filed a malpractice suit for a doctor who had always craved attention david arndt suddenly had more than even he had ever wanted the news when it found its way to his med school friends scattered across the country took the wind right out of them they had a feeling arndt would cause a stir wherever he went maybe put his career in jeopardy by telling off a hospital chief but this nearly two years later alexandra page still keeps a newspaper clipping about the interrupted surgery on the desk in her office outside san diego its yellowed now but when she refers to it during an interview it produces fresh tears we all make mistakes she says but this was so heinous so volitional im just aching for him for whatever must have happened in his life that caused him to do this during his interview sigurd berven breaks down at the same point same with another friend of arndts from med school saiya remmler who is now a psychiatrist in lexington what could be more important you know the guys on the table remmler says to this day i dont know how anyone could do that let alone one of my classmates but then how to explain remmlers reaction when she first read about the incident how she put down the newspaper turned to her husband and said it doesnt surprise me remmler says that arndt was funny charming and really smart i felt lucky to have him as a classmate but she adds he was also really narcissistic and i guess i knew there was this compulsive streak about him addictive almost and so deciding his needs are more important than his patients lifethat sounds narcissistic to me about a month after news about the checkcashing broke came another bombshell arndt would be charged with four counts of statutory child rape and one count each of indecent assault and battery drugging a person for sexual intercourse contributing to the delinquency of a child and possession of the drugs ketamine hydrochloride special k and methamphetamine middlesex county prosecutors allege that on september arndt was driving through central square in cambridge and stopped to invite two boys ages fifteen and fourteen into his car to get high then they allege after dropping off the fourteenyearold he had sex in his car with the fifteenyearold the boys waited four days before contacting police they said that arndt had given them his cell phone number and told them his name was david according to court records when police dialed the number arndt answered and he later admitted to having the boys in his car but said he had no physical contact aside from brushing one of the boys on the shoulder soon after came arndts poverty motion asking the court to pay his costs because according to his lawyer he was indigent and his parents needed to save for their retirement his parents disputed the lawyers account he is now gone and their lawyer stephen delinsky of eckert seamans is representing their son then in august almost a year to the day after he first made headlines arndt made a splash again he was arrested on august and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute according to the postal inspectors report and other court records on the morning of august arndt reserved a room at the chandler inn in bostons south end for that night and asked that a party by the name of frank castro be added to his reservation he also asked if any packages for him or his guest had arrived around pmarndt checked in to room but apparently didnt stay there that night around pm the next day arndt appeared at the front desk told that a package had arrived for room but that it was not in his name arndt signed for it and took possession of it what he didnt know was that the day before postal inspectors in los angeles had found the sixpound express mail package addressed to frank castro in care of the chandler inn suspicious enough to get a federal warrant inside the box they found a large pink penisshaped pinata inside the pinata they found about two pounds of a white crystalline substance that tested positive for methamphetamine that discovery led to a sting operation at the chandler inn which in turn led to arndt standing in room sweating profusely trying to explain himself to a postal inspector the postal inspector reported that arndt told him he had met frank castro online a few months earlier when authorities went to arndts apartment in the south end a man identifying himself as alfredo fuentes told them he and arndt used to be partners but were now just roommates he said arndt knew a frank castro from med school in fact authorities were able to track down frank castro an orthopedic surgeon castro and his office manager explained that he had been in surgery in tennessee for the entire time of the incident informed of the parcel containing narcotics that had been addressed to him castro told the inspector that of the few people he knew in boston only one could be desperate enough to do something like that david arndt he said he and arndt had been friends since they were lab partners during their premed days in san francisco but had not been in touch in some time david procopio spokesman for the suffolk county district attorneys office says that while the investigation is ongoing castro has been cooperative and the only person against whom charges are warranted according to the evidence now in our possession is david arndt because of the new charges arndt was found to have violated his bail on the cambridge case and it was revoked earlier in the summer arndt had been found at logan airport carrying at least in cash and his passport the passport was revoked but he was allowed to travel in the united states he would eventually be released after posting cash bail but for two months home for the surgeon and son of privilege was a cell in the nashua street jail one weekend after the blizzard of headlines stephen and jenifer lipson went out to brunch and bumped into ken and anne arndt ken by this time had left his post at beth israel hospital for a private practice in chestnut hill we sat at our separate table formally said hello to one another lipson recalls but clearly nobody wanted to talk about david it was too sensitive what does lipson think happened to his protege i think somehow he got involved in drugs and it ate him alive and he went over the edge he says beyond that i dont have an answer and its a shame if as friends say david arndt has always viewed himself as the star of his own drama what in the end drives the story line is his a story of downfall by drugs it should be noted that neither of arndts criminal cases has yet gone to trial and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges but if the allegations turn out to be true he would hardly be the first harddriving doctor to get wildly off track because of a substanceabuse problem john fromson is a harvard psychiatrist and president of physician health services the massachusetts medical society offshoot that provides support and monitoring services for doctors battling substance abuse and mental health difficulties confidentiality rules prevent him from discussing any one case or even confirming a particular doctors involvement with the program but he has gained considerable insight from overseeing a program that has worked with about two thousand massachusetts doctors over the last ten years this is not a great time to be a doctor more than percent of physicians surveyed in said they wouldnt go into medicine if they had to do it over again with increased productivity demands and a tightening financial squeeze doctors are under tremendous stress and more of them are turning to drugs and alcohol for relief an estimated to percent of physicians have a substanceabuse problem in massachusetts surgeons are among the most affected fromson ticks off the warning signs verbally abusive behavior tardiness unexcused absences inappropriate sexual behavior the signs of strain tend to come first in a doctors personal life when things happen at the workplace he says usually they have been going on for a long time even then he says the problem may not be confronted because most doctors are selfemployed and only loosely supervised and hospital management is often hesitant to call doctors on questionable behavior for fear that they will take their patient base to a hospital across town all of this means a doctors substanceabuse problem can go unchecked and then trigger a downward spiral and if the drug of choice is crystal meth or speed as its also known the narcotic at the center of arndts charges the spiral can move at dizzying speeds in his job with the san francisco department of public health grant colfax has done some pioneering research documenting the prevalence of speed in the gay community for many gay men crystal meth has just completely destroyed them he says people bottom out its a question of how far down youve fallen and if you can get back up if you look at davids personality speed is the dream drug colfax says it makes you feel invulnerable at some point in conversations about him just about all of arndts friends and colleagues use that word or others like it to describe him and his selfimage bulletproof subject to his own rules unbreakable ultimately thats what makes the drugs explanation on its own unsatisfying after all the same description fit him even during the long periods in his life when he was clearly not using drugs friends were often driven to distraction by arndts sense of invulnerability and need for control but they also saw how those traits could be attractive especially for patients in needspurring him to take on the most challenging cases to fight the toughest battles on their behalf but what happens if that need to be in control becomes more important than anything else david wanted people to pay attention to him and notice him says saiya remmler the psychiatrist and former med school friend to me it sounds like a gradual maybe even lifelong struggle between greatness and tragic flaws and what might be at the center of this greek tragedy she and other physicians who knew arndt but havent seen him in years suggest narcissistic personality disorder where an exaggerated sense of selfimportance masks a chronic emptiness then again only the star of this drama knows the full story you do as he tells you and he is right the journalist and the murderer is a gripping piece of nonfiction the original new yorker piece was published in book form in it examines the dance between a controversial figure and a journalist trying to persuade him to share his storyone that is always something of a tango through a minefield the relationship at the center of janet malcolms book is the one between fatal vision author joe mcginniss and convicted murderer jeffrey macdonald the first sentence of the book is a pretty clear preview of the analysis malcolm will render every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible to be sure the field of journalism is ill served by the selection of mcginniss as its emissary this after all is a writer who according to malcolm entered into a revenuesharing arrangement with his subject and then peppered him for years with flattering deceptive letters before crucifying him in the pages of his book the journalist and the murderer david arndt tells you provides insight into his decision not to speak to you at length its hard to miss the casting choice he is suggesting for you in the role of this ethically challenged journalist but his literary reference cuts both ways after all the other part to be cast is that of macdonald the physician convicted of murdering his wife two daughters and unborn son and implausibly blaming the carnage on a band of marauding druggedout hippies in a way the most thoughtprovoking portions of malcolms book do not involve her indictment of mcginniss but rather her own admissions she concedes that it was easier to come down hard on mcginniss after he shut off communication with her early on your own mind returns to the conversations you had with arndt before he too stopped talking you have no idea what my life is like now he says in the hall of the cambridge court if you talk to anyone who knew me after residency you know i am an excellent surgeon i can no longer do what i do best through a series of circumstances some of them perhaps my own doing and then as if on cue his call for compassion is dislodged by a reassertion of control you must not do this story he says when you remind him that he cant control whether the story is written but only how complete it is he shakes his head you can control anything you want he says how dont turn it in neil swidey is a staff writer for the boston globe magazinehis assignments have included reporting on the arab world during the runup to the iraq war his previous profile subjects have ranged from former red sox shortstop nomar garciaparra to the general manager who traded him from the brother of osama bin laden to the one american charged with putting a price tag on each of the lives lost on september coda spend enough time with david arndts story and you feel as if nothing could surprise you his downfall has a cinematic quality to it after being away from his story for awhile i was curious to see how it had continued to unfold the dramatic turns just kept coming arrogant compassionate and reckless david arndt seems incapable of living his life in anything but capital letters not long after this piece was published federal prosecutors swooped in and took over the county drug case against him they alleged arndt was a serious drug dealer part of a wider ring and that the undercover sting at the chandler inn exposed just a glimpse of his illegal activity to support their case they produced testimony in court papers from several unnamed witnesses the most sensational allegation that arndt was supplementing his income by practicing backalley medicine this image of arndt the oncerising star in the dazzling constellation of boston medicine furtively sewing up bullet holes in drugtrade players unwilling to go to the hospital might be dismissed as too implausible by even immoderate screenwriters but for people who lived through arndts reallife fall nothing could be considered too over the top even the language attributed to arndt fits the part one witness said the former surgeon had boasted he would have no problem disemboweling with just a quick swipe of the scalpel anyone who ratted on him about his drug deals with the new federal charges arndt was ordered held without bail in the middlesex county case involving charges of statutory child rape a trial date was set for the fall of meanwhilearndts malpractice insurer agreed to pay milion to charles algeri the former cab driver arndt left anesthetized on the operating table while he ran out to the bank algeri says arndt botched his surgery so badly that he was left with excruciating pain and had to undergo two additional operations to try to correct the damage having battled his own drug addiction years ago algeri says he often finds himself replaying in his mind the fateful morning when he went under the knife with arndt the day he showed up i should have known better i said to myself theres something wrong with this guy dark circles under his eyes unshavenhe was a mess but what am i supposed to do ask him to pee in a cup piss off the guy whos about to cut me open on june after spending nearly a year in jail arndt walked into a courtroom and pleaded guilty to a host of federal drug charges including conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine he did so knowing that sentencing guidelines will require him to spend a minimum of ten years in prison the prosecutor said she will recommend a sentence of fifteen to nineteen years in court arndt was unusually contrite telling the judge he had been addicted to drugs i was out of my mind arndt said and being incarcerated probably saved my life james ellroy choirboys writers debts

and heavy riot gear leeched pounds off of him he held the moments close he compiled notes later he deployed them in his first novel the new centurions tracks three cops for five years the narrative covers to the riot policework vignettes force the action it is crime as continuing circumstance and crime as defining circumstance writ intimately and large the cops differ in temperament their worldviews converge along authoritarian lines and diverge in their need to touch darkness and disorder the three posses neardisordered inner lives they meet subvert interdict and seek to contain crime every working day the process serves to still their fears on an ad hoc basis and grants them a sometimes stable sometimes troubled equilibrium the novel concludes shortly after the watts riot the riot has provided them with the context they have unconsciously sought since their first days as cops they have aligned the opposing sides of their natures through enforced chaos they have achieved momentary peace that peace will die almost immediately a non sequitur event prosaic and deadly will define them all in the end crime as continuing and defining circumstance to my own idiot crime life

realigned all my criminal conceptions it fully rewired me it was the moral and psychic cost of crime on an unprecedented scale it was a anecdotal social history of s la it was a merciless treatise on the lives of men it was bottomless dark humor it was a sternly worded defense of the need for social order and a rebuttal to the prevelant anticop ethos of the day it was my crimeascontinuingcircumstance configuration expanded and made humanly whole it burned my mental world down it took me back to my mothers death and all stops in between i reread the book i took in wambaughs knowledge it dovetailed with my knowledge and gave me a view of the flipside of the moon i couldnt quite dodge its moral power i routinely violated the rule of social order that wambaugh eloquently expressed joseph wambaugh would dismiss me on moral grounds and rightfully so i reread that book i did not alter my lifestyle one iota wambaughs second novel came out the blue knight was a

lessons he brought fear to the job it was the informed fear of the intelligent and imaginative he surmounted his fear in repeated context he learned that you never quash your fear for good cop work is always the next context he learned that boredom incites rage that leads to chaos and horror he learned that the strongest human urge is the simple urge to survive he learned that this urge mutates he learned that it induces pity in good people he learned that it inspires brutal willfulness in the bad he learned that crime is a continuing circumstance he learned that a cops splitsecond choices poised him a heartbeat close to laurels and dishonor joe wambaugh lapd to he should have stayed longer he couldnt he had to write he had to transpose his lessons he had to share the ride in all its power he turned informal onthejob notes into sketches and short stories he submitted them to magazines an editor at the atlantic monthly advised him to shape them into a novel he wrote the new centurions and sold it for a modest advance the book was a critical sensation and a big best seller he got packaged and somewhat pigeonholed as this anomalous copwriter the book portrayed policework as a troubling and morally ambiguous journey some cops hated the message most respected the inherent truth the lapd high command disapproved that was a fucking heartbreaker the blue knight the onion field big bestsellers big bucks rolling in bigtime acclaim big movie sales big hoohaw the disjuncture that big recognition always brings he wrote the choirboys it was scheduled for mid publication the job pulled him one way the craft pulled him in reverse the craft was the job that consoled him somewhat he shut down the ride my ride waned outdoor living and booze and dope sent my health south jails hospitals rehabs the nadir of early to mid i read the choirboys late that summer i stole the book from a hollywood bookstore it was wambaughs finest work the locale was wilshire division a group of nightwatch cops unwind in westlake park they call their soirees choir practice its kicks and chicks for a while an undercurrent sets in theyre too stimulated and tweaked by the job the job sates their curiosities theyre public servants and voyeurs the job gives them a steelbuffed identity theyre machomaimed and frail underneath they brought a surfeit of fear and hurt to the job theyre overamped and stressed and more than a little crazy theyre in over their heads crime as continuing circumstance claims them their collective fate is madness the book tore me up and oddly consoled me it reindicted my moral default it diminuitized my streetfool status it put me at one with some guys as high up on a ledge as i was it forced me into a corner it jabbed my imagination and made me cough up portents of a story it was a potential novel i knew i had to write it i knew i had to change my life first i did it ill credit god with the overall save ill cite joe wambaugh and sex as secondary forces i knew a couple named sol and joan sol sold weed played the sitar and pontificated he was a gasbag hippie patriarch joan loved him heedlessly i was in love with her she haunted my head i placed her in fantasy contexts with the cops from the choirboys she leaped from wambaughs pages to my prospective pages she haunted my first novel four year later i was at their pad joan sat to my left she wore jeans and a mans white dress shirt she reached for a cigarette her shirt gapped i saw her right breast in pure profile oh shityou must change your life no shit you did that was almost thirty years ago

aging excops roam affluent settings they fall prey to odd temptations and reach for the fortitude that fueled their cop days joe left the job early hes always looking back it isnt regret it isnt nostalgia its something sweeter and deeper its hushed visitation its the faint heartbeats of our lost ones its a feminine stirring in our malecrazed world its a womans breath in ellipsis joan the whiteshirt moment another joan nearing forty dark hair streaked with gray joan i might visit joe next month i might cohost his screenwriting class at university of california san diego we might sit
