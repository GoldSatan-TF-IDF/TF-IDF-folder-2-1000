to admiral sir james saumarez chapter his majestys brigsloop teazer eased sheets and came round prettily for the last leg of the short passage from polperro eastwards to plymouth sound the ships clerk knocked softly at the captains cabin door there was no reply so from long friendship nicholas renzi entered quietly commander thomas kydd was sitting rigid at the stern windows staring out he turned his face a bleak mask tom dear fellow ive brought you this renzi said proffering a glass the natives hereabouts do swear by its power to lay demons and recruit the spirit kydd accepted the offering but it remained untouched in his hand fine norwesterly blow renzi went on brightly we should raise the sound on this tack id venture there was no response from the fine and ambitious sea officer who had made the incredible journey from the focsle to the quarterdeck then achieved his own command now brought so low it had been so sudden returning triumphant after a rousing cruise kydd had decided to snatch a few moments in polperro the home of his newly betrothed rosalynd there he had learned of her tragic death just days before renzi drew a chair close there was little to be saidgrief was such a private thing but in this renzi knew guilt his closest friend had stood alone when he had followed his heart and asked a country lass to be his bride not persephone lockwood the admirals daughter there had never been a formal understanding between kydd and miss lockwood but societyand renzihad been outraged nevertheless you should know this dear friend ii own myself shamed by my actions you must understand renzi said in a low voice it was unpardonable not to recognise that it wasthat your sentiments sprang from the noblest and purest his words went unheard but he vowed that whatever lay ahead for kydd he would be at his side especially when he tried to reenter the world that had turned its back on him but there were more pressing concerns now we dock in so little time i have to ask shall you prepare to take the deck again kydds face turned slowly his eyes filled as he tried to speak and his fists clenched renzi knew for the sake of the future that kydd should be the one to take teazer to her rest you are the captain still and duty is a stern mistress shall i he let it hang as the words penetrated kydd rose from his chair like an old man and made his way to his inner cabin after a few minutes he emerged and took a last long look through the windows at the receding wake i have th ship mr standish kydd mumbled to his first lieutenant and stood alone face set and pale staring ahead rame head passed abeam teazer hauled her wind for the sound and home hands went to stations for mooring ship and she came gently to single anchor at barn pool the early autumn sunshine had a fragile poignant quality as the sloops gig pulled across the short distance to the dockyard at kydds side renzi held ships papers the boat nuzzled into the landing stage and kydd stepped out seeming lost and bewildered this way old fellow renzi said glaring at passersby who stopped to gape at the subject of the sorecent scandal it was not far to the offices the flaglieutenant hurried away to inform the port admiral of their arrival lockwood himself came stalking out to the waiting room but halted in surprise at the sight of kydds ashen face news of the tragedy had apparently not yet reached him im astonished you have the temerity to cut short your cruise mr kydd there are matters it seems sir i beg t report m full success in yr mission lockwood blinked teazers report renzi said handing over the details of kydds twin victoriessuccess against the notorious bloody jacques the renegade privateer who had terrorised the devon and cornish coasts and the unmasking of zephaniah job as the man behind the smuggling ring the admiral flicked through the papers i er it would appear i must offer my congratulations commander he said and looked up but kydd had left when the news was broken at number eighteen durnford street the residence kydd and renzi shared a pall of silence descended shocked mrs bargus the housekeeper cast about for things to do that might in some little way comfort her employer a cheerful fire was soon ablaze and the cook was set to prepare his favourite braised duck becky the maid came in timidly to light the candles but departed quickly leaving kydd and renzi alone if theres anything renzi started hesitantly but stopped as racking sobs seized his friend he waited patiently until they eased i never reckoned it could hurt s much kydd choked yes brother renzi murmured rosalynds gone fr ever so innocent an young an sheshe never knew i have to return to the ship tom renzi said gently theres things will need arranging unless someone was there to head off troubles arising in a temporarily captainless vessel chaos might ensure the ambitious standish would probably not see it as in his best interest to take a firm hand do remain here dear fellow and ill be back when i can renzi found the brandy and placed a glass before kydd it was no easy matter but a flow of fictitious captains orders relayed by renzi saw the larboard watch stream happily ashore and a suspicious standish set to turning up the hands for restowing the hold it was dark before renzi could make his way ashore again and he hurried to durnford street mrs bargus answered the door flustered and apprehensive oh mr renzi im s glad youre here its the captainhes in such a state all those things hes saying its not right mr renzi kydd was slumped in the same chair in his shirtsleeves gazing fixedly into the fire the brandy bottle nearly empty beside him he jerked round when renzi entered ahoy there ol shipmate he called bitterly bring yr arse t anchor an let yr logic tell me whywhy scrovy bastards like lockwood still strut abou while my rosalynd while shes his face crumpled renzi went to him and touched his arm im going to the apothecary my friend hell have much more efficacious medicines for your pain it was chilling to witness never in all their years together had he seen kydd in such a conditionsave perhaps in the early days in the old duke william no kydds hoarse cry pierced him ststay wi me nicholas of course brother renzi stoked the fire and drew up his chair with a forced laugh he went on you should have no care for teazer old fellow theres half the ships company rollicking ashore and kit standish believing you gravely concerned with the stowage of the hold kydd took no notice instead he turned to renzi and said hollowly itsits that i cant face it nicholaslife wiout her his hands writhed i saw all m days in the future wi her plans an course all set fair an nowtheres no point carefully renzi replied not at all i see a fine officer who is captain of a ship that needs him one with the most illustrious of sea careers to come kydd grabbed his arm and leered at him dont y see nicholas he slurred its th sea right enough its taken m rosalynd as it cant abide a rival what such nonsense kydd slumped in his chair i knew yed not unnerstan it he said almost inaudibly and closed his eyes before renzi could continue no point he mumbled no point atall tom i have to slip out for a space renzi said ill be back directly for a long minute kydd said nothing then with his eyes still closed he said with intense weariness as y have to m frien why nicholas what a surprise sensing the gravity of the visit cecilia added hastily do come in mrs mullins is engaged at the momentthe drawing room will be available to us i believe renzi followed kydds sister into the home of her old friend whom she was visiting she turned to face him its thomas isnt it yes renzi hesitated im truly sorry to have to say that rosalynd has been taken from us she was drowned when a packet boat overset on the way to plymouth cecilia gasped no it cant be andand poor thomas he he must be feeling i rather believe it is worse than that his intellects are perturbed hes not seeing the point of life without rosalynd and i fear for his future then i must go to him this instant poor lamb pray wait for me sir i shall accompany you presently no that is to say it might not be suitable miss cecilia you see he is at this moment er disguised in drink and he he might be um flustered nicholas but he needs us i shall go to him she said with unanswerable determination the night was cool as they hurried through the streets but when they reached number eighteen they were met outside by a distraught mrs bargus and a wideeyed becky clutching her from behind i didnt know what t do mr renzi all of a sudden i hears this great roar frm upstairsfair set m heart aflutter it did i goes up t see an then down comes th captain in a pelt he pushes past me an out on the street an he just in his shirtsleeves an all it was past enduring the shock of the news had given way to the spreading desolation of grief then the firming certainty that he wanted no part of a world that did not include rosalynd whichever way kydd faced there was pain and mockery heartbreak and futility blind hopelessness had demanded release and exploded into an overwhelming compulsion to escape the prison of his hurt he stumbled on into the night some instinct had made him snatch up his seaworn grego as he left which kept him warm and anonymous over his shirtsleeves setting his path away from the sea his thoughts tumbled on a tiny thread of reason struggling against the maudlin embrace of the liquor suddenly he had a theory every mortal had a measure of happiness allotted to them and his had just run out did this mean he should resign himself to dreariness for what remained of his days was this something to do with the fates renzi always set his face against them something to do with with terminismdeter something damn it who cared about renzi and his high ideas tears stung and no answers came a gentleman of age saw him and frostily made much of crossing the street to avoid him kydd glared drunkenly at him how hed suffered at the hands of socalled gentle society in the hard days as a newly promoted officer from before the mast he had been ignored until he had learned their fancy ways there had been illdisguised scorn for his origins even in far nova scotia until he had earned admiration in a social coup when he had unwittingly invited the mistress of prince edward to a ball it had been seen as a cunning move for advancement in high society and here in england they had been ready enough to see him court one of their own but could not accept that his heart had finally been taken by another bitterness welled now when he so needed those who cared and understood to rally to his support there was no one not a soul cecilia could not be seen with him for the social stigma and renzi well he had been so disapproving about rosalynd in the past be damned to itbe damned to all of them when he had been a common foremast jack it had never been like thishe remembered the comradely understanding the rough kindnesses then there had been no judgements and all was plain speaking square playing the memories flooded his brain fuzzily the drink in him only intensifying his loneliness he yearned to exchange his hardwon status for the careless warmth of the focsle but never again would he a sudden thought cameseductive challenging and glorious he had lost everything was alone in the world now and nobody cared what if he left commander thomas kydd to his misery and became once more tom kydd carefree mariner shipping out on a deepsea voyage to the other side of the world there were oceangoing merchantmen aplenty in plymouth taking on last stores and cargothey would snap up a prime hand such a voyage would give him time to heal find a new self he gulped at the thought after all these years would he be able to hand a staysail tuck a longsplice stomach the burgoo and hard tack he knew the answer instantly yes he tried to focus on the details muzzily aware that he was in no fit state to walk the mile or two back to plymouth he drew himself up with drunken dignity and hailed an approaching public diligence the only other occupant stared in astonishment at his worn tarsmelling grego over the lacetrimmed shirt and stylish breeches then averted his head he was deposited outside the kings arms in old town street on the heights above sutton cove and well clear of the insalubrious sailors hauntsbut that was where he was headed down the narrow streets alleys and passageways into the jumble of rickety buildings around the waterfront he knew that cockside on the opposite side of the pool was most favoured by the merchant seamen so he made his way there spurred on by the roars of jollity from a nearby taphouse a memorya reflex from a life long agocame back he removed one shoe gravely placed a few coins in it then put it on again this old sailors trick would ensure that whatever condition he was in later he would not be a burden to his shipmates in returning to his ship whichever it would be he lurched upright and continued down the steep unlit street towards the glittering pool of darkness what was waiting below what adventure would follow every time he had been to sea it had always been into some wild experience or other since hed left the shore life and a blow to the side of his head sent him staggering disoriented he turned another from behind knocked him to his knees scrag im then mate he heard footpads he scrabbled for his sword but of course it was not there grogfuddled he was easy meat a blackjack smacked into his head and sent him sprawling then the two were on him expertly riffling his pockets taking his purse a small ring the fob watch cecilia had proudly given him when he had achieved the quarterdeck he was helpless while they ransacked his body with savage invasive hands dickim avin them kicks help me get em off th bastard they had seen his breeches the sign of a gentleman and these were his finest worn for the admiral he struggled but was held while they were viciously stripped off an the shirt cully he caught one a glancing blow but it was no use before they had robbed him of stockings and shoes too something made them scurry off leaving him prostrate in the dirty alley sore and shivering with cold and shame kydd sat up head swimming a bout of heaving seized him and he fell sideways sliming his undervest he got to his feet unsteadily then saw that one of the robbers had thrown aside his own garments to run off in his a rank pair of trousers and a ragged black waistcoat they would have to cover him as he made his way back to his old life no if there was one thing he was not it was a cravenhearted lobcock he would see through what hed set out to do with pathetic dignity he hauled on the malodorous trousers the fatstreaked waistcoat and his old grego which the footpads had disdained it had seen many a stormy night in the past and no doubt would in whatever lay ahead kydd set course stubbornly for cockside he reached the cobblestones of the quay the bowsprits of silent ships spearing high above him in the still darkness on the far wharf others were moored broadside to with cargo working gear rigged waiting for the next day a lone shipkeeper wandered morosely about the deck of his vessel the sailors taverns were beacons of light and noise and he made for the nearest his mouth tasted vile his head throbbedbut a gage of bowse with the splicings would soon set him to rights kydd pushed open the door and a sickly sweet smell of liquored sawdust and warm humanity hit him a few turned then resumed their conversations across the room a serving maid looked at him speculatively and made her way through the tables a hard time sailor she said sympathetically it was not uncommon after a rough voyage and the hard carousing that followed for a sailor to sell his clothes kydds heart warmed to her and he gave a shy smile yere welcome here shipmate she continued an what cn i find fr you as will chase away yr memries m dear kydds face clouded thank ee missbut there isnt a medcine made as will settle that er i have m hopes of a long voyage t come though he concluded weakly his expression eased but a muzzler o yr right true sort is wha id take kindly look come over an sit wi these gennelmen she said and waved a pot towards a cosy group about a table in the corner theys in from the indies eleven weeks cross the western ocean wi a sprung foremast an aught t eat but belayingpin soup an handspike hash the beer was dark honest and spread the glow of inebriation once more his new friends had glanced at him curiously just once and then as was the way of the sea had accepted him for what he was yez mustve had a time of it tom m skiddy cock which hooker one asked save yr kindness mates an its something ii dont wan t talk of kydd said gruffly and took refuge in his tankard right b us aint it the oldest in the group said hastily to the others and called for another pint an if yere not flush in the fob he muttered kindly ah everybodys mess an no ones watch kydd snorted no cuffin i has m cobbs as will pay m way he fumbled with his shoe while the others looked away politely he found the coinsin his careless haste he had slipped in three halfguineas and a florin a princely sum for a seaman embarrassed he mumbled something and ordered a drink for each man they had not questioned kydds reticencemany went to sea for a good enough reasonbut they told him willingly of their own hard passage seeing kydd relax a little they asked what he had in mind for the future and head spinning he tried to explain his great need for far voyaging they nodded it was the ambition of most seamen when reaching port to spend all their hardwon pay in one glorious spree and penniless sign on for another hard voyage well matey wes not fr south o the line but y might want t think about barbadoes packet sailin soon fr batavia in hardwares her matell be about lookin fr hands tonight i shouldnt wonder kydd tried blearily to take it in th mate said another with feeling yere forgettin its hellyer a right bucko as ever i seen you ship out in that there a splintering crash and female screams slammed into kydds consciousness followed by urgent shouts and a strident bellow from the door reeling he tried to make sense of it as his companions shot to their feet and yelled at him the press skin out while y can tomjowla jowla matey they disappeared hurriedly into the scrimmage and kydd tried clumsily to follow but fell headlong before he could rise he felt knees in his back his thumbs secured with ropeyarns and he was yanked to his feet got a rough knot ere sir the press gang seaman called his hand firmly on the scruff of kydds neck as he tried to writhe free a young lieutenant was approaching and kydd hung his head in stupefied dejection waiting for recognition ah yes looks fit enough hey youwhich ship what rate o seaman kydd struggled with his befuddled mind er theres a mistake he mumbled thats sir t you cully the seaman said with a sharp cuff to kydds head um sir y cant take me im er that is t say im he trailed off weakly and pray what are you then a gentleman the officer said sarcastically eyeing kydds appearance or possibly the captain of your ship as cant be spared the seaman tittered kydd said nothing overcome with mortification the lieutenant changed his tone now theres nothing to be ashamed of should you show willing in the kings service we can make a man of you proud to serve who knows theres been those whove been rated full petty officer in just a few years numb kydd was led off with the others by the impress service the regular organisation for supplying the fleet with men he knew they were going to the receiving ship an old no longer fitforservice hulk moored well out there they were herded into the darkness of the hold and the gratings slid into place with hopeless finality two dim lanthorns revealed dirty straw and pitiful bodies a pail of water in the corner in the morning he would be cleaned up to go before the regulating captain who he recalled was byam honourably wounded at the nile without question he would be recognised the drinkhaze fled leaving him in full knowledge of the horror of his situation he would be laughed out of the navy even the merchant sailors would chortle with glee at the story of his downfall to the disgrace of his family he would be pointed out wherever he went as the captain who had been pressed by his own press gang the long night passed in selfcondemnation recrimination and torturing images of his shocked friends and relations as they heard the news how could he bear the shame what excuse could he offer he lay sleepless on the rank straw dreading the day to come at first light the guards took up position at the grating kydd heard footsteps approaching and saw figures peering down he shrank away there were muffled voices then a guard lifted away the grating and swung over a lanthorn hey yair you wi the grego kydd looked up miserably yes thats him the villain came a cultured voice another loomed next to him the ladder was slid down up n out matey an no tricks kydd climbed slowly misery overflowing he reached the top and raised his eyesto be met with the grave face of nicholas renzi who said with a sigh its him tom brown gunners mate never to be trusted ashore i dare to say that teazers captain will know what to do with him he turned to the lieutenant i do thank you for securing himwell have him back aboard immediately i dont believe captain byam need be troubled then he ordered the thickset seaman next to him hale him into the longboat directly if you please tobias stirk grinned mirthlessly and frogmarched kydd away chapter hearing movement in the other bedroom renzi sat up although he was very tired he rose quickly and dressed it had been a long distressing night after frantically searching for kydd for hours he had gone to teazer and found stirk together with stirk sworn to secrecy they had scoured the dockyard and town then despairing they had thought to check the press gang catch renzi knocked softly kydds pain was heartbreaking and he was clearly not responsible for his actions who knew what he might do next tom he called gently are you awake brother there was an indistinct murmur renzi entered to his surprise kydd was shaved dressed and tying his neckcloth do i see you well my friend renzi ventured as yed expect kydd did not take his eyes from the mirror believe me brother you have my every understanding when ones wits are askew with grief there is no telling where the mind will stray spare me yr pity nicholas kydd said it happened im saying that ive yet to meet the man who trapped in a pit is able to fix on far horizons what you did what i did was weak an foolish i couldve brought th service t contempt an ridicule he paused im t beim beholden t ye nicholas fr what ye did last night it was nothing more than a friend would do dear fellow kydd resumed at the mirror im goin back aboard this is m duty an this i must obey above all things he paused it was th last thing she spoke t me o course he added swallowing hard a noble sentiment thomas fitting for a gentleman of the first rank kydd found his waistcoat yell oblige me b tellin how many er who saw me last night why none of acquaintance i believe renzi answered equably the quarter is not favoured by kings men but there was stirk it was toby stirk who thought to summon a waterman once we were landed and even gave you his coat to wear over yours on the way back do you think he would be the kind of man to glory in his captains abasement there is none who and cecilia she will now be in possession of my note detailing how you were cruelly set upon by footpads while taking the night air to clear your head and that visitors are discouraged kydd finished dressing im returnin t teazer now he said abruptly do ye wish t come if that is my duty captain it is the waterman under the tightlipped grimace of his passenger bent to his oars and sent the wherry skimming across to the little brig in barn pool rounding the pretty stern windows he brought it expertly alongside her sidesteps and kydd boarded briskly you sir he roared at prosser the lounging mateofthewatch who straightened in dismay at kydds sudden appearance what kind o watch cant sight their captain returnin on board prosser snatched off his hat er youre not in uniform sir he said weakly farther forward the boatswain faltered under kydds glare wewe werent told ye was comin sir he said hurriedly the watch found things that needed attention round the decks this is not a kings ship its a dutch scow what are th men doin forard kydd said angrily hangin out th washing ifn ye cant take charge properly mr prosser ill find someone who will he stalked down to his cabin renzi paused then descended the after hatchway to his own tiny hideaway to wait out the mood the morning wore on he usually worked by the clear light of the stern windows in the captains cabin he gathered up his papers and made his way aft knocked softly and waited yes the impatient tone made him hesitate kydd was at his desk his face stony is there anything y need oher you wished to sight the quarterly return on casks shaken renzi said thinking quickly will this be the right time do you think not now ask th bosun to step aft if y please the afternoon watch came to an end and the starboard watch for liberty mustered there would be the usual sore heads in the morning after their time ashore standish paid his respects warily and was off as smartly leaving the ship to its evening rest renzi waited a little longer then went up kydd was sitting motionless by the stem windows gazing out at the shadowed waters iill be stayin with teazer for now nicholas he said stiffly yere at liberty t use number eighteen as y see fit thank you my friend renzi said quietly but as youll know weve been at sixes and sevens in recent days i need to take some quiet time to bring things to order i shall stay aboard without asking he sat down in the opposite chair kydd stirred and cleared his throat ships business then do y care t share m dinner it was a cheerless meal not so much kydds halting conversation or his silences but the contrast with what had been before kydds face was drawn his eyes dull and there was no lighthearted taking up of renzis witty sallies as soon as he decently could renzi excused himself the next day kydd kept to his cabin life aboard teazer settled to a dreary stasis at her mooring the entire ship affected by the solitary and melancholy figure in the captains cabin renzi knew the cause of the flares of temper the distracted silences kydd had seized on duty as salvationthe stern call to a code of conduct that was plain uncompromising and immediate a pathway out which would offer a clear and unthinking course to follow that was sure and secure and it was denied him while teazer lay idle what would admiral lockwood plan for them he wondered it was an embarrassment now to have kydd in his command despite his recent successful cruise another antismuggling patrol worthy but dull with possibly the admiralty questioning continued employment of such a proven asset in this way it would probably be a vague order to keep the seas as far from plymouth as could be contrived in any event the sooner they got under way the better on the fifth day standish went ashore to the dockyard and returned with packages he disappeared into kydds cabin and soon the ship was alive with rumourorders had arrived at last the ships clerk reported with the others while the cabin filled with animated chatter renzi picked up the single sheet and agreeable to an admiralty order you are detached from duty in the plymouth command and shall proceed forthwith to join the channel islands squadron renzi smiled cynically not only had lockwood rid himself of his embarrassment but had even managed to have them consigned to the quiet backwater guarding those lonely english outposts the tiny channel islands near the french coast he had never heard of any stirring battles in that quarterin fact nothing of note in all the years of war it was exile for kydd he looked again the date was a good seven months earlier lockwood had been asked then to provide a vessel but had held on jealously to his small fleetuntil now were near ready t sail whats to do about our marines kydd exploded as though it was renzis fault well hear back soon im sure of it renzi responded although he felt that kydd had enough on his hands without insisting they ship the complement of marines to which they were entitled since they were now proceeding to a foreign station he had himself worded the application which had been duly acknowledged but kydd was in a dangerous mood dont th marines barrack in stonehouse ive a mind t go ashore an stir the idle swabs there was no dissuading him and renzi found himself hurrying behind as kydd stalked the short distance from stonehouse pool to the massive light grey stonework of the barracks a sentry snapped to attention and slapped his musket bringing a lieutenant strolling out from the gatehouse sir he said saluting smartly what can i do commander kydd hms teazer an where are our marines the lieutenant blinked sir ive not time t discuss th matter please t conduct us to yr general in charge the colonel commandant the lieutenant said clearly pained this is irregular sir perhaps the adjutant might satisfy they headed across the parade ground passing several drill squads of marines executing complex manoeuvres kydd did not waste time kydd hms teazer were t sail soon an ive heard nothing of our marines sir the adjutant steepled his fingers then glanced up at the ramrodstraight colour sergeant at his side then im to understand that you seek a company of marines to make up the complement of your fine vessel before you sail yes the adjutant barked sarnt go outside and find this officer some marines sah bellowed the man with a quivering salute and marched noisily away in a suspiciously short time he marched back in and crashed to attention with another salute sah no marines sah none no marines atall sah the adjutant assumed an expression of saintly sorrow there commander you see we cannot help youthere are no marines left i regret to say sounds of screamed orders on the parade ground outside echoed in the office kydd took a deep breath you flam me sir an ill not stand fr it he snarled what are th men outside a flock o goats if i dont get m men an that main quickly ill commander there seems to be a misunderstanding the adjutant said smoothly we may yet find you some men he pointed at the colour sergeant tell me what do you see there a marine kydd grated without humour no sir if you will observe the man bears facings and cuffs of royal blue this to the knowing signifies a royal regiment sir he is a royal marine and has been since his majesty in the year two did us the signal honour of recognising our services to the crown of the last century or so sah the colour sergeant blurted in satisfaction loyal an royal it is sah so you see these are proud men and are entitled to their honours should you take aboard royal marines you will find no more loyal and courageous a band of men anywhere kydd glowered now let me see i have the current sea roster here pray tell where do you see your service mainly what rate of ship it does matter you know brigsloop channel islands squadron kydd snapped the officer sighed not as who might say an active station he leafed through the book a brigsloop ships company of eightya hundred then youll be looking to a company of a sergeant corporal and a score of privates no officer kydd came back testily even a junior lieutenant would be better than none for no one in teazer could talk soldier lingo enough to take charge none but youll find a royal marine is different from your regular soldiermore initiative more reliable on his own he leaned back ill find you a longservice sergeant you might rely on commander as for the men it takes some two hundred royal marines to get a shipotheline to sea and i rather fancy youll have to be satisfied at this time with near a dozen have no fear sir the men will be found the barrackmaster will need the details of course and im assuming you have made application for complement in the usual form our quartermaster will kit them for service and you shall have them before you sail good luck and good day to you sir our marines at last thank god standish muttered peevishly spying teazers longboat putting out from stonehouse pool i rather think they would wish to be referred to as royal marines mr standish renzi murmured watching the boat full of red coats approach lobsterbacks standish said well as long as theyre inboard and victualled in by noon well be in a fair way of putting to sea before dark our lord and master is in a right taking i tell youwants to up hook and bowting the briny without losing a minute youve applied for a removal out of teazer renzi said quietly standish looked at him sharply who told you that his gaze swung back to the boat but its true enough since hes crossed the admirals hawse theres no hope o teazer being put in the way of a good fight and chance of distinctionthe channel islands i ask you he continued moodily and its got to be said since his dolly had the bad grace to get drowned hes been knocked athwart and no use to any i fear our mr kydds appetite for glory has gone and with it any desire i have to stay in this ark of misery renzi did not reply the rot was setting in only the previous day they had lost boyd one of their only two midshipmen there had been a rambling letter from his father about a fortunate placement in a shipoftheline but the real reason was obvious society was unwilling for their sons and heirs to learn their officerlike qualities from someone of kydds reputation and none had come forward to take boyds place this was unfortunate for a midshipman counted as a petty officer and among other things could stand a watch in harbour under the mateofthewatch it would not improve prossers attitude from his tiny cabin renzi could not fail to overhear messdeck conversations at the moment the men were generally understanding of their captains grief but he would quickly lose sympathy if he could not soon come to himself and give the ship and her company the attention they deserved word was passed of the marines imminent arrival then kydd appeared and stood motionless with a look of inward distraction renzi noted the resulting movement of officers and men they were crossing the deck to keep their distance not out of respect the boats coxswain hooked on abreast the sidesteps renzi moved unobtrusively to watch after the sergeant and corporal had swung themselves inboard less than half seemed confident in their movements boarding a shipofwar however the sight of so many identical redcoated uniforms was striking beside the individual dress of the seamen when the men had been drawn up to satisfaction by the corporal the sergeant swung about and marched down the deck he had strong confident features with an easy cheerfulness sarnt ambrose sah corporal jay sah an twelve privates come t join he reported an not before time sergeant kydd said were t sea directly with only one midshipman murmured renzi beside him a mort hard on mr prosser i believe do him good th lazy villain kydd flared but he knew this was no minor quibble the lack of a midshipman in the opposite watch was going to affect more than just the watchkeepers for in any kind of action they were effective in standing between officers and men he rounded on renzi so if yr polite society doesnt see teazer a fit berth fr their sons why im th captain an its m right to set on the quarterdeck as midshipman any i please he retorted he turned back with a sardonic smile send able seaman calloway aft if y please teazer put to sea on the tide and stood out into the channel seen from the rolling green hills of devon there was nothing to suggest that this was anything other than one of the many small menowar going about their vital business in great waters her spars and rigging properly ataunto her pennant streaming out sails trimmed to perfection she was a picture of grace and warlike beautybut on her quarterdeck with the marks of grief and misery on his face a figure stared astern over the widening seas at the receding coast renzi watched kydd unnoticed it would be long months before england was sighted once more was there a chance that his friend could heal away from the memories he made his way below guiltily aware that for himself the exile would not be wasted he had heard enough of the channel islands with their neither truly english nor certainly french character to be looking forward keenly to his time there an earnest guidebook was waiting on the bookshelf and opportunities in the future for exemplary ethnical comparisons would be limitless at daybreak they raised the southwest of guernsey and with the customary pilot aboard for entry into harbour rounded the southeastern tip the island itself was only a few miles long but a dismaying number of vicious rocks reefs and islets were visible in the approaches to the harbour scores of black fangs waiting on every hand st peter port was guarded by the brooding mass of herm offshore and closer to a squat castle on a rocky islet before an inner harbour between there was a broad expanse of clear water sheltered from the prevailing westerlies there upwards of thirty ships were moored including three warships riding to anchor yell be wantin the twodecker o course the pilot said respectfully diomede an flagship o yr admiral she was only a but boasted a splendid gallery with a real oldfashioned sternwalk teazers small swivel cracked in salute as six marinesall that could be found room for on the afterdeckwere drawn up and with much stamping and slapping of muskets brought proudly to attention away the gig kydd in full dress uniform stepped gravely into the boat renzi watched it stroke smartly away for the flagship the twittering of pipes carried over the water as kydd mounted the side and was gone ill be below standish announced a bored look on his face he clattered down the hatchway leaving renzi with the pilot whose work would not be done until teazer had anchored safely this is admiral saumarez renzi pondered aloud to the pilot aye it is and something of a hero i believe renzi added was it not orion at st vincent and the nile and of course algeciras a guernseyman first an always the pilot said stoutly this is his fleet renzi said gesturing at the other two ships both frigates of some maturity even the small flagship diomede was of an obsolete and derided class not big enough to fight in the line of battle or fast enough to stay with frigates well an theres another two frigates out on a cruise like the pilot said defensively plenty an enough for sir james t see away johnny frenchman ill believe to renzi it was unsettling at a time when england stood in such peril why consign one of nelsons band of brothers a proven leader and experienced admiral to be a full commanderinchief of a tiny island or two and a handful of frigates he held his doubts but that didnt stop the boatswain pressing the case as it may be cully but it dont say why such a right copperbottomed fightin man as him tops it the admiralinchief here when a little onell do does it the pilot drew himself up no mystery m friend hes a guern as i said an hes come back t stand by his people in their time o need anything y can see wrong wi that kydd returned his face set great road astern o cerberus he ordered standish who had come back on deck and was awaiting the order to moor mr renzi please t attend on me he added and disappeared below there was a marine on duty outside the captains cabin as a naval officer renzi had been accustomed to due obeisance but as a ships clerk he was not to be noticed kydd however received the respect of a musket clash as they passed into teazers great cabin kydd emptied his dispatch case of papers id be obliged if yed see t these orders o the station as will touch on teazers standin orders forms o the sort as y will see bear on our new standing new standing aye kydd snarled as second t cerberus attached t her for victuals an stores fr duties as her captain will frm time t time direct attached this will it means no cruisin on our own any more renzi frowned apart from the obvious loss of independence the natural assumption of honours for the senior in any combat that might eventuate and the halving or less of any prize money there would be little chance now for challenges and diversions to lift kydd from the pit of despair my commiserations dear fellow how shall you kydds expression was hard i shall do m duty as will you an every man aboard this barky those orders t be transcribed directly an the purser t lay aft now kydds eyes gleamed fiercely his drawn features bleak and forbiddingalmost callous in their estrangement from the world renzi felt deep disquiet the papers complete kydd left for cerberus to make his number with her captain he returned quickly without comment in time to receive the seven local men coming aboard who had volunteered unlike the general run of seamen in england they could be sure that service would be in their home waters defending their own kith and kin at six bells mr queripel a small but wellbuilt man in nondescript oldfashioned dress arrived aboard his certificate showed him approved by the commanderinchief to act locally as a form of onboard permanent pilot insisted upon by saumarez for all nonnative naval vessels in his command renzi saw dowse their own sailingmaster take wary measure of him standish turned to kydd sir might i ask when cerberus puts t sea so does teazer kydd grated until then we remain in attendance at anchor is that clear aye aye sir standish said sulkily that night there was no invitation for renzi to dine with the captain he supped with standish and the others in what passed for a wardroom the cramped space outside the cabins below tut tut the master said after the meal had advanced sufficiently for tongues to be loosened where are our spirits why are we cast down th chances are well soon have our heart torn out on some godforsaken rock and out o this un quick enough mr dowse fr shame said the boatswain purchet could be th frogs are out an then and then they fall on these pawky islands standish sneered from the head of the table i dont think so mr hellfire bosun no if theyve got a handful of hours to crowd across the channel theyll not waste time here he tossed back his wine then whys his grandevity sir james o algeciras sent here dowse asked must be fr a very good reason ha standish came back instantly you really cant smoke it hes here for just the same reason as we are he glanced quickly at renzi who had taken no part in the discussion then went on in course hes run afoul of some higher and sent here to keep the natives quiet he went on strongly stands to reason dammitcommanderinchief of an island four miles thick and not a shipotheline in his command what other reason than hes been exiled too he said bitterly whats your opinion if y please mr renzi dowse asked politely by now in this company renzi had been accepted for what he wasan enigma but no threat he had kept to himself scrupulously careful never to take anyones part his relationship with kydd seen as that of an eccentric and needy scholiast taking advantage of the free board and lodging due a ships clerk a quiet and amiable manner however had ensured him the warmth of these men why ive seen nothing so far that might lead us to suppose there has been some form of alienation but this presents a mystery i fear that without facts im as much at a loss as you are standish snorted if you insist on making it a mystery sir i do not he banged down his glass rather more to the point is our predicament our which said renzi mildly over time they had come to see that he did not carry tales to kydd and were increasingly open in his presence with his ear to messdeck gossip and to the confidences of the commander he was in a unique positionwhich might well end in an impossible situation if he did not tread circumspectly you do not call this a predicament that were to spend the rest o the war flogging up and down this coast while all the victories are won elsewhere i have my hopes of a sea career gentlemen as wont be found here remember out of sight out of mind well not be noticed in this pawky scow he took a savage pull at his wine and he paused for breath i asked to be appointed into teazer because id heard tom cutlass was to be her owner and wed ride to glory together in some famous mauling in just six months hes thrown the lot away in with the admirals daughter and set fair to be made post into a frigate for his trouble me as his premier and he takes up with some country milkmaid the table remained silent and the worst is the looby lost the wench and has clearly taken leave of his wits been touched in the headpiece god knows what hell do nextdo you he threw at renzi renzi cleared his throat the man is to be pitied at this moment i believe he confided to me something of his feelings for the young lady and his present state is perfectly understandable given so we must all suffer while he comes to his senses dowse stirred uncomfortably erhum thems strong words sir he said quietly th man only needs time which we aint got purchet came in unexpectedly i dont mind sayin it before yez all but im afeared hes comin down hard fr no reason an unsettlin the hands then forgets things as are needful if he is um not as who should say square in his reason then god help us if ever we come up wi a frenchy a day later a lieutenant from cerberus brought orders for sea a neutral had sighted two french corvettes heading west to the open atlanticor brest either way saumarez wanted this immediately investigated by cerberus to the south and another frigate to the north to sail without delay throughout teazer there was a quickening of pace a lightening of spirit a corvette would be easy prey for a frigate but the other must be theirs it would be a rare match and hard foughtunless cerberuss bird tamely gave in the fight early and cerberus turned to claim both there was point now to the mindless cleaning and blacking of guns the makework tasks of a ship in harbour kydd could be seen everywhere about the decks and when cerberuss signal to unmoor was bent on teazer was ready the hoist went close up and at the midships capstan men placed themselves at the bars seamen and marines both stir those mumpin dawdlers kydd bawled down the deck to standish if were still hook down when cerberus weighs illill make em rue it to the reedy sound of a fife and the stolid thump of a drum they set to the task with renewed determination well before the frigate won her anchor teazer s was clear of the seabed and coming in rapidly renzi on the quarterdeck at the ready with his notebook pursed his lips they must now throw sails aback to keep from running down the stilltethered frigate on the more senior ship would this be seen as a brazen attempt to do them down eventually the union flag at the jack of cerberus whipped down to indicate her anchor was aweigh and with a flurry of flapping and banging teazer set her sails loose to the wind and settled to follow in her wake two cables astern until th open sea kydd told standish the low coast slipped past but more of the appalling rocks showed until it seemed they were surrounded by them for the moment they would be in no danger in the wake of the experienced bigger ship queripel came forward and stood next to kydd its not th rocks ye should be most concerned of he began y can see em its the tide set an currents round em that cn vex even th most experienced when th tide state is stand down mr queripel kydd said yere not required the mans eyebrows rose but he said nothing and retired to the wheel renzi knew better than to interpose and concentrated on the low sea coast to larboard and the endless dark crags and fissures that protruded from the water on all sides clear of the brayes the vessels stood on out to sea northward taking advantage of the steady westnorthwesterly standish made much of trimming sail demanding a foot of foretack here checking out a maintopsail sheet by two feet there until teazers bowsprit rose and fell dead in line with cerberuss stern and at the required distance kydd did not interfere and when the activity had died away he left the deck to standishs clear relief however he returned almost immediately carrying his octant he paced deliberately to the foredeck braced and sighted with the instrument bringing the main topmast truck of cerberus to the waterline then he strode aft and confronted standish our orders are t take station two cables clear as well y know sir whats this that you believe it t mean a full twenty yards closer the lieutenant remained silent ill not have cerberus think us laggardly in our duty ill trouble ye to fetch yr instrument t save you the figuring itll be six degrees an fortyfour minutes yell set he stared standish down and an abashed midshipman was sent below for standishs sextant which like many officers he preferred to the more oldfashioned octant kydd waited until standish was on the foredeck sighting then stumped off as soon as he had gone standish abandoned the task and returned aft his face murderous get for ard with this you he demanded of prosser shoving the sextant at him the sooner im quit o this madness i swear the better midafternoon the signal to tack was thrown out from cerberus with the amplification that the two would advance in lineabreast by the same distance kydd had been expecting this and from noon had both watches on deck and lines ranged along ready for the manoeuvre the hoist jerked downthe execute in frenzied excitement teazer hauled and braced spinning about handily under her brig rig full minutes before the frigate surging ahead in a fluster of foam but quickly finding need to brail her courses and idle until cerberus had steadied on her new track the waning sun brought with it brisker winds oceanic westerlies that had a fetch of thousands of miles and a steady pressure that drove unwary sailors staggering across the deck it was exhilarating sailingmen came from below to watch teazer take the combers on her bow in a crunch of seas a dizzying swoop and lift while out there on their beam to windward was the thrilling picture of a thoroughbred frigate snoring along in a smother of white closehauled under a full press of sail purchet came aft and touched his hat leaning forward to make himself heard shes like t wring her topmasts sir he said respectfully aloft every sail was as taut as a board thrumming with nervous tension and with edges in a mad flutter the boatswain crossed to a sheet and thumped it with a closed fist it was as unyielding as an iron bar he looked back significantly kydd did not speak at first his gaze went to the topsails which shivered on the point of going aback where the apprehensive helmsman was luffing up spilling wind to avert disaster single reef in th courses he allowed grudgingly out on their beam the frigate was making splendid sailing her wake racing past and with only the occasional graceful nod and sway in answer to the lively conditions teazer however was now taking the seas heavily forward the straining impulse of her sails sending her into steep oncoming waves with an explosion of white sea and then the shock of a sudden slowing courses were doublereefed and topsails to a precautionary single signal sir reported a midshipman cerberus was visibly pulling ahead our pennant keep better station the flags streamed out high and clear it was no doubt something of a sweet revenge for the frigate captain for as teazer struggled to keep up cerberus increased her lead all the while keeping the signal flying it was not until dusk and teazer floundering miles astern that the frigate relented and with a fine show brought to until the little sloop could come up it had been a fruitless chase the french long gone and nothing to show when they had cast anchor again in st peter port kydd had been summoned by captain selby to cerberus what had been said renzi did not know but kydd had retired immediately to his cabin ejecting him as he left renzi caught sight of kydd slumping in his chair staring unseeingly out of the stern windows allowing an hour to pass he had returned under some pretence of letters to be signed at the same time as tysoe kydds servant had under his advice brought in wine and left quickly kydd said nothing but accepted a glass a drollery to reflect that guernsey is undoubtedly the chief supplier to our smuggling fraternity in cornwall and here we are to consider them our charges to protect renzi said lightly kydd stared into his wine and such a singular part of the realm ive read the guidebook tells that they still converse in a species of ancient norman french which your parisian would find it a sore puzzle to understand he inspected his wine a visit ashore should prove most diverting go then i had rather hoped for your company in such an interesting place as we may talk about at a later time understand that i only have th one interestto do my duty an no other renzi tried once more it might prove restorative to the spirit to accept something of the kindness and hospitality that is undoubtedly on offer to the heroes who defend these shores to taste something of the delicacies peculiar to these climesit seems the gâche alone will reward the asking im stayin aboard kydds voice was flat and spiritless standish returned bubbling with tales of st peter port and its social attractions it seemed that as a colourful landfall it was fulfilling every expectation renzi was sorely tempted what he had read so far in the guidebook had been explicit about the remarkable differences in social attributes to be experienced on the island neither a colony nor a contiguous moiety of either england or france they were stationed here true but for how long better to snatch a glimpse now it was not hard to conceive of an excuse that must take him ashore two papers needed the signature of the civil authority and soon he was in teazers boat heading for st peter port the town above the enfolding arms of a north and south pier set about a tidal harbour the shore rose steeply behind buildings crowding along irregular streets and directly at the fore a long and busy waterfront lined with tall warehouses that took in goods directly from the ships alongside the port was remarkably busy the flags of a dozen nations visible from the many ships now settling on the mud this was no maritime backwater he was left at north pier and remembering the directions he had been given pushed past the noisy porters and wharfingers and squeezed up the narrow passages between the buildings to emerge on the main street he looked about here was a quality of building that would not disgrace bath or weymouth the shops of a perfumier a staymaker and an importer of carpets from london all evidence of a level of society on the tiny island that was no stranger to wealth a diverting ethnographical study was it purely economics at the root of their success or was it true there were other aspects to their culture high street was choked with people carts and carriages in rowdy contention he found his way to smith street a steep road that led him up to quite another purlieu imposing new buildings that looked out above the hurlyburly of the town to the sweeping prospect of the harbour castle islet and distant islands he found the government offices easily enough and it took minutes only to complete his duty but as he wandered back down to high street and its lively crowds he felt reluctant to return to teazer straight away he decided to walk the length of the thoroughfare revelling in the riotous sounds and smells after so long in the small ship with its bleak atmosphere at the end was a church and beyond a rookery of decaying medieval houses crowded on the steep slopes above boatyards on the strand he turned to go back but on noticing a raised level with the crush and animation of a market he was drawn irresistibly to the cheerful din at the far end was a noble arch and to the right a stone building with in the upper storey the unmistakable lofty windows of an assembly hall renzi crossed to admire it on the end wall there were posters theatre notices and to one side a beautifully handwritten one he bent to read the cists and dolmens of ancient sarnia newly considered a public lecture to be given at the royal college of elizabeth revd dr carey ma oxon etc etc dolmens of course were these in any way related to the cromlechs of brittany what manner of mysterious peoples had created those great stone monoliths had their civilisation wilted and crumbled from the immense effortor had they failed to meet some overwhelming economic challenge and subsequently disappeared from the face of the earth his excitement mounted what fortune to have come ashore the very day it was to be delivered a wave of guilt rushed in he had vowed to stand by kydd in his grief and travail but at this particular time he was not so immediately needed and this lecture given by a passing savant would not be repeated he would go he had plenty of time to discover the whereabouts of the royal college as the event would take place this evening so until then he could wander the narrow streets agreeably and possibly the rocky shore his means did not extend to a meal but there were sights enough for an enquiring mind feeling like an errant schoolboy he set out with evening drawing in renzi topped the rise above the town footsore and hungry looking for the ancient college the town was giving way to country on the lefthand side for some distance he saw a series of newer more handsome houses and on the right open fields and a dilapidated structure of uncertain antiquity where were the college and the people flocking to the lecture he stopped a passing tradesman elizabeth college yere looking at it he was told it was an academy of sorts much decayed but still in possession of extensive grounds and with only one glimmer of light showing renzi entered hesitantly welcome welcome do come in sir the broad room was musty with age and gloomy with dark panelling there were but six sitting among the rows of school chairs facing the lectern from which a diminutive cleric beamed at him he settled in the second row chairs scraped and coughs tailed off in the silence until it became evident that no more would arrive the man picked up his papers and introduced himself the talk was pleasantly delivered and competent the material stimulating at the conclusion renzi applauded enthusiastically but he subsided at the thin handclaps from the rest of the stolid audience renzi offered a question or two which were gratefully received then the meeting concluded most quickly making for the doorall but one gentleman a good evening to you sir he said and i do not believe i have seen you before mr renzi er of the navy just visiting then i should thank you for supporting the reverend doctor with your presence are you by any chance an old scholar of the college no sir so the lecture had been a noble attempt by the dominie to attract the public the gentleman speaking with him an old boy loyally present judging by the painfully chalked latin epigrams still on the board renzi surmised that the lecture would not seem to be typical of the kind of instruction normally carried on then the man asked politely i have a penchant for the outworkings of human culture of any age sir an unusual inclination for a sea officer if i might remark it the mans bearing was aristocratic his eyes shrewd ii am not a naval officer sir my situation is fortunate being that of a man of some learning afforded the felicity of board and lodging while i undertake my investigations for the trifling price of acting as ships clerk how curious the man hesitated then held out his hand my name is vauvert and it is my pleasure to make your acquaintance mr renzi my carriage is at present in use else i should offer to transport you back to your ship but my house is near and no doubt you will appreciate refreshment before you return vauverts house was one of the large handsome buildings on the other side of the road im by way of being an écuyer that is to say a négociant a merchant investor and my name is not unknown in these islands renzi took in the fashionable adornments of the drawing room mr vauvert it would gratify me considerably to know how it is that a distant island barely five miles across can display such wealth and success when others the reason is simple we are left to our own devices mr renzi parliament in london plays no part in our affairs and our loyalty is not to the english king but to the duke of normandy im astonished to hear it renzi murmured uneasily this is so vauvert said firmly our islands were anciently in the fiefdom of normandy and we see no reason to shift our allegiance to the crown of england renzi held still in the face of the revolutionary madness sweeping europe savage laws had been forced through by the prime minister william pitt with swift and dire penalties for illegal and treasonable association if therefore our loyal toast will always remain to the duke of normandywho since his subsequent conquest of england in now occupies the throne in the person of his majesty king george at renzis expression he continued smoothly which confers considerable benefits chief of which is an independence in matters of trade and lawfor instance we are outside the remit of english customs and excise i have heard the term smuggling used in that connection renzi said delicately teazers days of guarding the cornish coast were still fresh in his memory never in these islands vauvert said stoutly we are the suppliers of goods only if our clients choose to evade payment of duty on subsequent import then this cannot be our concern it has served us well over the centuries in truth and privateering ive been led to believe and privateering it must be confessed that many fine houses along grange road here were raised on the profits therefrom but pray do not be deceived it is our trading that has made us what we are that and our independence you will want to hear of our bailiff and constable who in this land hold powers higher than a prime minister our jurats states and royal courtsbut i fear you will not wish to be delayed renzi gave a polite bow and murmured a farewell it is however an unlettered place vauvert added i would very much like to hear of the progress of your studies here mr renzi perhaps at a later date chapter as renzi entered the captains cabin kydd threw him a dark look th ship in th state y see her and y step ashore on the rantan like some jackanapes wi not a care in th world im surprised at ye nicholas it was ships business renzi replied and there being no boat going inshore after dark as youll recall he had spent a cold night on the foreshore waiting for teazers milkboat at dawn and did not need a lecture theres some whod say as yere guilty of being absent frm place o duty kydd said hotly how cn i keep discipline ifn youre straggling ashore as it pleases ye renzi paused i feel youre not yourself my friend perhaps you should dont y understand me kydd said harshly youre ships clerk an have a duty t the ship y know i cn have ye in irons fr breaking out o the shipdesertion angry now renzi took a moment to control himself my dear fellow your words cannot help but strike me as somewhat intemperate not to say provocative and hardly justified youve been under strain lately i know and yere not t go ashore again without i say so as you wish renzi said yet ill have you know that i understand and have much sympathy for you in your loss f give me fr sayin it kydd said sarcastically but i dont see how y can until y cares enough fr someone loves em as i dodid he said thickly he faced away suddenly then turned back with a wooden expression but then its of no account to you o course renzi felt his control slipping confound it mando you think youre the only one whos loved and lost death is part of life and others find ways to deal with it he was breathing deeply youre not the same man i knew tom its knocked you askew touched your human judgementwheres your spirit youve changed and not for the better kydd did not respond and stared down at his hands then he said youre in th right of it im changed with a heavy sigh he went on im now emptyquite empty y see an theres only duty now in m life renzi bit his lip this wont do tom you must come up with a round turnsee yourself what youre becoming do i need to lay it out before you be a man for gods sake kydd stiffened an youre th one t tell me if you were a man youd not have run off frm cecilia to new south wales with a deadly ferocity renzi swept kydds papers off his desk he leaned down inches from his face how dare you kydd did not flinch staring back with equal intensity and said slowly pick up th papersor leave my ship now renzi bit off what he was about to say and made to walk away then turned back abruptly to face kydd again i will not leave the ship you dont realise it but at this moment there is not a soul whom you may call friend and i solemnly warn you as surely as the sun will set this day very soon you will most certainly need one do try the buttered crab mr kydd lady saumarez pressed you really shouldguernsey is not to be outshone in the article of fruits of the sea yes yes my dear the admiral murmured he turned to kydd and chuckled shes localborn as was i and will not rest until you are as a fatted calf on the good produce of our island kydd sat quietly toying with his food now i always like to invite my new captains to a little dinner en famille like thisless formal and allows us to talk freely learn about each other as it were aye sir kydd said respectfully tell me your service history is sparse in its detailyou were at the nile were you not sir fifth of tenacious come come sir you are much too coy i happen to know that you were out in the boats when lorient blew up that must have been such a fearful sight close to did you suffer much on your own account no sir i had th boats crew under coats an sails th big wreckage went over th top of us saumarez waited but kydd did not elaborate and this is how you won your step to commander no sir that was later just before th peace he resumed his meal saumarez threw an amused look of resignation at his wife who simpered encouragement at kydd who placed you on your own quarterdeck it was admral keith sir for a fine action no doubt off toulon captain rowley desired i be removed frm his ship sir an so admral keith sent me t malta to commission a new brig jus built saumarez sat back in amazement wellpon my soul for an officer of record you are a quiet one have you any family no sir ah well then perhaps you should there is nothing on this earth to compare with the love of a good woman to set the cares of the world to naught his warm look at his wife was returned with an affection that was as tender as it was private he turned back to kydd may we know if you have any hopes at allin the connubial sense i mean kydd sat rigid and unspeaking saumarez went on sea officers i fear are so much at a disadvantage when it comes to affairs of the heart i remember once when then his words trailed off and astonishment was replaced by dismay as tears coursed down kydds face lady saumarez stared openmouthed saumarez jumped up stupefied by the sight but caught himself quickly er my dear commander kydd is umand will be retiring with me to the red drawing roomfor brandy that is he hurried round the table helped kydd to his feet and led him into a large room with a cheerful fire now what is this sir saumarez asked in a kindly tone ii can only apologise fr m conduct ssir kydd choked ysee iveive just this month lost m intended t drowning he fought down the tears and added stiffly if you desire sir i shall leave y house immediately o course good heavens no i had no ideahere you shall have a good brandy directly he hurried to the decanter its one of the faults of our modern society that a man cannot in any wight allow his feelings to display do sit sirmy wife will fully understand when i tell her of your sad loss sir it will of course be a grievous ordeal for you but remember that for those who trust in the lords goodness it will be seen that there is a reason however hard it is to apprehend at this time he drew his chair closer and confided you will perhaps not at this point easily entertain the notion but it has been said that my nature is one that in its sensitivity might more readily be seen in a man of the cloth i can assure you that any distress in my fellow creature i do feel for myself he touched kydds arm lightly therefore i trust you will not take it amiss when i offer my advice it is that you do seek the humanity and warmth of your fellow man in the healingthe wellsprings of charity are deep and within us all kydds expression did not change im only too aware that for the captain of a ship this might prove difficult but there is a means to this end im referring in this to the mermaids club which is a retreat for naval officers in st peter port there you may find solace with your brothers of the sea at kydds silence his forehead creased in concern in fact you may take it as a species of command sir i shall have a word in the right place as will see you introduced dwelling on your hurts in the privacy of your cabin is not to be countenanced now i will be bending my mind to the task of finding ways to keep you and your command as active as i can contrive never doubt it mr kydd all things will pass in gods good time the room was broad but low and dominated at the far end by windows that extended the entire width to provide a fine prospect of the busy harbour below ho there the stranger a voice called from the group at ease round a mahogany table towards the back kydd handed his cloak to a steward stepped forward and bowed kydd brigsloop teazer a few in armchairs nearby looked up curiously from their newspapers then nodded politely kydd was the only one in uniform the others wore shore clothes he approached the group gentlemen come to join i take it a large man older than kydd said aye umm of good standing polite to your betters not afraid of the bottle any habits vices we should know about his eyes were shrewd no a pity we can do with men o spirit right ten livres a monththats lessn a guineafeastdays extra commensal brandy extra are you game aye then youre in im carthew of scorpion shipsloop and chairman o the mermaid this is obrien out of harpy brig and the rest youll get to know soon enough he sat back in his chair and contemplated kydd sit yourself down then kydd obrien get the young man a rummer now sir well know more of you what did you do to be banished to this benighted corner o the world i was detached frm the plymouth command o admiral lockwood agreeable to an admiralty request ding dong bell man and whats that meant to say that you i received m orders an i did my duty mr carthew kydd rapped faces turned elsewhere in the room and the talking died away for a space well well do i see a discontented fireeater before me if so you have my condolences my dear sir youll have to work hard to chase up some sport here obrien murmured something indistinct and carthew laughed cynically then my best advice to him is to get used to itthe only way hes getting out of here now is to contrive to be wrecked or become the admirals élève when theres to be a promotion he continued to appraise kydd coolly is it right that you were at the nile i was i see and saumarez here secondincommand under our nel fortunate for you not to say useful he said smoothly i was fifth in tenacious signal luff an never clapped eyes on him but the once if thats yr meaning do ease sheets mr fireeater carthew said evenly this is a small command and we all have to live with each other as the hard night softened with the first intimations of dawn kydd readied his boats crews it was a hastily planned operation with all the potential to go wrong during the night they had been towed within striking distance by teazer he was in the first boat about to lead the shore party which included others who had been sent in reinforcement from the squadron an oar clunked awkwardly as the men took up position for the coming assault hold y noise oaf kydd hissed savagely or i swear ill see y liver at the gangway tomorrow the man stared back at him resentfully all hinged on surprisegetting the men ashore and to the top of the twohundredfoot cliffs before troops roused by sentries could arrive from farther up and down the coast once on the heights there was level ground into the interior countryside and if they could establish a welldefended position reinforcements could flood ashore the coast materialised ahead from the dovegrey mists high craggy and forbidding there might be pickets even now concerned by the odd cluster of shapes out to sea finding a telescope and kydd scanned the area feverishly looking for the features he must locate in order to land in the right place an offshore scatter of rocks that guarded a small coomb not much more than a fissure but which would give them a chance to reach the top there at the right distance from the unmistakable high headland to the southwest he saw the betraying white of seawashed rocks extending out in a distinctive pattern les lieuses sept boues and the rest stretch out kydd roared stretch out fr ylives the need for caution was pastnow everything depended on speed oars thumped and strained as men leaned into the task astern the other boats surged and flew to bellows and threats from their coxswains at the periphery of his vision kydd saw movement at the high cliffedge it was a figure on horseback the alarm would now be given speedilytheir margin of time was perilously small the figure fell back and disappeared they reached the first rocks the assumption was that those defending would believe these lofty crags would prevent any seaward onslaughtthis would certainly be true for a shipofwar under sail but wellhandled boats could thread their way through and make a landing as they approached the cliffs towered impossibly high above them but their information had been correct a fold in the cliffface lay away at an angle bare rock scrubby bushes and the occasional scree slopebut a way up and praise be queripel had the tides precisely calculated in these parts the rocky plateau at the base was all but submerged allowing the boats to ground close in kydd clambered over the side all pretensions to dignity abandoned and splashed into the shallows move yselves he bellowed men started to gather on the rocky strand many staring up anxiously at the precipitous heights light along th tacklesget going then kydd barked irritably this was his trump card numbers of nimblefooted topmen would work in relays advancing upward to secure a block and tackle which would then be used to sway up swivel guns and their improvised mounts in stages only a light weapon at sea on land in these wild parts they would be the only artillery in the field and would give pause to even the finest infantry arrayed against them now kydd gestured to ambrose and the marines began to climb up the slope disappearing quickly into the scrubby undergrowth in clouds of reddish dust at the top they would throw up a defensive perimeter for the rest the stolid sergeant had grasped immediately what had to be done it seemed to be going welltoo well nearly two hundred men were massing at the foot of the cliff each encumbered with a musket slung over his back and others with ungainly packs of ammunition as more landed they were getting increasingly in each others way kydd drew his sword hastily forward he yelled and led them upwards in a rush so much had to go right there were those who were detailed to haul on the tackles unarmed topmen swarming up to secure the blocks more still to fleet the blocks once close up others to keep together for guncrew when on the level at any moment lines of soldiers might appear along the edge of the cliffand it would be all over very quickly panting with effort kydd yanked on bushes to heave himself up the craggy heights muscles burning and his world contracting to the untidy slither of dust and rubble that was their path out of sight above them the marines must have reached the topwould they be met with naked bayonets or but there had been no sudden shouts so they were still in with a chance when he drew near to the top ambrose scrambled over to him breathless kydd heard that the perimeter was secure with outlying sentries concealed and the defenders not yet in sight keeping his head down the marine pointed out the salient features a fardistant cluster of buildings probably a farm and farther still the tip of a steeple for the rest it was open fields and curious cows in a gently rolling rural tranquillity we post th guns herean over there kydd gasped sah ambrose pointed suddenly following the outstretched arm kydd saw mass movement at the edge of a small wood a mile or so away without a telescope he could only squint then as the activity extended to each side there could be no mistake troops were deploying get those guns up here at th rush he bawled and heaved on a line himself the swivels with their clumsy frame mountings were manhandled up and hurried into position men fanned out to either side it was sobering how few two hundred looked when occupying a battlefield but they were in time dusty and weary chests heaving with exertion they stood ready trumpets could be heard faintly as the soldiers opposite formed a line and to the thin rattle of drums advanced on them give em a swivel kydd ordered they were not within range but it would show them what theyd be up against at the spiteful crack there was wavering in the ranks and screamed orders carried across to them the lines came to stop and a white flag rose it was brought forward by an officer kydd grinned savagely the day was theirsand so easily the man trudged over red and angry damn it sir no one told us o artillery in the field rather unsportin i would have thought where the devil did they come from show him sergeant kydd grunted and watched while the officer was escorted to the cliffedge and peered down when he returned he mopped his forehead well sir an i declare mself well and truly at a stand it had been a hard march for the soldiers from the redoubts to the west but they had been too late i give ye victory sir the officer said in admiration those ship guns were a masterstroke he advanced to shake kydds hand major jevons o the guernsey militia might i hope t see you at fort george one day sir it had started as a difference of opinion between lieutenant governor general sir john doyle and rear admiral saumarez as to the adequacy of the military defences in the south of the island kydd had taken up saumarezs conjecture that they were not impregnable and now there was proof positive for all to see hms teazer had closed with the land the better to view proceedings and had the singular distinction of flying the colours of rear admiral saumarez with the standard of the lieutenant governor in a little over an hour kydd was back aboard well done sir saumarez said genially when introductions had been made on the quarterdeck to doyle showed em what the navy can do by jove he looked benignly upon kydd and what an active and enterprising officer might be trusted to achieve chapter the chamber of the house of lords was in an uproar baron grenville a former foreign secretary was on his feet and in full cry in fact im led to believe that this government has no idea no ideaof the dire threat the kingdom now faces allow me my noble lords to attempt to arouse some measure of urgency in this supine tory ministry seated on the woolsack before the empty throne the lord chancellor frowned but made no move to intervene grenville waited for the noise to lessen then pronounced i can now say for a certainty that bonaparte no longer menaces great britain with invasion having the august chambers full attention he went on this is just so the threats have now been withdrawn there was puzzled murmuring then he continued with quiet venom my noble lords the empty threats have gone and in their place is the awful reality from dunkirk in the east to granville in the west in every french harbour and port opposite us there are now being built hundredsnay thousandsof invasion craft whose only purpose is to throw one hundred and fifty thousand men on the english shore lord hobart fidgeted in his seat as secretary of state for war in a beleaguered administration his would be the task of replying to the unanswerable this realm at great cost to its treasure has created and maintains a navy whose chief purpose is the safeguarding of our islands we have a right to see it arrayed in all its might along our coasts resolutely facing the enemy as it has done so gloriously from long before grenville gestured at the wall panels each of which depicted a scene of some heroic sea battle from englands long past he paused then asked but where is it now apart from lord keith in the downs it always seems to be away on some distant erranddissipating its strength on some foreign adventure it should be here standing foursquare before bonapartes hordes turning sharply he looked straight at hobart i beg this house do remain attentive while the noble lord does enlighten us as to why we should not be terrified at this moment rising slowly hobart tried to marshal his thoughts my lords er there is there was a stir at the door and the lord chancellor got to his feet the earl st vincent he intoned a buzz of interest broke out the bluff man in the splendid robes of a peer of the realm was jervis honoured by his sovereign he was a sea hero whose service dated back to before nelson was born it had been he who in the year of the great mutiny had led the fleet against the combined might of the french and spanish to spectacular success he now stood at the pinnacle of his sea profession as first lord of the admiralty and strategic head of the navy feared and respected his wintry eyes took in the excited peers as he paced slowly to the centre of the chamber my noble lords he said in a voice that had in past days carried through winter gales i do not deny that we are faced with a determined and dangerous foe who is undoubtedly resolved on the conquest of great britain you are right to be concerned to question the power of the royal navy to withstand the tyrant he paused it is not in me to find you agreeable words of comfortthat is not my way you ask me to assure you that bonaparte will not prevail that cannot be in my power to guarantee to you in the utter silence earl st vincent added grimly this only am i sure upon i do not say my lords that the french will not come i say only they will not come by sea sir teazers number at the signal tower standish said to the motionless figure on the quarterdeck a ships pennants hung out meant a summons for her captain to attend immediately upon the commanderinchief standish tried to hide his curiosity aye kydd acknowledged dully th gig t be alongside in fifteen minutes thank you flags ill ring when youre needed saumarez turned to kydd do sit sir he said formally he picked up a paper from his desk and regarded kydd gravely there are two matters that i wish to discuss the first of which is causing me some distress i think it fair to inform you that i have received a most unusual that is to say disturbing communication from the port admiral at plymouth he regarded kydd steadily in it admiral lockwood has seen fit to disclose to me his views on your moral worth while serving in his command which are not necessarily to your credit sir this is the wording need not concern you but it should be understood that i myself hold personal probity and the strictures of honour among gentlemen at the highest possible value especially so in any of my commanding officers whose moral example will naturally be followed by those serving aboard his ship now mr kydd please know that i propose to decide for myself your fitness of character for the dignity of captain of your vessel as is only right and proper however the nature of these views implies a moral transgression of some weight and i therefore do beg you to acquaint me now with the substance of i have naught t regret kydd whispered his face pale why surely admiral lockwood did not hetheres nothing ive done fr which i need be ashamed nothing its very odd then that i swear saumarez leaned back plainly mystified he seemed to come to a conclusion and sat forward er very well sir then im minded to take your word on it he put down the paper firmly and therefore unless i learn of something to the contrary you shall hear no more of it now may i know if youve been able to find a measure of companionship at the mermaids club thank you sir i have kydd said stiffly again you do have my sincere condolences mr kydd and my wife wishes you to know that she perfectly understands your sir yes well perhaps we shall move on to matters more of the moment he reached across and rang the desk bell ah flags if we could have the gulf of avranches charts he turned to kydd with a sombre expression youre no doubt aware of the preparations the corsican tyrant is undertaking for his enterprise against england i have this day received more news of these evil works which must not be suffered to continue with impunity saumarez selected the largescale chart and laid it on his desk i have not forgotten my pledge to make your command an active one mr kydd and now i have a mission for you he moved the chart round to face kydd tapping his finger at a point on the coast of normandy a bare forty leagues from england i wish you to look into granville to discover a count of invasion craft and similar assembling there should your report warrant i shall have no alternative but to contemplate action against them granville was one of the few harbours of that ironbound coast lying to the southeast beyond the vast reef plateaus and vicious halftide rocks and could only be approached at particular states of the tide the harbour was in the lee of a long peninsula an ancient town atop its length and long enfolding stone piers providing capacious shelter below i understand sir it will not be an easy taskthe waters in approach are shallow and treacherous and the tidal streams prodigious i believe that spring equinoctial ranges exceeding forty feet are often experienced there he added with a thin smile and you will discover granville to be so situated that only the closest approach will answer ill do m duty sir im sure you will mr kydd saumarez said there may be others who may feel that their greater familiarity with these waters entitles them to this important task im confident however that you will secure the intelligence without overly hazarding your ship or taking unnecessary risks and it only remains for me to wish you good fortune wheres queripel kydd demanded standish startled by kydds sudden appearance on deck in the midst of the upheaval necessary in a rush to sea turned to prosser pass the word for mr queripel my cabin kydd said irritably and left the lieutenant scowled where the devils quez he said to prosser i dont know what all the fuss is about this is only a reconnaissanceaction to be avoided at all costs where is the rogue dammit the little man puffed up buttoning his waistcoat as i was amustering m charts he said with dignity captain wants your company standish grunted kydd looked up as queripel entered the great cabin what do ye know of granville granville not y harbour of noticedries at low water miles o reefs and sandbanks afore you come up with it cn get a nasty lop over the shallows ifn the winds in the souwest on the ebb and i mean t look into it directly kydd said flatly how queripel hesitated then said defensively an if it please ye twould oblige me should mr dowse be heard an all queripel was clearly conscious that his position aboard was local and irregular a hired pilot would in the nature of things assume responsibility for the ship but his position was illdefined and he did not want difficulties with the sailingmaster later dowse was summoned and kydd gestured him to one side as a chart was spread ill hear your opinions afterwards get on with it then mr queripel from the suthard mr kydd dowse came in before queripel could speak pointing to the long peninsula set out to the southwest from the northsouthtrending coast to see directly into the port it did seem obvious they would have to make their approach more from the south wont be possible mr dowse queripel said firmly what with banc de tombelaine an the shoalest water of all t the sousouwest we has t come at it by the same course as all do take from the west an lay le videcocq rocks no moren a couple o cables distant from th west kydd said sourly an under eye the whole time cant be helped sir said queripel teazer had lain uneasily to anchor overnight to the east of îles chausey a sixmile desolation of countless rocks and reefs that were a bare ten miles from the normandy coast and granville at dawn the winds were fair the day bright and no sail in sight but the sloop remained stubbornly at anchor there would be no sudden descent on the port for queripel had been insistent the tides had to be right it was not until after nine that teazer got under weigh the tideset had been quite apparent while they were moored the ship had soon swung into the ebb and the rapid current had gurgled urgently along her hull until in the early hours it had lessened after the vessel had veered right about the busy swirling had begun again in the opposite direction on a strengthening flood tide teazer with doubled lookouts raised the coast an uneven ripple of bluegrey firming quickly to a sweep of craggy coastline interspersed with sandhills and beaches the pale blobs of sail close inshore changed aspect one after another as the faroff craft recognising an approaching manowar fled for their lives the granville peninsula cape lihou lay dead ahead ending in a prominent lofty headland it angled across and half concealed the harbour the sheltering stone piers of the port sweeping the vessels into its embrace were dozens of feet high in deference to the vast tidal range and they hid the harbour completely with everything it contained they enters b keeping in wi the land from the south queripel murmured this lie of the piers would give the best protection from harsh westerlies but meant that their one and only chance to see past the high stone walls was to close right in with the land then make a hard turn to the left until they could peer inside the two pierheads take us in mr dowse kydd ordered lifting his telescope to scrutinise the panorama the distant last sail was even now disappearing within the enfolding piers as they approached leaving the whole coast in both directions clear and somnolent in the autumn sunshine the headland gained clarity but as they neared and shaped course to its southward there was a gust of white on the bluff tip and seconds later a double thump cannon balls plumed and skittered towards them ranging fire only murmured standish coming up to stand next to kydd the villainsll have to do bettern that kydd didnt reply another rumble and a shot passed the length of the ship before meeting spectacularly with a wave crest to send spray sheeting and rattling over the quarterdeck stand on mr dowse he said with a cold grin well tack about opposite the harbour entrance as quick as y please an out again teazer edged away to make searoom but queripel said anxiously an nothing t starbd at the same time a distant avalanche of thuds sounded and the sea was alive with rising plumes boxed in as they were by sandshoals to the south and the peninsula to the north their approach track left precious little space for manoeuvreand of a certainty the gunners in the old fort were well aware of it no inquisitive british warship was to be allowed sight of the harbour a ball slapped through the fore topsail leaving a ragged hole another parted a backstay with a musical twang and they were not yet within a mile or so of the harbour dowse whispered to standish action t be avoided did ye say sir hold y course snarled kydd as the helmsman allowed the ship to fall off the wind standish whipped up his glass siri see two no three and more craft under sail and leaving kydd raised his own telescope then lowered it gunboats he said heavily it altered everything small lugrigged open craft they each mounted a cannon in their bows one twopossibly four or five teazer could take on but wellhandled a swarm together could bring the broadside of a frigate to bear it was time to retreat renzi entered the cabin noiselessly to see kydd at his desk head in his hands he stood by the stern windows for a moment then turned an unfortunate situation he said softly his friend did not look up as would vex the saintliest he added kydd raised his head and mumbled something but renzi was shocked by the redrimmed puffy eyes kydd gestured wearily at a chair and renzi sat quietly ill not quit kydd croaked it would seem we have little choice renzi said standish wants t land a party an scale th heights t look down the other side into th harbour with the old town all along the top and roused by our presence i think not a boat in th night but theyd never see anything renzi pursed his lips no course of action suggested itself and in going on he was only humouring kydd then possibly some sort of spy agent who when landed will mingle unnoticed and kydds head lifted you he said and smiled renzi treasured the look for the memory of shared times now past but said wryly the character of a norman townsman might well be beyond my powers i fear the light died in kydds eyes more and he slumped back i shall think on it he said finally tell mr queripel t present himself with his charts if y would shortly hms teazer got under way from where she had been lying hoveto and made away to the west yet another frustrated english manowar thwarted in her mission to uncover bonapartes secrets no doubt there were those in granville seeing her fade away over the horizon who were blessing the ports odd topography for repelling the foe so easily but among the islands of chausey teazer ceased her retreat and rounded to in a channel east of the larger renzi and standish waited at the conn the rich stink of seaweed drifting out from the scatter of rocky islets a desolate cluster of sod huts was the only sign of life it sounds a right madness standish said sullenly renzi forebore to reply for kydd had been curt and unfeeling he alone would carry out the plan any other conversation was stilled by kydds arrival on deck sir youve given thought to what this means for the customary usages of war yes kydd was apparently in no mood to discuss matters ye have yr orders mr standish mind you fail me not sir he added grimly you have th ship the lieutenant stepped forward aye aye sir the yards came round and taking the pleasant wind on her quarter teazers forefoot chuckled contentedly as she began to circle the forlorn group of rocks before long she found what she was looking for itll do kydd said shortly mr andrews go below an find a notebook he told the young midshipman ill be telling ye what to write the whitefaced lad hesitated what kydd contemplated was causing consternation round the ship renzi motioned the lad to one side i do believe sir that any clerkly duty belongs rightfully to me he said to kydd and as it happens my notebook is ready by me the little fishingboat bobbed disconsolately under teazer s guns while the pinnace pulled out to it by common consent in wartime the fisherfolk were left alone to go about their business but now kydd had seen fit to capture one if it resulted in reprisals and the sea fisheries of britain suffered the threeman crew had little choice they were relieved of their ranksmelling fishing smocks and headgear and sent back to teazer while stirk and renzi set about acquainting themselves with the rigging of the little twomaster that reeked so of eel and shellfish it was a simple but effective lugsail rig the breton chassemarée a tidechaser that was fast and agile in these shallow waters but renzi had a considerable sense of foreboding trespassing in french waters out of uniform they could be taken up as spiesand the french would stop at nothing to prevent information about their invasion preparations getting out and the only way their stratagem would work was if they sailed right up to the entrance ignoring the heavy cannon of the fort and the gunboats at readiness inside he swallowed and glanced at stirk who sat impassively forward next to the foremast stepped so close to the stem there were distinct advantages to those not cursed with a vivid imagination he thought ruefully the frayed brown sails fluttered then tautened and the boat leaned willingly into the wind heading back to granville and its home while renzi wedged himself against the gunwale all depended on things having settled down after the english ship had been seen to give up but was kydd to be trusted in his judgements it was so troubling his obsession with duty did his headstrong daring mask carelessness with others lives cape lihou loomed ahead sail were dotted here and there issuing out from between the pierheads free to continue their coastal voyages renzi was aware that locally their little craft would be well known and with strangers seen aboard to answer a friendly hail might result in alarm and disaster they were close enough now to make out the embrasures of the fort at the tip of the peninsula the long defensive walls along the old town and the high stone piers extending well out a perfect concealment faint shouts came from over to starboardanother chassemarée waving for attention instinctively renzi ducked and began to throw odd bits of gear to stirk who quickly caught on busying himself industriously at nothing kydd remained stolidly at his steering oar concentrating on the approach the ruse of being too occupied to talk seemed to satisfy with several final derisory yells the fishing vessel passed across their stern and away the afternoon light was mellowing to early evening but if they made it to the entrance soon they would have no difficulty in seeing into the port a coaster emerged and loosing topsails made off to the south they were now less than a mile from the entrance under his fishing smock renzi readied his notebook and pencilthey would have minutes only he dared a glance at kydd his concentration was intense angry voices came from astern a french advice boat making importantly for the entrance as well kydd fell away from the main track to let it by renzi busied himself once more and caught glimpses of faces some bored others staring down the worthless fishermen as they overtook to make the sharp turn to pass within the piers on m mark kydd whispered savagely their lives depended on what happened in the next few minutes the twin pierheads each with the figure of a sentry atop were now barely hundreds of yards distant the nearer one drawing back with their advance in seconds they would know everything the pierheads drew apart and there within was what they had risked so much forrenzi had time only for a quick impression of an inner harbour all of a quartermile in size and crammed with small craft before kydd leaned on the steering oar and the boat turned sharply towards the entrance now kydd rapped renzi was holding a bucket on a rope over the side as though scooping water but at the command let it go under its drag the boat lurched to a snails pace and kydd began his count i see sixno a full dozen o chaloupes canonnières he hissed urgently nomake it a score an moren i can count o bateaux canonnièressay twenty thirty the piers were approaching slowly and steadily and if they allowed themselves to be swept inside they would be trapped theres six gunbrigs an more building on th inner strand kydd went on remorselessly something in the muddy water caught renzis eye a subliminal flick of paleness and mottled black it must be desperately shallow here and his mind went cold years of experience told him that the sea state had changed the tide was now well and truly on the ebb queripels calculations had been proved inaccurate in these local conditions they had been counting on an approach with the flood and retreat on the ebb it might already be too late renzis imagination saw them making desperately for the open sea only to grind to a sickening stop on some tidal bank er tides well on the ebb he said with an edge in his voice take this down a frigatesay a building t th north wi at least ten flat barges next t it i do believe we should put about now renzi said pointedly with an odd halfsmile the piers were near enough that a sentry could be seen looking down on them curiously renzi tried to catch stirks eye but he was doing something with the lugyard tom we have enough as will convince even stand by t go about kydd hissed a coastal brig was coming up fast astern a marked feather of white at her forefoot and in her relative size indescribably menacing renzi stood ready with his knife leeoh the blade severed the bucket rope in one and at the same time the steering oar dug deeply then renzi understood what stirk had done a lugger had to dip the yard round the mast when going about but he had furtively laid it on the wrong side at the cost of their sailing speed when they had turned it was already on the correct side and had gloriously filled sending the bow seaward renzi leaped to the main lug and worked furiously on the heavy yard distant screams of rage across the water made him look up and he saw the brig bearing down on them frighteningly close they had not gathered enough speed to clear its pathand the closehauled larger vessel hemmed in by shoals clearly would not be able to avoid them stirk gripped the gunwale and stared in horror at the onrushing ship but kydd remained immovably at his post on the brig men were running urgently to the foredeck shouting gesticulating the ship plunged nearer its bowsprit spearing the air above them and suddenly it was upon thembut the swash from the bluff bows thrust them aside and they were clear by inches the barrelling hull towering up and rushing past almost close enough to touch the noise of her wash sounding like a waterfall and then it was over the plain transom receding and men at her taffrail shaking their fists at the lunatic fishermen the old boat gathered way agonisingly slowly her gear straining renzi knew that high above them in the fort their antics were being pointed out and probably puzzled over especially the odd fact that they were shaping course not along the coast but heading directly out to sea now all depended on speed it would not be long before the french woke up to their audacious incursion and then the first dismaying sign was the sound of a thin crack high up gunsmoke eddied away next to a signal mast at the tip of the headland clearly to bring attention to a string of flags that had been peremptorily hoisted they stood on doggedly but then a deeperthroated thud sounded and seconds later a plume arose between them and the open sea renzi looked again over the side and saw that anonymous seabed features were becoming visible in the murky water then with a bump and slewing they came to a halt it was now deadly serious if they could not get off within minutes they would find themselves left high and dry by the receding tide easy prey for soldiers cantering up on horses over th side kydd shouted leaping over the low gunwale into the water it was hard serrated rock underfoot the striations parallel with the coast they manhandled the big boat heaving until their muscles burned it moved then juddering it found deeper water and suddenly they were dangling from the gunwale at the limits of their strength they flung themselves inboard panting and hauled in on the slatting and banging sails stirk saw them first be buggeredtheys after us he gasped pointing back to the harbour entrance one by one gunboats were issuing out it was now all but over sheet in kydd roared the chassemarée leaned and showed her breeding perfectly suited to the shallow waters of the brittany coast but it would not be enough against the halfdozen vessels now in fierce pursuit then quickly it was all over in obedience to orders and at the appointed time hms teazer appeared round the headland her colours flying and guns ablaze chapter the large airy upper room at government house st peter port with sunlight beaming in from tall windows was ideally suited for a captains conference the commanding officers of his majestys ships in guernsey roads sat round the long table with at the head in his gold lace and decorations admiral sir james saumarez distinguished at st vincent and the nile victor of algeciras he made an imposing figure gentlemen his grave glance took them all inselby captain of the frigate cerberus at the foot with the sloop commanders on each side carthew of scorpion obrien of harpy kydd of teazer and the rest i have no need to remind you of the utmost seriousness of our situation with bonaparte adding daily to his arsenal for his enterprise against england we have now received intelligence of a most disturbing nature directly affecting this station concerning the harbour of granville which is as you must be aware apart from st malo the only anchorage worth the name in all the two hundred miles between cherbourg and brest studied blank looks indicated that this was old news to most saumarez continued it would appear that granville is being readied to play a major role in the armament and building of invasion barges and support craft concentrating them there in great numbersyes captain selby sir the frigate captain leaned forward but do we have recent intelligence as will this last two days commander kydd has returned from a reconnaissance of the harbour by means of remarkable exertions he was able to look into the port directly and make an account of the shipping therein i have no reason to doubt his information selby sent a quick smile of respect to kydd who did not acknowledge it ive heard something of this daring sir carthew interjected looking pointedly at kydd and i rather feel it would be of interest if we could hear his justification for taking prize a fishingboat contrary to the common usages obrien murmured something but saumarez cut across quickly the vessel was not made prize and was restored immediately afterwards and i understand the master did not decline the sum that was offered him for the er hire of his craft you should understand mr kydd has my entire approbation for the initiative he displayed in this matter carthew exchanged a significant glance with the others saumarez frowned and i shall be looking to more of the same from all of you in the very near future heads rose as the implication of his words penetrated yes this meeting is not one about defences gentlemen we are to make an assault on granville there was stunned silence then a hubbub of excited talk if it went forward it would be the first real offensive operation in these waters against the french so far in the warand the best chance in sight of some form of distinguished action but granville in so formidable a defensive position with forts and a walled town overlooking the harbour it would take considerable military resourcesdid saumarez have these the admiral called the meeting to order and went on the essence of my plan is this the primary objective can only be the invasion craft i propose to inflict such damage on them that their sailing to join in concentration those readying opposite englands shores cannot be in contemplation before the winter season is upon us and by no means may we consider a landing this leaves us in prospect of a massed boat action which i can only think will be a bloody affair indeed and i will not have it there is however one possibility left us bombs saumarez paused while his captains took his words in a bombvessel was a specially constructed craft with a huge mortar throwing explosive shells if it could be manoeuvred into position i have therefore sent for a pair from the downs squadron to assist us in the assault sulphur and terror will be joining us with their tenders and then we sail against the enemy there was no mistaking the feeling in the pugnacious growls round the table with shoal water out beyond cannon fire before granville there is limited searoom and thus our force is constrained therefore i am making the following dispositions i will be shifting my flag to cerberus frigate from diomede to close with the coast more nearly and will of course be in overall command the two bombs will also be under my direction and will form the core of the assault to this end there will be a force of three sloops and cutters whose sole duty will be the protection of the bombvessels this was a small force to set against the might of the french but if a shipoftheline was present it would necessarily be compelled to remain powerless far offshore and with the bombvessels warped close in only smaller craft could keep with them under whose command will the covering force be carthew asked he left unspoken his realisation that any valiant defence of the bombs would certainly be applauded but only the man in command would bear the public credit for this task i will be asking commander kydd saumarez replied levelly sir i must protest carthew said hotly this officer has been in these waters only a few weeks and besides i feel i must draw your attention to the fact that he is considerably my junior in the list of commanders im not in the habit of defending my decisions sir snapped the admiral however you will recall that mr kydd has had a recent and intimate acquaintance with the object of our expedition and has done nothing to disabuse me of his suitability for the post he will assume charge and i expect all my captains to support him sailing with the earlymorning tide the small fleet laid course for the enemy coastthe flagship cerberus in the van and hms teazer immediately following leading the closesupport squadron however even before jersey was laid to larboard it was clear that the bomb terror was unable to stay in the line her broad flatbottomed hull making atrocious leeway in the combined southsouthwesterly and strong tidal current it was essential that she be in position before dark her mooring arrangements were complex and technical for it was not the mortar she aimed but the whole ship her sister sulphur was delayed in port there was now every prospect that the assault would fail even before it started and there were bleak looks on every quarterdeck later in the afternoon cerberus backed her topsails and hoveto with teazers pennant and the signal for come within hail hoisted saumarezs voice sounded through the speaking trumpet strong and calm his orders were to go on and anchor before granville and await the bombvessels which would now necessarily be obliged to conduct a difficult night moor a councilofwar would be called upon arrival pointe du roc was raised by five oclock and well before dusk cerberus let go her bower anchor a second streamed out by the stern she settled just outside range of the guns of the fort on the louring heights the signal for all captains was immediately made as you see gentlemen we have set ourselves a challenging task saumarez opened with a tight smile i propose to place the bombvessels to seaward of the peninsula their fire will overarch and descend into the harbour the other side among the densepacked shipping with the object of causing general damage and the utmost confusion for there is nothing that the french might do to prevent it falling among them he looked meaningfully at kydd unless that is they are able to make a sally against the bombs theyll not touch em sirthats m promise good may i know how you plan to dispose your forces sir scorpion and harpy t take close station on the bombs elingschooner fr communication and carteret cutter with teazer at th entrance o the harbour t bar any who thinks t leave the captain of the schooner was visibly crestfallen and carthew curled his lip in a barely concealed sneer and if there is a concerted attack on any one position red rocket all vessels attend at the harbour entrance blue rocket t fall back on the bombs very well we lie here until the bombvessels reach us at which point we close with the shore to begin the bombardment paying particular attention to the state of the tide if any vessel takes the ground there will be no help for itwith this tide range there can be no relief saumarez hesitated it does occur to me he said in a troubled voice that our actions will be alarming in the extreme to the civil populace living as they do in the town beneath the flight of the shells and in sight of them exploding captain selby do you take a flag of truce ashore and warn them of what will occur and warn them sir the bombs are now able to approach under cover of darkness and can achieve a fearful surprise andand he spluttered nevertheless this is what you will do can you not conceive sir the mortal dread that must seize every female heart at the sudden thunder of jove we will unleash i will remind you that our duty is to make war against soldiers not children and womenfolk terror had touched on a reef which delayed her progress and it was not until after midnight that she was reported approaching in the wan light of a fading moon she was shepherded in out of the darkness the ghostlike form of a schooner appeared and a voice hailed teazer compliments from the flag an on account o the tide state terror is to prepare for an immediate bombardment an desires ye to take position according kydd acknowledged it was a breathtaking assumption that the little bombvessel could in the darkness lay out accurately her anchors and springs in readinessnot only that but to contemplate bringing forward the other vessels to their closein positions and undertake an actual bombardment one by one the sloops abandoned the security of their anchors for the invisible urging of the tidal currents and felt cautiously for their appointed positions in the last light of a low moon well aware of the lethal ramparts of granite beneath their keels the long stone piers by the low moonlight seemed strangely sinister in their stillness as teazer drew nearer the small cutter close astern at a prudent distance she rounded to and awaited developments at two in the morning the last of the moon disappeared and darkness enfolded the scene a chuckle of water along the ships side the only intrusion into the stillness then suddenly the night was blasted apart a blinding sheet of flame erupted which froze the shadows of ships and the anonymous black heights of the peninsula in stark relief a fat thud rolled over the water while a red streak drove across the night sky high and over the huddled town to descend out of sight on the other side then there was another unseen guns opened up on every side in an eruption of noise gunflash stabbing from the embrasures of the fort at guntowers along the cliffs and even from fieldpieces atop the piers and all in vain apart from occasional small splashes out in the darkness there was nothing to show for the chaotic fusillade fired blindly into the night from the bombvessel a blazing flash and another twohundredpound shell was hurled into the blackness followed by another the shallowdraught bombvessel pounded away with monotonous horror in the darkness teazers tense watch on the harbour however spotted no rush to escape the vessels within were evidently taking their chances rather than risk the unknown english warships lying outside in wait for them in the first creeping predawn light firing ceased and all vessels fell back to their deepwater anchorages leaving vacant the stretch of water where before there had been such warlike activity from seaward however nothing could be seen of the effects of the long bombardment and at the councilofwar saumarez looked at his captains gravely a good nights work i believe he said heavily yet i feel frustrated without certain knowledge of our success i am reluctant to quit the field while there may well be work yet to be done selby frowned sir weve pummelled the enemy for nearly four hours continuous do you not think that and i believe i mentioned we have no intelligence regarding its effectiveness saumarez said testily and glanced at kydd i could not see into th inner harbour kydd said his face drawn the french are well roused b now carthew put in they know what to expect an theyll have daylight to prepare y want a retreat kydd said tautly sulphur will be up with us this daywe have th chance fr double the fire do you want to return there without clear cause we dont know for a fact we have failed sir retorted carthew we find out kydd rapped lie at anchor today an this night land a reconnaissance party t settle the matter the bombs t await their signal a reconnaissance party against such odds pray who would be the hero you would find to accept this mission carthew enquired silkily saumarez rubbed his eyes in fatigue gentlemen this discussion is to no account in the absence of information i must decide myself if ill lead the party kydd announced looking directly at carthew sir ill be ashore at duskand with yr information b midnight mr kydd said saumarez weighing his words am i to understand you are volunteering to lead a party of reconnaissance yourself you must understand that in the nature of things this must be regarded in the character of a forlorn hope we are all wanting sleep mr kydd our judgement necessarily in question i beg you will reconsider your offer sir carthew leaned back his expression unreadable i will do it sir kydd said renzi squinted closer at the congested typeface and brought the little brass argand lamp nearer it guttered for a moment the disadvantage of having his tiny cabin so close to the main hatchway was however more than offset by the relief it gave from the tweendecks fetor and he resumed his study the small volume in german in turgid hochdeutsch dealt with the perfectibilists who were urging the reclamation of modern society from its sordid roots not through gross revolutions but the perfection of human nature through rigorous moral education on the other side of the thin partition the messdecks were in full cry after issue of grog and the talk eddied noisily round it did not penetrate renzis thoughts for he was well used to it he was much more interested in how a source for this moral education could be found given that weishaupt had specifically proclaimed the abolition of all religion yet the illuminaten could not be lightly dismissed it was said to be a secret society of freemasonry with goethe himself a member and suddenly he became aware that the messdeck had gone quiet but for one deepthroated voice holding forth nearby despite himself he listened it was mawgan petty officer and captain of the foretop an older man and steadyrenzi could visualise the scene beyond the thin bulkhead the others listening raptly to him no mates i aint an this is fer why hes got th mark about im i seen it before done somethin evil an has t pay fer it first he loses his doxy an then its his ship an we with it afore he finally goes down ter his just reward there was indistinct murmuring and poulden came in troubled y cant say that mate hes had a hard beat t windd since losin his sweetheart bound t bear down on im like there was increased muttering which did not sound like sympathy theres one thing as gives me pause t think renzi knew it to be the voice of the sharpfaced gissing gunners mate yerve all got him on th wrong tack hes not a deathorglory boy not he no it aint that atallan ill tell yez fer why renzi held still kydds call for volunteers on his return from a councilofwar had been met with a stony silence and his own offer curtly dismissed no more eloquent testimony was needed for the loss of moral authority that kydd was now facing go on cully then tell uswhys our tom cutlass not atryin t top it the flash hero there was a moments pause then mawgan said cos hes not intrested shouting down the disbelieving cries he continued hes not intrested fer a clinkin good reason hes got th deathwish yer what a horrified quiet spread through the messdeck a deathwish yer iggerant lubber thats when y grief is so oragious y cant see as lifes worth th living y doesnt care if yer lives or dies an then y feels as if bein dead might just be th medicine t cure all yr pain this was clearly a new and deeply disturbing thought for straightthinking sailors to dwell upon renzi hesitated if he intervened his overhearing their private talk would be revealed and his position become impossible but at the same time he could recognise the signs in the absence of insight and enlightened leadership from kydd the malignancy of unreason and superstition was spreading among the unlettered seamen and it would not take much so hes going t be careless with his lifean i ask ye this will he be any different wi us there was a dismayed silence and he finished flatly theres agoing t be them as leaves their bones here mates take my word ont teazer had made one pass along the coast north with kydd at a telescope and as the evening was drawing in she was heading south once more to an appalled standish on the quarterdeck kydd had loudly declared that in the absence of men of spirit he was going on the mission alone it had brought astonishment and grudging admiration but no volunteers now as the time was approaching there was a fearful expectation about the ship landing on an enemy coast under arms to act the spy was utterly alien to the kind of courage a seaman was normally called upon to display when lights began twinkling ashore and a hazy darkness descended kydd came up on deck dressed in dark clothing his face pale and set sir may we know your intentions ifif you standish stammered i shall be landin at th neck o the peninsula kydd said coldly an will cross quickly to th other side which if yell remember is a beach along frm the harbour they wont be expectin any t approach frm the inside direction sir stirk touched his hat respectfully but remained impassive boats alongside poulden and three seamen were in the gig their role would be confined to taking him ashore perilous though that would be ready t land sir stirk reminded you have th ship mr standish kydd said stiffly and crossed to the side looking neither to right nor left renzi held still watching silently sah sergeant ambrose emerged from the main hatchway followed by three more marines each with blackened gaiters signifying imminent action yr escort present n correct sah kydd hesitated and turned to ambrose who saluted smartly sergeantdo you well be with ye sir thank ee sergeant but th men are volunteers too sir he said crisply there was a stirring among the men and midshipman calloway stepped across the deck ill come if y wants me mr kydd he said twisting his hat nervously in his hands stirk growled something at him but he held his ground yes lad no emotion could be seen on kydds face sirif youll have me andrews the wispy midshipman came forward too and looked at kydd imploring so junior renzi thought but he would not be such a loss to the service if he failed to return very well from the crowd now came cries of encouragement and further offers but kydd cut them off th royal marines an these two muskets fr the redcoats in a hushed silence they boarded the gig renzi followed it with his eyes into the darkness but kydd did not look back the oars rose and fell dipping carefully and economically the rowlocks stuffed with rags to muffle the thump of each stroke kydd sat upright his gaze searching what could be seen of the shore until he pointed in one direction th beach therewe land at th northern end the lights of the town were along the top of the peninsula well to the south an anonymous rural darkness stretched away everywhere else obediently stirk moved the tiller and the boat headed in every sight every sound that could not be instantly identified was a threatbetrayal and disaster could happen so quickly the pale beach looked so exposed a low dark rock at the end offering the only cover the boat hissed to a standstill on the sand at the edge of the water and taut with tension the men went over the side then splashed ashoreaware that the hard sand underfoot was the soil of the enemy t me kydd whispered hoarsely and hurried to the nearby rocks searching for a seafacing cove they scurried after him to the shelter their boat and security already heading rapidly seawards with the whites of eyes flashing about him kydd whispered no moren half a mile across here ive measured it wi bearings no lights as cn be seen should be all farmland we come t a beach th other side work our way as close as we need questions ifn we get cut off by a patrol ambrose began we dont let ourselves be kydd said he raised his head cautiously above the line of granite nothing we move they crossed a straggling line of coarse grass into low dunes that soon gave way to firmer grassland but it was now so dark that only gross shadows loomed ahead not a light within a mile kydd struck out inland the marines on either side the midshipmen in a nervous crouch behind the smell of cow pasture was rank after the purity of the sea air a stout stone wall materialised across their path with a suspiciously militarylooking ditch beyond they scrambled over and found muddy water at the bottom of the ditch before reaching panting the far side ahead the ground rose and the skyline could just be made out squarely athwart their track was the squat low shape of a building a sentry post whispered calloway fearfully sergeant ambrose sucked in his breath not as any might say they waited for long minutes seeing no signs of life just hearing the breathy night air playing through the straggling grasses then kydd said in a hard whisper we cant wait all night we go forward when we get to the building we listen he moved quickly towards the silent shadow it was of rough stone but gave no other clue they pressed up to its cold bulk keeping an absolute quiet their breathing seeming loud in the stillness nothing we go the wooden squeal of a door shattered the silence it was opening on the opposite side then came the clink and slither ofa harness sword scabbard a military accoutrement a marine at each end hissed kydd savagely bayonets take him wi cold steel if he turns th corner ambrose dispatched his men who silently took position unseen in the inky blackness behind the wall the random clinking sounded from one side growing louder and more distinct almost certainly the spurs of a cavalryman the footfalls however seemed uncertain ambrose whispered cynically hes bin on the doings n is goin behind to take a piss the sounds drew nearer and nearerand in a desperate swing a terrified young marine transfixed an indistinct figure with an audible meaty thump the figure dropped squealing and choking the unmistakable clatter of a falling bucket like a thunderclap itsits an ol woman i done an ol lady the marines cry of horror pierced the night he dropped beside the frantically twisting shape on the ground her terrorstricken frail cries turning to pathetic sobs kydd swung on ambrose sergeant he ordered stonily the man hesitated only a moment then crossed over took the marines musket and thrust the bayonet expertly once twice there was a last despairing wail that ended in choking andstillness we got t go back now calloway pleaded and the other midshipmans wretched puking could be heard to one side but there was only the serene caress of the night breeze abroad and kydd turned on them on yr feet he said harshly this is only a farmhouse were going on beyond the structure a roughmade access road gave them fast going to the main road to town crossing in front of them halfway if it were daylight they could probably see down into the harbour from the other side as it was halte làqui vive in the dimness they had not noticed a foot sentry astride the road farther down qui va là he called again more forcefully kydd whipped round there was only low scrub nearby pitiful cover sergeant but the sentry had yanked out a pistol and fired at them then hefting his musket he stood his ground its no good sir ambrose whispered hastily hes stayin because he knows theres others about more voices could be heard on the night air kydd stood still for a moment then said savagely back t th boat they wheeled about racing past the silent bulk of the farmhouse and to the ditch as they clambered over the wall there was the sudden tap of a musket then others dismayingly close move kydd bawled there was no need now for quiet they stumbled and rushed towards the sea tripping and cursing in their frenzy kydd stopped suddenly wheres the marines he panted a double crack to his rear answered him ambrose was behind the wall delaying the troops closing in two firing while two reloaded it would hold for minutes at most kydd and his men made the beach the pale sands gave nothing awaythere was no boat to be seen the end must be very near despite ambroses sacrifice kydd traced the line of the waters edge along the beach until his eyes watered the firing stopped but then out on the dunes flanking them musket fire stabbed againinland the marines must still be doing their duty but it would not be long now at that moment a rocket just half a cable offshore soared up and burst in a bright sprinkle of stars a gun kydd roared any wi a musket fire it now but of course there was none in the inky darkness no sailor untrained in the art could possibly be relied on to reload a musket the marines must do it by feel theres no one kydd pleaded sir i have this andrews said shamefacedly handing over a little folding pistol he had taken it just in case a foolish notion but now priming powder it was in a little silver flask kydd snatched it and sprinted to the nearest rock he shook out a large pile and holding the pistol lock close stood clear and pulled the trigger the powder caught in a bright flare which died quickly but did the job come on kydd yelled hoarsely for yr lives he broke cover and ran to the waters edge and there it was their boat pulling strongly inshore stirk at the tiller it grounded and kydd stood in the waves urging the others into it we gotta leave now sir stirk pleaded his crew were rotating the boat seaward for a fast withdrawal to the safety of the sea wait all along the line of dunes the flash of muskets was increasing twice kydd felt the whip of bullets close by the boat was afloat and pointing out to sea but he remained standing in the shallows with his hand on the gunwale then there was a flurry of firing from up the beach and figures were staggering across the sand one with another over his back ambrose an the marines willing hands helped them into the boat and with frantic strokes the little craft finally won the open sea troubled and depressed renzi stood by the main shrouds gazing out into the hostile darkness the talk of a deathwish was nonsense of course but it pointed up the core of the difficulty since losing rosalynd kydd had turned hard and bitter and no longer possessed the humanity that had informed his leadership before it had destabilised his men who could not be expected to follow one whose character they could not fathom whose human feeling was so much in doubt and who was said to be deranged by grief above all the iron control and remoteness now set him apart there was a distant spatter of firing ashore renzi stiffened the party must have been discovered he thought they could not last long against regular french troops and he gripped the shroud standish appeared next to him seems hes got himself into a pother he said casually to be expected well give him an hour i think renzi could not trust himself to reply another spasm of firing occurred farther alongit grew to a crescendo musket flashes now atop the dunes all along the beach then it lessened and stopped abruptly it was not possible in the dark to make out what had happened but standish let out a theatrical sigh it seems to be all over with mr kydd i do believe youll send another boat renzi snapped i will not theres half the french army there waiting for us to blunder in to the rescue ill be taking teazer to sea and boat ahoooyy the focsle lookouts voice cracked with feeling a distant cry came out of the night a seaman ran aft and touched his hat to standish our boat in sight sir he said with relish the tired party came over the bulwark ashenfaced the wounded marine handed up tenderly kydd went straight aft to standish im t see the admiral you have th ship till i return without acknowledging renzi he went over the side and the boat shoved off renzi noted sadly that kydd had not said a word of praise to the men or ordered a double tot for them something inconceivable before the boat came back quickly as soon as kydd was inboard he summoned standish th admiral has decided t resume th action we stand to at dawn this time it was to be both bombvessels sulphur and her tenders having arrived during the night and not only that but a daytime assault for maximum accuracy the tides allowed for an approach at five in the morning and the two ships would pound away for as long as the tide allowed probably until tenor until they were overwhelmed by vessels emboldened by daylight which the french must surely have in readiness much would depend on kydds inshore squadron the two bombvessels crabbed in and began the elaborate preparations with three anchors and springs attached in such a way that the vessel could be oriented precisely it was then a technical matter for the gunners the charge exactly calculated for range and the fuse cut at the right point to explode the thirteeninch mortar shell just above the ground for deadly effect as the day broke with wistful autumn sunshine the bombvessels opened up sheets of flame shrouded the small ships in a vast cloud again the heavy concussion and this time it was possible to glimpse a black speck hurled high in a parabola trailing a thin spiral seconds later from behind the headland a muffled crash was followed by a lazy column of dirty smoke the provocation was extreme and there was every possibility that before long the beleaguered french would burst out of the harbour in a vengeful lunge to crush their tormentors the frigate moved in as close as she dared leadsmen in the chains and kedges streamed but there was no avoiding the fact that the bombvessels could only be defended by the smaller ships with a lesser draught teazer and the cutter stayed off the entrance to the harbour suddenly from the harbour mouth came a succession of gunboatsone by one in an endless streama growing array until a full twentytwo of the ugly craft were in view attend at th entrance roared kydd aft to the signal crew all possible forces were needed even if it stripped bare the bombvessel defences an give em a gun as the redflag signal whipped up a gun cracked out forward to lend urgency the other two sloops hauled their wind for the entrance but before they arrived the gunboats were roping themselves together in a double line facing outward be damned t it standish spluttered theyre defending the harbour as they think we mean to cut em out it was telling evidence of the respect and awe in which the royal navy was held by her enemies nevertheless the battering the french were receiving was murderous and unceasing surely they would attempt some kind of retaliation in the light morning airs powder smoke hung about the ships in slowly roiling masses as the mortars thudded again and yet again the dun clouds spreading gradually far and wide there was little response from the forts sited to overlook the port the french were paying dearly for having ignored the possibility of an artillery strike from the sea dowse pointed over the side mr kydd ye can seewere makin foul water the tide now fast on the ebb their keel was stirring up seabed mud the bombvessels concluded their work and their windlasses heaved in their ground tackle but it was this moment that held the greatest danger would the enemy see the fleet in retreat and throw caution to the winds to seek revenge cerberus lingered until the last possible moment to cover the withdrawal before bracing round for the run out to sea her admirals flag proudly aloft still the enemy remained out of sight but it was time to leave teazer jockeyed round to take position astern of the flagship the last to leave the field of battle then suddenly the frigate slewed sharply to starboard and slowed to a crawl before stopping altogether her sails were let fly then doused the big manowar now motionless shes gone aground hissed kydd we close an take th admiral off things had changed catastrophically the powerful ship was now helpless hard and fast with the ebb far from spent without the means to manoeuvre she lay easy prey sir we stand ready t take you off bellowed kydd through the speaking trumpet to cerberuss quarterdeck saumarez could be seen in serious consultation with selby hard decisions must be made to abandon ship now in good order and no loss of life or be forced later to a humiliating scramble over the side in the face of hostile gunfire disdaining an offered hailer saumarez cupped his hands and roared back i shall stand by the ship mr kydd do as you see fit for the defending of the bombstheir preservation is of great importance aye aye sir kydd acknowledged the bombvessels even now were making a slow but steady retreat to the northwestbut if any of the small squadron was detached would the remainder be enough to discourage a determined attack on the stranded frigate on the other hand all could be retained and deployed to prevent the enemy leaving granville the only threat of any consequence but if once out of sight the bombs were set upon tell harpy t come within hail kydd called it was a moot point whether his temporary command of a squadron defending the bombs could be said still to exist in their absence but he had his orders from the admiral harpy was dispatched with the schooner eling to chase after and stay with the bombs scorpion t come within hail the bigger shipsloop affected not to notice the signal but at teazers gun went about and came up pointedly rounding to windward off her quarter kydd ignored the calculated slight the custom of service was for the senior to lieto while the junior went round her stern to leeward and carthew no doubt was making a point id be obliged should you stay wi the frigate kydd hailed teazer an carteret will lie off th harbour there was an unintelligible acknowledgement from carthew and the threemaster curved away leaving just one brigsloop and one tiny cutter to meet whatever challenge would emerge from between those stone piers the day wore on it was clear that cerberus had lost the race against the tideshe was now visibly at an angle and unnaturally still and the significance would not be lost on the french with such a prize within reach there for the taking it could now be only a matter of time another hour now the frigate lay heeled over at a crazy angle her guns either in the water or impotently skyward her greenstreaked copper bulking indecently her men moving hand over hand along the decks the ship a picture of helplessness when the attack did come it was cunningly mounted and rapidly carried out without warning a stream of other gunboats under oars issued out one after another in the light winds teazer and carteret were too late in closing with them and with their carronades short range could only blaze away in futile desperation as the shallowdraught gunboats swiftly made away against the wind for the north of the videcocq rocks where no british ship could follow it was a masterstroke the gunboats were positioned such that their weapons could bear on the helpless frigateonly one long gun each but these were fullsize eighteen or twentyfourpounders together they would have the same weight of metal as the broadside of a frigate of equal size and cerberus could do nothing but endure until the inevitable capitulation the guns opened with slow and deliberate fire the first shot sent up a plume of water just short others joining to surround the frigate with a forest of splashesand then aim improving dark holes appeared in the naked hull renzi watched in alarm kydds squadron had failed in just a short while the admirals flag must be lowered in abject surrender then suddenly his friend seemed to lose his reason he wheeled his sloop about and sent her pellmell at the harbour itself in the smoke and confusion of combat a miracle happened the gunboats abandoned their prey and retreated inside the walls of the harbour and when the tide returned cerberus was duly refloated and was able to make off to safety but kydd was not of a mind to communicate his motives to anyone chapter it was galling in the extreme because of the gravity of the situation renzi had overcome his scruples and resolved to warn kydd of the ugly mood that was building the savage opinions he had overheard and in charity forewarning him of worse to come he had to make one last try to get through to kydd he entered the cabin after a polite knock and waited it was difficult to broach after kydds wild triumph and renzi controlled himself with effort if you only knew what coming to you like this is costing me in violation of my sensibilities then youre free t go an why you should come an waste my time with yr messdeck catblash i cant think kydd threw over his shoulder then resumed scratching away with his quill may i know at least why were at anchor here instead of guernsey the other vessels had retreated to the security of st peter port while they were again moored off chausey rocks with a tired and fractious crew kydd looked up expressionless since y ask im t keep a distant watch on granville fr a few days t see what theyll do his features had aged so no sign of animation none of the interest in things round him only this dull blinkered obsession with duty do you not think it wise to apprise your ships company of this theyve been sorely tested recently i believe and now to be robbed of their rest the heartless dismissal of the old ladys death as the fortune of war had upset many and the ferocious solo altercation at the harbour mouth had others questioning kydds sanity theyll do their duty kydd said shortly and picked up his pen again renzi drew breath sharply and blurted good god above the ship is falling apart around you and still you wont see the men need leadershipsomeone they can trust that they may look up to believe in not a griefstricken machine who spouts nothing but duty and kydds fist crashed on the table rot you fr a prating dog he shot to his feet who are you t tell me about leading men he said as we cn all see youve left th world t others an taken refuge in yr precious books cold with fury renzi bit out then as its clear you no longer value my services or my friendship i shall be leaving the ship in guernsey good day to you sir he stormed out pushing past the boatswain who had been about to knock kydd stood breathing rapidly and gazing after the vanished renzi um sir purchet said uncertainly its b way of bein urgent like what is it then he said purchet stepped inside closing the door m duty t tell ye sir he mumbled then stopped as if recollecting himself tell me what mr purchet kydd snapped the boatswain took a deep breath in m best opinion sir the men are no longer reliable kydd tensed are ye telling me theyre in mutiny mr purchet everything from this point forward even an opinion or words spoken in haste might well be next pronounced in the hostile confines of a courtmartial i cannot say that sir then what theys awhisperin thinkin as i cant hear em he said gravely the boatswains cabin in the small sloop was as thinwalled as renzis i dont take mind on it usually but as its s bad tell me if y please kydd prodded er i have t say it how i hears it purchet said go on well one o the hands has it as how youre out o your wits wi grievin an says as any doctor worth th name would have ye out o the ship an they thinks as how this makes ye not responsible an therefore its not right fer them t take yr orders an the others sir they say how as t prove it they seen ye change like frm their capn in plymouth t a hardhorse tartar who doesnt hear em any morethem sayin it o course he added hastily they seen ye at granville th last fight an say that if yere careless o your own life whats theirs worth kydd waited his face stony anything else why sir this afternoon when young jacko said them things y heard most would say hed had his grog an was talkin wry like no need t seize im in irons like that an theyre afeared what yell do when he comes up afore ye tomorrow and thiss yr mutiny theres a gallows deal more sir as its not fit fr ye t hear he looked at kydd defiantly i bin in a mutiny once an knows the signs all it wants is fr one chuckleheaded ninny t set em off wi hot words an then thank ee mr purchet y did th right thing kydd said formally the boatswain shifted awkwardly and mumbled jus wanted t warn ye like as had renzi illill think on it was all kydd could manage then ill be away forard purchet said with quiet dignity kydd sat down slowly cold with shock since he had first won command those few years ago in malta he had taken satisfaction that his origins before the mast gave him a particular insight into the thinking of his men but nowa mutiny deep down he knew the reason and it was the one he feared most to be brutally honest with himself he would have to admit that he was confronting personal failure his seizing on duty as the answer to his pain a sure and trustworthy lifeline out of the pit of despair that he had grasped so eagerly this had secured its object the continuance of his professional functioning but at grievous cost by degrees it had changed him become the master of his soul and now ruled his every action turning him into a hardhearted blinkered automaton he balled his fists it had been too easya way of keeping the world and its hurts at bay but also an excuse not to think and above all not to face things he paced fretfully about the cabin if it was not the answer then what was the decanters were in the sideboard he hesitated then took out the rum its fire steadied him but this was no remedy that could only be to face up to his pain the grief memories since that terrible day he had instinctively shied from their immediacy was he ready to deal with them yet a feeling of inevitability crept over him he was not blessedly logical as renzi was but something drew him irresistibly to focus on just one thing the slight but constant pressure at his breast always so warm against his skin the locket he had worn it next to his heart since the day when rosalynds silhouette had been fashioned into a miniatureand he had never dared look upon it since he had lost her he drew it out slowly tenderly for a brief moment he held it tight in his hand fighting the flood of images then snapped it open her likeness rosalynd in black crêpe paper now a little crinkled he held the trinket reverently trying to relive the time when it had been new the cheap gilt finish had now worn through to the bright steel at the edges and in places there were specks of rust but no matter what he held in his hands was rosalynd his sweetheart he gulped as his eyes misted but another thought intruded growing in strength and insistence this was not rosalynd it was merely her likeness it was tarnishing and fading and would eventually disintegrate it was not her she no longer existed in this worldexcept in his memory and there she would never fade he knew then what he had to do he crossed to the stern windows opened the centre one and swung it wide outside there was impenetrable blackness but with it the clean tang of salt seaweed and waves soughing mournfully against teazers counter with only a brief hesitation he hurled the locket into the night it was done with the act came a feeling of release lovers separated by distance would eventually meet again but when separated by time they would not rosalynd was of the past there was now no need for any elaborate personal defences she was safely preserved in his memory and he had his duties to his present existence renzi had been right but it had taken the threat of mutiny to bring him to mutiny the reality flooded in and his mind snapped to full alertness he did not fear a bloody uprising so much as the certainty that the moment an order was disobeyed a scornful or threatening word uttered nothing short of a courtmartial and a noose at the yardarm would satisfy an admiralty sensitive to the slightest evidence of disaffection or rebellion in the fleet long after the corpses were cut down teazer would bear the stain of dishonourand it would be entirely the fault of her captain it demanded actionand quickly what should he do order the marines to stand to heading off any moves now under way wake standish and have him with the warrant officers armed and aft this would stop any mutiny in its tracks but would immediately throw the ship into two camps set implacably against each other he couldnt do it he would lose any regard that still remained in his men and that was too great a price to pay then what do nothing that was not possible instead he would appeal directly to them on a personal level but not as a supplicant as their captain and not on the quarterdeck in the usual way his servant tysoe had taken to keeping out of the way so kydd went to his sleeping cabin and there found his full dress coat with its nile medals and pulled it on clapping on his goldlaced cocked hat he made his way in the darkness to the hatchway as he descended he could hear the usual babble of talk and guffaws issuing from the messdeck it was a strong custom of the service that the captain would never intrude on the men in their own territory in their own time still less do so without warning but this was no idle visit his appearance at the foot of the ladder was met with an astonished silence men twisting at their tables and the nearest scrabbling to distance themselves the stench of so many bodies in the confined space with the reek of rush dips guttering in their dishes caught kydd at the back of the throat it had been long since he had endured these conditions inescapable as they were for sailors in a small shipofwar standing legs abrace he placed his hat firmly under his arm and faced them he said nothing his hard gaze holding first one then another the dim light picked up the gold lacing of his uniform and when he spoke he had their entire attention teazers he began i wont keep you fr long now one of yr number came aft t see me thought fit t lay an information afore me as was necessary fr me t know furtive glances were thrown and there were awkward shuffles was there a spy in their midst bearing tales to the quarterdeck he was right t do so fr what he said was concernin yr own captain he said t me that theres those whod believe im not sailin square wi ye since i had m sad lossthat im toppin it th tyrant t no account he paused apart from the lazy creaking of a ship at anchor there was utter stillness this ill say to ye i took aboard all that was said an have considered it well an my conclusion is if theres anything that stands athwart teazers bows in bein the finest fightin ship in the navy then s help me i wont rest until ive done something about it ill not see m men discontented an i wont y have m word ont in the flickering light of tween decks it was difficult to make out expressions but the silence told its own story i give ye this promise at th end o the month any man wants t ship out o teazer cn shift his berth to another an that same day needs o the service permittin thank eean good night he made his exit behind him the silence dissolved into a chaos of talk about to mount the companionway he hesitated then turned to a tiny cabin and knocked renzi appeared and regarded him in a low voice kydd said id be obliged nicholas should ye sup wi me tonight theres some things i need t get off m chest it wasnt until well into the second bottle of wine that renzi allowed himself to thaw and listen courteously to kydds earnest explanations nicholas all i could see then was that ifn i wanted t keep from hurtin all i needed was t lay hold on duty an be damned t all else duty taken at its widest interpretation id hazard renzi said drily to include a zeal touching on engagement with the kings enemies thats a caution to us all he looked across at kydd tell me my friendfor its a matter much discussed belowwas it an unholy passion to prevail or the baser impulse to suicide that had you throw teazer across the harbour mouth do tell if i might remind you it did not seem you were of a mind to communicate your motives at the time why nothing as cant be explained wi a bit o logic said kydd smugly it was a fine piece o reasonin by their captain t take the gunboats out as they did an place em out o reachso i had t find a way t call him off an i thought o you nicholas you always say as how im overborne by logic so i set th french wi a puzzle th duty o the gunboats was to defend th port an its craft they see cerberus an think t take her all i did was remind em of their duty i made a sally at th harbour as made them tremble fr its safety they then have t make up their mind which is th higher call on their duty and bravo a cool and reasoned decision worthy of nelson there had clearly been no impairment of kydds judgement in his time of madness and there was every reason to hope for a full restoring of the man that lay beneath on quite another matter brother renzi began lightly do i see a brightening of spirit as it were a routing of melancholia perhaps aye nicholas y do its been hard he dropped his eyes renzi noticed the tightly clenched fists the madness was over but the hurt would remain for some time and he longed to reach out ah you will probably not be interested at this time but that sainted ethical hedonist jeremy bentham did once devise an algorithm for the computing of happiness the felicific calculus which i have ofttimes made use of in the approaching of vexed decisions in life and im bound to admit this day to my eternal shame that by its calculations it would seem you were right in placing aside the admirals daughter in favour of of the other he trailed off uncertainly but kydd raised his head with a smile aye m friend but i had not th time t perform the calculations and had t set a course by my stars as i saw emand i dare t say i would do it again renzis eyes pricked it had been a hard time for them both but now was the time to move forward er your opinion what do you consider the captain of this fair barque would pass in judgement over that iniquitous young mariner jacko now in durance vile he said languorously stretching for another mutton cutlet why i believe if th rascal should make his apologies to his lawful commander i dont think he will suffer for it kydd grinned and raised his glass to his friend it was evident that there would be no immediate breakout from granville so hms teazer shaped course to guernsey raising sark in the morning the flagship was back at her mooring in the great road and like her lesser consorts dressed overall in bunting but what caught the attention of every man aboard teazer when the smoke of the gun salute had cleared was the distant squeal of pipes aboard cerberus followed by a long rolling thunder of drums b glory mannin th yards an its all fer us came a cry from forward from belowdecks of the flagship her ships company came racing up leaping into the shrouds and mounting the rigging of all three masts at once as they reached the fighting tops they spread out each side along the yards hundreds of men in urgent motion upwards and outwards when they were in position the drums stopped and in the sudden silence atop the mainmast truck at the very highest point of the ship a lone seaman snatched off his hat and as he whirled it round disciplined cheers broke out granville was not going to be a great fleet action celebrated by the nation but in navy fashion these men were recognising their own teazer s gallantry in a very public way the figure of saumarez was unmistakable on cerberuss quarterdeck and kydd made an elaborate bow which was returned at once pray allow me to shake the hand of a very fine officer the admiral said when kydd went aboard to report that was the finest stroke this age i must declare looking intently at kydd he added and i do believe that our successful engaging with the enemy has gone some way into laying your own troublesam i right aye sir then it will be lady saumarezs pleasure to renew your acquaintance in the near future there will be a dinner given at saumarez park on saturday in grateful token of our victory at which i dare to say you will be guest of honour mr kydd in teazer standish was receiving the official visitors and was conspicuously enjoying the task quantities of young ladies it seemed requiring a personal sighting of the ship that had recently fought so bravely renzi however went below taking advantage of the quiet in the great cabin to prepare the ships papers for her return to port the wail of a pipe on the upper deck pealed out this would be kydd returning from the admiral a few minutes later he entered the cabin but his face was bleak his gaze unseeing renzi understood instantly this was the first triumph he would have been able to lay before rosalynd then kydd noticed him and his eyes softened nicholas m dear friend do lets step ashore ive a yen fr different faces if y understands why to be sure but here are my papersshould our stern captain learn of their neglect in wanton disporting ashore they went in plain clothes but their disembarking on to north pier steps drew immediate attention from the urchins playing about the busy waterfront and there were gleeful cheers and whoops for two sailor heroes of the hour as they stepped out for town it was an agreeable afternoon renzi was able to direct their course to take in the colour and bustle of the pollet the boatyards and the admirable views to be had from the upper reaches above st peter port then they supped together at a snug inn with a fine prospect of the castle islet they spoke little kydd was quiet but renzi could see that it was part of a process that would end in a new man emerging hard lines in his features telling of experiences that had not destroyed but changed him rather as a furnace fires a creation to permanence renzi knew that with kydds strength of will and depth of character he would eventually come through stronger and so i give you commander thomas kydd an ornament to his profession and a sea officer whose future can only be bright and glorious in the service of his king kydd bowed gravely in acknowledgement of saumarezs fulsome words while in the splendid room the toast was duly raised by the assembled captains of the squadron expressions ranging from the hearty and comradely to the envious and grudging anointed as the favourite of the commanderinchief kydd could look forward to the plums of appointment on the station they clustered about him exclaiming laughing hearing his modest protestations while saumarez stood watching benevolently i do believe you have now proved yourself mr kydd he called so im giving you an independent cruise sir there were admiring gasps and growls of envy from the others and a slow smile spread on kydds faceand stayed the news raced round teazer an independent meant that as long as no other was in at the capture of a prize it would be theirs duly condemned ship and cargo would be sold and the proceeds would go to the captorswith of course a share due to the commanderinchief the atmosphere aboard changed this was a captain who was demonstrably a favourite of saumarez and any lucky enough to be in his ships company would now share in his fortune there would be no more talk of mutiny three days later prosser returned from the admirals office with orders renzi signed for them and locked them away in kydds confidential drawer for his return from shore a cruise t the west o bréhat kydd grunted with satisfaction picked up an inner packet and looked at it with delighted surprise do y smoke what this is he said impressed its m first sealed orders nicholas it seemed from the superscription that prior to kydds relief of scorpion off les héaux de bréhat there was a special mission to be performed as specified in these secret orders they were to be opened precisely at noon the next day when teazer was required to be in position three leagues northeast of st peter port halfway between guernsey and alderney and action taken accordingly secret orders kydd said in awe were full stored n watered tomorrow we make discovery o the contents and find we may be under weigh fr holland th south seasanywhere i rather think not renzi said as you see we have to be at bréhat directly following in fact it rather exercises the intellects as to what precisely can be done in just the one day chapter as teazer stood out into the little russel passage in the brisk morning breeze kydd fought to suppress his emotions with his mind no longer at severe distraction he was able to take his fill of the sights and the perfection in the way his ship lifted so willingly to the seas in the furious rush of events of the last few months he had neglected her but now with everything set fair ahead he would take time to renew their relationship as if sensing his attention teazers bows rose gave a spirited toss and with a thump she threw a playful dash of spume aft that wetted his lips with salt his heart went out to the little ship now so far from malta where she had been born the cruise was just what was needed to pull teazers company together kydd turned with a grin to standish next to him on the quarterdeck the officer returned an uncertain smile and occupied himself with his telescope grande canupe safely abeam kydd ordered a northeasterly course and in less than two hours had made the specified position savouring the moment he waited for the eight bells of midday to ring out then went below hed concluded that in naval terms renzi was more of a captains secretary than a mere ships clerk no matter what was entered in the muster book and therefore could be made privy to any operational confidentialities its noon nicholas he said casually fingering the sealed packet i do believe im t open my secret orders it was disappointing in a way just a single sheet of paper folded several times no enclosures still this was his first time opening such orders and he scanned it quickly from an anonymous hand he learned that he was to recover a chest from the french coast and keep it safe until he returned from the cruise then he would pass it to the commanderinchief the entire operation was to be conducted in the greatest possible secrecy we have t steer small wi this mission nicholas kydd mused not even kit standish renzi looked at him soberly i can conceive of why it should be so he said supposing it were to contain documents and plans won at great personal cost the very knowledge that we have it might nullify any advantage we gain from the intelligenceand put to hazard the brave soul who brings it aye it seems th admiral took pains t make sure th orders couldnt be known afore we sailed an as far as we can fathom it might all be a reglar done thing kydd read the instructions more slowly lanse pivette i figure thats t be somewheres south o cap de la hague this was the very tip of normandy to the north he continued we close wi a small beach after dark an lift it offits passin strange it says nothin about anyone handin it over just the spot th exact time an date thats as if the bearer wishes to disassociate from us reasonably it would seem renzis halfsmile appeared i cannot help but observe dear fellow that there is something else perhaps we should consider and that is if we are betrayed the time and place being known we will then be delivered into the hands of the enemy or this is th way its to be done b those in the character of aa spy kydd said stoutly we carry out our orders nicholas certainly renzi said its just thatthis creeping about like a common thief is not to my liking i fear im not your born intelligencer rest easy m friend youre not t be troubled in this kydd said it should be quick enough done the strictures on secrecy meant that besides dowse only one other aboard queripel was told the exact location they were heading for but neither was informed of the reason it was not going to be easy but clearly the nameless hero who had tracked across the lonely wilderness of the interior to deposit the chest would be counting on them to muster sufficient seamanship to achieve the last lap in its journey sir its a wild an savage shore queripel said warily i remember passing th nez during the peace glad o some shelter frm the alderney race an recollect as how theres tidal rocks close by as yed be glad to keep off from an approach b night i doubts it sir together he and kydd pored over the charts to the north beyond the nez the point guarding the bay lanse pivette was the race of alderney with the fiercest currents to be found anywhere as the ebb tide turned the direction of the water would reverse flooding in to fill the race from the wider atlantic in surging currents that at times could exceed a ships best sailing speed a fearful hazard picking up on something queripel had said kydd formed his plan that evening a small british warship would be seen sailing northward along the coast probably intending to round the cape to look in on cherbourg as so many had done in this war its inexperienced commander would pass the nez de jobourg immediately find himself in the teeth of the race and dismayed fall back into the lee of the nez to ride out the hours until the tide slackened for this he would choose lanse pivette there was no time to lose kydd bounded up to the upper deck and told standish ease away t th east if y pleasecap de flamanville this was a dozen miles to the south of the nez and would allow them to come up as though on their way to the north they raised the odd semicircular headland in two hours and pretended to look into the tiny harbour before shaping course to the north it needed careful sailtrimming and continual work with the log over the taffrail to keep a constant speed in order that teazer would meet the alderney race at the right tide state kydd hid a smile at standish trying to contain his curiosity at the activity ahead the bold and characteristic shape of the nez de jobourg firmed in the afternoon sun and queripel pointed out the features la ronde he said respectfully of the tail of high rocks extending into the sea at the northern end of the quartermile bay his gaze shifted farther round to a tiny beach lanse pivette he grunted it was a good anchorage for anything except a southerly kydds information was that the chest would be placed behind a rock at the welldefined inner end of the small beach he hauled out his watch tide is well on th make he said in satisfaction the race is beyond aye sir no moren a halfmile or so the shoreline was rugged and precipitous grey granite and scrubby vegetation with no sign of life in the soft lateafternoon sunlight kydd trained his glass on the little beach until his eyes watered but could see nothing beyond the dash of ruddy gold sand amid the sombre crags the breeze was lightening as they skirted la ronde and weathered the nezfull into the making tide of the race the current was more rapid than any kydd could remember fretful ripples and sliding overfalls were hurrying towards them as far as the eye could see in the light airs teazer had no chance with all sail set the water gurgled past in a fine wakebut she made no headway the coastline abeam quite stationary then sliding away as they were carried back where they had come from queripel smiled a calm day he offered in a southerly gale tide agin wind twould amaze the seas as are kicked up an tide with a blowwhy in highwater springs we cn meet wi nine ten knots an then aye ill remember kydd said there might be not a soul to witness teazers arrival but if there was it had to look right helm up an wear into the bay he ordered the ship found her lee and the anchor tumbled down as the sun set out to sea standish could not hold his curiosity any longer and came up to stand next to kydd as the sails were furled to anchor sir on an enemy shore the gig an two hands in th water after dark wewere not going ashore sir it was normally the prerogative of the first lieutenant to lead any party out of a ship no i am the evening drew in with no movement seen ashore this desolate spot would seldom be visited by any other than fishermen kydd felt a thrill of apprehension this was different from his hotblooded landing at granville here there was time to admire the rugged sunset beautyand imagine what could go wrong was a troop of soldiers concealed ashore did a warship lie beyond the point waiting to come down with the tide and fall upon them if it appeared while he was ashore standish had the bounden duty to cut the cable and run leaving them to the french as spies caught in the act a threequarter moon was low in the sky and it was time the gig was lowered gently two seamen cobb and manley took the oars kydd the tiller and the boat pulled strongly inshore as soon as they had left the comforting mass of the sloop he became aware of the evening quiet just the slop and gurgle of water the distant hiss of waves on shingleand the enfolding shadows reaching out to claim them the boat nudged sand and kydd stepped out well be back directly he said to manley cobb followed him up the beach the land felt inert and lifeless underfoot adding to kydds unease he stopped and held up his hand there was not the slightest sound he looked about eyes straining the tiny beach ended in a long ledge of rock at the northwestern end they trudged over and behind the rock in its shadow found an ordinary oblong wooden case with crude rope handles kydd took one endit was heavy but not impossible for themand cobb grabbed the other before they lifted it kydd froze was that a tiny scrape a slither with an outraged squawk a large seabird launched itself past them kydd cursed and the two manhandled the chest into the boat kydd threw his boatcloak over to conceal it go he hissed at manley and they returned hurriedly to teazer standish was leaning over the side in great curiosity strike it down into m cabin immediately kydd snapped at the two seamen and ordered standish brusquely to get the ship to sea immediately hed done it as teazer leaned to the soft night airs kydd had the satisfaction of knowing that he had successfully performed his first secret order and now could concentrate on proper sailoring hauling their wind for the south they tried to make up the time to the rendezvous sailing between guernsey and jersey taking care to fetch the treacherous roches douvresrock dovers to the sailorsin the safety of morning light it was a sobering passage kydd had made up his mind to learn what he could of the area in which teazer would be operating for the foreseeable future a maze of shoals subsea reefs fierce tidal currents and some of the most desolate and forbidding coasts he had ever seen added to which there was the lesson learned of these waters early in the war when saumarez himself had been chased by five french warships and thrown his heavy frigate through the hideous tangle of rocks in the west of guernsey to freedom a tribute to his courage and to his exceptional knowledge of local conditions queripel had been eager to pass on what he knew and kydd began to accrue knowledge and wisdom as he did so his respect for those who daily plied these waters increased any who could keep the seas off this ironbound coast would be a good seaman including the french st malo an ancient town deep in the main bay of brittany had produced daring corsairs for centuries some even now prowling as far afield as the indian ocean this cruise would not be a sinecure off the wicked tumble of greybrown rocks that was the île de bréhat he saw a sloop hoveto her challenge was smartly run up but kydd was ready with the private signal it was of course carthew in scorpion but this time there was no doubting the senior vessel and as custom dictated teazer was sent round her stern to respectfully round to for hailing youve taken your time i observe mr kydd he blared through his speaking trumpet id expected you a day or more ago what delayed you it took kydd aback it was unlikely that carthew had knowledge of his secret orders and in any case it was not to be discussed in such a public way er an errand fr admiral saumarez he bellowed back all concluded now i should think so carthew said tartly then added no french about as ive seen to the westward quiet in paimpol and you have harpy to the eastd for a rendezvous here in six days any questions no sir very well good hunting he said flatly his bored tone implied disinterest in kydds prospects and scorpion lost no time in bracing round and making off to the north leaving teazer in sole possession of the patrol area at last it was a fine morning the winds were fair and there was the best part of a week to traverse the hundred and fifty odd miles westward to ushant and back with no ports of significance to speak ofroscoff was the largest but not a naval port and the rest were mere rockbound tidal havensit was an unpromising prospect but with the autumn roads now impassable by oxcart which could carry several score sacks of grain it would have to be packhorses each managing at best only four every beast would itself require feeding and tending by a man he in turn having needs and this would be multiplied by the five or six days it would take to cross northern brittany how many would it take to keep the fleet in brest with its thirty thousand hungry seamen supplied a humble hoy could bring eighty tons along the coast in a day and go back for more dozens of these vessels must now be threading their way westward trying to keep out of sight from seaward among the craggy islets and offshore sandbars all helpless prey to a determined manowar kydd gave a passing thought to these inoffensive craft manned by seamen whose daily fight was with the sea and this dire coast how hard it must be to have their voyage cut short their ship and livelihood snatched from them then he turned abruptly to the master t th west mr dowse in the fortunes of war the merchant vessels had to take their chances as did every other seafarer even teazer might suddenly be set upon there was no room for sentiment the coast lay to larboard its rocks caught in the morning sun with a soft pink tinge and lying in dense scatters or peeping coyly from the waves in a flurry of white islands sprawled in groups or out to sea as lonely outposts this coast had a terrible beauty all of its own teazer sailed on westward past tortuous inlets leading to huddled settlements ploumanach and skeiviec ancient names from the beginning of timehere was quite another france to the pomp and fashion of paris they skirted the ugly jumble of les héaux de bréhat well out to sea giving best to the small fry cowering up the long river at tréguier id like t cast a glance at sept îles kydd murmured these were sizeable islands lying offshore of which the master would be aiming to keep teazer to seaward but frightened coasters might be skulking among them they angled towards but from somewhere in their midst the smoke and tiny spat of a small cannon erupted closer kydd ordered an antique fort in the centre island was ineffectually disputing their progress it did however serve to draw attention to the channel that lay between it and the mainland an south about he added the sloop eased into the passage with a rosecoloured granite shoreline on either beam and in the sea overside an unsettling forest of kelp from the dark depths streaming away with the current ahead lay only the oddshaped high islands of the triagoz plateau but the coast had now turned abruptly southwards a scream came from the masthead lookout deck hoooo two sail under a press o canvas standing away from the deck it was clear what was happening their decision to take the inshore channel had spooked the two into abandoning their hidingplace in the triagoz for a hasty dash to the safety of roscoff only a couple of hours sailing across the bay i want em kydd grated levelling his telescope across the deck grins appeared mr queripel depth o water tween here n roscoff theres a channel frm the noreast he began uncomfortably aye as will servebut sir i have t tell ye its perilous waters hereabouts can we not noreast kydd sniffed the wind itll do bowlines t th bridle an dont spare th cordage teazer seemed to sense the drama and leaped ahead every eye aboard followed the motions of the quarry whose terror even at a distance could almost be felt the knowledgeable made lordly judgements as to the probable prize value but kydd was aware that things could change in a tricea frigate disturbed in roscoff a sudden change in wind forcing them on to a dead lee shore were t shift course here sir queripel said awkwardly we must be clear o th plateau else we theyre not concerned t weather it kydd said pointedly the fleeing vessels were taking a direct course to roscoff no more than ten or fifteen miles more ii say we must sir thth tide is on th ebb an we they come frm hereabouts they should know its th state of tide sir i mislike we ignore th overfalls o the plateau ive seen very well ease t larbd kydd said heavily they angled farther southwards while their prey flew directly towards the distant smudge of their sanctuary masts leaning at a precarious angle in their quest for speed there were groans about teazer s deck and sour comments about luck and then it happened the leading vessel struck slewing round in an instant she was brought to a complete stop her foremast toppling like a tree at the shock of impact the other ship following close astern shied to one side but raced on desperately leave him kydd said eyeing the wreck he looked at queripel can we he took a reef rock o th plateau de la méloine we have t keep to the suthard or finish th samebut this onehe nodded at the fleeing shiphes going t be a mort more cautious now we has a chance teazer was in the deeper channel and forging ahead but the other vessel was picking its way fearfully through the weedcovered menaceswith only five or so miles to go they most definitely had a chance queripel stepped aside and kydd saw that renzi had appeared on deck wearing the wistful absent expression that showed he had been happily immersed in his books until very recently ah do i see the cause of so much commotion ahead of us aye y do kydd said supposin we cn catch him before roscoff thats roscoff renzi said with interest as youd know a port of much antiquity here it was that mary queen of scots stepped ashore to be married to the dauphin of francein the s it must have been were goin t be in gunshot in just a quarterhour nicholas do y think i should hold fire fr fear i might hurt our prize of course she was only five years old at the time renzi went on thoughtfully a barbaric practice such a union and a fine coaster should fetch a handsome sum asll be right welcome at this time kydd added yet many would remember first that it was here as well that the young pretender charles edward stuart came after the calamitous battle of cullodenspirited hence by a malouin privateer i believe to his final exile but kydd had his glass up his attention on the low sea wall coming into view he stiffened the bloody dogs he growled gunboats a gaggle had emerged and were converging on the fleeing vessel even if they overhauled it now they could never heaveto and take possession weve lost him he said lowering his telescope he swivelled round and focused on the wreck of the first it was fast settling but if they managed to come up on it through the same hazards that had claimed it they could only ingloriously fish out sodden oddments of cargo carry on t the west mr dowse they had done well on their first encounter there would be others it seemed however word had spread that a new and aggressive english manowar was abroad and the few sail they sighted scuttled away rapidly after an uneventful conclusion to the cruise during which kydd had taken pains to discover more of the sea conditions in this forbidding but often strangely beautiful seascape guernsey lifted into view with his newwon local knowledge he conned teazer himself past jerbourg point and into the great road a shame we havent a prize at our tail standish remarked we shall kydd said firmly the more he knew of these seas the better able he would be to find their skulking places there was no admirals flag in cerberus but it flew from his headquarters ashore and their gun salute cracked out in proper style calloways quarterdeck brace was an exact imitation of his captains kydd had been impressed by how he had handled the promotion now in a position of authority over his former shipmates he pitched his orders in such a way that none could take offence at the tone or doubt his intent to be obeyed boat putting off sir he reported smartly very well kydd answered two boats i think standish said lowering his glass it was odd the first clearly contained an officer and a number of seamen but the other taking position astern of it seemed to carry soldiers kydd was ready in his dress uniform for going ashore to report the boats however were heading purposefully towards teazer so he waited when they neared the second with the soldiers slowed and stood off the seamen laying to their oars while the first made for the sidesteps kydd felt the first stirrings of unease as the boat disappeared under the line of the bulwarks and shortly afterwards with the wail of a boatswains call the stern face of an elderly postcaptain came into view kydd took off his hat and approached with a welcoming smile which was not returned the officer briskly drew out a paper and intoned commander thomas paine kydd provost captain william fellowes by these presents i am instructed by the commanderinchief to make search of your vessel he held out the paperand unmistakably at the bottom there was the signature of admiral saumarez er you kydd was thunderstruck around him the deck came to a standstill men gaping commander the officer held himself with heavy patience may i know whats the meanin o this sir kydd said tightly as he recovered himself t be rummaged like a country trader this is a kings ship sir an im her captain ill have good reason frm you sir afore i allow such a freedom are you disputing the direct order of the admiral sir fellowes said acidly holding up the paper im asking fr a right an proper explanation of yr actions sir kydd blazed come come sir you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide there was no pity in the mans eyes the situation was absurd but also in deadly earnest very well sir do ye require t begin forard ill have th men take up over the hold as soon as we secure frm sea fellowes wheeled round and beckoned to the boats party who lost no time in coming aboard leave the matter to us commander he said harshly the men clambering over the bulwarks were hardlooking practised in their movements and assembled in a tight group before the captain you know what to do the men trotted offnot forward but aft disappearing down the hatchway sir ive a right t know what is it but fellowes had turned his back on him and was gazing out to the dark bulk of sark tapping the paper impatiently against his thigh suspiciously quickly there was movement again at the hatchway to kydds horror the men were hauling up the confidential chest he had recovered with such pains and protected with so much secrecy belay that you men he roared in anger they took no notice and kydd turned hotly on the provost captain sir have y men stop thats a chest o secrets fr the admiral th greatest confidentiality t be observed the petty officer in charge touched his hat to the provost captain ignoring kydd in th commanders bedplace sir under th cot he reported kydd struggled for words thatthats a blackamoor tried t stop us an we had t skelp him on th calabash the petty officer added impassively tysoe y poxy villains ill thats enough commander fellowes rapped i have now to ask you to accompany me ashore if you please kydd hesitated but only for a moment the sooner the business was sorted out the better the box was still unopened and its secrets safe perhaps this was after all a longwinded way to get it ashore very well an the chest remains secured th contents not t be seen of course there was nothing for it but to board the boat leaving an openmouthed standish to complete the moor then begin harbour routine and storing for the next voyage there was no conversation on the passage back the other boat fell in astern and kydd realised that the soldiers were there to enforce a predetermined course of action and his unease turned to alarm this was no simple mistake they headed for smith street and the headquarters ashore the seamen bearing the chest following closely behind saumarezs flag still flew and kydds anxieties began to subside soon he would know what it was about they entered a small room and kydd was shown to a single chair on one side while fellowes sat behind a table the chest had been delivered intact and lay in the centre two marines stood guard over it saumarez strode in ah sir said kydd in relief scrambling to his feet theres been aa misunderstanding o sorts saumarez ignored him is this what you found he asked fellowes it is sir kydd blinked this is th secret chest your chest sir he blurted my chest saumarez said in amazement you think to make it mine sir his voice thickened in anger open it butbut sir we cant do that pray why not kydds mind reeled because sir this is the confidential chest y ordered me t recover wi secret um things as cant be shown t the ordinary sort saumarez looked at kydd in disbelief i gave orders youre attempting to say that i gave orders no sir this will not do it will not do at all ssir kydd pleaded dont open it in front o the others i beg was he going mad saumarez paused looking at kydd keenly then ill clear the room all except captain fellowes to withdraw and remain outside he waited until the three were alone now we open the chest please oblige us captain fellowes cut the cords then threw back the lid saumarez took a sharp breath as the contents were revealedbundles of intricately worked lace and silk goods ithis is kydd could find no words saumarez drew himself up his features suddenly old and weary take this officer to the blue room he said dully i will deal with him presently kydd tried to make sense of it in just a single hour his entire world had been turned upsidedown why was saumarez denying his own orders had the secret chest been waylaid and a substitute made for him to convey unwittingly in its place how had the searchers known where to find it should he send for renzi or wait until things became clearer there was every possibility that saumarez was even now finding out the truth of the matter and he didnt want to involve his ship or any aboard unless he had to it seemed an interminable wait and his mind wandered to concern over teazer and her condition after her recent voyage he must have that fore topmast seen to when it had come down to the deck for exercise the carpenter had shaken his head over a fissure in the timber and with the worn main tack having been turned end for end already he would need to do battle to win a new outfit for fore and main both while they were at it conceivably the chainpump could there was movement and discreet murmuring in the adjoining room the scraping of chairs the authoritative voice of saumarez the flaglieutenants face appeared sir if youd be so good as to present yourself kydd followed the officer around a long table faces turned towards him saumarez at the head fellowes to his rightand carthew others kydd was ushered to the opposite end to face his commanderinchief gentlemen saumarez seemed to have difficulty bringing out the word gentlemen i would have you in no way misled as to the nature of this meeting it is by way of an inquiry only and has no legal standing if there is cause enough shown then such proceedings may follow in due course but for now i wish only to establish the facts at hand he looked gravely down the table commander kydd you should know that an information was passed to me recently that you were abusing your position as captain of one of his majestys ships to set up in trading on your own account to the detriment of the honest merchants of these islands and to the dishonour of the service sir who told you mr kydd although this is no court of law you would oblige me by remaining silent until called upon to speak sir there was an edge of steel to his tone that kydd had never heard before and he fell silent but it was an outrageous accusation and he would soon set matters right when the time came with a commanderinchief as morally sensitive as saumarez it would be an unforgivable abomination that would require the direst penalty my source was anonymous but brought forward facts that left me no choice other than to take further action im sorry to say that the information was in the event proved correct and a search of your vessel has produced prima facie evidence to support the allegation faces gazed at kydd some with interest others neutral in view of your meritorious record to date in the service of the king i am most reluctant to believe that you could be so far in want of conduct as to take advantage of your position therefore i wish to establish to my own satisfaction the true situation there was a stirring about the table as papers were laid before him captain fellowes saumarez instructed detail for me your recent boarding of hms teazer fellowes inclined his head and made to rise no no sirthis is not a formal gathering saumarez said with a quick glance at kydd you may speak to me directly sir he began weightily reading from notes pursuant to your order of the twentyfifth on the sighting of the said vessel and its subsequent mooring i proceeded in plain english if you please yes sir er this morning i and a party of men boarded hms teazer soon after it anchored in guernsey great road there i did you encounter any resistancediscouragement of your action erno sir but when advised of the purpose of my visit commander kydd became heated in his opposition to my action quite so saumarez said drily but on showing him my authority for so doing he agreed but attempted to divert my attention forward away from his cabin offering to lay open the hold however by virtue of the information supplied my men proceeded straight to commander kydds private quarters where regrettably his servant offered violence to their entry and was forcibly subdued the chest was found under his cot as predicted were there any witnesses to the seizure petty officer crowe or any of his party present is prepared to swear as to where it was found and then it was hauled unopened to the upper deck at which commander kydd became considerably agitated what did he say i cannot recall his exact words sir for the officer appeared incoherent eventually claiming that the chest was of a level of secrecy that precluded its public display and it remained unopened until brought here all concerned will testify to its integrity sir kydds anger rose at the protracted affair and he made to interject but was stopped by saumarez commander are you perhaps claiming that the chest and its contents are in fact for your own private consumption it was a lifelinebut if teazer had been spotted near lanse pivette by the informer or his ships company testified to his bringing aboard a mysterious chest he would be seen to have lied and then no sir i am not he said thickly im tryin t say later sir i find i must now establish a further point commander carthew did teazer arrive at the rendezvous in a timely and proper manner carthew looked uncomfortable furtive almost sir er come now mr carthew we can easily determine the answer from your people if necessary well sir then not exactly siryour attempt to shield a brother officer does you credit but we will have the facts commander im truly sorry to have to say sir we were hoveto off bréhat in wait for some twenty hours after the appointed time thank you mr carthew said saumarez looking squarely at kydd dropping his eyes he paused then seemed to make up his mind bring in teazers sailingmaster mr dowse sir the weatherbeaten mariner shuffled his feet but gazed resolutely ahead he carried his own masters log information has been passed to me that teazer was sighted two leagues off cap de flamanville and again close in under the nez de jobourg at the time her orders specifically required her to rendezvous off bréhat i note to my surprise that there is no entry in the ships log to this effect can you explain this yes sir saumarez leaned back in expectation mr kydd he said as how it were a secret mission like an not t trouble enterin it in th log do you have the true workings for those days aye dowse steadfastly avoided kydds eye and as y said sir we closed wi the coast after dark at lanse pivette an took aboard aa object then prompted saumarez then we made all sail fr the rendezvous i see you may stand down now mr dowse saumarez said tightly is mr standish outside he is sir send him in standish entered carefully his eyes darting about the room sir just one question mr standish what occurred at lanse pivette teazers first lieutenant glanced beseechingly at kydd then murmured er we anchored in the lee of the race and um the captain took away a boat and two men an landed on the coast o france you mean the captain went ashore alone but for two hands at the oars standish looked stricken yes sir did he give any reason nnone that i can recall sir was he ashore long he was away for only half an hour or so sir and when he returned in the dark it was difficult to see if you understand sir i will make my meaning plainer did he return with any object it was covered with a boatcloak sir and as officerofthedeck you didnt even glimpse it as it was swayed aboard saumarez said irritably it was the chest standish admitted good god kydd exploded this has gone on long enough will no one hear me out with a pained expression the admiral replied i would be obliged if you would refrain from so using the lords name in vain yet in all fairness you shall be heard what is it that you want to say sir kydd held his temper fiercely in check things were bad enough as they were without a confrontation sir this is yr chest as ye gave orders fr me to find an bring back i cant understand mr kydd this is the second time you have made this public accusation and i am finding it difficult to restrain my anger i gave you no such orders as well you know and to be certain of this i have sent for your ships clerk under escort to bring me teazers orders as received that i might verify their contents myself he glared at kydd then called iswhat is his name renzi sir is this man in attendance yet sir tell him to step inlively now renzi entered his features were grave you are ships clerk of hms teazer i am sir have you the original orders for the voyage just concluded quickly man renzi unlaced the folder and handed them across kydd craned to see but saumarez snatched them and scanned them whats this i see here no reference whatsoever to any secret dalliance mr kydd he said sarcastically pray tell by what means you are able to place such a wild construction on these perfectly straightforward instructions sir kydd gulped there were sealed orders as well an they i have heard from my flaglieutenant that your masters mate prosser duly signed out on these orders you renzi were you not responsible for their registering into the ship sir you signed them in directly from mr prosser did you not i did sir and did you see them contain any sealed orders the room echoed its silence did they answer me sir if renzi admitted to seeing them it would be to betray kydd as having allowed him a mere ships clerk access to the highest level of confidentiality and if he did not kydd would have not a single witness to testify to their existence sir i signed for the packet but immediately locked it into the captains confidential stowage renzi said quietly his face pale sir mr kydd sir i find it monstrous that im being treated in this way i did m duty t th best o my saumarez bowed his head and held up his hand clear the room he said ive heard enough you will remain mr kydd when they had left saumarez looked at kydd for a long moment before he spoke you of all the men of promise in my commandto stoop to venal acts as shabby as any kydd tried to say something but it came out as a mumble and you think to obfuscate and temporise with wild tales that do you no credit whatsoever i have to tell you sir im both shocked and greatly saddened by what has passed he sighed deeply and rose slowly from his chair and now i have to decide what to do with you he paced to the end of the room then turned in view of your recent valour and service to my squadron i will not proceed in law mr kydd ththank you sir there seemed nothing else to say however i see no other course than to relieve you of your command as of this hour mr kydd you are not to return to your ship your effects will be sent ashore at your convenience i will not have you as an example to my fleet good day to you sir chapter kydd was very quiet unheeding of the hubbub that eddied around the inns taproom the candle guttered throwing the lines on his face into deep relief renzi felt uneasy would this sudden catapult into shame and an unknown future tip him back into unreality ye didnt have t do it nicholas he said eventually his beer still untouched in the pewter tankard with teazer in an uproar and all ahoo not as this would assist in a scholards ruminations kydd raised his head who is renzi saw there was no point in prolonging it kit standish is made captain and prosser an acting lieutenant the light died in his friends eyes and his head dropped renzis heart was wrung with pity that a man could suffer two such blows in succession was grievous that neither was of kydds doing was so much the worse did they land yr books in good shape kydd asked unexpectedly breaking into renzis thoughts he had found an old sailloft near the boatbuilders in havelet bay as a temporary store for their possessions the familiar objects of a score of voyages on a dozen seas now hidden under drab canvas waiting for who knew what they did bless them stirk made the boats crew bear them the full way then insisted in making a seamanlike stow of them he hesitated then added softly and wishes i might make known to you the true feelings of the ships company on your cruel and unjust treatment kydd gave a tired smile you worry im ready t slip m cable go astray in m witsi know ye too well ol friend his head drooped once morebut then he looked up suddenly and with an appalling crash both of his fists smashed on to the table he held renzis eyes with cold ferocity if it takes th rest o m life im going t get revenge o this i dont know what its about but y have my oathsomeones t pay for it renzi was taken aback at first he could think of nothing to say he had his suspicions but it was not the time to air them he sought refuge in his glass then said perhaps we should give thought as to our future kydd breathed deeply and forced himself into control his knuckles were still white and renzi felt a fleeting pity for the perpetrator when his friend finally found him er what do ye suggest well theres nothing to keep us here renzi said and i do recall we have the better part of a years lease left on number eighteen all paid for of course and a pity to waste it no its comfortable and its there renzi finished lamely im not leavin here not until ive cleared m name an been taken back tom dear friend you should not set your heart on this i sadly fear itll prove a deep and fearful mystery that may well be impossible to penetrate at our remove someone is out to ruin you and has friends consideralthough youve been dismissed your ship theyve not succeeded in having you cashiered out of the service youre unemployed but still a commander royal navy and can be given a ship at any timebut not here while admiral saumarez remains in command i stay kydd hissed if i leave ive got no chance o nobblin th bastard who did this its here theres th clues an here i stay till ive laid him by th tail i understand brother renzi said and since these islands are proving such a singular source of ethnical curiosities so shall i stay too ii thank ye for it nicholas ive taken rooms here as will serve he took a pull at his drink then said this i dont fathom nicholas why should saumarez deny his own orders hes a squaresailin sort treated me right well before thats easily answered there were no sealed orders i saw em wi my own eyes nicholas those were counterfeit added to the original orders kydd slumped back why as i said to bring about your fall from grace and ruin in the most complete fashion possible a masterly plot it has to be admitted renzi mused he went on firmly i saw the orders were unopened prosser signed for them in due form in the admirals office and they were still unopened when i took them in charge this implies that if there was anything untoward it was done in the admirals office then we clap on all sail an go this will not be possible your presence will be resisted more to the point it will be to no purpose ill sweat it out o th buggerssomeone knows it would appear dear fellow that anyone having influence in a commanderinchiefs office and acting with confidence and a degree of familiarity one admiral upon another does in fact suggest lockwood kydd recalled the mans threats when he had chosen rosalynd over his daughter i cannot dispute your conclusion he has sworn to destroy you for what he imagines youve done concerning his family and but for the respect you have already won from admiral saumarez you would now be facing a courtmartial and certain public ruination how the motive is established the method easily deduced it requires but one corrupt clerk to accept a suitably fat bribe to insert the poisonous forgery and one smuggler knowing the coast to deposit the chest and it is done he added its the perfect method for how do we proceed do we know who took the bribe confront the admirals staff one by one and demand they confess or minutely examine their motions on the day in question andits hopeless im obliged to say kydd slumped back if youd have found th orders when you were called nicholas id have waved em in saumarezs face an m case would be proved you will believe i searched furiously the escort looking on with a certain impatiencebut as you can observe if i confessed knowledge of them by their absence wed be in a strange fixation both then theyre still aboard i rather doubt it i personally supervised the removal of your effects with the intent of their discovery if you could but remember where you placed them iive tried damn it but we were in a moil at th time puttin t sea an all renzi sighed but then its all of no account at this space of time should you produce them now it would be considered a clumsy attempt at exculpation no brother this is as serious a matter as we have ever facedand i confess at this time i see no way forward kydd was frustrated and restless ive a notion t take a walk nicholas clear th intellects spirited discussion had not resolved the matter but there had to be a way through with his uniform packed and stowed kydd was in his barely worn civilian garb the darkgreen tailed coat and nondescript pantaloons feeling odd after his stout naval coat and breeches he was now a figure of scandal of wondera navy captain who had been publicly shamed caught out in a felony and dismissed his ship to make things even more juicy for the gossips he was the undoubted hero of the recent granville action in the street he would be pointed out gaped at scornedand not a word could he say in his defence feeling hot shame he descended the inn stairs holding to his heart that no matter what he knew he was innocent of any wrongdoing the street was in its usual clamorous busyness and kydds emergence was not noticed gathering his courage about him he turned left and marched resolutely up high street renzi caught up with him in the more spacious upper reaches i hadnt bargained on such a gallop he puffed do moderate your pace i beg but kydd wanted to be away from the town and didnt slow eventually they found the road north slackened their speed and renzi found breath for conversation a remarkable islandjust a few miles broad but t be pointed out asas who i am its moren a man should bear kydd said through his teeth he knew however that there was one easy answer simply to return to england and find anonymitybut that would deprive him of any chance to uncover the truth and reclaim his honour renzi glanced at him sharply dont take it amiss my friend if i remark that few know you by sight your not having entered upon society to any great degree i have my doubts there are above a dozen people outside the navy who know you so you shouldnt overmuch fear the gaze of the herd if that is your concern aye but theyll find outan you will say im damned in society renzi bit his lip here this will be so for now i agree but in england im not leavin nicholas they walked on in silence and after an hour returned nothing had been concluded other than a vague intent to go to the admirals office and do something unspecified yet every hour that passed for all they knew lockwoods agent might still be on the island preparing to return still available for unmasking it was the worst kind of frustration kydd found it hard to contain and as they passed government house he turned impulsively to go into the naval headquarters their entry was refused but he pushed past the scandalised sentry whereupon they were indignantly ejected there would be no interrogations the evening meal was cheerless and silent it had become obvious now that there would be no quick solution and happy restitution in fact nothing constructive whatsoever had suggested itself in the morning kydd excused himself and said he needed to go for a walk alone when he returned his face was serious renzi knew better than to ask indeed his own situation was approaching despair for complete idleness without the solace of his books was difficult the day wore on drearily with neither news nor inspiration eventually needing to get out renzi suggested they head to the tavern where they had shared a dinner before their world had turned demented it was a mistake they had a fine view of the castle islet below but also a firstclass vantagepoint to witness hms teazer win her anchor and stand out to sea her long masthead pennant whipping in the brisk breeze it was proof positive that a new commission had begun for her a new life under a new captain kydds face was like stone then renzi saw a glitter in his eyes and he had to turn away when he looked back kydd was as still as a statue following the little vessel with his eyes until she spread full sail and made off southwardto the open sea with infinite sadness he said id be beholden t ye nicholas should we go back now it grieves me to raise the subject brother but we must take stock of our position renzi and kydd sat in their usual spot in the snug to one side of the fire teasing out their halfpints of ale for as long as they could it was now five days gone and they were no further forward kydd said nothing gloomily lifting his grogblackened leather tankard in fine it is to remark that our means are not without their limitmy humble emolument as a ships clerk ceased the minute i quit the ship as you would know and for your own good self kydd shifted uncomfortably im on halfpay thats true but i have t say to ye its spoken for fr months aheadi outlaid a fat purse t those villains in st sampson t prettify teazers brightwork an gingerbread i doubt as standish is appreciatin it now he added morosely renzi turned grave am i to understand thereby that we are living on our capital aye i suppose its so thenthen its time for a decision my friend oh most certainly and it is simply to establish at what point we will be constrained to recognise our resources no longer allow us to continue our hunt and retire from hence wounded but whole im not running kydd blazed t return to m family wi such a stain id sooner roast in hell renzi gave a halfsmile then we must take prudent measures steps to preserve body and soul through come what may until someones going t talk kydd said positively spend their vile guineas like water make a noise in th taverns an then ill hear about it he said savagely an god help th slivey toad very well renzi said without conviction the first is to secure our living quarters this fine inn here is no longer within our competence we must find our kydd cut in nicholas this is not your fight in all conscience the odds against you are high enough i cannot find it in me to leave you to face alone what you must dear brother no this is now my decision which you will allow me to make on my own tak it or leave un the hardfaced woman turned to go but renzi stopped her well take it madam ten livres on account she said thrusting out a hand from under her shawl an ive plenty o frenchies asll sigh for such a one kydd frowned at renzi who whispered back the royalists having fled the revolution theyre pining in exile here where they can still see their homeland the wrong side of fountain street it was a mansion of grandeur that had seen better times now the familiar drawing room dining room and the rest were each partitioned off with their own noisy family kydd and renzis domicile was the topmost floor the old servants quarters such a quantity of space exclaimed renzi stoutly at the two rooms a clapboard partition dividing the open space of a garret their furniture was limited to a bed each turned up against the wall a single table and chair under the window and a seedy dresser there were bare floorboards and a dank musty smell throughout fresh air offered kydd eyeing the dirty window and a fireplace the small grate looked mean and still contained the disconsolate crumbled remains of the last fire but he rubbed his hands and said briskly well soon have it shipshape um not as whos t say but i dont spy a kitchen atall how renzi forced a bright smile in course we as bachelor gentlemen do send out for our victuals dear fellow theres sure to be a chophouse or ordinary close by as to the smaller comestibles therell be your milkmaid baker pieman calling eager for our trade kydd looked at the small fireplace a kettle fr tea an coffee tea will soon be beyond our means im sorry to say renzi said firmly scotch coffee will probably be available kydd winced childhood memories of scrimping in hard times had brought back the bitter taste of burned breadcrumbs they set to and a seamanlike scrubbing from end to end soon had the spaces glistening with damp the window protesting loudly at being opened and a resolve declared that they would invest in more aids to comfort when their affairs were on the mend meanwhile another chair was needed with various domestic articles as they suggested themselves when evening fell and they set about their meagre repast the extravagance of a bottle of thin bordeaux did little to lift the mood a burst of illtempered rowdiness came up from below was the future stretching ahead to be always like this the night passed badly for kydd in just a few months he had come from contemplating a highsociety wedding to regretting the coals for the comfort of a fire from captain of a manowar to tenant of a dirty garret it was hard to take and lurking at the back of his mind there was always the temptation to slink back cravenly to england but that would be to accept the ruin lockwood had contrived and hed be damned if he would the dull morning began with rain pattering on the window and leaks appearing from nowhere over the last of their tea renzi gave a twisted smile i rather think that the occupation of gentleman is quite over for us brother we must seek out some form of incomeof employment suitable to our character or it will be the parish workhouse for us ill never get another ship from admiral saumarez kydd said glumly even supposing hes one in his gift er y havent seen my hairbrush you know the pearlbacked one mother gave me i thought it was on the dresser renzi said absently no matter kydd said itll turn up he reflected for a moment an it must be admitted anything of employment as takes me back t sea is not t be consideredid then be removed frm here an couldnt find m man renzi smiled briefly as one of neptunes creatures theres little enough for you on terra firma so completely out of your element i shall think ont kydd answered stiffly may i know then what it is youre proposin to do nicholas it does set a challenge renzi admitted my qualifications being of the most cursory i do suggest we devote this day to a reconnaissance of prospects each being free to follow our independent course and exchange our experiences later tonight kydd headed down to the busy quayside and found the little octagonal building that had been pointed out to him the genial harbourmaster greeted him and made room for him among the charts and thickbound books what is it i cn do for ye mr kydd kind in you t see me mr collas er id have y know that ive seen m share o sea service oh aye but at th moment i find mself without a ship an i thought it might be time t swallow th anchor an take employment ashore if y see what i mean there was a careful silence that is t say if theres a position open in th harbour authority t a man o the sea that yed recommend id be grateful t hear it y mean a harbour commissioner inspector sort o thing i do then i have t disappoint ye mr kydd we runs things differently here no kings men pokin into our affairs an that an no customs an excise neither in th islands trade is king so its leave em at it to get on wi their business now the most important thing we does is the piloting t be a guernsey pilot is t be at the top o th profession mr kydd an afore ye ask theres none but a guern will have th knowledge t do it see theres nothing like here anywheres in creation fr rocks n shoals and then we adds in the tidal currents and its a rare place indeed fr hazards y learn about a rockit looks like quite another when th tide states different y come upon it in th fog see it just the oncewhich rock are y going t tell yr ships master it is he went on currents about here cn be fastern a man can run but theyll change speed n direction with the tide as well its right scareful th way it can be well on th make in one part an at the same time only at slack in another why springs in the great russel y can hear th overfalls roaringdoes y know how t navigate the far side of an overfall in spate an then theres the seamounts nasty beasts they are currents over them are wicked and they change with th tide kydd said hastily i did hear as yeve bought a patent lifeboat we did a greathead thirtyfooter cost us a hundred and seventy pounds so we takes good care of it and does it need we keep it at st sampson clearly it was of small interest and tucked away safely out of harms way kydd was running out of ideas do ye conduct hydrographical surveys hereabouts im doubting th admiralty has the time no need were well served b the private charts all put out b local mariners as we know n trust dobrée an others rutters by deschamps then buoyage an lighthousessurely trinity house cant be expected but they do an all yeve probably seen our casquet light remarkable thing three towers an argand oil wi reflecting metal kydd stood up aye thank ye mr collas good day t ye renzi waited patiently in the foyer of the imposing redbrick building on st julians avenue the clerk appeared again regarding him doubtfully mr belmont is very busy but cn find you fifteen minutes mr er renzi a thin and bespectacled individual looked up as he entered yes the man was irritable in his manner but making an effort to be civil so renzi pressed on sir at the moment im to seek a position in guernsey that will engage my interests and talents to best advantage my experience in marine insurance will not be unknown to the professionthe barratry case of the lady of penarth back in the year ninetythree in which i might claim a leading role has been well remarked it would probably not help his case to mention that at the time he had been a common foremast hand in the old duke william with kydd since those days i have occupied myself as an officer in the kings service lately invalided out and it struck me that i should perhaps consider turning my experience to account and tell me sir what is your conceiving of a contract of indemnity why sir this is nothing but that which is defined in the deed it was a fair bet that anything and everything would be covered in any good watertight policy would you allow then rotted ropes in an assessment of common average or would it be the particular sir you can hardly expect me to adjudicate in a matter so fine while not in possession of the details at hand belmont sighed might i know then if you have written anything renzi brightened he had passed the initial test and now they were enquiring after his common literacy as to that sir since you so kindly asked he began warmly i am at the moment consumed in the task of evolving an ethnographical theory that i do hope will be published at i was rather referring to policies the man rasped sarcastically and as it happens im desolated to find that there is no opening in this establishment for a marine gentleman of your undoubted talents good day to you sir in the evening footsore and thoughtful it was time to review matters kydds attempts had led nowhere although he now had the solace that in guernsey society it seemed his crime was regarded more as bad luck than anything else the pursuit of profit by trade a worthy enough endeavour whatever the nature of the enterprise renzis manners and evident breeding had created suspicion and distrust and apart from a doubtful offer as a proofreader and another as assistant to a dancing master whose duties appeared to be nothing more than making himself agreeable to lady students there was nothing im to go to st sampson tomorrow kydd said there are several yards as build fine schooners an brigs there an theyll be sure t need a projector o quality one who knows th sea an has met fine men o standin in strange parts o th world he added unconvincingly renzi hid a smile kydd engaged in hard selling to thickskinned mercantile interests was unlikely to say the least one moment and ill jot our ideas down he said he found paper but then in irritation turned on kydd brother i have mentioned before that the silverlead pencil is a fine but expensive piece and is for my own studies and not for the er general use where did you leave it pray kydd glowered back an ive heard above ten times o this wonderful pencil but fr now im not guilty o the crime he hunted about briefly itll turn up renzi paused at the sound from below of a shouted argument reaching its climax in a crash possibly we should be considering a more aggressive approach to securing our existence what kydd grunted why er we have not yet consulted the newspaper they sauntered into the nearest coffeehouse renzi engaged a bewigged attendant in amiable conversation while kydd sat on a bench and looked around as though waiting carelessly picking up a recent la gazette when he was sure no one was watching he folded the newspaper slipped it into his waistcoat and left his face burning it was a substantial publication in keeping with the prosperous island economy and its study justified the opening of their last claret for the light was fast fading and with a single candle at the table all renzi would allow there were many pages of closely printed columns they set to trying to ignore the distant squalling of infants and the reek of burned fat and cheap tallow rising to the upper storeys it was depressing reading without appropriate introductions of the usual sort access to the more gentlemanly occupations was barred while without experience even the lower trades would not be open to them theres a situation here that may interest you renzi said oh indeed i see here a vacancy as a shopman for an antigropelos draper no less kydd gave a lopsided smile being well a seller of waterproof leggings of course renzi answered lamely they both tried to laugh and kydd reached for the foulweather flask there should be some of the precious spirit left from the last stormy deck watch wheres that bedamnd flask gone to grunted kydd in annoyance rummaging about suddenly he stopped and raised his eyes to meet renzis a poxy snaffler it has to bebut wheres a sneak thief going to get in while were out kydd had locked everything and he was sure that it was not possible to gain entry ahthere is one way nicholas at night we dont batten down all hatches while were asleep do we the scrovy swab if i lay my kydd smiled grimly bear a fist nicholas im going t rig a welcome as will see us shakin hands with th villain b morning it was easily enough done the odd length of wood pieces of string led along the floor a cunning door wedge then they pulled down their beds to retire renzi did not sleep well it was becoming clear that they were headed into unknown waters possibly useless penury certainly life on the fringes of society he would bear his lot without complaint but now a moral question was arising was he right in acquiescing to kydds forlorn search to clear his name if lockwood was at the back of it the implication was that he would not rest until kydds personal ruin was seen to be accomplished therefore even if by some miracle kydd achieved his exoneration lockwood would find some other way to secure his revenge renzi knew well the lengths to which vindictive men in high places could go if vengeance was their purpose but he had vowed to stand by his friend whatever the situation therefore in logic he must remain the bed with its wire frame creaked and twanged as he turned restlessly but sleep did not come his mind wandered to his studies his theory was proceeding well coalescing about responses to primal needs in differing cultures but he needed more data much more if only he could lay hold of baudins journal but the french explorer had died in mauritius and his data was now separated by the unbridgeable gulf of war where else could cecilia would she wait for him the thought shocked him into full wakefulness as he reflected on his failure in australia to forge a life there as a free settler he had wanted to create an arcadia of his small landholding for her now his grand plan to complete his first volume for publication to present to her before he felt morally able to seek her handwhere was this now that his entire endeavour was at an indefinite standstill what if she hssst nicholas kydd whispered but renzi had heard it too the doorhandle was squeaking softly he lay still there was just enough wan moonlight to make out gross shadows so the two of them should well be able to handle onebut if there were more the door scraped open and stayed for a space then the floorboards creaked but renzi could not see any bulking figure instead to his surprise he next heard movement from well within the room kydd yanked the string hard the door banged to and the wedge slammed into place with a triumphant finality the intruder whirled about and made for the door but it was jammed tightly shut strike a light nicholas an well see what weve snagged kydd said with satisfaction getting to his feet the candle flickered into flame revealing a slight figure trapped against the door well now an whats y name then y young shicer there was no answer two dark eyes watched warily as they approached the figure was in leggings a short jacket and a bandanna answer me y scamp or i has ye taken in b th watch the muttered reply was inaudible speak up scapegallows ppookie a female childthief caught offguard in his nightgown renzi took refuge in frowning severely pookie what pray defiantly the boyish figure stayed mute we cn easily find out b takin you t each o the families in th buildin t see who owns ye pookie er turner kydd looked at renzi in exasperation the harsh penal system demanded transportation to botany bay for the theft of a handkerchief and the gallows for a few shillings children as young as nine had gone to the scaffold what had possessed this ragamuffin to take such risks get rigged nicholas im gettin satisfaction frm th father but there was none only a listless irritated mother who screamed threats at the child only twelve year she has an all sir an s help me the bastard aint even mine she whined it seemed they would not be seeing their possessions again listen t me an mark well what i say kydd growled in a fierce quarterdeck manner ifn i catch this scut skulking about our rooms again its th beak on th instant compree the coins clinked one by one as renzi let them drop to the table his face in shadows from the single evilsmelling rush dip so bad kydd asked uneasily he was trying to toast the last of a stale loaf on a browncoal fire at first renzi did not reply then he turned despite domestic economies of such austerity as would quite put mistress hannah glasse to the blush it would seem that the end must come soon and with no appeal th end kydd said apprehensively suffice it to say that on friday we shall be unable to render her due to our termagant landlady it should be quite within prospect that our immediate quitting will be demanded then yes renzi said nothing further and regarded kydd gravely youre sayin were t be gone frm the islands return t england it would seem the time has come brother kydd looked away im stayin nicholas where im goin t the sailloft th old fisherman as offered it me has no use fr it thats where ill be dear fellow thatsthats no living for a gentleman why you might well be taken up for a vagrant it will not do at all kydd gave a tigerish smile im seein it through that chousin toad only has t say one word out o place an ill have him it was a piteous image a fine seaman and honourable reduced to rags and the shuffling hopelessness of the poor with the canker of vengeance sapping his life spirit of course renzi said calmly then i do suggest we begin taking the rest of our worldly goods thence for myself there is no question that i burden myself on you further instead ill er find somewhere to lay my head yes i have a mind to visit jersey jersey a channel island not twenty miles to the southeast which i might point out to you is larger in area than this present isle and its opportunities as yet untried any news i have will be made available to you at st peter port post office thenthen this is yr farewell nicholas kydd said in a low voice an id wish it were at a happier time for now dear friend when the one meets with fortune i dare to say the other will share in it do take care of my manuscripts i beg and at any time you will have need of your friend make it known at the st heliers post office chapter it would be easier said than done carrying a bundle for his immediate needs renzi stepped ashore in st helier the chief town and port of jersey with the pressing goal of finding employment however humble that might serve to keep both himself and his friend from starving while kydds allconsuming quest spent itself before they returned to england preoccupied he had not particularly noticed the castle set out into the approaches to st helier which was of considerable antiquity other defensive works of a more recent vintage briefly caught his eye the massive crenellations of a fortification along the skyline above the town gun towers and signal posts jersey had a definite edge of siegelike tension about it st helier itself was less steep than st peter port but appeared busier the mariner in renzi noted the immense scatter of granite reefs that crowded in on the port and would make it a lethal trap if the wind shifted to the south unlike st peter port which had handy escape routes north and south he shrugged there would be precious little sea time for the near futurehe had to secure tolerable employ renzi found a coffeehouse and went in seated in a quiet corner he secured a dogeared copy of the gazette de jersey and scanned itmuch about the tenor of existence economic health and the general happiness of folk could be gauged from the profundity or otherwise of the concerns expressed in a newspaper here it seemed there was feverish anticipation of an imminent assault by bonaparte but otherwise the usual run of vanities theatre gossip confected moral outrage but there was also a sense of boundary between the incomers and the established residents not so different from any society in similar constricted circumstances he reflected but without the requisite introductions nearly impossible to penetrate sociallyor for the purpose of gentlemanly employment renzi sighed and put down the newspaper he had come across just one avenue there was a naval presence here considerably smaller than in guernsey but apparently rating a junior commodore it might be possible by deploying his experience as a ships clerk to make himself useful somewhere in the establishment he called for writing materials and crafted a polite note offering his services to the commodores office in whatever situation might prove convenient sealed it and carefully superscribed it in correct naval phrasing he had provided no return address begging that any reply might be left poste restante at the st helier post office then sat back to finish his coffee in the early morning he emerged stiff and shivering from beneath an upturned fishingboat where he had spent another night on the beach trudging into the deserted town his nose led him to a bakery and for the price of some amiable chatting renzi went away with half a loaf of stale bread around the corner he fished out a hunk of cheese pared some off with his penknife then wolfed his breakfast the town was coming to life and he wandered through the streets like st peter port this was not a poor communityin fact it too showed signs of wealth by midmorning he was ready to continue to seek employment on impulse he turned back for the post office kydd had promised to keep in touch and he was much concerned for him there was nothing from his friendbut there was a neatly sealed letter in an unknown hand bearing a crest he did not know it was from commodore dauvergne in friendly tones it invited him to make himself known at his shore address adjacent to the customs house where they would explore possibilities concerning a position it seemed a trifle peculiara flagofficer however junior deigning to involve himself in clerkly hiring but renzi could see no advantage to be gained by any kind of prank at first he thought he had come to the wrong place the small office compared to his usual experience of naval headquarters could only be termed discreet he had taken some care in his appearance and stepped in purposefully he identified himself to a clerk who looked at him keenly but said nothing and ushered him up a cramped flight of stairs to a small room it was odd he thought that there were no uniformed sentries mr renzi sir the man announced ah do come in sir commodore dauvergne said genially in barely accented english he had a round kindly face but with the high forehead and alert eyes of someone intelligent and selfpossessed thank you sir renzi said attending carefully while dauvergne leaned back in his chair there was a moments pause as the commodore summed him up then he said briskly you wonder why at my eminence i noticed you sir that is simple in the letter your hand betrays you as a gentleman and your making application for a menial post intrigues me renzis uneasy smile brought a further penetrating glance of course this would be a capital way for a spy to inveigle himself into my headquarters are you a spy mr renzi i am not sir then my last post was that of a ships clerk sir lately teazer brigsloop for reasons that need not trouble you this position has now been closed to me clerk how interesting it would disappoint me to hear that your removal was for peccant reasons no felonious act has ever attached to my name sir renzi snapped do pardon my direct speaking sir you see your presenting at this time comes as a particular convenience to me at renzis wary silence he went on let me be more explicit as commodore of the jersey squadron i have my flagship round the coast at gorey this little office provides an official piedàterre in st helier and my private house is nearby as it happens sir i have an especial regard for those who have in their person suffered in the terrible convulsions of the revolutionthe royalistes he looked at renzi intently here there are many émigré french to be seen wandering the streets poor souls some even standing for long hours on the cliffs mooning over their lost land which is in plain view to the east i do take a personal interest in their plight shuffling some papers on his desk he said it is for this reason i maintain an old contemptible castle near gorey which i devote to their cause now there is nothing in the naval sphere available he said regretfully but i have recently lost a valued confidential secretary and the creatures offering themselves in his place areare lacking in the article of gentlemanly discernment shall we say therefore should you feel inclined there is a post i can offer which shall be my secretary for émigré affairs you have the french i trust he added i do sir they are a distracted and some might say fractious community dogmatic priests aristocrats insisting on the forms of the ancien régime a thankless task for this shall we say fifty livres a month a princely sum it was more than he had dared hope and with only a single glance at renzis scuffed shoes dauvergne added smoothly of course this will be at the castlemont orgueil i should inform youwhich is at a remove from st helier and therefore i feel an obligation upon me to offer you a room there for a trifle in the way of duties out of the normal hours that is most kind in you sir then may i know when would be an acceptable date for your commencement mr renzi this is a very remarkable achievement sir said renzi standing next to dauvergne within the grim bastions of mont orgueil softened with tasteful medieval hangings and wellturned gothic furniture the castle foursquare and forbidding on a prominence looking across the water at france had its roots in the age of the longbow and armoured knights but with the arrival of cannon it had been abandoned in elizabethan times to genteel decay dauvergne had brought back some of the colour and grandeur particularly in the part of the edifice he occupied the corbelled tower now an impressive receiving place past the four outer gates and a higgledypiggledy final spiral staircase the rest of the castle was an eccentric accretion of bluff towers and quaint gateways that led to open battlements at the top there stretching over twothirds of the eastern horizon was the coast of francethe ancient enemy of england dauvergne gave renzi a pensive look i like to think i am its castellan of modern times and im rather fond of it time has mouldered into beauty many a grim tower its been said and where rich banners once displayed now only waves a flower sad for theres myriad tales untold here im persuaded he collected himself you shall bed in the principal yeoman warders room dont concern yourself on his behalf praythe last he had need of it was in renzi found it hard to avoid being affected by the atmosphere the musty stonework of the upper floors had some life and light but other places lurking below in the dark and unfathomable depths of the fortress made him shiver dauvergne continued there is a small staff i have had the kitchens removed to this level else it plays the devil with keeping the food hot the gate porter youll find in st george towerbe sure to address him as the maréchalhis lodgings are found by the kings receiver and he may claim one gallon of imported wine and a cabot of salt for his pains at length they returned to dauvergnes apartment where he sat behind a gothic desk set before diamondmullioned windows and steepled his fingers so you have the measure of my little kingdom mr renzi what do you think it was impossible to do justice to the sense of awe and unease that this lonely seafrontier redoubt had brought to him so renzi murmured quite of another age sir just so er at this point perhaps i should introduce myself a little more formally you see at the recent demise of léopold duke of bouillon i have succeeded to that principality and am thus entitled to be addressed as his serene highness the prince of bouillon renzi sat back in astonishment remembering just in time a civil bow of his head you will no doubt be more comfortable with the usual naval titles at which i will be satisfied however i do insist on the style of prince in my correspondence sir you might remark on it that since my lands are at the moment in occupation by bonapartes soldiers and as the great hall of the castle of navarre is unavailable to me i must rest content with mont orgueil this i cannot deny sir and it does explain my ready sympathy with the royalist émigré dont you think itit must do sir then let us pass on to other matters such as yourself mr renzi er renzi said uncertainly quite i do now require my curiosity to be satisfied as to why such an evidently welleducated patrician comes to me in the character of the ships clerk of a brigsloopif indeed this be soseeking a form of employment with me you may speak freely sir he regarded renzi dispassionately and i sir renzi said firmly now am in a state of some wonder as to why you have seen fit to offer me a position without the least comprehension of my circumstances dauvergne smiled thinly i believe myself a tolerable judge of men and in your case i do not feel i am mistaken your story sir if you please to renzis own ears it seemed so implausible going to sea as a foremast hand in a form of selfimposed exile as expiation for what he considered a sin committed by his family later to find its stern realities strongly appealing after the softness of the land finding a friend such as kydd and their adventuring together which had ended with renzis own nearmortal feverbut then the revelation of a lifes calling in the pursuit of a theory of natural philosophy that in its rooting in the real world could only be realised by taking ship for distant parts in kydds command to be his clerk as a device to be aboard and unfortunately he has been er superseded and at the moment is without a ship renzi added there was no need to dwell on the circumstances dauvergne did not reply for a moment and renzi began to think he was disbelieved then with a warm smile the man said a remarkable history sir i was not wrong in my estimationand i would like to hear more of you sir one evening perhaps the chophouse was busy noisy and welcoming after kydds morning exertions walking the streets in search of clues regarding his situation he drew his grego clear of the sawdust floor and eased himself into one of the communal tables nodding to slight acquaintances bean jar is it then a waiter asked swiftly disposing of the remains of a meal in the empty place next to him his customary order of the local dish of lentils and pork along with bread and beer would be his only hot meal of the day aye mutton chop is primecn find yer one fr sixpence not today thank ee kydd said he had felt his dwindling stock of coins before he entered and mutton was not within reach he blessed the fact that while he was known to the commanderinchief and other potentates of guernsey the common people would not recognise the shabby figure keeping to himself in the street as a naval commander so he could pass about freely in the town but he had found not the slightest lead to help in his investigations and time had passed he had to face it renzi had been right the trail had gone cold his chances of discovering let alone proving the deed now vanishingly remote it was time to call a stop he would give it just a few more days to the point at which his means of sustenance came to an end thenthen he would go home having made this resolution he felt more at ease with himself and in a fit of bravado tipped the waiter a whole penny then marched out into the street the autumn sun was hard and bright and on a whim he headed to the harbour where ships were working cargo seamen out on the rantan and the rich aroma of seasalt and tarry ropes pervaded all on the broad quay he stopped to watch a handsome barque discharging wine her yardarm and stay tackles worked in harmony to sway up the cargo from her bowels to a growing pyramid on the wharf no customs reckoning here the great barrels would be rolled directly into the mouths of the warehouses probably for transshipping later by another hull to a british port given that she flew the american flag a neutral a young man stopped his empty manhauled cart and waved to him kydd stepped across and instantly recognised the face mr calloway he said in astonishment what are ye doing calloway doffed his battered cap respectfully an unexpectedly touching gesture in the surroundings and said shyly mr standish had his own young gennelmen he wanted t place on th quarterdeck an offered t me as whether id be turned afore the mast or be put ashore sir it was a mean act but in the usual course of events when a captain left his command the midshipmen and followers would go with him allowing the new captain to install his own and calloway had chosen the honourable but costly move of retaining his nominal rank instead of reverting to seaman and staying aboard midshipmen were not entitled to halfpay and thus he had rendered himself essentially destitute an so ye should have done mr calloway kydd said warmly the thought of others who had served him so well now under an alien command wrenched at him er can i ask how ye fare now why sir on mondays an wednesdays im t be ballast heaver tuesdays an thursdays im cart trundler to mr duval the boatbuilder kydd hesitated then said stoutly y has m word on it luke in m next ship ill expect ye there on th quarterdeck with me wont be s long an m namell be cleared youll see aye aye mr kydd calloway said quietly an where cn i find ye ask at th bethel sir theyll find me when y has need o me a floating church in harbour the bethel was a refuge for seamen seeking relief from the sometimes riotous behaviour of sailors raising a wind in port idid like t invite ye t sup wi me a while but i thank ye mr kydd but i must be about m duties calloway said with the barest glance at kydds ragged appearance good fortune t ye sir renzi had not found the work onerous and in fact it was not without interest dauvergne seemed to have a wide circle of royalist acquaintances and was in receipt of considerable sums from charitable institutions in england to distribute to the needy some of the royalists apparently had pressing personal problems that dauvergne was taking care of privately several came while renzi was working with him at their suspicious looks he would leave the room quietly such behaviour from proud exnoblemen was understandable renzi finished what he was working on and handed it to dauvergne who glanced through it and said with a smile i do fear mr renzi that we are not making full use of your talents he slapped down the papers with satisfaction tonight you shall come to dinner be it only a family affair and then i will learn more of your philosophies renzi was much impressed by the mansion just a mile out of st helier set in a vast ornamental garden with interiors of a splendid if individual magnificence dauvergne had humorously named the house bagatelle and proudly showed him the sights inside scientific specimens works of art of considerable value with relics of injured royalty which included objets de toilette from the apartment of marie antoinette smuggled out at the height of the revolutions horrors at length dauvergne made his apologies i must leave you now for a space mr renzi to settle a business at my town office but i shall be back directly do avail yourself of my libraryi take much pleasure from learned works in which the flower of mans intellect might so readily be imbibed the library was monumental with some sixty volumes on naval architecture and navigation alone another hundred or two of voyages and travels a wellthumbed johnson and a recent encyclopaedia britannica seventy more on chemistry mineralogy and a whole shelf of arcane botany more on applied mathematics and a complete shakespeare renzi noted that nowhere was there any tome that could remotely be said to address religion although there was voltaire and commentaries on robespierre and the worship of reason and neither were there the usual weighty classics virgil caesar plato were conspicuous by their absence a gloomy inner library contained a mass of volumes and pamphlets on the history of france obscure references to medieval campaigns and racks of genealogical studies it was staggering renzi estimated that no less than four thousand books were before him in serried array this was erudition indeed and he looked forward keenly to making their owners better acquaintance dauvergne soon returned and after passing pleasantries over sherry they moved into the dining room my dear this is mr nicholas renzi a philosophical gentleman who is doing us the honour of dining with us tonight renzi this is madame de la tour daughter of the count of vaudreuil who will perform the honours of the house two children stood meekly by her side and were also introduced a shy but warm acknowledgement was bestowed and they sat comfortably at the table en famille do explain to madame the elements of your study dauvergne suggested renzi had caught on to the discreet coding the lady was not his wife were the children hers dear madame this is naught but a comparative essay into the imperatives of human existence he began as being differing responses to the same madame paid careful attention but remained silent dauvergne asked intelligently about the same aspects of rousseaus position on the noble savage that had so exercised renzi in the great south seas some years ago casting a shrewd glance at renzi he murmured from your regard for the encyclopaedists one might be tempted to conclude that your admiration extends to present philosophies if by that you are referring to the revolution then i can assure you that nothing is more abhorrent to me than the spectacle of the glory of french civilisation falling prey to those political animals now in control of the state quite so quite so we are of a mind on the subject napoleon bonaparte is now consulforlife and is energetic and ruthless in his own interestas witness his domination of the state apparatus the secret police even his economic machine which i have certain knowledge has lately replaced the national currency with his own franc he continued sombrely he has now not a single country in arms against him save our own and therefore has no distraction from his lust to conquer i cannot recall that our realm has ever lain under a greater menace renzi shifted in his seat this reminder of peril was only pointing up his own essential uselessness in the present dangers to change the subject he asked politely do satisfy my curiosity on one point if you will sir just why is it that in these singular times their lordships at the admiralty see fit to rusticate sir james saumarez to these remote islandsa proven fighter if ever one were needed rather than require him to lead a fleet in the great battle that must surely come why sir have you not surmised dauvergne said with raised eyebrows it is over he has won his victory his purpose is complete granville said renzi puzzled not at all dauvergne chuckled i talk of a species of silent victory but for all that one that will resound down all of time sir let me be more explicit in the french plotted an invasion of the norman isles specifically jersey only the greatest exertions from us and the convulsions on the mainland at the time saved us although the treaty of amiens ended hostilities in it became clear quite early that we would be under assault once more this time by the most formidable general of the age what better move can you conceive of than to dispatch a feared and respected leader of the last war to take station here as commanderinchief by his very presence he has discouraged intemperate assault on the channel islands and with a simple flourish at granville he has shown the impracticality of a local invasion and he did succeed my intelligence now is that all troop concentrations have dissipated for the moment we are safe he put down his glass and went on so on the strategical side this is what has been accomplished from calais far to the east to the extremity of france in the west they have no harbour of size in which to concentrate a battle fleet to seize the channelexcept guernsey which in course is now denied them by sir jamess silent victory for the french this is galling in the extreme you see we in turn do use these islands to our own advantage which is as a base to fall on their sea lanes with menowar and privateers to paralyse their commerce and attempts to reinforce and most critically to keep close in watch on bonapartes invasion preparationswhich we are so well placed to do he added with satisfaction the mood changed he lifted his glass and exclaimed genially but then we are neglecting the plaice with our talk pray eat and enjoyand i have a notion how we might deploy your talents to better effect mr renzi he added mysteriously renzi lay awake in his creaking fourposter a southwesterly was blustering outside against the ancient stone and penetrating draughts had him drawing up the counterpane hed been prepared to endure nights under a hedge and feast on scraps but he was now safely immured in a castle in comfort under a goosedown quilt and reflecting on the conversations he had enjoyed with the reigning flagofficer no less there was no real reason for dauvergne to have so readily seized on him as a personal secretaryunless for intellectual companionship could this be so and what were those extra duties that dauvergne had alluded to was he in truth a prince his thoughts raced on kydd meanwhile was living in a sailloft vainly trudging the streets in his forlorn quest did renzi have the right to spend his days in such grand surroundings while his friend suffered on the other hand with a library of such richness within reach his study might yet take wingsthe voyages and travels alone must be a goldmine of ethnical facts against which ah renzi did you sleep well at all dauvergne was at his desk early reading various articles of mail renzi took his accustomed place i did sir one letter seemed to be causing dauvergne some concern he lifted his head and spoke unseeingly oh thats good he stood up suddenly and paced about the room then stopped abruptly i think its about time we put you to real work mr renzi my daily routine does not vary much youll see in the morning i shall be here attending to matters and the afternoon i spend aboard my flagship severn devoted to the business of my flag there she is he pointed out of the window renzi glanced at the twodecker of a distinct age peacefully at anchor in the centre of the wide sweep of gorey bay below the castle several smaller vessels moored alongside shes a only dauvergne said apologetically but as you can see gorey bay is sandy and open and the only invasion beach worth the name on the island severn does her duty nobly as nothing more than a floating battery to cover the approach renzi could well see the convenience of having a commodores retinue so close at hand with the ability to put to sea within minutes at the same time it left dauvergne free to maintain his interests ashore now this is your first duty i desire you to make known to yourself the whole situation obtaining on the mainland with its problems and concerns only when you are privy to the complete picture will you be able to assist me as you should er yes sir that is in brittany and neighbouring regionsparis and that gang of regicides you may leave to their evil machinations and for this i would suggest the french local newspapers all of which are conveyed to me here a prime source of insight into a country your newspaper sir renzi said politely then might i beg the use of your library for the acquisition of background material and similar i would hope you do sir renzi nearly hugged himself with glee to spend his days poring over those literary treasuresit was too good to be true oh and im often accused of being mortally absentminded therefore ill take the precaution of advancing you your first months emolument before i forget renzi was touched i am obliged to you sir he pocketed the envelope gratefully the piles of provincial newspapers were delivered to one of the empty rooms nearby so he excused himself and set to they were read in market towns by peasant farmers and agricultural factors yet clues stemming from the fluctuating prices of common produce and unintended allusions in shrill editorials revealed that all was not well and ugly dissatisfaction was not far below the surface in napoleons france when dauvergne left for his flagship renzi scribbled a quick letter to kydd for collection at the guernsey post office enclosing three coins and explaining his good fortune at meeting the prince de bouillon without going into detail turning back to his task he heard movement in dauvergnes office startled he went through but found only the flaglieutenant waiting for a message he seemed surprised to see renzi er jenkins you must be the new man renzi secretary pro tempore i believe he replied cautiously recently arrived an interesting placebut tell me is the man in truth a prince jenkins grinned theres much youll find odd about our philippe dauvergne but i have to tell you that besides the duke of clarence i believe hes the only fullrigged prince in the service he was adopted into the line but a prince for all that a man of some learning i think he is did you know hes an frs renzi was amazed not only a member of the royal society the premier learned society in the land but a fellow no less a deep thinker hes a doctor of letters from livonia and corresponds with the world on everything from mathematics to botany but amiable enough oh and an arctic explorer and colonial planter to boot has heis he distinguished in his service career the young lieutenant chuckled im surprised you havent heard in fine yes a frontline fighter in the american war first lieutenant o the saucy arethusa and more than a few prizes to his name even before napoleon youll findoh thank you he said taking some papers from a messenger and stowing them in his satchel have to go nowbut i think youll find your work very interesting he hurried off leaving renzi in even more perplexity than before after two days he felt he had explored enough of the people and the situation and went to dauvergne so you feel able to talk about the royalists and their problems then pray tell me your observations on the chouan risings and what they would mean to the paysan and merchant it was apparent that he was being tested but it was not hard to apply his mind to the social effects of a bloodily repressed rural revolt dauvergne nodded slowly very good you have a natural insight into the human condition and that i like one moment he rose and crossed to the thick oak door closed it firmly then returned and produced a letter now your opinion of this if you please apprehensive for some reason renzi picked it up the eyes never left him as he began to read why this is a letter from it doesnt say he looked up sir this is a private letter we have no right shall we leave that aside for now do continue fromfrom someone signing himself little cabbage renzi read out unwillingly its to anotherbelle poule he looked up unhappily this appears to be from a lover to his amante sir is this necessary read dauvergne commanded very well sir we have this person writingah it is to his wife he mentions the little ones he is at last to return the time has been hard while they have been separated he glanced up in silent protest but at dauvergnes stony stare he continued he will treasure the moment he sets foot in the old cottage once more life in a town is not to be compared to a village of brittany the soldiers of the garrison are arrogant and he has a loathing for what he has to do but he consoles himself that it is for them both and with his earnings they will close the door on a harsh world renzi finished the pathetic scrap another of bonapartes victims i think doing a menials work in some army town that will pay better than rural beggary i do so feel for him and his kind dauvergne waited but renzi would not be drawn this kind of human adversity was being played out all over the world as war ravaged previously tranquil communities why was he being shown this particular evidence i honour your sentiments renzi however a premonition stole over him and he tensed as dauvergne leaned back in his chair and spoke in the same controlled tone it would interest me to know your reaction if you are aware that the town he speaks of is st helier the garrison soldiers from fort regent and the man stofflet acting in the character of a baker is passing details of our troop levels to decrès renzi listened with a chill of dismay as dauvergne continued rather astute really he could tell to a man the garrison numbers daily by the size of the bread order and he plans to return shortly with the capability and firing angles of our defences no doubt carefully paced out and written down a spy renzi said uncomfortably you have an objection to spies then dauvergne asked innocently ithe must be taken up immediately of course but the practice of spying im not sure i take your meaning sir well it would seem to me axiomatic that if a covert act by a single individual could result in the discomfiture of many of the enemy then it is not merely morally acceptable but his bounden duty towards those who would otherwise be put to hazard i do not deny the necessity but the practices of spying are repugnant to me renzi said carefully i really do not see where the immorality lies mr renzi if as commanderinchief at the scene of a battle i receive intelligence that the enemy will come by a different direction do i alter my dispositions accordingly or refuse to do so on the grounds that the information was gained by a single person working alone renzi held his silence wondering if dauvergne was trying to provoke him no of course i cannot morally or otherwise my duty as a commander is to build a picture of the forces opposite me in the best way i canand if an opportunity arises whereby one of my men might move forward keep out of sight and note the truth of what these are then i shall be grateful to him as though it were final proof in a mathematical theorem dauvergne concluded therefore no one can be surprised that this is carried forward by all nations as a perfectly valid and utile means of acquiring intelligence pulling himself up renzi said cuttingly sir before now i have had to perform bloody acts that were logically dictated by the situation at the time and i believe i have never shied from the duty what i find immoral is the deployment of such as an instrument of policy in a way you disappoint me renzi you have not considered your position in logic which i find is the only method to be trusted for laying the thickets of sentiment and false moral positions take the spy himself for instance feeling a heat of resentment at having his cherished logic brought into such a discussion renzi reluctantly followed the reasoning the spy is a brave and resourceful man who goes alone and unarmed into the enemy camp it has often puzzled me he said as an aside just why we admire and value those who on our behalf do so while those of our opponents with the same qualities are on discovery vilified and must invariably suffer death an odd notion dont you think he thought for a moment then continued his main thread is there i ask you any difference au fond between ordering a man to stand before the cannons rage and another who is required to place himself in greater peril within the enemys territory it is not in my power to order a man to do anything sir renzi said with feeling let alone so who in your universe will harvest the intelligence save you from the guile of the enemy his conspiracies and malice dauvergne snapped you have the freedom bought by others to walk away from matters of nicety to your conscience and leave their resolution to others this is neither logical nor responsible then do i understand it correctly sir that you require me to assume the character of a spy in some affair renzi asked coldly dauvergne slumped back no no that was never in my desiring he said wearily mr renzi you have gifts of insight and understanding with formidable intelligence and a rare admiration for the primacy of logic all this fits you in a remarkable manner for the role of assisting myselfsimply lightening the burden if you willin the conduct of operations of a clandestine nature against napoleon renzi felt the chill of foreboding if you are in any doubt as to their importance let me disclose to you that i communicate not with sir james but directly to the foreign secretary of great britain as indeed i have done since the terror of paris in ninetytwo the work is allowed to be of such sovereign value that i am entrusted with the maintenance of a network in france whose extent is large he sighed raggedly at the moment i have none in whom i can place my trust and i bear the burden alone it was my hope that in some degree you would feel able to offer me your helpand your country sir help renzi muttered to maintain the confidential papers take up some of the load of secret correspondence speak with those arriving from france with newsand on occasion to favour me with your views in matters compelling a difficult decision everything in renzi rebelled against involvement in illicit affairs of deceit and trickery in the lies and betrayal that must be at its heart his whole life was predicated on the sure foundation of the honour and moral obligation of a gentleman and he had no desire to immerse himself in such a moral quagmire sir i fear that it would do violence to my nature he began notwithstanding your logic and its too late for that renzi whether you like it or no you are even now privy to information of a most secret nature but more pressing than that you have been made aware that there is a service you may do for your country to which you are most peculiarly well fitted sir it may well be now it is within your power to turn your back and walk from this roombut for the rest of your days you must live with the knowledge that you have failed when called upon now sir will you do your duty it had been hard to accept that he had been unable to muster any rational argument against the request but he found comfort in observing that the post was only that of confidential secretary taken a trifle further but he had been wounded by dauvergnes polite assurance that there would be no question of personal risk when he had acceded before going further he was curious about one thing on the question of trust sir how is it that you are assured my character is as you allege oh on that score i had your room and small baggage searched and who but a hopeless scholard would burden himself with goethe and locke for light reading he smiled renzi returned a thin smile while dauvergne opened a businesslike chest and found a pair of heavy intricate keys the records are in the crypt below i have one key you the only other be of good care renzi peoples lives are in your hands with those papers at renzis set face he continued lightly take it from me dear fellow its a quite different and wider moral framework we find ourselves in but you will discover that being a friend to logic will extract you safely from many a sentimental mire for example see if you can overcome your present scruples sufficiently to detect the transcendent moral certitudes in this little exercise i as a commander have several thousand lives in my charge and must meet the foe on the battlefield if i can convince the enemy commander that my attack will come by course a when in fact i will come by b there will be at the close of that day perhaps some hundreds fewer widows left to grieve how might this best be brought about renzi shook his head even more uncomfortable in this world of shades and compromise well here is one sure way do you charge a brave man with dispatches emphasising their grave nature and enjoining their safe delivery by all means he is not to know their false nature and when he is betrayed and valiantly defends them even to the death the enemy will be convinced of their authenticity and act accordingly with a tight smile he concluded so of course many lives are saved for the one expended you really cannot argue against that renzi and to his anguish he found he could not these were moral quicksands of a kind he had never been forced to confront before and their serious considering would occupy him painfully for some time to come i would find it difficult sir er may i know what action you intend in respect of the letter it was something he could test dauvergne with stofflet you mean all actions must be considered of course but pray tell what do you yourself propose renzi he must be stopped of course taken up as a spy he remembered the kind baldheaded baker from whom he had begged bread now he knew that the man was married happily with children he expected to see soon for a public demonstration in these fevered times that there are spies in our midst i think not an assassination renzi said neutrally goodness me no crass barbarism and not to be countenanced by a civilised nation then taken up quietly and a strict parole demanded before banishment renzi suggested boldly remembering dauvergnes words about brave men suffering death undeservedly perhaps not i rather think he must meet with an unfortunate accident chapter kydd trudged up the steep steps without noticing his path had taken him to another level of the town it was more densely settled and had an indefinable rakish air which focused round a theatre idly he went up and read the billboard the much adored griselda mayhew as the princess zenobia and the magnificent richard samson as count dragonheart in carpathia or cupids trust rewarded he turned to go but his eyes were caught by another notice underneath stagehands required none but those able to go aloft and haul ropes heartily shall apply if this was not work for a sailor then what was a week or so of jolly theatricals and then he could claim as much asas a whole mutton pie with the full trimmings of course and swimming in lumpy gravy his stomach growled as he entered the theatre a short sharpeyed man appeared from nowhere where you off to m lad performance not until seven not until seven i say oh er th notice said as how stagehands are required you the man stepped back to take his measure done it before a flyman i mean goaded kydd looked up two somewhat faded ornamental gold cords descended each side of the audience entrance from a single ringbolt in the lofty ceiling with a practised leap he clutched the leftmost one and swarmed effortlessly up to the bolt then launched himself into space for the other and slid down hand over hand much as in the distant past he had found a backstay to reach the deck all the quicker i see the man said affecting boredom an weve had sailors before an all wages re two livres cash on th nail each performance no liquor during find yr own prog er can y start now kydd feigned reluctance a livre as earnest he sniffed holding out his hand he had forgotten how much it represented but guessed it must be worth a shilling or two be off wi your impertinence yr impertinence i say kydd turned on his heel but the man caught his arm one livre an ill know y name sir tom cutlass m shipmates call me he answered slowly an yours the man puffed up his chest mr carne t you im th stagemaster stagemaster i say kydd took the money when do i be here at five sharp y late an thats all ye get renzi found dauvergne at the battlements staring moodily out to sea his greatcoat streaming and whipping in the autumn bluster renzi followed his gaze and saw a sail against the faroff brittany shore then spotted the gaggle of vessels in chase the french coast was a distant smother of white from the pounding of the westerly with white flecks of waves vivid in the stretch of water to the dullgrey coastline it was a hard beat into the fresh gale and the drama played out slowly before them the hunted craft clawing desperately against the wind first on one tack then another the others straggling astern as it eventually stretched out towards safety with stinging raindrops fast turning things into wet misery renzi left dauvergne to his vigil and returned to his task collating a number of appraisals penned by different hands into a fair summary he heard dauvergne come back and go straight to his inner sanctum then some time later a disturbance echoed in the long passage outside his little roomcries a panting fuss and the loud voice of the serjeant warder the commotion faded and he heard the drone of other voices then the chilling sound of a mans sobbing dauvergne came and slumped in a chair létalon is taken he said hoarsely his face dazed it meant nothing to renzi stallionthe codeword for an agent he murmured something never having seen dauvergne so shaken that toad fouché he went on betrayal murder intrigue theres nothing hell not stoop to for his diabolical master bonaparte the minister for police renzi responded paris and its deadly state apparatus was not within his remit and he had no wish to know anything of it but dauvergne obviously needed to talk secret policethe vile rogue when létalon was betrayed we had time to get him away but under bonapartes orders fouché arrested his family one by one thatthat noble being gave himself up to spare them and in course will be guillotined renzi avoided the stricken eyes unable to find words dauvergne pulled himself together with an effort fouché is not the problem hell serve whoever its in his interest to pander to its napoleon bonaparte this man is not only debasing a great civilisation but drenching the world in bloodto satisfy his own lust for conquest sitting up suddenly dauvergne cried in outrage do you know what the contemptible hypocrite plans now renzi could only shake his head thatthat monster first consul and titular head of the revolution who overthrew king louishes having himself declared emperor not just king and monarchbut emperor no renzi blurted that the man could so subvert the principles of the revolution and the people tamely acquiesce was a titanic shift in national allegiances clearly bonaparte was taking every last skein of power into his own handsthe majesty of the state of france for his own personal property dauvergnes face was haggard very soon it will be too late i fear too late forfor the last remedy sir im not sure i follow renzi said my dear renzi dauvergne murmured and sat down renzi waited silently im about to speak on matters of the very direst secrecy ignoring renzis protest he went on firmly i feel able to do so for some small time ago i received private intelligence regarding yourself that allows you are a fit and proper recipient renzi or is it to be laughton renzi stared at him taken aback to hear his real name he had been nicholas renzi ever since he had gone to sea those many years ago a prudent precaution in my position you will agree so you see sir i now know of your highminded selfexile your distinguished actions at st vincent and acre i learned of the quality of your late studies from count rumford himself therefore i feel able to treat you as my equal in matters touching the safety of the realm you may have heard of my not insignificant successes in instigating unrest and rebellion among the normans this has been due largely to my network of agents in france who smuggle out information and carry out acts of bravery as needs must that was in the revolutionary war since the start of this war bonaparte has moved with ruthless speed the secret police are everywhere one even needs a passport to travel to another city this has achieved its object nearly all organised opposition to the tyrant is now broken scattered there are agents and sympathisers but they are in daily fear of their lives the gates of fortress france are fast closing and with them any chance to prevent the cataclysm of total war it seemed so abstract discussing such a world in an ancient castle with the winds moaning about but renzi felt a sense of inevitability as to what would come next sir youre speaking of an attempt on bonapartes life no dauvergne gave a rueful smile not his life his majesty will not have it he is to be kidnapped kidnapped yes renzi seized and held it is a previous plan by others feeling as we do and ready to lay down their lives in the attempt does this have the support of london at the most secret level conceivable but with the kings proviso that bonaparte shall be brought out of france alive to answer for his crimes sir may i ask if we are to be involved we are central to it allow me to lay before you the essence of the plot it is to waylay his coach as he retires outside paris with his mistress as he is wont to do he is to be spirited instantly through yvelines and calvados to the coastand thence by sea to jersey here indeed when i receive word that the plot is to proceed i shall have an allowance from the foreign secretary to be employed in preparing here at mont orgueil an apartment for the reception of napoleon bonaparte renzi felt unreality closing in um sir is the plot well advanced certainly there are some hundreds of brave souls already in paris each with his part to play and practised since the summer you will no doubt recognise the name of general charles pichegru pichegru he had risen rapidly to the top of the revolutionary army invaded and subjugated holland then subsequently crossed the rhine with his victorious troops yes the only general in history to capture an entire fleet of shipsoftheline it was the stuff of legend the dutch battlesquadron had been icebound and pichegru had led a cavalry charge across the frozen sea to seize them all dauvergne continued he will raise the soldiery who love him to take all paris and declare for the king in the vacuum that exists at the disappearance of napoleon the duc denghien will be made head of state and regent until king louis might return to claim his throne butbut the organisation the timing i have told you the essence only there is much more if you knew georges cadoudal and that for five months he has been in paris preparing you would rest your concerns cadoudal a man larger than life itselfa hercules of sublime courage and audacity and one with an undying reputation in the chouan risings i myself have seen georges hold fast a kicking donkey by its back legthey sing ballads about him in brittany renzi found himself utterly at a loss for words there are others too numerous to mention chouans who have made the perilous journey from the vendée to paris to lie in hiding awaiting the call those who pass among the people risking everything to bring word of the coup to come there are even troops of dragoons training in secret in the forests outside the capital thenwhen shall it it is essential that the rising is supported at a scale where it may succeed to this end we must await a final commitment from london in my communications i have stressed the urgency and fading opportunity we shall hear shortly i believe the evening was turning chilly and kydd was thankful to get inside the theatre it was now abuzz with excitement and anxious stagehands hurried to mysterious places past the giant curtain for too long kydds buoyant good nature had been clouded but the atmosphere of a place dedicated to losing oneself in fantasy was getting to him damn it he vowed he would enjoy this interlude hey you you theretom whatevers y name carnes face came round the curtain and he looked irritable aye mr carne kydd called humbly and made his way hastily past the seats and on to the stage come the face disappeared so kydd pulled back the curtain tentatively and stepped into a dark chaos of props ladders improbable scenes painted on vast boardsand an impatient carne this is y mate as will teach ye carne snatched a look at a wellthumbed snapbound book and turned to a wiry man nearby and i want t block through scene three again fr miss mayhew in ten minutes he told him and left them to it tim jones his preceptor said thrusting out a hand to kydd look o the sea about ye cuffin he snorted then grinned aye said kydd bemused er quartermasters mate round th horn in the flying artemis artemis jones said respectfully as did fer the citoyenne in th last war glory be well i was only a jack dusty in tiger had t go alongshore wi the gormy ruddles as ruined m constitooshun he clapped kydd on the shoulder wes better be learnin ye the ropes here right enough they left the confusion of the rehearsal for the dark upper eyrie of the flyloft where kydd looked down through a maze of ropes and contraptions directly to the stage below jones squatted comfortably on the slats and began that theres mr carne an hes the stagemaster who calls th show from that book he has hes in charge o the runnin crew which includes us flymen an that scrovy crowd workin below now heres the griff when the scene shifts th whole thing frm clew t earring goes arsyversy in a very smart way an its us as does it how ill show ye kydd took in the complexity of ropes and machinery that could change their world of enchantment from a sylvan glade to a magnificent palace and back again he learned of flats and gauzes clothes and rigging and of the special whistles that had as much meaning for the stage crew in the complex operations of a scene change as a boatswains call for seamen in the operation of a manowar carnes hectoring voice rose above the din and occasionally kydd caught sight of an actor in fine robes foreshortened by the height as he strode the boards declaiming into the empty darkness excitement gripped him soon the grand play would openit seemed impossible that the disorderly rumpus below could calm to the breathless scenes he remembered from his last visit to a theatre will we see miss mayhew an mr samson atall he found himself asking in awed tones y might at that a bellow of places places cut through the confusion carne had the company pacing through the new scene arrangement under the directors critical eye and the flymen were soon hard at work on ropes and flats there was a last flurry of activity before front of house went to their stations then a tense wait for the play to commence the echoing emptiness of the theatre now had a different quality a background susurrus of rustling and murmuring as the first of the audience took their seats while the reflectored footlights threw magic shadows into the upper reaches the noise grew shouts from rowdier elements mingling with raucous laughter and the animated hum of conversation the small orchestra struck up with a strenuous overture until anticipation had built sufficientlyand the play began it was hard work and the timing exact but kydd had the chance to hear and sometimes see the action at the interval he descended to help with the flats for the second half but was called across by carne take miss mayhew her refreshment tom whatsyername he was passed a single ornate crystal glass on a small lacquer tray with chinese writing on it a smell of gin wafted up from it as kydd carried it to the dressing rooms past halfdressed nymphs and bearded magyars in a stifling atmosphere of heat and excitement with the unmistakable smell of greasepaint enterrrr the response to his knock was the same imperious trill he had heard on stage griselda mayhew was at her brightly lit mirror a vision of a towering wig flowing gown and caked makeup but a jolly face with kindly eyes ah thank you dearie she said gratefully put it down there im near gutfoundered she looked at kydd shrewdly well i havent seen you before er new tnight miss mayhew he said diffidently youre no common stagehand id wager gent of decayed fortune more like still y came to the right place theatres a fine place t make your mark good luck t you cully blushing kydd left the second half went rapidly and when the play finished he felt an unaccountable envy for the tempest of applause that followed and the several curtain calls that had him sweating at the heavy ropes and when the audience had streamed out he felt a pang of loneliness all he had to look forward to after these bewitching hours was the squalor of the sailloft he finished securing the rigging as griselda mayhews laughter pealed at richard samsons dramatic flourishes with her coat she looked in kydds direction did y enjoy tonight at all she called to him i did that kydd said awkwardly conscious of his shabby appearance as he approached her shyly she frowned slightly then touched his arm its not my business but have y somewhere t go to put offbalance kydd mumbled something but she interrupted i understand m dear we see a lot of em down on their luck like well not t worry look were travelling players an we have t take a big enough place for the season jem just quit so why dont y stay with us for a while she turned to samson thats all right isnt it dickie she said winsomely a fiercely protective eye regarded kydd as long as ye dont smoke a pipe m good man staggered by their generosity kydd took his leave of carne pocketed his coins and followed his new friends out into the night it was heaven to lie in a proper bed and kydd slept soundly in the morning he went diffidently down to join the others but found not a soul abroad at that hour he made himself useful squaring away after the winddown party of the previous evening to the surprise of the maidofallwork who arrived late and seemed to find his presence unhelpful his gear was in the sailloft and he went out to retrieve those things that would fit into his modest room reflecting on the strangeness of life that it could change so quickly when he returned a young man was holding an angry conversation with a wall and richard samson was stalking about in an exotic bedrobe reading aloud from a script in ringing tones ah i thought wed lost you mr cutlass he roared when he spotted kydd a yen to feel the oceans billows perhaps or a midnight tryst with a fair maiden do come in and hide those things away one by one the others appeared but it was not until after ten that griselda made her entrance the men greeting her with exaggerated stage bows while she sailed in to take the least faded armchair miss mayhew kydd bowed too oh dear she replied the others call me rosiewhy dont you tom i will kydd said with a grin it had been an entertaining morning rehearsing cue lines from a script for whoever asked it of him and his spirits were high yere starting a new play i hear of course dearie she sighed we open every second friday with new guernseys not a big enough place we can stay wi the same all the time she looked at kydd speculatively youre not t be a stagehand for ever when shall you pick up a script well i a famous actor strutting the stage with swooning ladies to either side the confidences of princes and dukes folk flocking from far and near having heard that the legendary tom cutlass was playing ill think on it he came back awkwardly on the way to the theatre he called at the post office and this time there was a letter to collect it was from renzi he ripped it open and three coins fell out he scrabbled to retrieve them and eagerly scanned the hurried lines renzi had met with unexpected success soon after arriving he had made the acquaintance of a prince de bouillon whom kydd took to be an exiled royalist and had been fortunate enough to find employ in his household as a private secretary the enclosed thirty livres kydd could expect every month from his wages a lump rose in his throat with this generous gift he was now free to continue with his quest for as long as he but he had already concluded that he was getting nowhere in uncovering the plot and must give upmust he track about hopelessly for ever he had a life to lead he could at least still hope for a ship in england and in any case as an officer even of declined circumstances there were genteel niches in society but the instant he left the islands it would be the final surrender to his unjust fateand lockwood would have had his vengeance was there no middle way there were no performances on the sunday some of the players went to alderney on a visit while others simply slept moodily kydd went to the deserted front parlour and sprawled on the sofa unable to escape his thoughts he laid down his newspaper and closed his eyes the door opened and the swish of a dress made him look up do i disturb you tom oh er not at all rosie kydd said hauling himself upright just thinkin awhile she looked at him steadily youre not all you seem m friend she said quietly ive seen a few characters in my time an youre so differentyouve got iron in your soul a mans man and somethings happened i dont know what it is but its thrown you down where y dont belong when kydd said nothing she came to the sofa and sat beside him i may be only a common actress but i know when a mans without a friend t talk with an thats not natural she straightened her dress demurely and continued it would be my honour if youd take me as y friend tom her hand strayed to his knee kydd flinched but not wanting to offend her stayed rigid she withdrew the hand and said quietly so theres a woman at the bottom of itam i right no that is she no its too tough a yarn t tell tom weve a whole sunday ahead your secret will stay wi me never fear kydd knew from his sister that for a lady there was nothing so intriguing as a man of mystery rosie would worm it out of him sooner or later and besides he had to talk to someone well its a long tale y see he told her of the navy of his rise to success and command of his own ship of his entry to high society and likely marriage into their ranks and subsequent fall when his heart was taken by another and finally the terrible revenge a father was taking on him dear lord an what a tale i had no idea my dear how can you keep your wits about you while youre reduced toto this kydd gave the glimmer of a smile so th last question is just when do i give it away an return t england never she said firmly never tom youre perfectly right you cannot return without youve regained your honour its just as it was in clarissa victrix where the hero is unjustly accused of theft an thrown into newgate an its only when his lady seduces the blackhearted earl into handin over the false evidence that hes made free kydd grimaced while she went on proudly we opened the season wi that in weymouth last year to my leading lady twould be a fine thing indeed should i meet wi such kydd said tartly i have m doubts itll be soonsavin your kindness ive no wish t top it th beggar fr much longer an neither should you rosie soothed tom do promise me y wont leave us for now ive a frienda a personal friend as was who i mean t speak with an then we shall see what happens renzi had slept badly it was either a harebrained plot by wildeyed lunatics or the only chance to rid the world of its greatest nightmare or perhaps bothand dauvergne had made clear that in the event it went ahead renzis wholehearted participation was expected and on the inner circle he had now seen the secret correspondence with london indisputable understandings and instructions from the very highest and concerned with real military and political commitments dauvergne had not lied about his connections and the scheme was under eye by the foreign secretary of great britain and the cabinet itself but just what was being asked of him interrupting his thoughts jenkins the flaglieutenant popped into his office thought youd be too busy to look in at the post officeletter for you been there for a while it was from kydd he had found a menial job shared lodgings and expressed sincere gratitude for the few coins enclosed renzi started a reply but it wouldnt come the contrast between his friends decent plainsailing world and this insane arena of chicanery stealth and the desperate endeavour to topple bonaparte was too great around noon the cutter from england with dispatches entered gorey bay with a package so important that the commodore himself was brought to sign for it shortly afterwards a grimfaced dauvergne laid a letter in front of renzi it was from lord hobart secretary of state for war short and to the point the plot to kidnap napoleon bonaparte was to proceed with all possible dispatch and in the greatest possible secrecy there is attached an order authorising exceptional expenditures against secret service funds at the treasury and an expression of full support from their lordships renzi do you cease all duties to attend on me personally this is the gravest affair this age dauvergne was in no mood to waste a second we shall meet in an hour my friend your current business should be concluded within that time renzi worked quickly no report or appraisal could stand against the stakes that had now been raised when he entered dauvergnes office he was met with a look of dedicated ferocity mr renzi the world knows me as the commodore jersey squadron and i maintain that position and retinue in my flagship and a small office in st helier some might know that my sympathies with the royalists occupy me on occasions here in mont orgueil few indeed know of my other activities as of this moment i count myself officially on leave of absence from my naval duties it will remain thus until this business is complete very well sir renzi nodded may i enquire as to the establishment you must now engage for this purpose the line of command as it were none sir renzi asked not sure he had heard aright the matter is too grave far beyond the compass of what is to be expected of a serving officer the issue much too delicate to entrust to others at this late hour it will be you and i alone who will bring this business to a head sir it consider the plan calls for a rising in paris a coordination of forces and an alignment of purpose that is the concern only of those actually theregeorges and company en effet there is little we might do at this distance and our contribution must be to secure and provide what is asked for and when the time comes to be ready to extract the tyrant by sea from the territory of france his eyes gleamed thus as you will see our tasks will be limitedbut important your good selfs arriving in jersey has been a miracle renzi we will press ahead togethermy office is yours and my time we will share the burden and with it the honour this was nothing less than a strident call to join the gathering maelstrom of the great conspiracy from a reluctant role at the fringe of this halfworld he despised he was now being thrust to the centre it was abhorrent to the principles he had lived bybut how could he deny the syllogistic inevitability of the reasoning that a smaller evil might be justified for the sake of a greater object could he in all conscience stand back at this point this was where logic and morals collided sir i shall do my duty in this matter renzi said coldly with due diligence as my health and strength do allow but i would have you know sir that while bending my best endeavours to the cause i find the business of spying and deception both distasteful and repugnant to my character when this enterprise is concluded therefore i must quit your service that is all dauvergne nodded as i would expect of you renzi before all things you are a gentleman and you are now being asked to violate your sensibilities beyond the bounds nature sets for them however before we begin the enterprise i must have your word upon it that you will enter in with a whole heart applying your mind and body to the one end do i have it you do sir good he picked up some papers and made a show of shuffling them now their first task is that of supply it is vital to their plan to establish a chain of trusted maisons de confiance from paris to the coast each to be defended if needed stocked with fresh horses foodive no need to detail this it is not our concern but the chouans will need gold for bribery arms for the escort they will have it he paused for a moment and you renzi if you will shall make it so your service as a sea officer allows me to place my fullest trust in your ability to perform this duty issue your requirements and i will countersign them without question chapter although his future was now reasonably secure kydd felt qualms all the time he delayed his return to england he knew renzi would stay by him at considerable personal cost and this weighed on his conscience in all fairness he must make plans for departure at the theatre rosie made a point of seeking him out tom love ive something for you at her coy words richard samsons expression darkened but she went on gaily ill give it you tonight when we get back it was a letter addressed to whom it may concern and strictly private cautiously kydd broke the wafer and unfolded the single sheet conscious that rosie was watching quietly to his surprise the salutation was a firm commander kydd puzzledfor he was sure he had not mentioned his last name to rosiehe read on in friendly tones the writer allowed that an acquaintance had conveyed to him that kydd was now at leisure on guernsey and it had occurred to him this was a circumstance that might well be turned to mutual advantage if kydd was inclined to hear further he would be welcome to call at his convenience a mr vauvert kydd said offhandedly says he wants t meet me rosie assumed a practical bustle you will show me what you intend to wear my dear she ordered kydd obediently brought out his best and only walkingout clothes canvaswrapped from their storage in the sailloft and laid them before her the darkgreen coat with tails had suffered somewhat with mould but more serious was the spotting on the cream pantaloons undaunted rosie got to work and soon pronounced kydd ready to appear he marched up to an impressive door in grange road and knocked rosie had told him that vauvert was an important figure in guernsey a merchant investor and négociant of st peter port of some standing and therefore he could be sure this was not a social call he was met by vauvert himself an older man of impeccable dress sir it is kind in you to call he said his shrewd eyes taking in kydds appearance do come in the house was spacious and darkpanelled in the old style with expensive ornaments tastefully placed might i offer you something against this cold evening the cognac was the finest kydd had tasted this was hardly surprising he reflected given the smuggling reputation of guernsey tell me sir he began how it is y know my name why sir you must understand that good intelligence is a merchants first requirement if he is to be successful your misfortune is not unknown in the fraternity of commerce kydd coloured sir i have t make it plain that mr kydd the circumstances are known to me if you are innocent i can only commiseratebut if you were informed upon by another less successful than yourself it is no reflection on your judgement that you were unprepared for such an odious act such things do happen from time to time in the conduct of business and you will find no one in guernsey who will say that the pursuit of profit is in any way morally offensive but i rather feel we should proceed to more constructive discussion do sit sir the fire had settled to a comfortable heat in the elegant study and kydd tried to compose himself if this was a rich merchant seeking a prestige ornament for his establishment by offering him token employment now mr kydd let me be open with you to waste the talents of a sea officer of such shining credentials as yourself in idleness would seem to reflect badly on a nation as sore beset as ourselves the reasons might be debated but the circumstance itself might yet prove of advantage to both you and me he went on i shall be brief you are a naval officer of proved distinction with an active and aggressive attitude to meeting the enemy these qualities are one and the same as those required in the captain of a private manowar a privateer no kydd spluttered iits not possible i cant no vauvert said evenly then ive misjudged you sir at a time when your country lies under as great a peril as ever it has you would spend your time at leisure ashore let me point out to you that your kings ship and your privateer are in the same business of reprisal one is at the kings expense the other paid for by concerned citizens who seek to make their contribution mr vauvert you dont understand fr a naval officer and has it escaped you that war by this means costs his majesty not a penny the enemy is made to pay for his own destruction the sale of prizes repays our own contributions and any overplus is to the credit of those by whose exertions and valour they are secured but this very house sir a not insignificant monument i would dare to say is itself raised on the proceeds of private cruising in the past age kydd felt anger mount the man knew nothing of the contempt a kings officer held for his commercial rivals he could hear cries of disgust as his fellow officers learned of his fall from grace see the shaking heads no it was simply not possible and this was the thing he had sworn not to do absent himself at sea while his quest remained unresolved it was the very reason he was delaying in guernsey no he said with finality its kind o you t think on me but im unable t see m way clear in th matter ill bid ye goodday sir vauverts disappointment was plain my carriage is at your disposal sir he said stiffly that wont be necessary kydd said and left but outside his annoyance ebbed vauverts disappointment had been genuine in a way it was a tribute to the respect in which kydd was held the man had probably counted on his agreeing to be a privateer captain with a fine profit on every prize he brought in not that it would in any way swaykydd stopped in his tracks he was getting nowhere in trying to uncover the plot against him and he probably never would unless he tried another tack lockwood had obviously bribed a clerk in the admirals office no doubt with the connivance of someone local and what could be bribed could be unbribed elation surged with enough gold in the right places he could achieve anything he wished including a recanting of the false witness against him and what faster way to accrue the necessary wealth than as a privateer whose fortune could be won in a single voyage with rising excitement he hurried back he would need to seek leave for employment at sea in the usual way no doubt just as he had done for the convict transport to new south wales his halfpay would cease immediately but what an opportunity nothing could stand against a determined man with a pot of gold at his back the négociant was blankfaced as kydd was shown back in mr vauvert i do apologise sir i may have been too precipitate in m departure i should have enquired more concerning m prospects in th venture i understand mr kydd it can seem a big step to take when youre not familiar with practices he said ill do what i can to set your mind at rest a cigar no perhaps more brandy a servant appeared with a tray please let me tell you a little of the business i use the word advisedly for this is something we must keep always before us it is in the nature of an investment and for so doing we expect a returnto bear a profit to the investors at the least to recoup our costs he looked keenly at kydd now prudent men of business do weigh the prospects of a return against the risk to their capital and that of private cruising requires the greatest thought of all i do not have to detail to a man of your experience the costs of setting a vessel aswim but to those must be added considerable legal and agency costs especially if a prize is to be contested in the courts kydd attended politely aware that if he was to become a noteworthy privateer captain he must learn as much of these elements as he could it might be said that the chief determinant in success or otherwise of a voyage must be the richness of the cruising ground but i have to tell you that it is not it is in equal measure the acumen of the financing promoter and the sagacity and enterprise of the captain he smiled at kydd you are young and daring it is true but your recent actions before granville tell me that this is tempered in no small measure by cool thinking and a practical appraisal of risk should you choose to undertake this venture i for one would not hesitate to accept you then sir youre saying im saying only that your suitability for the post is clear you should understand that the business of any such venture will not be mine to command the whole will be conducted by a promoter whom we term an armateur he will form an association of interested persons looking to the matter with a view to investment should they concur articles will be drawn up and the armateur will bring together the subscribers funds into a consolidated whole which will then form the capital of the venture their return will be in direct proportion to the measure of interest they have shown by their investment i see kydd said then as a captain wi no investment of my own m position is this will be a matter for the articles of association you can be assured that you will be adequately recompensed for your conduct some choose a regular wage others a portion of the proceeds it is a common thing for a successful captain later to become an investor in himself with shares accordingly these many fine mansions you see here in grange road are some intimation of what can be achieved kydds pulse quickened then er vauvert leaned back well it seems ive sparked an interest in you sir shall we say that if im able to receive an expression of your earnest in the matter i shall approach an armateur of my acquaintance to open discussion with a view to forming a venture do i have it mr kydd with only the barest hesitation kydd gulped aye sir ye do he was nearly late for the evening performance carne looked at him sharply as he arrived but kydd was too excited to care he was on another plane of existence and did his work mechanically letting the nervous energy of the theatre wash about him as a surreal backdrop to his thoughts it wasnt until the next morning that he managed to talk to rosie he told her what vauvert had said then added with a grin so y see if this works fr me im in a fair way t hauling mself back t where i should be you will love never doubt it her warm smile touched kydd if all the world shared her faith in him the next few days were trying the possibility of great wealth such a contrast to the reality of present penury but then a courteously worded note arrived the armateur had shown a degree of interest and suggested kydd meet him a time and date was duly agreed kydd was aware that everything was riding on this next stage the armateur was a heavily built gentleman of years in plain dress still with the blocky stance and weatherbeaten features of a professional mariner le sieur robidou is most experienced in these matters ill have you know mr kydd his success as a privateer in the american war is still talked of and hes trusted by all the merchant houses here in the article of practical costs management he has some questions for you vauvert told him kydd found himself held in a steady gaze by the calm blue eyes of the older man im pleased t make your acquaintance sir robidou said in a voice that was deep and authoritative yeve a mind to go acaper i believe vauvert interjected hastily oh on a caperits an old dutch term for going in search of plunder er im considering th prospects kydd answered politely might i know what you conceive t be a captains first concern in a private manowar kydd hesitated then came back stoutly t keep th seas without cease until a prize be sighted he said an then t spare nothing until th prize is ours robidou replied in measured tones for mself id think that the higher is t take a proper regard fr the ship an her fittings as they are the property o the owners mr kydd cracking on in a chase is all fine an well but if she strains aloft or carries away her sticks is she fit t carry on after th next prize an can ye tell me your outlay fr a prime mainyard twould make y eyes water sir kydd mumbled something but robidou pressed on then what would be yr secondmost concern sir why yr books of account o course sir kydd replied what is yr prizetaking without y know your expenses t date as must be set against yr profit doubleentry o course an properly shipshape well said sir rumbled robidou so many neglect the same t the eventual mortification o their finances tell me mr kydd have ye experience at sea in th commercial line i have mr robidou i was captain o the totnes castle in th colony trade around th cape an the owners were pleased enough wi my service there was probably no need to explain that it had been a convict transport and i stood by m brigsloop fitting out in malta a right caution t see what hookum snivey the chousin rogues tried at th dockyard it not being a kings yard robidou nodded totnes castlecant say ive knowledge of her now these channel islands do ye feel comfortable wi the sea conditions t be found here aye in teazer we had on board mr queripel an a taut hand he was at yr currents an tides he was good enough t allow me t hoist aboard a mort o learning o th brittany coast i know queripel robidou said a good man well i can see yell need to haul in a lot more about the privateer trade but b the look o you well rub along im sure mr vauvert if we can satisfy mr kydd with our articles i think we have a venture it was no good he couldnt go on any longer a privateer captain or a stagehandhe couldnt be both but if he stopped working he would be without enough funds to contribute to his lodging or whatever lay ahead rosie was sympathetic my dear it happens to us all youre between engagements and embarrassed for means she smiled sweetly you shant leave us on that account crossing to a corner table she touched an oddlooking china cat with an upraised paw if y have need just ask mojo here she lifted its head and found him some coins in course we give him back th rhino as soon as were in the cobbs again kydd felt a gush of warmth he felt he was sharing in a tradition that might have been handed down from the travelling players of shakespeares time a custom that helped the needy without causing embarrassment dont worry rosie i will he said an when m first prize comes home well have such a hobanob together as will set th town t talkin fr weeks robidous small office was on the top floor of an old ships chandlery on the waterfront near the harbour and still smelled of the century of sea stores that had once been there he looked up from a broad desk set under oldfashioned windows with a view out to sea i think it only proper t tell ye whats to happen afore we can think t fit out our craft for cruising an elderly clerk scratching away against the wall murmured something but robidou cut him short no samuel those figures must be presented tonightwell not disturb ye he took kydd into another room and said gravely hes preparing our case as will be put t the investors it has t be a fine rousin one or theyll not hazard their capital kydd felt a sudden chill his hopes might yet be turned to dust dont concern yself mr kydd thats business for me but after weve got agreement we must appoint the officers the officers surely this was his prerogative why yes i shall be made ships husband o course but theres the business house in london well need a bond agentpaul le mesurier id trust we has t find a proctor an notary public and therell be insurance and legal agents t appoint but ye wont be interested in thisall youll want t hear about drawing up th articles of agreement and shares i do mr robidou kydd said as heartily as he could well curb y impatience sir all in good time now after this is signed we have the venture ill be collectin the subscriptions an establishin our credit wi the priaulx housethey owns privateers but theyll handle fittin out for us in return we gives em commissions of appraisement an such on our prizes when ive done that we can go lookin for a ship for ye robidou chuckled then ye has t find a crew as will follow an then finally take out yr letter o marque it was an intoxicating thought there was every reason to hope that soon he could be once more at sea and miraculously as captain when do wethat is m ship do we just how did one go about acquiring a privateer vessel go to a builder of privateers look in the newspaper advertisements impatience flooded kydd your ship a mite impetuous when we hasnt yet an agreement sir robidou relented with a grin why dont ye take a walk along the harbour ifn theres a saucy craft as takes yr eye its possible well make an offer havelet bay an st sampson the builders yards there might have something t interest ye kydd lost no time there was every conceivable vessel in st peter port harbour stately barques nondescript luggers and at anchor in the great road large merchantmen sporting a surprising number of guns a side but where were the privateers would he recognise one those he had come upon at sea were a mixed bag indeed from large threemasters to the swarms in the mediterranean not much bigger than boats there was probably not a single type of vessel that could be classed definitively as a privateer his pace slowed this would not be easy were vessels purposebuilt to be privateers if so what would their characteristics be fast craft probably sharp in the hull with sparring to take a cloud of canvasbut those were the very kind whose seakeeping was so poor they would have to retire at the first sign of a blow and as well in the confines of a sharpbuilt vessel where were the prizecrews going to find berths and stowage for stores to keep the seas for any length of time then again if he were the prey a smart rakish predator lifting above the horizon would instantly have him sheering away for his life and it would be a tedious and costly stern chase to go after every prize it was something to which he had never before given thought he looked at the ships working cargoes what would be their perspectives on the matter as prey at sea they would be as wary as any wild animal fearing a fox ranging nearby so if the privateer seemed one of them on its lawful occasions they would not take much notice of his approach or any manoeuvre that would otherwise seem threatening yes a ship of respectable size probably brigrigged as so many traders were then a sudden unmasking of a goodly row of guns to convince even the stoutest heart that resistance would be futile this would have the additional benefit that there would be no gunplay to damage prize or cargo a ship in fact not so very different from teazer there were several that might qualify as he surveyed the busy harbour one in particular stood out a blackhulled brigantine of two or three hundred tons sitting handily on the mud in the tidal harbour to reveal her sweet underwater lines there were few about her decks her hatches were on probably awaiting her cargoor she was in idleness his heart beat faster was this the ship that would take him to wealth and respectabilityto adventure in the unknown casually he walked round the harbour wall until he was up with her close to she appeared well caredfor the gear tautly bowsed lines from aloft properly tarred decks priddied all this was a good indicator of her condition below he sauntered past to peer at her stern cheval marin was painted there in ornate yellow lettering seahorse a fine name a shipkeeper gazed up at him curiously kydd walked on he knew now what he wantedif the investors came to an agreement renzi and dauvergne fell quickly into a working relationship based on mutual respect together they reviewed the plot the heroic lengths to which georges and his compatriots were going merely to maintain themselves at the centre of napoleons capital they traced the route out of paris that the fleeing carriage and its prisoner must takewest through the meadows and beech forests of the orne into the uplands and to the rugged coast to a secluded but accessible place where the final delivery of the wouldbe emperor to the waiting vessel could be effected in secrecy and at speed that done it was now necessary to prepare the ground the secret records of la correspondancedauvergnes underground network dating back to the days of the revolution to the doomed risings in the vendée with all their desperate valour and treachery these would hold what was needed renzi placed his candle on the bare table oppressed by the stifling atmosphere of the ancient dungeon and crossed to the iron chests the heavy keys were awkward and the lock wheezed reluctantly but then he had them deeds of heroism never to be told to the world letters of pleading ended briefly in another hand bald receipts for gold and armsand the names of those living quietly in the peace of the countryside who had to be informed that service and sacrifice were now asked of them he stuffed the ones he needed into his satchel relocked the chests closed the grim door and left the room to the dust of centuries while renzis first requisition was being readied he started on the hundreds of messages that were to go out each missive reaching to villages and farmhouses in a long line to the capital had to be carefully phrased to avoid implication if it was intercepted but be undeniably authentic for kydd time passed heavily then a hurried note came from robidou to the effect that one of the investors had raised a serious objection to him as captain it didnt say but kydd knew that vauvert and robidou were relying on his name as a daring naval officer to offset his lack of experience would this suffice two nights later a letter arrived by hand of messenger kydd ripped it open there was agreement he was appointed captain and expected at the office at ten the following morning for the formalities which would include his acceptance of the initial articles kydd called his friends rosie richard raise yr glasses please t guernseys newest privateer captain hurrah rosie squealed hugging kydd a real corsair how romantic well come down to the harbour an see you off on your voyage o plunder and adventure you lucky man at robidous office he picked up the memorandum and articles of association that were the foundation of his future it was strange to see before his eyes in sombre weighty phrases the financial underpinning to nothing less than a voyage of predationbut then he remembered that he was a mere employee of the association the captain of their venture but nevertheless a servant of the owners this became even more plain when preparation began on the articles of the voyage there was dignified discussion concerning his emoluments but this was merely a form of politeness his basic income would be no more than a bare wage the incentive for captain and crew would be a share in the proceeds of any prize they might take this was apportioned out and agreed at a fiveeighths share to the managing owners the rest to be distributed among the privateer crew the captain would receive sixty shares twice that of the officers the boatswain gunner and other valuable members half that again the common seaman could expect anything from twelve to two shares in accordance with his worth to the ship that settled there was the question of the conduct of the voyage in the merchant service there were no articles of war no regulations or admiralty instructions as a comforting guide and sometime refuge from decision on a merchantman aside from the venerable customs of the sea the captain stood alone to rule as he saw fitand be ready to take the consequences there had to be something sturdy and bracing in the articles however as this was the only binding document for a seaman who must sign them before the forthcoming voyage for a privateer it was a particular case carrying on the profession of war but within the structure of the merchant service under robidous advice kydd compromised on simple clauses that required obedience to lawful orders and refraining from insolence and disorderly conduct as to provisions touching on combat it was no use to make appeal to king and country there was but one simple equation those who flinched in action or showed cowardly behaviour would forfeit their share in the prize on the other hand the first man to board a resisting prize would be rewarded six gold guineas for him and one each for the next six no pillage to be tolerated the articles went on to other details no extra privileges to officers save the captain a weeks wages in advance on signing and a redeemable ticket for shares immediately on prize condemnation none to suffer loss of wages or prize money if put ashore with illness or injury caused in the line of duty and all monies due a seaman to be payable within three months of the end of the voyage these were clear enough for kydd had been master of a merchant vessel before and the legalities of such documents as the portage bill and others concerning the crew were no mystery to him he must have impressed for robidou sat back in satisfaction and grunted an if yell clap yr scratch t the articles we can get th venture under way the armateur pulled out a bottle of malt whisky and glasses heres t your good health mr kydd an may our enterprise be profitable it was time to find a ship aye i did get sight o one kydd said casually shes alongside by south pier name of cheval marin fine lines she has trim an well fettled wi a deck asll take a line o sixpounders the brigantine about two three hundred ton a mite oversparred fr the channel aye but not a problem fr a cruiser robidous expression hardened pray tell me mr kydd why do ye think shell make a privateer why she has the size t discourage valour and looks a simple merchantman well enough and where did ye say yr cruising gulf of avranches t brest kydd said defensively remembering the two quarry he had seen from teazer then yell need to think again i believe theres two things y may have overlooked the first of em is in those waters theyre all coasters close in shallow draught is whats wanted in chase through shoal waters bigod an thats not yr cheval second is have ye costed the barky three hundred tons a hundred an fifty crewputtin aside th purchase price whatll she cost each day o seatime disbursements in harbour dues wharfage repair an maintenance add all yr other outlay with this an we come to a pretty sum now how much do y reckon a coaster prize will yield figuring on a ready market but fees o thirty per centum at the least not enough t cover expenses no sir it will not do youll be wantin a trim coaster yself im thinkin no moren eighty ton probably lugrigged an country built a hold well enough fr a prizecrew y wont need storin past a week or so at a time kydds dreams of cutting the figure of a rapacious privateer putting to sea in a proud craft in search of booty were rapidly fading i did see one as ill allow is more t my taste robidou went on in st sampson fr repair a saucy lugger just yr size youll want t see her first o course name o bien heureuse been in th salt trade this last twelvemonth a common enough sight to the french what weight o metal kydd asked dubiously robidou chuckled a frenchy coastin craft wont have moren swivels so a pair o small carriage gunsll be enough t terrify him if yere crafty an go quietly yell outsail any deepladen vessel o yr own class an then its how well y board kydds first sight of bien heureuse was a vessel propped up on the mud near a slipyard up the coast at st sampson plank walkways were laid to allow their inspection but as kydd made his way gingerly towards the rearing bulk his heart sank her construction was sound enough carvel strakes of a thickness out of respect to the rocky shoals and reefsbut so drab no figurehead or decoration to relieve the sturdy lines not a touch of goldleaf or a proud sterngallery her hull was utilitarian tarred blacksided faded in parts but her spars and rails were varnished giving an overall impression of unpretentious strength they clambered up a wooden ladder to the deck she was twomasted really the third much smaller and wellraked mast right aft was so out of keeping with the others but at least they soared to a satisfying height kydd reflected and they could probably spread topsails above flushdecked there was one hatchway forward and one aft the latter led to what would be his cabin little more than a hutch with a table and space for a cot with two tiny skylights above forward was a space with curtainedoff bunks above lockers no doubt the officers accommodation reaching the open air again kydd saw that with gratings in the hatches the partitioned hold held good promise of accommodation for prizecrew and there was the usual focsle gloryhole right forward for the main crew aware that robidou was watching him kydd took his time if this was to be his command nothing could be left to chance he crossed to the shrouds they were faded to the plain hemp but when he examined inside the strands there was the rich black of stockholm tar the deck was uncluttered the lead of the lines from aloft economical and practical as to be expected of a small crew there would have to be doubled backstays and the like as in a manowar to provide for rigging carrying away in the thick of an action and other additions would be needed aloft her ground tackleanchors and cableshad been landed but could be inspected later as would the suits of sails going with the sale but all in all shell do kydd said evenly subject t survey o course the pace quickened it was made very clear that ships in harbour do not catch prizes and kydd spent more of his time at st sampson when he called on robidou he was asked to provide a completion date for the conversion were livin on our capital the armateur rasped ye must have crew but not too quicktheyll be guzzlin on our account soon enoughbut they needs t plan out their time frm when youre askin em to sign on whichll be lessn a week afore ye sails an thatll be as soon as shes fit t swim kydd made to leave but robidou stopped him arent ye forgettin something mr kydd er whats that sir ifn ye goes acruisin without it the world will take ye as a pirate ah th letter o marque it was the legal document that set him loose on the seven seas to board and seize ships going about their business without being accused of piracy he had never seen one close to but knew them to be of vital importance do ye know whats t be done in the applyin when kydd shook his head he passed across the single sheet of an old letter of marque from a previous voyage it would be no trivial matter the object it seemed was to petition the king through the high court of admiralty for a grant of reprisal the legal conceit being that the petitioner was seeking redress for injury from the nominated princebonapartethrough the seizing of his property namely ships and their cargo this in turn required the production of a warrant from the lords commissioners for executing the office of lord high admiral of great britain for the granting thereof to the named captain and ship to obtain such it was necessary to make deposition as to the suitability of such a vessel and its commander with the owners tonnage and rig her principal officers the size of crew and armament to be strictly specified even the number of shot for each gun and the state of her sea stores would be noted th suitability of her captain as must appear before em kydd had never heard of a naval captain of a privateerbut then it was likely that few would wish to boast of the experience and what of the recent shadow over his naval career thats as it has t be robidou said impatiently youll not need t appear as guernseymen we can declare b proxy an we has a london agent wholl weasel th thing through any shoal waters for us he knows what hes about an were payin the devil enough for his pains kydd read on a bond sureties on the commander against his good conduct im askin paul le mesurier t stand in the sum o one thousan five hundred pounds as he will trustin youll steer small in the article o seizin ships as will fight it staggered kydd the princely sum of five years of his total pay as commander was being advanced in trust by a complete stranger on the word of robidou which he stood to lose if kydd ran afoul of some bloodyminded admiralty clerk who judged that his conduct in boarding had been wanting robidou continued well now thats under way then i fancy yell want t find a crew he paused youll not know s many in th islandsdo ye wish t leave it to me t find some asll ship with ye if y please mr robidou kydd said ill put th word about slowly the replies arrived on renzis desk a tribute to the skill and dedication of dauvergnes network concealed in treetrunks and under bridges they were retrieved and at great risk to the carriers made their way to the coast then by fishermen and smugglers to jersey now to lie in his hand the secrets were held in grubby spidery letters some as spirals to be uncurled others folded to minute squares in innocent shop receipts or letters to relatives however great care was needed for while the old trick of writing in lemon juice and reading it by the heat of a candleflame was well known many preferred to use bakingsoda and grape juice this could be read only the once then would slowly fade for ever effectively preventing its later use as evidence the messages fervent support elaborately worded reasons for unavailability warnings of billeted troops all needed to be plotted against the route and alternative arrangements made chapter kydd was set up in his rendezvous at the blue anchor in st peter port in due style ready to stand a muzzier of stingo to any brave tar who wished to sign on with him for a cruise of fortune westward it was noisy harddrinking work but robidou was sitting next to him and it was clear that he was well respected as a privateersman among the first to approach was rowan a seamed west country man with a direct eye and quiet manner his recent experience quickly saw him signed as lieutenant and prizecaptain a boatswain rosco was next bluff he had a hardeyed countenance that kydd liked seamen started to appear there were some prime hands that would not have been out of place on the gundeck of a manowarwhich was probably where they had learned their trade others had the look of the wharfrat about them but kydd could not be too particular as numbers were thinning another experienced officer came up name of tranter he could claim service with the guernseyman hamon of the phoenix which had taken twenty prizes in the revolutionary war he was made second prizecaptain and lieutenant more seamen came some curious others disdainful it was hard to make out their mettle when it was overlaid with the traditional independence of the merchant seaman but this was not to be a long deepsea voyage where any real defects of character could matter as time passed kydd was perturbed that no gunner had stepped forward he had secured a pair of ninepounder carriage guns and needed to see they were fitted properly a merchant vessel was not equipped with the heavy scantlings of timber round the gunports to absorb recoil and they would require sea testing to work up to a safe charge by the evening it had become evident that while they would not go shorthanded they had not been besieged by eager fortunehunters and kydd knew he was lucky to have signed his crew now it was time to take on the ships boys their main purpose was to manage the ship when the men were away in prizecrews paid at the lowest rate and with but a halfshare each they were nevertheless vitaland cheap they crowded up to his table eyes shining ready for adventure he hoped the reality of a cold autumn sea and an overcrowded ship would not too quickly disillusion them and managed a few words of encouragement to each the next day kydd was back at the bien heureuse which was now in the water so he could take his fill of her her lugger rig was his main concern as it was seldom encountered in the navy this one was similar to a french chassemarée with its sharply raked third mast and ringsail with jigger boomkin out over the stern but she had a lengthy bowsprit over her dignified straight stem english style time was pressing and there was so much to see to the sails had to be in reasonable condition for the weather as it worsened with the season the running rigging needed to be overhauled no twicelaid stuff to fail at the crucial moment and all the time expenses were mounting and robidou had to be convinced of their necessity artificers and artisans were signed onthe sailmaker armourer carpentereach with shares negotiated and commensurate all found outfits of tools and spares the clock was ticking with the hands signing aboard and taking wages the priaulx yard was doing a good job but seemed to have no sense of urgency it needed goading and drink money for the shipwrights who were of course in a way of business that in a kings yard they were not a gunner was finally found kevern a sallow and somewhat nervous young man who had the unsettling habit of agreeing instantly and completely with anything kydd said by now robidou was showing clear signs of impatience kydds requirement for more powder and shot was denied curtly he was allowed the bare minimum of charts and no chronometer the prizecaptain rowan however was unexpectedly helpful in discovering odd rutters and pilots of the waters in french and dutch a small crowd of interested spectators had taken to looking on from the pier to the hazard of the ships stores being prepared there to be struck below driven to distraction kydd was told that the cook had stormed off in disgust at the primitive stoveand he knew only too well that the men wouldnt stand for there not being hot scran on board at the right time it was chaos and confusion on all sides as kydd took refuge in his tiny cabin it smelled of damp bedding and stale tobacco the timber sides were weeping at the join of the transom and there would be no money wasted on oiling the faded wood of the bulkhead it remained a drab and paleblotched sadness he held his head in his hands what had possessed him to take this on he would have given a great deal to have his friend renzi with him now loyally working at menial clerking in jersey to give him the chance to clear his name yet something had prevented kydd writing to tell him of his change of situation some feeling of reluctance to admit to his friend his new status as a privateer there were more pressing matters how could he forge this ships company into a fighting whole when they were complete strangers not a soul would he have aboard that he had known more than hours only he would be again without a friend in the world staring gloomily at the grubby skylight he had a sudden idea that set him to calling a ships boy heres a sixpence do you find a mr luke calloway as will be at th bethel or workin on th waterfront an tell him th captain o bien heureuse wants t speak with him off y go then it would not only provide calloway with a job and a chance at real money but kydd would have a familiar face on board it wasnt until the afternoon that the lad came back breathless i did fin a gent b that name but he was pushin a handcart mr kydd an when i told im what ye wanted he asked what ship i told im bien heureuse privateer he puffed out his cheeks in pride then where when he hears shes a private ship he dont want t know sees me off the boy said astonished kydd grinned mirthlessly tell him mr kydd has need o his services younker another sixpence if hes aboard b sundown that evening still without a cook kydd welcomed calloway warmly and over a hot negus in his cabin told him of his plans an if yed wish it theres a berth fr masters mate on th next cruise whatever it took he would get it past robidou after all calloway was a prime manowars man and an officer in his last ship and a masters mate aboard a merchant ship well if the practice was to call mates lieutenants in privateers then surely he could import other ranks id like it well mr kydd calloway said in a voice tinged with awe it vexed kydd that he was apparently now touched by the glamour of a corsair he went on sternly in course as soon as were rightfully back aboard teazer ill see ye on the quarterdeck as reefer again aye aye captain calloway said happily get y baggage an be back smartly ive a cook t find frm somewhere kydd said heavily remembering if he did not find one er i do know o one a seacook where calloway hesitated over in la salerie mr kydd i seen him cook up fr the boatyard there see hes of an age as wed say youd have t hide th grog or hes a devil cut loose but hes been t sea the young mans face cleared oh aye if yed lend ear t his yarns an half of it true why get him here then suddenly it was time after a last frantic scrabble to load stores and find missing crew they were singling up the shore lines shouts were thrown at men standing uselessly about the focsle and the boatswain knocked a man to the deck in vexation canvas rustled as it was hoisted on the fore and a sightseer bent to give the bowline an expert twist and toss into the water as the wind caught the tall lug and the bow sheered away from the pier kydd roared the order that brought in the stern painterand they were on their way out to sea kydd took a deep breath to steady himself he was back in command and outward bound on a voyage of fortunefree of the land but this was in a small barely armed former salt trader with an untried crew and in minutes they could be fighting for their livesor seizing a rich prize as they left st peter port there had been no fine gun salutes or pennant snapping bravely at the main the hallowed ceremony of a kings ship putting to sea to meet the enemy instead it had been a casual slipping from the pier to catch the ebb along with all the other small vessels leaving to go about their business on great waters bien heureuse picked up the breeze and stood out into the channel of the little russel kydd took care that they carried only small sail until he was happy he knew his ship better it was unsettling not to have a queripel or a sailingmaster aboard as they headed out past the sombre rocks round the harbour probably robidou had reasoned that if he needed deeper local knowledge he could ask rowan or one of the others but for now he must be the one to give orders with clear skies and in only a slight lop they shaped course past the plattes for the north of guernsey where are we headed mr kydd rowan asked standing by his shoulder perfectly braced on the heeling deck were t quarter th coast west o bréhat kydd said in a tone that did not invite discussion however he planned to delay their arrival on these hunting grounds along the north coast of france as there was a driving need to get his ship in fighting array before their first encounter he did not want arguments he felt there was quarry in those regions and besides his one and only patrol of the french coast had been there so these were the only waters he knew well rowan looked at him keenly but said nothing they reached the north of guernsey and put the tiller down for a smart beat westward in the direction of the open atlantic where he would have the searoom to take her measure the fresh breeze strengthened in gusts and sent the lee gunwale dipping into the racing side wake a lesson learned bien heureuse was tender on a wind and would need more men to each mast her angle of heel was considerable even for a foreandaft rigged vessel and kydd found himself reaching for a shroud to steady himself approaching seas came in with a hard smack on the weather bow and transformed into solid spray that soaked every unwary hand she was a wet ship he tested the wind leaning into it with his eyes closed feeling its strength and constancy a strong blow from the southsouthwest surely they could carry more sail he made the order to loose one of the two reefs on the forethe bow fell off and buried itself in the brisk combers an th main mr rosco kydd bawled there was little subtlety in the lug rig but this brought a definite improvement in her response at the tiller he sheeted the little ringsail behind him harder in and was surprised by the response not only did she right herself considerably and take fewer seas over the bow but her speed seemed to have increased and closer to the wind there were possibilities he let bien heureuse take up full and bye again then tried her going free downwind without a comfortable breadth of beam she felt uneasy rolling in a regular arc to one side then lurching to the othernot her best point of sailing and the absence of a weighty cargo low down didnt help a crestfallen calloway appeared sorry sir purvis isum flustered b liquor an needs t rest kydd grimaced their cook prostrate with drink as were other crewmen who had disposed of their advances in the timehonoured way they would have to be roused soon for the setting of watches then must abide by the ageless rhythm of the sea in the navy such behaviour would earn at the least a night in the bilboesbut this was not the navy mr rowan id be obliged should ye take the deck until weve got our watchbill course west b south fr now kydd wanted to get the paperwork squared away while the daylight lasted there were no clearlight spermaceti lamps aboard this vessel the motion was uncomfortable in the confines of his cabin a pronounced wallow that demanded a sustained bracing against the movement he turned to his papers hurriedly stuffed into a box he had not had time fully to digest the admiralty instructions to privateers a specific set of rules enclosed with the letter of marque which by their infraction would result in the bond forfeited they seemed straightforward enough however in the main to ensure that merchant ships of whatever flag and particularly neutrals were not assailed by swarms of illdisciplined freebooters little better than pirates from the look of some of his crew this was not impossible kydd thought wryly the other paperwork would have to wait he swung out of the cabin and then on deck in the cold evening bluster he saw only rowan and the helmsman in any sense on watch with possibly a pair of lookouts on the foredeck but more probably they were landmen unable to keep belowdecks he stumped down to the curtained officers quarters and found the other prizecaptain lying in his cot mr tranter muster all hands fr watches he snapped bit hard like the man drawled they been on th turpswe lets em sleep it off he made no move to rise kydd saw red out n downnow he roared if i dont see ye on deck this instant so help me ill have ye turned afore the mast tranter rolled an eye towards him y cant do that he said in an aggrieved tone this aint a kings ship we got articles as say im a prizecaptain he contemplated kydd for a moment more then slipped down slowly and reached for his watchcoat stumping up the companionway kydd clamped down his anger if he was going to have a welltrained crew instead of a cutlasswaving bunch of pirates he had his work cut out the men came on deck reluctantly some helped by their shipmates there were by count but fiftyone all told the chill wind whipping in set the unprepared shivering but kydd was in no mood for sympathy he waited until they were still yere crew o the bien heureuse privateer he rasped yeve signed articles an now yere takin my orders apart from some sullen shuffling there seemed to be stolid acceptance he would show them he knew the customs of the merchant service well enough mr rowan mr tranter he called importantly rowan stepped forward and pursing his lips pointed to a leveleyed seaman with his arms folded across his chest raynor he grunted the man obediently crossed the deck and stood by him with a grimace tranter moved forward and surveyed the group he called out a thickset seaman from the back who shuffled across to him through the others it went on the best men fairly distributed the unknowns parcelled out when it reached the boys kydd intervened ill take him t be m peggy he said pointing to the tallest he wanted a cabin boy who could stand up for himself when the process was complete kydd set calloway to taking down the details ill have a full watch o the hands b morning he ordered both lieutenants it was now up to them to assign their own men to best advantage in the watch that they themselves would lead he left them to it and headed for his cabin relieved that the first steps had been taken in bringing order to the world no sooner had he sat down than there was a tap at the door come he called it was the young lad he had chosen as his cabin boy well now an yeve nothing t fear if y do yr duty younker kydd said genially was there not something familiar about the youngster yes sir he replied not meeting kydds eyes im sure ive seen ye somewhere aboutwhat do they call ye lleon s please ye sir the boy said shrinking back realisation dawned be damned an leon its not pookie more

enough o th catblash youre goin back t yr ma the childs eyes filled please mr kydd i want t be a sailor see aroun the world like you doan ye did promise us when we signed as wed be able seamen afore we knew it thats what y said kydds first reaction was to summon the boatswain and have the girl taken off his hands but then he sat back heavily the ship was halfway between guernsey and the french coast with night coming on he was not risking those rocky outliers to return in the darkness with a fluky wind she would have to stay on board for the night to return in the morning would be to waste their hardwon westing and result in an ignominious arrival in port to explain that one of the hands he had personally signed up was female not to speak of the expense which would be mounting hourly and he couldnt land the rascal somewhere to pick up later there was no friendly territory anywhere to the west of guernsey kydd sighed what can yr mother be feeling now y scamp ma she said scornfully shes so plagued b the little uns shed be main pleased t see th last o me i been away before y know she added with selfpossession beyond her years y cant stay aboard what if they finds ye aa female does anyone know no they doesnt mr kydd she said stoutly look ill be th same as the othershonest ill pull on yr ropes an such just like a man dont make me go back kydd had to admit that she was indistinguishable from a boy in her breeches and plain homespun and her hair while long was in keeping with that of the other ships boys her impish features suggested anything but a demure damsel despite himself he warmed to her need to escape dreary poverty for the freedoms of the sea he made up his mind be just th same as the other lads take orders wiout a cackle stand up fr yself i will mr kydd she said with fervour then ill make ye a deal mr kydd i dont know yere a female nobody told me now if any aboard find out yere taken straight t this cabin th same instant an locked in until we

female they wont mr kydd he looked at her very directly and ifn any shows ye any mischief at all youre t come t me directly ill not stand fr it d ye hear yes mr kydd right well mr turner let me tell ye of yr duties morning found them under small sail tossing uneasily in a long swell from the west blearyeyed men were roused from below to meet the dawn this would be the last time kydd allowed the ship not to be ready at quartersor whatever passed for battle readiness in a privateer mr rowan he hailed ill give both watches one bell fr their breakfast an then well turn to fr some real sailorin it was near impossible to work up a ships company to effectiveness as a fighting unit in such a short timebut it would be their captain they blamed if they failed to take a prize or worse were overcome themselves the men left the deck muttering and kydd remembered the cook going forward he found the forehatch but praise be immediately below it purvis was at work with his pots and pans on the small portable stove he looked up cheerily ho there capn he breezed everything in hand kydd called down the stove was rigged over a bed of bricks under the open hatch but how it was possible to bring in meals for scores of men in such conditions was a mystery to him ayealls ataunto sir kydd left him to it and returned to his cabin inside an apprehensive cabin boy waited with a steaming dish and plates on a tray under a neat canvas spraycover why thank ee er turner clearly the cook had been consulted and together they had managed a hot breakfast fit for a captain it was a hearty burgoo and toast thick with jersey butterkydd had not been able to afford his usual private cabin stores and knew he was sharing with his men mr purvis says as if ye has yr particular taste he will oblige mr kydd thats kind in him kydd said now you duck below an crowd some victuals inboard ive got work fr all hands this forenoon asll have em all in a sweat he chuckled the smell of hot food was irresistible and he realised he was very hungry later restored after his meal kydd went on deck he had given it some thought there was no use trying to bring things along by setting masts to compete or appealing to some sense of nautical excellence these merchant seamen were used to a sea life very different from the navy often with parsimonious owners providing tiny crews barely adequate to do the job leaving little time or energy for nonessentials no it would be necessary to go about it in other ways the first was to trust the mates that they would see to it their men would not let them down mr rowan i desire ye t exercise yr men under sail what do y have in mind at first it was a shambles but that was to be expected order out of chaos seamen out of men the timehonoured sequence when each had to learn the ropes on an unfamiliar ship that did things in its own particular way different ships different longsplices was the old saw but rowan proved experienced and wise and well before midday each point of sailing every manoeuvring task any major event to be expected in a chase had been completed to satisfaction with a core of competence at the heart of the watch it would now be possible to build on it and start the task of bringing along the ordinary seamen landmen and boys to their rightful standing and respect as full ablebodied seamen after a hearty noon meal of beef stew it was time to attend the guns kevern assembled a crew and they set to on their main armament it quickly became obvious that they were paradoxically both over and undergunned a vessel of their tonnage could be expected to mount at least four carriage guns a side in his desire for the authoritative heavy crash of a sizeable gun kydd had acquired a pair of ninepounders it had been a mistake they were too long unwieldy and their full recoil would send them right across the deck if they had to reduce charges out of respect to bien heureuses light timbers the weapons would be of no more use than smaller ones kydd realised he should have stayed with more but lighter guns and felt resentful that kevern had let him go to sea so encumbered he consoled himself however with the thought that a pitched gunbattle was the last thing he wanted a quick chase and rapid boarding that was the way to get an unspoiled prize they were making headway the restraining of his navy instincts and understanding of his mens ways had gone a long way to winning their grudging respect it was left to see how they would behave in a boarding should he begin to exercise with cutlass and pistols along the horizon on the larboard bow kydd saw just starting to lift the low untidy jumble of dark granite islets that was the north of france there was little time left now to prepare he took a deep breath so much depended on saaail hoooo an excited whoop from forward shattered his thoughts where awaaay he bellowed the lookout obliged with a pointing finger there were no tops and ratlines up the shrouds with the lugrig so he was at essentially the same level an excited roar went up and kydd fumbled for his pocket telescope this close to the coast the odds were in favour of it being french and a prizeso soon his heart thudded as he tried to focus they had surprised the ship as it had come round the cliffy headland into full view no more than three or four miles away it was sailing along the shore on a course past them steady as she goes kydd called urgently and rounded on rowan i want these men out o sight belownow they would play the harmless coastal trader for as long as possible nothing would be more calculated to alarm their prey than a sudden alteration towards them with crowded decks he lifted the telescope again gripped by rising excitement so far the vessel was holding its course and they would hold theirs imperceptibly inclining towards their victim until they could make a lunge his mind clamped in concentration on their relative positions and speeds they were closehauled westward in brisk seas while the stranger was driving before the wind a dramatic contrast of pale sail against a backdrop of the sullen darkgrey squall front spreading behind it flickering white wave crests showed in the darkening water nearer kydds eyes watered as he stared through the glass it was a brigantine of sorts so not a warship and showed no colours it shaped course closer to the coastline opening the distance they would have to cover to intercept offshore there was another of the innumerable uninhabited islets a white mist was lifting on its far side a token of mighty seas from the atlantic ceasing their thousands of miles travel in the concussive finality of ironhard granite under the looming dark heights of the squall the headland merged into misty white curtains of rain trying to control his impatience kydd judged that their encounter with the brigantine would occur before the rain reached them nothing could be better calculated to pull his ship together as a fighting band than a successful prizetaking at the forehatch men unable to contain themselves snatched a look keep th heads down y blaggards he bellowed the stranger would be wielding telescopes too the offshore island disappeared into the advancing rain curtain and kydds gaze turned to the vessel as he tried to make out more detail its perspective altered curving ponderously round to take up on a course away back where it had come they had been discovered sheet away y lubbers he shouted at the men boiling up from below the strangernow the chasewas hard by the wind clawing as desperately as it could to windward but it had lost much ground and now lay barely a mile ahead a lazy smile came to kydds face in their panic they had put the helm to the wrong side and now found themselves on the other tack to bien heureuse they could not possibly weather the headland we have him now kydd laughed hell be ours afore sundown they would keep to seaward and wait for the chase to come out to them bien heureuse was lined with eager privateersmen each hungrily making the same calculation a sizeable merchantman with a small crew judging by their tardiness in putting about and taking up closehauled her cargo probably returning from biscay with wine and brandy risking a quick dash across baie de saint brieuca pity for him that a guernsey privateer just happened to be round the point there was no hope for the frenchman and kydd wondered why he held on so doggedly then the first squall arrived in a wash of cold downdraught bien heureuse entered a wall of rain passing into a hissing roar of water that stippled the sea white in a drenching deluge it stunned the wind momentarily and the sails hung limp and wet they emerged damp and chill but the chase was still ahead and closer then another wall of rain closed round them and the sails now deprived of a steady wind flapped and banged visibility was reduced to yards and the seas lost their liveliness as they were beaten to rounded hillocks in the swell kydd squinted into the chaos which seemed to go on and on where was everything in this neverending rain world uneasily aware of the treacherous currents surging over unforgiving ground he gave the order to veer sheets and bien heureuse slowed to a crawl the rain volleyed in a loud drumming on their deck gurgling down the lee scuppers when it finally stopped the chase had disappeared the headland was much closer but there was no sign of the brigantine had he successfully weathered the headland if so he was away up the coast and could be anywhere then kydd saw the offshore island againit was well within reach and would make a perfect place for the frenchman to lurk out of sight while kydd went chasing past then take up on his old course his voyage delayed only by a few hours lay us t windard o that island kydd snapped the breeze had picked up and pierced like a knife through his sodden clothes he shuddered the island rowan said uncertainly are ye sure he thinks t wait out o sighthes too lubbardly t have weathered th point kydd said tranter cut in i dont reckon hes there at all were wastin time get y men ready fr a boardin mr tranter an you stop y pratin kydd answered with sudden anger his heart fell at the sight of the rabble in the waist they were as unlike a naval boarding party as it was possible to be jabbering excited men with drawn cutlasses and lurid headgear where was the lethal discipline of a sectioned assault where the calm weighing of opportunity and deadly resolve hold em there mr tranter kydd called with an edge of sarcasm they were up against terrified merchant sailors and the likelihood was that any fight would be minimal a ninepounder was cleared away and kydd sent calloway to the forward crew to stiffen them they were as ready as they could be drawing near the island seemed the ideal bolthole and at a respectful distance they took time to round the whitefringed weather shore kydd kept his telescope up straining for sight of a naked mast above the irregular lumpiness of the bare rock they circled the island in silence ready for a panicstricken dash nothing at a loss kydd carefully quartered the sea the brigantine had to be somewhere a little cove perhaps a hidden river mouth the prey had escaped tranter snorted and stormed below the men followed in ones and twos with scornful looks aft kydd caught rowans eye where did he go d ye think i dont think y give th frenchy credit mr kydd hes one cool hand waits fr the main squall then slashes about t stay inside it an passes us close in th murk an away off t paimpol cool as y please it was galling it seemed these french matelots in their home waters were every bit as bold and seamanlike as the english certainly far from being frightened sheep about to be snapped up by a passing wolf we press on kydd grunted therell be morean i know where the sept îles resolved out of the grey murkiness as he remembered them from the deck of teazer the only question now was whether to pass to seaward or take the inner channel he decided quickly south about lad he told the helmsman there was no point in crisp naval orders to an officerofthewatch in this vessel obediently the young seaman swung the tiller and bien heureuse headed into the channel under easy sail in the fluky northeasterly every man on eager lookout as guineas would go to him who first sighted their prey this time there was no gunfire from the old fortthey must appear as innocent as the salt trader they had once been as they passed through unnoticed kydd tugged his coat closer and sighed he was now a captain again even if it was of a jackal of the seas he was under no orders other than his own with nothing to do but fall upon any sail sighted no other purpose or distraction no convoys senior officers strict instructions this was what it was to prowl the seas as a singleminded predator no wonder the carefree life of a pirate in past ages had saaail screamed two men simultaneouslyor was that a seaman and a sharpeyed boy kydd swung up his glass eagerly as they emerged from the passage on the other side of sept îles he saw a threemasted lugger on the same course it had taken the deeper seaward route and they had met the other side not more than a mile or two apart his telescope told him that the vessel was larger than they and low in the watera full cargo a handful of men stood on deck no doubt filled with consternation at their sudden appearance the lugger held its course for minutes longer then curved sharply into the wind and made for the open sea go after him then kydd growled happily at the helmsman an exultant roar went up from the men busy at the ropes and bien heureuse heeled sharply the hunt was on clear away an give him a gun mr kevern the first would be unshotted and to weather the demand to heaveto the next would be a ball across the ships bows failing a response to this there would be a cannon shot low over the decks with an apologetic crack the ninepounder under reduced charge spoke out the rank odour of powder smoke nevertheless carrying aft its message of threat and challenge boarders mr tranter kydd warned in the event of resistance he wanted no delay in the manoeuvre to give their opponents time to rally the two ships stretched out over the sea leaving the lumpy grey islands to disappear into the rain astern with the pursuer straining every line and stitch of canvas to close with their prey as kydd watched he saw suddenly that the fleeing craft was falling off the wind then incredibly it was turning towards them rowan cursed and muttered that theres trois frères o st maloi should o known frenchy privateer a malouin he is that capn vicq an hes a tartar particular well manned n armed wed best helm up kydd roared to the startled man at the tiller t th triagoz it was a single near conical rocky islet ahead set in endless reefs but it was the only land in sightand down to leeward with a dispiriting wallow bien heureuse slewed about for the distant hillock and picked up speed kydd thought furiously the other was a larger ship and almost certainly more experienced and these were home waters for the malouin in these seas it had the edgewith superior numbers and firepower tranter came aft th bastards got us tides on the ebb an we cant hold y jabber kydd snarled he had just noticed that the wily vicq with his slight advantage of speed had eased away to parallel his run for the triagoz but was closing with every yard they could not strike for the open sea because vicq would be waiting there but on the other hand they were being pressed slowly but surely against the hostile land it was the same trick he had used on the cornish coast to box in another privateer to a rockbound coastbut this time he himself was the victim the deck fell quiet as each man took in the dire situation their captain was the only one who could save them now kydd had no illusions about vicq his initial move to flee had drawn kydd into betraying his true character as a privateer and further had lured him into the open sea now he had the patience to make sure of bien heureuse and win the bounty napoleon bonaparte had promised to any who could rid him of a detested english privateer by definition they could not prevail in an encounter at sea therefore they must keep in with the land he recalled his first sighting of the lugger low in the water without doubt this was the outset of a cruise for vicq with the ship full of prizecrew and stores kydd made his decision with their lesser draught the only course left to them was to head for the rocks and shallows under the coast to try to shake off the larger craft south he ordered into the embrace of the landenemy land once again bien heureuse bucketed round taking up on the larboard tack in a race for life and safety vicq conformed immediately and tucked himself in astern for the chase but when kydd reached the reefstrewn coast and swung cautiously away to the southwest vicq angled over at once to keep his clamping position to seawards close inshore the prospect was fearful granite crags deadly rocky islets emerging with the falling tideand everywhere the betraying surge of white from unseen subsea threats rowan was sent up the foremast in an improvised boatswains chair to try to spot imminent perils aheada trying task with the masts manic dipping and swaying in the following wind vicq remained at a distance passing on the outer side of the forbidding plateau de la méloine and allowing bien heureuse the inner passage in a chill of fear kydd saw why with the wind dead astern the only course was aheadand into the fivemile stretch of morlaix bay constrained to keep close inshore bien heureuse would need longer going round and with vicq taking a straight course to cross it there was only one outcome the two vessels would converge on the other side of the bay and kydds sole voyage as a privateer would be summarily finished he balled his fists it was not just the humiliation of craven surrenderfor he could not in all conscience consider a fight against superior odds with the crew he hadit was that the investors who had believed in him would now lose every farthing his ships company would be taken prisoner and as privateersmen had no hope of release and of course he would be among them he could reveal his true identity and claim the protection of his naval rank to be later exchanged but he knew bonaparte would make much of capturing a commander royal navy as captain of a privateer he could never suffer such dishonour to his service although he would not fight kydd was determined to resist capture with everything he had he fixed vicq with a terrible concentration noticing he was disdaining the shallows at the head of the bay this allowed kydd to weather a menacing central peninsula but it was only delaying the final act as they came to understand the meaning of the drama panicstricken local fishermen scattered they had obviously felt quite secure previously for at the end of the other side of the bay was roscoff where teazer had been cheated of her prize in less than a mile bien heureuse would reach the far side vicq was on an intercept course under the same wind from astern which would prevent kydds retreat the climax would occur close in off the ancient port in full view of the townsfolk and the gunboats sallying forth would put paid to any escape but the tide had been on the ebb for some time and kydd reasoned it must now be close to its lowest point roscoff harbour was therefore an expanse of mud so neither the gunboats nor any other could be a threat his spirits rose the bay finished in the sullen mass of the île de batz three miles long but so close to port that every approaching ship must pass warily round it if he could think of a way the harbour opened to view at the same time as vicq no more than a few hundred yards distant triumphantly fired a gun to weather kydd saw with a sinking heart that any channel between roscoff and the île de batz was lost in a desolate and impenetrable rockbound maze give im best mr kydd rowan said sadly ye did y damnedest for us mortification boiled in kydd he felt an insane urge to throw the ship on the reefs to rob vicq of his victory but this would be at the cost of lives it was time g rot ye for a chickenhearted scut came from behind kydd swung round to a flushfaced tranter who had clearly taken refuge in drink as the chase drew to its inevitable climax clap a stopper ont y useless shab kydd retorted or what sneered tranter were goin t rot in some frog chokey fr years thanks t you a dandyprat kings man as thinks hes one more word from ye an ill yere finished ill be takin no orders from you no more capn kydds pentup frustration exploded in a fist that felled the man to the deck in one at that moment a shaft of pale sunlight turned the dull grey seas ahead to green under the surface the black splotches of seaweed now could be seen streaming away from rocks that had lain hidden before and kydd saw his chance the waters of the great gulf of avranches were draining fast into the atlantic with the ebbbut the seaweed was not pointing straight ahead it was at an angle crossing their bow indicating that the current was not going round the île de batz but instead between it and the port racing into the confusion of crags and halftide islets between that had seemed so impassable take us in he roared nervously the hand at the tiller worked the vessel round the last rocks and committed bien heureuse to the hazard the current clutched at the lugger and whirled her forward distant shouts came from vicqs vessel but as kydd turned to see what the frenchman would do the vessel hauled out for the seaward side of the big island and disappeared clearly vicq had no desire to imperil his own ship but he was confirming too that kydd had stumbled on local knowledge of a channel between and was hastening round to trap him at the other end or was he kydds first instinct was to throw out an anchor and after a time double back the way they had come to freedom leaving a frustrated vicq to wait for them at the wrong end but what if the wily corsair had considered this and was at that moment hoveto ready for an unwary bien heureuse to track back into his arms or did he reason that kydd would know this and instead press forward distracted kydd noticed suddenly that the current was converging through scattered islets on a deeper but narrow passage close to the islandand it was carrying them along at a breathtaking pace if he had had any ideas of returning it would be much harder the farther he went in and now the tide had receded exposing vast rockstrewn sandbanks and beaches as they left roscoff to its somnolence there was no easy answer just an even chance that kydd would make the right choice put us in the lee o that bluff ahead he decided well stream a kedge b th stern the craggy cliffface protruding out from the island with crumbling ruins atop would serve as a temporary refuge and the ships bows would be in the right direction if vicq came after them so that they had to cut and run the small anchor splashed down and held roscoff was in plain view only a mile back but dried out was no threat and the lowering island was as far as he could see uninhabited they were safe but for how long get th boat in th waternow y lubbers vicq was on the other side of the island he would go and see for himself kydd swung over the side into the boat and took the oars get aboard jus you he told the seaman holding the painter nno not me the man muttered shrinking back be damned t ye kydd exploded i need someone t hold th boat y villain not a man moved anyone he bellowed stan aside y dogs shrilled a sailor from the group of men forward pushing through with a swagger im wi ye capn the boarding ended in an undignified tangle of arms and legs a cutlass clattering to the bottom boards pookie kydd hissed get out this instant y chuckleheaded looby but as the man with the painter saw his chance and let go the boat was taken by the current and slid away rapidly illill tan y hide pookie illill kydd said angrily tugging hard at the oars to bring the boat round a glance showed that too much time would be lost in a return so he pulled it round and headed in beyond two long islets there was a wide beach and he stroked furiously for it the boat grounded in the sand with a hiss and he scrambled out seize a hold on th painter he panted an if ye lets it float off illill slit y gizzard aye aye capn kydd pounded off along the beach until he found a way up to the scrubby top he stopped and looked back the figure at the boat was clutching the rope with both hands he shook his fist the child waved back jauntily a flock of goats scattered at his appearance and a young herdsman stared at kydd openmouthed as he raced past over the patchy ground to the opposite side bigod kydd gasped as he dropped down to look tucked in within a headland vicq was just coming to a light anchor his sails brailed and ready to loose kydd leaped to his feet and ran back the way he had come the goatherd still mesmerised by his antics his eyes sought out the boatand his heart nearly stopped it was still there but the little figure was surrounded by others faint shouts eddied up from the beach he ran down the sand yelling hoarsely at least they were not in uniform while their cries were no french that kydd could understand their meaning was plain the little soul they were shouting at held the boat firmly with one hand and was keeping them at bay with a ridiculously large pistol in the other kydd thrust past set the boat aswim turned it into the waves and scrambled in to take the oars get in y rascal he panted an fr gods sake be careful wi the pistol the child struggled over the gunwales and sat forward as kydd pulled hard out to sea didnt matter nohow it were empty no onell teach me how t load it will you mr kydd now look pookie kydd panted i thank ye fr th service but ifn ye they came up with bien heureuse and were pulled alongside while he clambered aboard kydd called to rowan hes waiting for us sure enough at the others grave expression he laughed so well disappoint cut th cable an run t th west ready facing the right way sail was loosed and wind and tide with them bien heureuse began to shoot through the tortuous channel to the open atlantic nearly overcome with relief kydd blurted out unthinking an see turner here gets a double tot the gobetween with the conspirators in paris arrived to meet dauvergne late that night le vicomte robert daché this is mr renzi my most trusted confidant the man was slightly built with shrewd cynical features with a polite smile dauvergne went on le vicomte is anxious that the shipment of arms is brought forward how does it proceed renzi the transport from england is delayed by foul winds renzi said smoothly sensing the real reason for the question was to reassure daché im sanguine that it shall be with us within the week sir four hundred tower muskets and one hundred thousand ball cartridge we lack only the destination setting in motion the requisition had been an interminable grind but allegedly the arms were at sea local arrangements must be made la planche guillemette sign and countersign le prince de gallesle roi bourbon very well sir as soon as i have word dauvergne smiled beatifically excellent renzi do escort le vicomte down to the privy stairs his boat awaits him there renzi attempted conversation on the way but tension radiated from a man well aware that he was about to reenter napoleonic france in circumstances that were the stuff of nightmares chapter far from showing resentment at his handling of tranter who was keeping sullenly out of the way the crew seemed to have settled kydd saw willing hands and respectful looks he lost no time in setting them to boarding practice it would be a humiliation not to say a calamity if they were to be repulsed through lack of discipline or skills he appointed calloway masteratarms in charge of practice and for an hour or two the decks resounded to the clash and clatter of blades while the ship stretched ever westward along a desolate coast kydds plan now was to put distance between him and vicq and at dawn be at the point where france ended its westward extent and turned sharply south into the bay of biscay this should be a prime lurking place all shipping from the south must turn the corner thereup from spain and portugal and even farther from the mediterranean and africa all converging on the channel at the same point there were disadvantages of course not far south was brest and therefore the british fleet on station few french would be willing to run the blockade and coastwise traffic would be wary but the pickings were better here than most shortly after three that afternoon they were given their chance as they lay portsall rocks abeam a ship passed into view from the grey haze on the starboard bow it firmed to an unremarkable squarerigged vessel that held its course to pass them a balt rowan said with certainty bluffbowed and rigged as a snow it certainly qualified but when bien heureuse threw out her colours as a signal to speak she held steady and hoisted the spanish flag a baltic spaniard kydd grunted i think not the vessel was near twice their size but its ponderous bulk rolling along would indicate neither a privateer nor a manowar calloway stood down his men and came aft thems spanish colours mr kydd he said aye we know are ye going t take him sir at first kydd did not answer this was so different from a war patrol in a kings ship when stopping a vessel with a row of guns at his back was so straightforward not so easy as that lad kydd said then came to a decision bear down on him gently mr rowan he ordered and the privateer leaned to the wind on a course to intercept mr calloway he said gravely youre t be a sea officer in time an ill always remember it was a hard enough beat t windd for me t hoist aboard how we takes a prize kydd glanced at the distant ship still holding her track let me give ye a course t steer as will see y through theres only one thing were after an thats evidence evidence aye m friend even y stoutest courage at the cannons mouth an the bravest o boardings wont stand unless we has th proof he regarded calloway seriously the richest ship we cn take will never make us a prize less th admiralty court says so an this theyll never do without we show em evidence as will convince th judge t condemn him as good prize aa judge mr kydd whats t be th crime an were talkin international law now kydd went on as all nations agree on now heres the crime the one if we bring evidence that hes an enemy o the crown the other if hes a neutral an hes found atradin with em thats all mr kydd thats allbut th devils in th detail m lad er yell be findin out soon never fear the heavily built merchant ship seemed resigned to her fate bracing aback her foreyards and slowing bien heureuse went around her stern to take position off her weather side and kydd cupped his hands bring to fr boarding if y please he hailed across the short stretch of water he turned to rowan ill board an take calloway as m notary with three hands t rummage th hold he said have a boardin party standin by t send across if i hail it was the usual arrangement when not expecting trouble their boat was in the water smartly and kydd eyed the vessel as they approached his experience in boarding was extensive but almost all in the mediterranean and overseas here the principles would be the same but the players different he had noted that the ship was the asturias as they rounded her stern her sides were worn but solid and she had the familiar sparse workaday reliability of a merchantman a ropeladder clattered down her sides he mounted nimbly and swung over on to her upper deck im kydd an i hold th letter o marque of a private cruiser he offered the paper to the greyhaired man he took to be the master it was ignored ill ask ye t submit to my examination sir he said evenly the ship smelled of the baltic an undertone of pine resin and a certain dankness which seemed to go with vessels from cold climes the man snapped orders at one of the men behind then met kydds eyes coldly i vill thenk you he replied tightly then added pedersen master yards were laid and sails doused to take the strain off the masts while the ship settled to wait lifting uneasily on the slight swell they took to the small saloon and after kydd and calloway were seated pedersen left to get the ships papers this was the living space for the officers here among the polished panels and brass lamps they would eat their meals exchange the comfortable gossip of the voyage to kydd their intrusion seemed an act of violation pedersen returned and slapped down a thick pack of papers sitting opposite he waited with barely concealed bitterness spanish flag kydd enquired mildly the master made much of riffling through the pile and finding the seabrief the attested proof of ownership he passed it across as far as kydd could see the title of the ship was vested in spanish owners trading with northern europe and as king george was as yet still in amity with spain this with a florid certificate of registry on cartagena entitled it to fly the spanish flag your muster roll captain as a naval officer kydd had by this means unmasked deserters and renegades among crews before now swedes several finns and other scandinaviansno danish spanish italian names some unpronounceable balkansthe usual bag for merchant ships in wartime nothing there he looked up at the master no englishmen then astray frm their duty pedersen returned his look stolidly nej so it was a neutral but this by no means disqualified it as a prize charter party pedersen found it and passed it over this was the contract for the freighting of the cargo and might reveal to kydd whether the owners or its destination was illegalwhich would make the cargo contraband and subject to seizure it was a voyage from bilbao to göteborg in sweden varying shippers each with an accompanying bill of lading and duly appearing on the manifest all apparently innocent of a french connection and most papers in spanish but some in swedish but such were the common practices and argot of the sea that there was little difficulty is making it out kydd had dealt with far more impenetrable moorish documents in the mediterranean watched by a wideeyed calloway he painstakingly compared dates and places even the smallest discrepancy could be exploited to reveal that the papers were false and therefore just reason to act he called for the mates book the practice in every country was that the first mate of a ship was responsible for stowing the cargo and maintaining a notebook of where each consignment was placed generally on the principle of first in last out against the bills of lading kydd now checked off their stowage for suspicious reversals of location while calloway jotted down their actual declaration for later conscious all the time of pedersens baleful glare kydd knew that under international law he was as entitled as any warship to stop and search a neutral and took his time but he spotted nothing port clearance this was vital clearing a port implied the vessel had satisfied the formalities in areas such as customs which demanded full details of cargo carried and next destination for the alert it could reveal whether there was an intention to call at another port before that declared as destination and perhaps other incriminating details it was however consistent a hardworking trader on his way from the neutral but unfriendly spain voyaging carefully through the sea battlefield that was the channel to the baltic before the ice set in no prize he wasnt going to let it go there was something was it pedersens truculence if he had the confidence of a clear conscience he would enjoy seeing kydds discomfiture sarcastically throw open the ship to him as other innocents had done before nohe would take it further id like t see yr freight captain be s good as t open yr hold sir pedersen frowned then after a slight hesitation he nodded ver well he got up heavily and they returned on deck while the master threw his orders at the wary crew kydd called calloway to him we see if what we find squares wi whats on the manifest he whispered check off yr detailsany consignment not on yr list hes t account for as its not come aboard frm some little frenchy port on the way or any as is missing murmured calloway which he couldve landed kydd chuckled aye yere catchin on m boy the thunderous cracking of timbers and goods working in the lanthornlit gloom and the dangerous squeeze down amid their powerful reek to the footwaling below did not deter the experienced quartermasters mate kydd had been and he clambered about without hesitation muslin and linen cased oranges spanish wine in barrels each was pointed out by the mate and accounted for kydds sharpeyed survey omitting no part of the hold no difficult corner nothing it was galling there was somethinghis instincts told him so but what there was no more time two ships lying stopped together might attract unwelcome visitors kydd was about to heave himself out of the hold when a glimmer of possibility made itself known he paused this would be one for renzibut he wasnt here slithering down again he worked his way back to the tightly packed wine barrels he held the lanthorn above one tinto de toro zamora was burnt crudely into its staves he sniffed deeply but all he could detect was the heavy odour of winesoaked wood on its own it was not enough but kydd suspected that inside the barrels was not cheap spanish wine but a rich french vintage he squirmed over to the casks closest to the ships side and found what he was looking fora weeping in one where it had been bruised in a seaway or mishandled he reached out then licked his finger sure enough the taste was indisputably the fine body of a bordeauxa médoc or other perhaps he was not the sure judge of wine that renzi was but certainly a cheap spanish table wine this was not and he could see how it had been done they had left bilbao with spanish wine on the books as a welcome export passed north along the french coast crept into a lonely creek and refilled the barrels before setting sail once more he had them exultant thoughts camethe most overwhelming being the vast amount the prize would bring with the sudden end of his immediate troubles but cooler considerations took hold the only evidence was his nose was this sufficient justification for him to bring his boarding party swarming over the bulwarks and taking the grave action of carrying the vessel into port the ships papers were in perfect order and any trace of a quick turnaside would be difficult to prove he returned to the saloon ships log he demanded kydd ignored pedersens thunderous look and flipped the dogeared pages he wanted to see the dates between sailing and rounding ushant it was scrawled in swedish but again the shared culture of the sea allowed him to piece together the sequence light airs from the south when leaving on the tenth veering to a fresh sevenknot southwesterly within the daybut not to fortyfive degrees north before another two days there kydd said stabbing at the entry seven knots on a fair wind an it takes ye three days to cover fifty leagues he snorted ifn it does then im a dutchman ye put in t bordeaux country an took a fill o frenchy wines as i cn prove below pedersens expression did not change ef wine are not spanish ze merchant iss cheatnot vorry for me he snapped an m time he went on frostily i lost by privateers inspect me there two time an may we see then yr certificates kydd shot back sarcastically these had to be issued by the examining vessel on clearing any vessels boarded that any subsequent boarding could be waivedand none had been shown to kydd before he began his inspection an theym be french pedersen came back with equally heavy sarcasm the french did not issue such certificates it was no good the man was lying through his teeth and had been trading with the enemy but he could not take the ship prize with this hanging over it at the very least there would be lengthy litigation which would cost his investors dearly he had to let it go at his desk the day wore on for renzi first there was the matter of the arms shipment it would arrive soon in a storeship to preserve secrecy it would be better to make rendezvous and transship at sea to the lesser vessel that would be making the dangerous run into france this would probably mean smoothing the offended sensibilities of the master and mate who would be expecting the formalities of clearing cargo in the usual way and the crew who would resent the need to open the hold and rig special tackles in an open seaway then there was the task of finding a vessel suitable for the final dash dauvergne had suggested employing a privateer as their season was drawing to a close and one might be tempted to an extra voyage they were well armed and not afraid of fighting if the need arose and of course had the carrying capacity but renzi had a naval officers healthy dislike of the breed it would mean haggling with nearpirates his attention turned to the details of the currency shipment this would be coming from england in a cutter and there would be no alternative to the flummery associated with the movement of bullion it would necessarily be taken aboard and signed for in the flagship then released upon signature into the delivering vesselit was the right of the captain of any naval vessel carrying bullion to claim a freight money percentage and did this apply to the flagship captain how were the receipt and delivery to be accounted for in a form acceptable to the treasury who would make the clandestine conveyance another privateer and all the while he worked on these details he knew desperate men were risking their lives wearily renzi picked up another sheet from the growing pile on his desk days passed the area was not proving as productive as kydd had hoped possibly the autumn weather was thinning the flow or another privateer at work in the vicinity might be frightening off their rightful prey it gave kydd time though to make another attempt on sea discipline but he quickly discovered that without welltested naval command structures in place it was really to no purposethere was no interlocking chain of responsibility linking the seaman on a gun through gun captains petty officers warrant officers and so on to the commanding officer such that at any point his will was communicated in ready understanding straight to that seaman but then he was finding that a merchant sailor was in some ways more independent and expected to perform his seamanlike functions on his own the shipowner would not outlay good money on layers of command that were only vital in the heat and stress of combat he had to make the best of it his was a merchant ship prettied up with a pair of ninepounders and guncrews of untrained amateurs enough to overawe small fry but if any showed real resistance he kept his thoughts to himself and focused on where to find that prey all too aware that every day without a return was draining capital kydd kept the deck from first light until darkand then their luck changed anchored overnight in the lee of a convenient sweep of rocky headland bien heureuse was greeted in the chill of the morning by the astonishing sight of another vessel no more than a few hundred yards away in the darkness it had unknowingly chosen the same shelter as they and was still firmly at anchor when it caught sight of themand the boat thrashing across that kydd had instantly in the water with rowan at the tiller it was hardly a ship more a low floating barge that was easily recognisable as a storeship for the brest dockyard as the boat drew close the crew abandoned their efforts to weigh anchor and hastily took to their own boat to escape ashore with satisfaction kydd watched rowan go alongside and board his men fanning out fore and aft on the deserted vessel he had only to select a prizemaster and crew and bien heureuse had one in the bag rowan returned quickly a prize t be sure dried fish n potatoes fr the garrison in brest no complications with papers and international law this was an enemy that was now rightfully theirs kydd sent tranter away as prizemaster glad to see the back of him the new captain wasted no time in hoisting sail for the run back to guernsey ribald shouts of encouragement echoing across the water kydds chest swelled their first prize turning his gaze to sea his eyes focused on a sail a good three miles away but an unforgivable lapse in lookouts whose attention had been diverted squarerigged she was hoveto and alone out to sea uneasy kydd sent for his glass as bien heureuse won her anchor a brigrig the workhorse of coastal shipping she could be anything but there was something then as he watched the ship got under way again laying over as she took the wind and he knew for a certainty that it was teazer it affected him deeply this sudden encounter with the ship hed loved his first command where he had experienced the joys insights and anxieties that went with the honour of being a captain and the one where rosalynd had never come aboard teazer had not seen where he slept never had the chance to he crushed the thoughts but when he lifted his telescope he found his eyes stinging and his glass not quite steady he forced himself to concentration as she altered her courseand headed inshore towards them kydd had no wish to make contact and snapped at rowan to hasten the unmooring but teazer arrived as they were getting under way her colours broke at the mizzen shrouds in unmistakable challenge and kydd had to decide to attempt a break to the east or await events luff up he ordered resigned to the inevitable teazer rounded to backing her fore topsail bring to im coming aboard of you captain it sounded like prosser with a speaking trumpet giving the same orders that he himself had used as it came closer kydd saw an officer in the sternsheets he stood back as the man came aboard it was prosser stiff in his new lieutenants uniform he looked about him importantly then stumbled in shock when he saw kydd i er ive been sent b commander standish t examine y vessel um mr kydd he said uncomfortably heres m letter o marque as ye can see its all in order kydd snorted the brailedup sails banged and slatted overhead impatiently prosser took it then looked up awkwardly he means y full paperswhere bound freight an i know what an examination means kydd said cuttingly i now need y reason why m vessel is bein detained after ive proved m business its not like that sir mr standish is hard on them who dont carry out his orders t satisfaction an he said then tell commander standish as im a private shipowar and may not be delayed in m tasking without good reason good day ltenant he stalked to the ships side prossers boat was bobbing off the quarter the men at their oars boats crew kydd roared and gave the straightarmed up and down signal of the naval order to come alongside a plump midshipman he did not recognise swivelled round in astonishment this instant damn yr eyes kydd added hesitating the young man gave the order and the boat came to hook on at the main channel the midshipman looking reproachfully at kydd and his officer by turns good day t ye mr prosser kydd said menacingly crimsonfaced the man swung over the bulwarks and barked at his men to shove off kydd saw the pinnace clear then ordered sail to be loosed and bien heureuse resumed her course he tried not to look astern but when he did it was to see teazer brace round and set out in chase the high crack of a bow gun fired to weather gave point to her hoist at the signal halliards heaveto immediately pointedly it was in the naval code which no strange merchant ship could be expected to know once again bien heureuse lay submissively to leeward teazer eased close alongside men at quarters next to their guns in plain sight let everything go by the run or i shall fire into you standish hailed from the quarterdeck his voice ringing with hauteur kydd bit out orders for the yards to be lowered and tried to keep his anger in check was the man showing off in front of his ships company or was it a deliberate attempt to belittle kydd in front of his men the two ships moved together in the long swell every detail of the lovely teazer before him the chesstree was set at such a rake that by so doing it cunningly led the tack clear of both the sheetanchor fluke and a nearby gunporthe hadnt noticed this before standing back he waited with arms folded the boarding party swung over the bulwarks and quickly spread out a petty officer and six with bared cutlasses then standish glorious in brandnew commanders gold lace and sword he took his time disdainfully inspecting the plain decks a glimmer of a smile at the single pair of ninepounders and a cursory glance aloft before he strolled over to kydd he did not remove his hat you failed to stop on my lawful order what is the meaning of this you sir have come aboard my vessel armed t th contempt of the law an custom o the sea whats th meanin o that standish blinked he had obviously forgotten that in the arcane practices of the sea it was quite in order to board with a party of men armed to the teethbut the officer in charge should never bear a weapon i may have omitted the observance in this instance sir but i do require an answer to my question several of the boarders dropped their eyes and shuffled in embarrassment an answer i hoveto in th first instance an the order was improper in the second kydd said tightly improper standish said languidly moving a few steps away and testing a downhaul i rather think not as i command a kings ship you shall obey my every order whether you like it or not that is the law kydd held his tongue how long would this charade continue lieutenant prosser was within his rights to demand your papers as well you know he went on and returned to stand arrogantly before kydd legs abrace he tells me you bear a letter of marque as a private ship any luck he asked casually th sport is thin kydd said thickly good cracked standish with a cruel smile then you wont miss a few men do you muster your crew on deck i shall press half i would think yell press my men kydd choked are you disputing my right to do so he was well within his rights prime privateersmen were a favourite target for the press in any form if any of your men have protections then in course they will be left to you he went on implacably do turn your men up more quickly mr kydd i really dont have time to waste with a terrible intensity kydd leaned forward have a care standish lay a hand on just one o my men an ill see ye standing afore admiral saumarez to explain yself standish recoiled you forget yourself kydd you no longer oh kydd replied then ill be glad t hear what yell be saying t th commanderinchief as ye tell him yeve decided t disobey his orders orders aye his written order that no nativeborn guernseymanas is his own countrymanshall be subject t th press an everyone aboard is as theyll swear standish blinked is this right sir james has never given me a written order to that effect kydd pulled himself erect then yell be tellin yr commanderinchief as ye havent had th time t hoist in his standin orders somewhere kydd had heard that a guernseyman had ancient privileges that allowed him to serve the duke of normandy rather than the english sovereign giving him theoretical protection from the press gang it was unlikely that saumarez would take kindly to any who trampled the rights of his proud bailiwickand who would be the one to argue very well mark my words mr kydd if this is your deceiving the next time i see you and er your private shipofwar i will strip you down to the cook do you hear he stalked to the ships side and signalled to his boat impassively kydd watched him leave when the boat was halfway a fullthroated shout came from forward in teazer god save ye as a good un mr kydd stirks shout was taken up in a roar of others standish leaped to his feet in outrage the boat swaying perilously seize that man in irons he yelled and stop your cackle instantlyd you hear me you mumping roguesor ill see the whole lot of you up before me kydd gave a wry smile loose sail mr rowan lets be away chapter the sport was thin days later of three encounters only one had proved fruitful a tiny but voluble portuguese with a freight of slab cork that could only have one destination in this part of the world and time was getting short kydds hopes of wealth were disappearing fast still he had learned much of the privateering trade and could see that given certain advantages in the future there was every chance of succeeding in a handsome way there would be changes on the next voyage he would see to it bien heureuse returned to st peter port in the tail end of an autumn gale but the great road lay as a welcome triangle of calm away from the port shielding it from the battering of the southwesterly and the little privateer finally lay at rest alongside the pier kydd made his way smugly to robidous rickety topfloor office to receive an appreciation for a good start in the privateering business and to learn when he was to receive his share of the proceeds robidou told him gruffly to wait while he dealt with his clerk and kydd contented himself with the fine view over the harbour including his two prizes the clerk was then sent away and with a cold look he was bade to sit it unsettled kyddhe had expected a warmer welcome besides he wanted to get away to tell his theatrical friends of his adventures yeve disappointed me sir robidou began heavily kydds heart sank m investors did expect much moren ye found for em he went on remorselessly i told em as ye was th proven article as an active an enterprisin privateersman kydds hackles rose only a couple o weeks at sea an two prizes on m first voyage two prizes robidou said acidly th first a storeship wi dried fish an potatoeshow d ye expect me t place such a cargo on the market potatoes when we has our own jerseys that knocks such into a cocked hat an dried fish as is only fit fr soldiers the ship kydd tried a storeship worthless none wants a slabsided scow as is built t supply an army no sir this is no prize worth the name face burning kydd said tightly th portugueea freight o cork as can only be bound fr the french wine ports robidou sighed hes worse ill agree it cn only be fr the french but the master is savvy an knows its no use t us we dont make wine so he protests th capture in course we must go to t litigation in an admiralty court but this takes a mort o timeand fees ifn we win its only cork we has not worth a brummagem hapenny a bushel the ship contemptible an we cant cover the fees we have t let him go kydd bit his lip can we not we lets him go an must pay him demurrage fr the delay t his voyage a sum fr his extra vittlin harbour dues t st peter port fr his moorinan if were not lucky hell lodge an affidavit with his consul claimin consequential damages no sir yeve not had a good voyage shaken kydd realised that without any return from prizes the voyage was a failure and the investors had not merely lost their outlay but were faced with liability for heavy unforeseen payments to the portuguese er im sure th next voyagell be capital um ive learned much as will mr kydd when th investors hear o yoursuccess i wouldnt hold mself ready fr a next voyage good day t ye sir three days later the venture meeting was brief and robidou had news for kydd when he returned the following morning sir i have t tell ye th investors did not see their way clear t renewing an interest in a privateer voyage by any means it was expected but it stung all the same if yell attend on me just fr a few hours well finalise th books an then youll be free t go with the paperwork complete kydd left unemployed once more why tom m dear rosie discarded her sewing excitedly and ran to meet kydd throwing her arms round him with a kiss youre back on land do tell me yr adventuresdid you seize any treasure ships atall her eyes were wide in expectancy but she frowned when she saw kydds long face isis something wrong no treasure rosie jus two prizes as are t be despised im told he sprawled morosely in an armchair an they dont see fit t give me another voyage oh so kydd looked at her with affection so it means dear rosie theres nothing more i cn do that was the nub of it really he could return to being a stagehand and eke out a few more weeks of existence but to what end im t go back t england now he sighed twas a good plan but im not yr naturalborn corsair id have t say now a wave of depression came but at least he could console himself that he had given it his best try dont leave now rosie said stricken you will find the wicked dog as did y wrong i know it kydd smiled im beholden t ye all for y kindness but ill not be a burden any more i have t leave please dont tom she pleaded give it just a few more weeks an then no end o th week rosie with dull eyes renzi took in a report by one broyeur who was responsible for their security at the jersey terminus detailing actions and observations as they pertained to counterespionage endless lines of trailing this or that suspect suggestive phrases in purloined letters rumoursand then one word caught his eye stofflet it was followed by a short entry per order friday last drownedno marks the epitaph of a kindly man who had renzis eyes stung rushing in came the memory of the little bald baker taking pity on a hungry stranger and finding a tasty loaf which renzi had gratefully devoured he would no longer serve his ovens or see his little ones and now where was pity where was the humanity with a catch in his throat he felt control slipping why could not logic preserve him from the stern consequences of its own imperatives he staggered to his feet sending the table and its papers crashing to one side urgently seeking open air he was soon out on the battlements breathing raggedly his fists clenched as he sought the sombre night horizon the salty air buffeted his face bringing with it a sensory shock the spasm passed but left him troubled and destabilised since his youth he had found reason and logic a sure shield against the world but now it had turned on him what was left to him without the comfort of its certainties sleep came finally to claim him but in the early hours he was dragged to consciousness by a disturbanceshouts dauvergnes urgent retort men in the passageway he flung on a coat and hurried there it was daché trembling with fatigue sprawled in a chair and retching his side bloodsoaked to the waist go fetch a doctor dauvergne threw at the men standing about uncertainly the rest get out daché had risked everything in bringing his message to mont orgueil such was its urgency dauvergne he said weakly listen to me wewe have a crisis he slumped in pain then rallied his eyes feverish paristhey wont rise up unless they have an unconditional assurance that the british will play their part he coughed and the consequent pain doubled him over until it was spent you must understand bonaparte suspects something the country is alive with soldiers it is very dangerous the chouans sense treachery that as soon as once they raised the banner made their throw they were marked men and if the plot failed napoleons revenge would be terrible all the more reason to fear that england the old enemy might play them false the last moves will be the most critical daché resumed shaking with pain and emotion if anything goes wrong it will be most tragic dauvergne nodded the frenzied dash with their prisoner through the dark countryside forces closing in on all sides the final frantic arrival at the coastand the royal navy not there to receive them into safety he could see it must be their worst imagining they wish a binding commitment of some sort he asked a written statement of late date under signature of a high officer of state nothing less apparently than a document proving the complicity of england in the plot very well you shall have it dauvergne said calmly he paused and i shall deliver it no daché said hoarsely you are known youll have no chance dauvergne had been imprisoned on trumpedup charges once in paris during the brief peace and only been released reluctantly after considerable diplomatic pressure from westminster yet if things stalled now inertia would set in causing the whole to crumble without hope of recovery as if in a dream renzi heard himself say i shall take it to them it was logical the situation was desperate he knew of the plot he could speak knowledgeably of the dispositions andand he would be dispensable in the eyes of the government you gasped daché they dont know you theyll think you a spy the irony was not wasted on renzi who gave a halfsmile dauvergne frowned my dear renzi do reflect on your situation you would have the most compromising document in christendom on your person that most certainly would incriminate your government if threatened your only honourable course would be toto so who then will be your emissary renzi challenged there was no reply i shall require a form of password an expression of authentication as it were and early on the thursday morning a knock at the door caught them by surprise as the only one fully dressed at that hour kydd answered a messenger held out a letter mr kydds residence he asked favour o mr vauvert rosie squealed in anticipation and rushed over her attire forgotten kydd broke the seal it was a curt note from vauvert indicating that if he wished to hear something to his advantage he should be at the three crowns tavern at four promptly rosie clapped and snatched the message from kydd to your advantage tom she cried i knew something would come kydd did not reply it was obvious he was going to be asked to run contraband as a smuggler no doubt this vauvert was extracting a fee from a business associate for introducing him well damn it he would disappoint them both what will you wear love rosie enthused it could be a swell cove taking you t see his friends he paused there was just the tiniest chance that it was something elsebut the cold tone of the note fitted that of a businessman holding him at arms length while he was handed along to another nothin special rosie ifn they cant take me as i come then the three crowns was a spacious and wellappointed inn liberally endowed with snug rooms and discreet alcoves with highbacked chairs for those inclined to serious conversation kydd entered diffidently fingering the single florin in his pocket which was all he could bring himself to accept from mojo he hoped that his mysterious visitor would not expect more than a nip of ale a few faces turned curiously but he stared ahead defensively and was left alone soon after four the figure of a gentleman in an oldfashioned wig appeared at the door looking in hesitantly he seemed distantly familiar and kydd rose the man hurried over i thank you for seeing me mr kydd he said in an oddly soft voice for a moment he was caught offbalance then it came to him this was zephaniah job whom he had once arrested in polperro as a smuggler and then been forced to release by higher authority im to tell you how very sorry i am to have heard about your rosalynd such a sweet child and to be lost to the world so suddenly kydd gulped a memory catching him unawares with its intensity yes sir i wasmuch affected he turned away so that job would not catch his expression and willed himself back to the present he realised he shouldnt be surprised to see job there for he was a sagacious businessman with interests in all things profitablehe even printed his own banknotes kydd recalled that guernsey was the main place of supply for jobs many smuggling enterprises now he was going to be offered a position operating against his own colleagues by the man he had previously taken in charge for doing just that job gave a polite smile i heard of your privateering voyage just concluded mr kydd my sympathy on meeting with such poor fortune thank ye kydd said he was damned if job was going to get a beer out of his precious florin now you seem in need of some cheer if i might make boldwill you allow me to press you to join me in a jorum of their finest er maybe i will kydd said warily very well job said after the jug was set in train let me go directly to the head of the matter i heard about your recent voyage from a common acquaintance and besides something of your history while here and im sanguine youll hear me out if i make you a proposition go on he was in no hurryhe might as well listen to what the man had to say im a man of business not a mariner but i confess i was somewhat surprised when i learned that having taken on the calling of privateer you were unable to make a success of it kydd gave an illnatured grunt but let him continue therefore knowing of your undoubted qualities i made query as to the details and it seems my surmise was correct for reasons best known to the investors you were constrained to confine your attentions to the small fry coastal traders and the like i will speak frankly to me this is not the best exploitation of your talentsspeaking as a businessman of course now i was too late to take shares in your last venture but i have a mind to consider doing so in the future should the arrangements be more to my way of thinking mr job thats all very well but i have t say ive been told theres t be no second voyage for me job paused to refill kydds glass this is then my proposition to you should you feel a bluewater cruise in the western ocean to meet the trade from the west indies and south would better answer i will invest in you despite himself kydds hopes rose there was no reason to believe job would waste his time in impossibilities this sounds interestin mr job but i cn see a mort o problems there was so much to overcome a deepsea venture was an altogether largerscale enterprise much more costlyand many times the risk im no stranger to privateering you may believe job said smoothly i find the chief objective is to secure a captain of daring and acumen the second to ensure he has the ship and men he needs to perform his task this is essential and must always stand above considerations of expense spoiling the ship for a haporth of tar is false economy so by not sparing the quality of ship and man the enterprise does maximise its chances an increases th capital risk kydd said it does but those considerations you should leave to the prudent investor who you can be sure does take full measure of his exposure he went on for myself i will increase my own determination in the venture by one simple means i intend to take the majority shareholding sir i cn see how this might be of advantage t me might i correct you in the particulars sir i do this not for you but in the cause of profit and gain to accrue to myself i would not do it unless i saw due opportunity and having witnessed at the first hand your daring and clear thinking when you apprehended the pirate villain bloody jacques then its my estimation that the investment is as sound as any now open to me go on besides which job continued i will naturally take reasonable measures to safeguard my position the first of which is to state that i will in no wise set to hazard my capital without i have a formal proposal from yourself this shall include details of your intended cruising grounds particulars of the vessel you desire to employ the crew consequential on its size the length of voyageall the usual considerations in matters of this kind which im sure you understandand each most carefully costed kydd held his elation in check then you shall be the armateur by no means sir there are many such available in guernsey i shall be content to remain chief investor should your proposal prove acceptable playfully kydd added an if i find such will be sufficiently advantageous as will allow me t delay my return to england blinking job leaned forward return to sir that would be to discard a particularly fine business opportunity surely you wouldnt kydd saw his moment ive had m taste of privateerin an if i was t consider another cruise theres t be changes oh y mentioned therell be no spoilin th ship fr a haporth o tar is this t mean i can select a ship of size as can go up against a big indiaman man t man ah yes this is the very point that encourages me in the whole business as you will allow a fivehundred or thousandton vessel is an extremely expensive proposition to set aswim with you as captain however a more modestsized craft might well be manoeuvred with daring and resource to achieve what in lesser hands would certainly require a larger youll grant me mr job that a grand martinicoman will never strike t a squiddy cutter an must always resist i should need m choice o armaments of course an men enough t swarm aboard when th time comes undoubtedly articles ill draw up mself of a character as will grant me full powers o discipline im sure that will be possible i say where we cruise as long as it is a bluewater venture im certain that will be acceptable the usual clause runs something like shall cruise in waters to the west to take such ships as you shall fall in with or similar well that could be agreeable kydd mused rubbing his chin if you should decide to take this up job said earnestly then news of my firm and sizeable commitment will of a surety excite interest and speculation that will not leave us shy of subscribers to follow in the enterprise aye i see that west of the azores is a famous place for deepwater privateering mr kydd those of an age will recall talbot of the prince frederick in those waters taking two spanish in fine style from bristol to london the bullion took fortyfive armed wagons to send it safely to the tower of london well can i expect your proposal kydd beamed aye ye can mr job he needed a brisk walk along the foreshore to regain his equilibrium while he contemplated the sudden change in his prospects he had another chancecould he make a success of it there was rich trade coming in from the atlantic but the french were canny and made much use of neutral bottoms their allies were largely driven from the seas as well while the other ships plying the trade routes would be sure to have a vexatious quantity of protective documents the fabulous spanish treasure ships were offlimits with the peace still holding and while there were multitudes of ships afloat there were millions of square miles of open sea but an ocean cruise was a different game altogether from his earlier foray into privateering a single fat caribbean trader in sugar could repay their outlay many times over two could make him rich or none couldhe cut short his doubts this was an opportunity he would take with both hands all or nothing however the proposal needed expertise he did not have finely judged costing arguments that he would later have to live with mr kydd robidou grunted in astonishment what can i do for ye if its about yr settlement then ill tell you no mr robidou its about what i can do fr you kydd knew his man and got to the point straight talking no tacking and veering simply that if he was given assistance with a proposal he would see to it that robidou was appointed armateur for the venture the name of zephaniah job was sufficient to get him a fair hearing and kydd found himself back in the three crowns tavern he ransacked robidous experience the best area for serious cruising was indeed beyond the azoresclose enough to be at a reasonable sailing distance and far enough that receiving convoys and their escorts would not have formed up there was stirring talk of cargoes sugar coffee cotton inboundand outbound exotics like mercury destined for the mines luxury items for the colonies bullion and their chances french batavian ligurian all for the taking but ready for a fight and disinclined to heaveto at the order of one half their size the discussion turned to their ship kydds instinct was for the manoeuvrability of square rig but with the high pointing of fore and aft both men agreed on the type of vessel that best fitted the description a topsail schooner robidou knew of one just laid up for the winter as soon as kydd clapped eyes on the witch of sarnia he knew he had to have her she had been designed and built on speculation as a privateer with a finelined hull that took no account of any need for cavernous cargo holds low and rakish there was no mistaking her purpose but an innocent approach would not be practical with wary deepwater merchantmen and sailing qualities alone would decide the issue she was recently out of the water propped at the top of the slip and kydd walked slowly round her taking in the tight seams true curves and obviously new construction this was a sound wellbuilt and altogether convincing craft as a privateer his pulse quickened a ropeladder hung over her neat stern and kydd hauled himself aboard with most of her gear stored and decks clear of ropes it was possible to take in her sweet lines leading forward to a bowsprit fully half as long again as the main hull as she was bigger than bien heureuse his cabin was roomier narrow but longer there were two cabins a side for officers and a pleasant saloon which would later double as an examining place forward a modest hold was followed by a magazine and store cabins a galley well and finely contrived crew accommodation it was impressive as unlike bien heureuse as it was possible to be including limewood panelling below and herringbone decking above her hull was a wicked black not from tarred sides but fine enamelling and with a compelling urgency in her coppered underwater lines the witch gave an overwhelming impression of a thoroughbred predator robidou looked pleased at kydds evident approval but cautioned thisn is goin t be a pretty penny mr kydd i knows janvrin and hes not agoin t let this sweet thing go for a song the costing began although prepared for a bigger outlay than there had been with bien heureuse kydd was shocked as the sum mounted and robidous eyebrows rose and because it was virtually certain that they would have to fight for their prey there was the expensive question of armament a warship had to be equipped to engage in any number of modes shiptoship broadsides a cutting out repelling an aggressive boarding a shore landingbut for kydd there would be only one the subduing of a larger ship followed by an unstoppable boarding and unlike in a manowar defensive fire was not required if the tide turned against them the slimlined schooners response would be to turn and flee unworried by notions of honour that would have them stay to fight it out a gundeck and rows of cannon were not in contemplation instead it would be closequarter weapons swivel guns a carronade or two capable of blasting a sheet of musketballs across the deck and of course cutlasses and a pistol for every boarder halfpikes and tomahawks were to be carried by some to intimidate and among the coolheaded he would distribute grenadoestwo pounds of lethal iron ball packed with gunpowder and a lighted fusee to hurl on the opposing deck and he could see how the topsail crojack could be made to do service with stinkpots devices filled with evilsmelling combustibles in all this the object was to spread fire and fear but without causing damage to a future prize fitting out manning storingwithout robidous head for figures it would have been impossible more work on the inevitable fees allowances and imposts and suddenly it was finished the proposal was made ready checked and sent in an answer came back with startling promptness a venture association was being convened immediately on the basis of their proposal and mr robidou would be invited to act as armateur it was extraordinary and wonderfulkydd was a captain once more his exhilaration however was tempered by the fact that this was going to be all or nothing if he failed to deliver a prize he was most certainly finished everywhere the witch of sarnia was towed to havelet bay for fitting out and in the whirlwind of activity kydd slept aboard and bore a hand himself on turning a deadeye here stropping a block there then it became time to consider his ships company robidou had good advice should ye want t have a tight crew as will keep loyalty id find a right hardhorse mate an trust him t find his own men theyll owe him an hell owe you so theyll fight th barky like good uns ye have an idea o who as it happened robidou did the lieutenant on his own last cruise as a privateer one henry cheslyn they met at the boat slip robidou had been at some pains to prepare kydd but the sight of the man took him aback cheslyn was powerfully built with a massive leonine head and full beard and had a deepsea roll as he walked near twenty years kydds senior he had closed fierce features and flinty eyes in a searuddy face mr cheslyn kydd acknowledged what could he say to one so much older and so much more experienced whom he expected to take his orders unquestioned they stood regarding one another until cheslyn spoke capn robidou says as yere no strutnoddy he said truculently in a deepchested voice an he reckons yere sharp but yez a kings manever bin in a merchant hooker bluewater like aye said kydd evenly an a gallows sight furthern you id wager robidou cut in apprehensively mr kydd took a convict ship t botany bay in the peace henry cheslyn ignored him says yeve odd notions o disciplineyou aint athinkin o goin navy he grunted sourly mr cheslyn im t be captain o the witch shes in the trade o reprisal im in the business o finding mself a sack o guineas an anything or anyone goes athwart m bows in that is goin t clew up fishmeat so theres no misunderstandin im writin down m expectations in th articles fr all t sign an the one whos t be m first ltenant will be in no doubt where i stand mr kydd knows men robidou interjected firmly as he started a common foremast jack yell know aye well ill think on it cheslyn said with a last piercing look at kydd before he stumped away a hard man robidou sighed yell need t steer small with himbut ill tell ye now hes bright in his nauticals an a right mauler in a fight if y makes him mate yell have no trouble with y crew within three days cheslyn had assembled a core of hardened wolfish seamen all of whom it seemed were capable privateersmen of his long acquaintance they packed kydds rendezvous taking his measure silently this was not a time for fancy speeches kydd spoke to them of caribbean wealth and south american treasure of a mighty ocean but a wellfound ship shipmates and courage spirit and discipline any who would go aroving with him might return with a fistful of cobbs but must sign kydds articles and take his orders without a word he finished the room broke into a hubbub of excited talk s wholl be first t sign fr an ocean cruise in th saucy witch he roared above the noise they crushed forward cheslyn elbowing his way to the front he raised his eyes once to kydd then bent to the book and scrawled awkwardly mate an first ltenant kydd called loudly an be s good as t introduce me to yr men mr cheslyn for his officers he had brought the oneeyed le cocq as his second a short man but reputed fearless gostling an experienced prizemaster was third kydd was surprised when rosco the boatswain of bien heureuse fronted at the table y has yr chance now mr kydd he rumbled and scratched his name an i wants a piece of it he said forcefully with rosco as boatswain and a coldeyed mariner perchard the gunner he was well on the way to complementand then luke calloway entered pale but resolute he stood before kydd id wish t be wi ye sir how the young man had heard of the venture he had no idearumours must be flying in st peter port about this lateseason cruise into the atlantic ah theres a berth if ye want it mr calloway kydd said but i have t tell ye this is not yr regulargoin cruise well be up against th big ones asll object t being taken by a pawky schooner an will want t give us a right pepperin this was not the real reason the men he would have aboard were a callous pugnacious crew and young calloway would be hard put to handle them sir iid want t ship out if y please er luke if its pewter yere lackin then able seaman afore th mast would suit main well mr kydd kydd nodded and threw open the book for signing ironically calloway would probably succeed better at that level without the need to assert himself over the hard characters in the crew and his seamans skills were second to none it was time for the final act send in th boys he called to the door instantly the room was filled with an urgent press of youngsters eager to ship out in the witch of sarnia the talk of the town one fought to the fore and stood proudly and expectantly before him kydds heart fell at the sight of pookie turner no it wont do he said sadly its an ocean voyage an i cant the young face set capn y knows i i cant an ye knows why kydd looked pointedly at the eager boy behind at the end of the day kydd sat back satisfied these were a dissimilar breed of men to the coastal privateers of his previous experience tough competent and professional deepsea sailors of one mindthe ruthless pursuit of prey and profit this alone would make it an altogether different experience all he had to do was put them in the way of what they desired and they would follow him youre a blackhearted villain rosie taunted him hearing of pookies attempt to sign on cant you understand she wants adventure and excitement before the mast captain just like you do shame on you rosie im never before th mast in witch and ill have y know this is an ocean voyage wi a crew o right cutthroats as any ive seen its not right an proper fr a young y have ships boys to do mens work so if pookie wants to be a boy why cant she be make her y cabinboy to keep her under eye if you have to but i dont think shell need any o your protectin kydd thought wryly of her prowess over the other boys with her fists while rosie went on warmly besides if you dont take her shell be back on the streets up to her old tricks and dont forget her share of the booty wont this help her poor mama its too late betimes rosie ive closed books an we sail on th tide tomorrow forenoon shes a game un shell find something else he added lamely it was a day of autumn overcast with a brisk wind that fluttered dresses and tugged at hats as witch of sarnia made ready for sea a crowd had come to see the smart privateer that was reputedly making a daring foray into the atlantic ocean on which much guernsey money was riding they lined the quay gentlemen and ladies quantities of curious wharfloafers and the odd redcoat soldier with his woman robidou appeared and pushed through the crowd waving what seemed to be a book just been published he shouted against the excitement passing it to kydd someone gave it me fr interest but i think ye should have it kydd yelled back his thanks but there would be precious little time for books stand by forard he bawled as they began to single up the lines his eye was caught by a lone figure standing apart from the others with a grin he recognised pookie who no doubt had come down hoping for a lastminute change of heartso with an exaggerated beckoning the witch of sarnias crew was complete the delighted youngster threw a small bundle aboard grabbed a rope twirled round and landed lightly on the deck with a huge smile departure was easy enough in the southerly sail mounted quickly as lines were let go and hauled in and water opened up between ship and quay with cheslyn by kydds side in wellworn sea gear hard men efficiently handing along tackle falls and overhead the crack and slap of a topsail spreading along its boom the schooner made for the twin piers at the entrance a knot of spectators on the very end waved gaily and as they passed close on their way to the open sea the group broke into whooping and shouts a firework whizzed skywards and another followed kydd was touched his theatrical friends were not allowing him to seek his fortune on the vasty deep without due ceremony he waved back energetically which would have produced expressions of horror on teazers quarterdeck kind in em to see us on our way he murmured to cheslyn who had looked at him askance but kydd feeling the witch heel as she took the wind at the harbour entrance eagerly seeking the freedom of the open sea was letting nothing spoil his happiness of the moment they passed between the vessels anchored in the great road each with decks lined with interested sailors watching the privateer head outkydd knew that the witchs fine lines would be attracting admiration while her sleek and deadly black form would leave no doubt as to her mission through the little russel and leaving the shelter of herm they met long seascombers urged up on the lengthy swell by a brisk westerly from the deep atlantic kydd and robidou had taken the witch out earlier with a skeleton crew to try her mettle and with one or two changes to the set of her sails he was satisfied and confident in her seakeeping he had discovered that witch of sarnia had completed only one voyage previously and that a poor one under an overcautious captain but he would take full advantage of her qualitieshe would have to if she was to have any chance of closing quickly with a prey his crew were hardbitten enough but would they follow into the teeth of a larger crew intent on repelling boarders as he knew a manowars men would could he saaail the cry came at the sudden emergence of a sizeable ship from beyond the pointand directly athwart their path it took no more than a heartbeat to realise that the noble lines belonged to hms teazer kydd guessed that standish had been waiting for him hearing of kydds atlantic mission he had positioned himself ready for where he must come and was up to some sort of mischief yell ware shes a kings ship cheslyn muttered pointedly aye said kydd evenly watching as teazer laid her course to intercept them he was in no mood for standishs posturing and gave orders that had witch wheeling about and heading away downwind mounting the backs of the combers before falling into the trough following in a series of uncomfortable sliding and jerks what d ye do that for cheslyn spluttered hes a brig an we can point higher b gob it was truethe schooner had had every chance of slipping past by clawing closer to the wind but kydd had seen something an what does thisn mean cheslyn growled as if yere of a mind t id thank ye t keep a civil tongue in y head retorted kydd carefully sighting ahead if this was going to work he would need everything he had learned of the frightful rocks about them be damned yere losin y westin by th hourthis aint how to kydd turned and smiled cynically beyond teazer was another harpy summoned by the signal flags he had spotted so obviously in place to swoop if they had tried to slip by cheslyn had the grace to redden and kept quiet as kydd made his estimations astern the two brigsloops were streaming along in grand style shaking out yet more sail with the wind directly behind them the foreandaft rig advantage of the witch however was now lost to him and with the brigs far greater sail area spread to the wind the end seemed inevitable along the deck worried faces turned aft if standish had the press warrants in a short time any not nativeborn could find himself immured in a kings ship for years ahead was a roil of white which was the halftide reef of the platte fougère kydd stood quietly watching it carefully his eye straying back to the two warships willing them on then at the right moment he rapped down helmsheet in hard pitching deeply the witch came slewing round to larboard men scrabbling for purchase with bare feet as they won the sheets in a furious overhand haul the schooner took up immediately at right angles to her previous course now broadside to wind and waves in a dizzying rollbut she was passing the reef to its leeward kydd grinned he knew teazers limits and there was no way she could brace round as quickly when she cleared the reef watching her thrashing along dead astern kydd decided it was time to end the charade eyeing the jagged black islets of the grandes brayes farther on the bow he sniffed the wind for its precise direction stand by t go about mr cheslyn this time there was no argument and the man stumped off bellowing his orders kydd thanked his stars for an experienced crew what he was contemplating was not for the faint of heart rapidly assuring himself once again of the exact relative position of the islets reef and the winds eye he gave the order to go about witch of sarnia did not hesitate she pirouetted to the other tack and took up quickly passing into the fewhundredyardswide channel between reef and isletsand thrashing into the teeth of the wind where no squarerigger could go with a pang for his old command kydd saw teazer left far astern as the witch energetically made the north tip of guernsey and round it was done they had won the open atlantic and the rest was up to him the low lines of the privateer meant exhilarating going but there was a price to pay very soon kydd found his new command was going to be a wet ship knifing through the waves instead of soaring over them with every second or third roller the decks were thoroughly sluiced but the witch lived up to her name it was remarkable how close she held to the wind and her square sail aloft gave added impetus and at the same time a degree of manoeuvrability that required fewer men for the same tasks than a sloop the vessel type had originated in england but it was the americans who had termed it a schooner and taken it as their own adding special features from his time on the north american station kydd recognised the deeply roached topsail that allowed it to clear the rigging the lead of the schooner stay that was like a shroud moved forward easing pressure on the foremast to spread an expansive fore staysail engrossed in becoming acquainted with his lady he failed at first to notice cheslyn next to him goes like a witch dont ye think he offered but the mans features remained stony and an expressionless le cocq stood with him this time o year after th equinoctials gets chancy the big man said cautiously bsides the glass is still droppin kydd looked at him in surprise why if i didnt know th better id have t say m first ltenants gone qualmish cheslyn reddened the witch aint built fr heavy weather an that theres no ladys puff he gestured at the lowlying darkgrey cloud masses across their path a squall or two ill grant ye but this is only y regulargoin western ocean blash kydd had seen the atlantic at its worst and this was no threat at the moment im t raise flores in five days mr cheslyn do y like it or no if the wind stayed steady from the west they could do this even earlier in one slant to the southsouthwest and then they would be at their cruising ground he turned and left for his cabin the prospect of rest suddenly enticing he closed the door firmly it was not a big cabina high bunk over drawers on one side a working desk with lamp the other and a neat diningtable at the after end mercifully there was a skylight above with a compass repeat farther forward he ripped off his spraysoaked coat and boots let them drop carelessly heaved himself into his bunk and closed his eyes the witch was closehauled and had an angle of heel that could be alarming on first meeting but he wedged himself in familiarly and let the sounds of the sea wash past him reaching ever westwards into the vastness of the atlantic involved an endless repetition of a sudden crunch from the bows followed by a defiant rapid upwards lift then an eager long glide downward and forward the hiss of their way quite audible through the hull weariness laid its hand on him and thoughts crowded in but one in particular would not let go unless he succeeded this was going to be the very last voyage he would make as a captain neither the navy nor others would ever offer him employment again a double wave thumped the bows and the schooner lost her stride with an affronted wiggle which dislodged robidous book in the bedside rack it fell into his bunk kydd sat up and opened the little volume thomas hartwell horne a compendium he leafed through it was an exposition in clear english of the prize law of in the form of a handbook of guidance to privateers and shipsofwar and it had been published by clarke of portugal street this very year one stout passage caught his eye lawful force may be used to enforce a boarding it being assumed a vessel cannot be proved innocent otherwise contumacious resistance to fair inquiry is evidence of guilt in law to be followed by just confiscation so if any objected to his boarding whatever the circumstances he had the whole force of the law at his back and whatever else there was in this little treasure as he addressed himself to the task of teasing out the practical meanings of the legal rules he barely noticed a tiny knock at the door it was repeated unsteadily come he called loudly it was pookie gamely passing hand to hand in the lively motion with a small cloth bundle ssir mr purvis says as how th fire aint lit but wonders if thisn will do it was cuts of cold meat cheese and bread itll do fine younker the little figure had a pale face and kydd felt for the effort it must have cost to come below where there was no horizon to steady senses thrown awry by the relentless heave and jerking noleave that ill do it he protested when his carelessly cast aside wet gear was painfully but tidily stowed in the sidelocker compliments t th officer o th deck he added an because ye have the youngest eyes in th ship yere t be lookout fr prizes o course the child looked up gratefully and scuttled out kydd resumed his book munching hungrily on the cold victuals but he soon noticed a definite change in the rhythm of the vessel a sulky twist after each lift he frowned and glanced up at the compass repeat northwest be damned to it he slipped out of his bunk grabbed his grego and made the upper deck mr cheslyn whats th meaning of ive taken in reefs an were headin fr shelter in falmouth he said truculently against the bluster of the wind yeve abandoned course kydd burst out in amazement an without s much as a byyleave it was a near treasonable offence in the navy take a look fr yself cheslyn said heated pointing at the layer of darkness near the horizon ahead kydd caught his anger an whats the barometer say he asked dangerously a bare twentyninean losin fast without a word kydd crossed to the hatchway then to the saloon where a neat fortin barometer hung on gimbals he looked closely as he suspected the fiducial point had not been setthe vernier would not read reliably without a true datum he tapped the mercury column carefully and adjusted the levelling screw then saw the reading was closer to twentynine and a quarter inches a figure not out of place in a southern english autumn snorting with contempt he resumed the deck behind cheslyn the stocky figure of le cocq was flanked by gostling and the boatswain rosco hovered uncomfortably no one spoke who has th deck kydd said loudly knowing full well who it was me snapped cheslyn get back on course west b north kydd said coldly an well douse th fore staysail i think we reckon its goin t be evil doins afore long an we we as every sailor knows a westerly in th fall aint t be trusted an with th barometer at twentynine and a quarter what lubber cant do a correction kydd said scornfully ive crossed th western ocean enough times an i know what i seewhat ye have ahead is a parcel o black squalls only nothing t fret upon it was worrying that cheslyn a reputed north atlantic mariner was having trouble with this weatheruntil kydd realised he might have other more mercenary reasons for a quick visit to falmouth bear up there he commanded the helmsman course west b north the others flicked anxious glances at cheslyn and kydd wondered darkly what tales of seawoe he had been spinning to them this ill do he said should th glass fall below twentynine before dark ill put about fr falmouth it was not much of a concessionif it fell so quickly he would flee in any eventbut he was confident in his reading of the sea and felt it unlikely but he missed having a sailingmaster to fall back on for advice and the comfort of such wisdom at his side he was on his own and would have to stand by his decisions just as dusk was closing in the first linesqualls arrived as he suspected they were shortlived but with disconcerting venom short periods of screaming and droning in the rigging and bucking in the canvas kydd knew that behind a series of black squalls was marching in from windward with an abrupt drop in temperature and the wind veering sharply in their wake he was determined to press on the witch of sarnia was well found nearly new and her gear could be trusted it would be uncomfortable and daunting to some but they would do it but once deep into the ocean what if a real atlantic howler coming out of the unknown fell upon them a black squall heavy with stinging rain blustered over them the keening winds that followed brought a shock of raw cold as they bullied at watchcoats and oilskins kydd sent below those he could but realised this might not have been a mercy to any still finding their sealegs in the fitful conditions the schooner was skittish and unpredictable in her movements the seas however were constant from the west long combers whitestreaked down their backs and as powerful as bulls coming at them ceaselessly kydd ticked off the seconds between cresting if the time had increased the swell was lengthening a sure sign of weather to windward another squall in square rig with these backing and veering winds there would be heavy work in the bracing of yards and at the tacks of so many more sails but in the witch with but two main sails it was so much less some time into the dark hours the wind shifted northerly and at the same time the barometer sank below twentynine inches time t turn an run cheslyn said pugnaciously to kydd in this dark what codshead would go abeam in these seas without he knows whats acomin at him frm windward were safe as we go an we stay this way the next day dawned on a cold grey waste of heaving whitestreaked seas and sullen cloudbanks but no sign of the broken and racing scud of a coming storm itll blow itself out kydd said confidently cheslyn merely stumped below there were no sunsights possible but despite the dirty weather they seemed to be making good progress with a whole clear ocean ahead they would pick up their position in time for now however kydd must estimate the extent of the set to leeward caused by the weather coming at them the constant motion was wearying the bracing against anything solid taking its toll of muscle and strength he sent calloway to round up the ships boys then start a class of how to pass bends and hitches and the working of knots possibly it would take their minds off the conditions they were now well out into the atlantic and the weather had eased more westerly again the underlying swell was long and languorous which might mean anything but the wind was back in the southwest as a strong breeze streaming in fine sailing weather for a schooner night drew in with little in the evening sky to raise concern and kydd read his compendium with interest before turning in he fell asleep almost immediately any worrying about just where in this vast desert of sea he might find prey could wait for the light of day at some time in the night he came suddenly to full wakefulness and lay in the dark knowing something was amiss but unable to pinpoint it there was nothing no sudden shouting no change in the regular pitching and heaving of the ship the feeling intensified and a sense of preternatural dread stole over him he rolled out of his bunk threw on the grego over his nightclothes and hurried up on deck his eyes straining into the blackness the watchondeck looked at him in astonishment capn sir said one with concern approaching kydd tried to make sense of his feelings the rollers showed white in the darkness seething past as usual and the overcast made reading the sky conditions difficult but something was then he had it an almost indefinable continuous low roar at the edge of hearing beneath the bluster of the wind but once detected never fading he froze in horror a memory from long ago burned into his soul burst into his consciousnessone night perilously close to the dreaded cape horn and he threw himself at the wheel as he had done then knocking the helmsman aside and spun on turns the little schooner seemed reluctant and frantically kydd willed it on for otherwise they had but seconds to live the roar became audible to the others on deck who looked at each other in terror as kydd shrieked hold hold on fr your lives then the wind died in not much more than a breath of air witch of sarnia came round into the calm whisper and started canting upthe angle increased sharply and the nearness of a monstrous presence beat on kydds senses hold he howled as the schooner reared higher still and from within the vessel he could hear anonymous thuds crashing and terrified cries the roaring was now overwhelming and suddenly it became a reality the foaming peak of a rogue wave of mountainous size rolling down on them out of the night like a juggernaut its feral presence mindfreezing now all depended on whether kydds action had been quick enough as the schooners bow buried itself in the boiling white of the crest the wind which had been cut off by the sheer bulk of the wave resumed with shocking forcebut she was now in the eye of the gale and it blasted equally both sides of the fore and aft sails by that one fact the witch had been saved from being slammed sideways to die rolling over and over broadside at the teeth of the wave the deluge took possession of the deck and came rushing aft at the same time the naked dripping bow emerged spearing skywards before the vessel fell with a sickening crunch into the back of the great wave then the rush of water thinned and disappeared over the side before it reached them they were through but at what cost men boiled up from below in terrified incomprehension above the bedlam kydd could hear cheslyns roar then saw his bearlike shape forward as he restored order with his fists the man handed himself aft his heavy face streaked with wet hair eyes red the barkys well shook up below mr kydd he said hoarsely you keep th deck sir an ill take some hands below an do what we can till day very well mr cheslynan thank ye there was a glimmer of a smile then he left abruptly first light showed much the same bleak seascape whitestreaked waves to the horizon advancing on them energetically but there had been no worsening during the night the barometer holding steady confirmed kydds estimate that it was but the north atlantic exercising its ageold right to nastiness he faced the wind the centre would be some six points or more out there on his right hand if he shaped away more south of west he would avoid the worst of the blow and still be on course for the azores and their hunting ground with a sigh of satisfaction he retired to his cabin they had survived remarkably well considering almost certainly because of their new fit of rigging between decks the mess was still being cleared away but nothing vital had suffered he was peeling off his sodden clothes when the door flew open and a cabin boy raced in shrieking an its a sail it was pale against the east horizon and of some size excitement swept the witch even though kydd knew the chances of it being prizeworthy were not great given they had not yet reached their hunting ground nevertheless the privateer prepared for a chase setting topsails abroad in earnest for the first time since st peter port and laying her course to intercept as if scenting the thrill of the hunt the witch lay down under her full sail and slashed along in exhilarating style feverishly kydd brought his newwon knowledge to mind for if there were to be wordgrinding arguments he would be ready now and if the ship resisted their examinations they would earn a wholehearted boarding strangely the vessel did not shy away downwind but held her course under the same light sails and in perfect confidence a gun if y please mr perchard as the powder smoke whipped along the decks the witch of sarnia broke her colours at the mastheadthe union flag of great britain their intent must be obvious why then did it not take action as they drew nearer it became even more perplexing with the ship continuing steadily on not once varying her eastward course for some reason her upper rigging was full of men putting his telescope down kydd was certain now that this was a martinicoman a french caribbean trader and therefore an enemy nearly twice their size yet not making any manoeuvre to meet the threat cautiously kydd allowed their courses to converge then a tricolour rose swiftly up the halliards and instantly up and down the deckline guns opened with stabs of flame the smoke carried swiftly to leeward the lively seas made any kind of accuracy impossible but it was clear to kydd that they were badly outclassed in weight of metalany boarding could end up bloody still the stubbornly held course and few sails kydd made to pass under her stern at half a mile rangeand when the big vessel failed to wheel about to keep his guns bearing on them kydd understood hes taken th same wave as we he laughed in relief an is higgled in the tophamper it was the cruellest of luck for the ship weakened beyond manoeuvring in masts or yards witch of sarnia had sighted them before they had found time for a juryrig to the injured spars kydd thought guiltily of the men who had worked through the night as they had and when blessed daylight had come so had their nemesis but this feeling did not last long a surging happiness flooded him as he went through the motions of crisscrossing the unfortunate ships helpless stern until the point was taken and the flag fluttered slowly down hornes compendium would confirm that this was rightful prey and being enemy he could fear no lengthy legalities before she was condemned as prize the venture was made witch of sarnia had made her first killand it had taken minutes only chapter as they glided close into the shore renzi felt the calm of the night an utter stillness broken only by the occasional animal cry and the slap of playful waves on the side of the privateer here the captain grunted squinting into the anonymous darkness are you sure renzi asked quietly the man nodded by this time there should be two lights showing out to sea one above the other but nothing interrupted the uniform blackness of the shoreline a tantalising scent of autumn woodland and freshturned earth wafted out to them then theyve had trouble with the lanterns if youll set me ashore now mr jacot i dont reckon on it mr giramondo why done this afore aint good t second guess em if theys found trouble an hour passed and more although keyed up with the appalling tension renzi mused that this would be his first step on the soil of france since those inconceivably remote days when kydd and he as common seamen had made their desperate escape following an abortive landing kydd what was his friend doing now so true and honourable one of natures gentlemen who did not deserve his fateany more than others in the chaos of war and he had sworn to stay by him yet here he was there jacot said with satisfaction two lights had finally appeared in the right place the captain looked at him questioningly and renzi realised he was waiting for a decision had this signal been delayed by lantern trouble or had it been made under duress after capture to lure them in should he seize courage and proceed or cancel the mission ill go ashore he said as calmly as he could there was no alternative the boat nudged into the sandy beach and renzi scrambled out it disappeared rapidly into the night and he was left standing at the edge of a wood sloping down to the waters edge with every nerve stretched to breaking point he listened night sounds the soughing of wind in the trees creatures in the undergrowth and blackness at that moment he was in as much mortal danger as ever in his life the letter sewn into his coat felt like fire a document of such towering importance that if he were captured would result not in his simple execution but in the deadliest torture the state could devise to rip his secrets from him then merciful death with shocking suddenness a hand clamped over his mouth from behind and his arms were seized on each side a voice close to his ear whispered in french a sound and you die renzi nodded and the hand left his mouth but his arms were held as he was frogmarched into the woods unseen sharp forest growths whipped across his face as he stumbled along in the grip of at least two men others following behind panting at the unaccustomed effort he was relieved when they reached a small glade and paused the rickety outlines of an old woodcutters hut appeared before them low words were exchanged then he was brought forward the door opened slammed shut behind him and the impelling arms fell away sensing the presence of others in the hut he kept still there was a tapping of flint and steel and a single candle sputtered into life to reveal a large man standing behind a table silent shadows all around qui êtes vous the man said mildly the accent was metropolitanparisian a poignard blade jabbed impatiently at his throat mustering his best french renzi replied nicholas renzi a british naval officer we were expecting another le vicomte was detained by his wounds i come from him with a letter renzi drew back his coat far enough for the scarletheart insignia of the chouans to be seen a rustle went through the others as they bent to see and here is his token he held out his hand which now bore dachés signet ring the blade stayed unwavering at his throat so you robbed le vicomte of his ring as well as a show of his trust in me he desires further that i should say this to you he took a breath and in the ancient french of seven hundred years ago the noble lines of la chanson de roland echoed forth in the old hut tere de france mult estes dulz pals oi desertét a tant ruboste exill barons franceis pur mei vos vei murir jo ne vos pois tenser ne guarantir the blade fell away robert always did relish his civilisation i am henri you told that well englishman are you perchance a scholar you were late renzi snapped it is the situation mon bravesoldiers gendarmerie they are in unrest they stalk the woods it is menacing outside msieur the candle flickered as another entered the hut and muttered something to henri he nodded with a frown then turned to renzi a letter you said sir ive come to deliver assurance from his britannic majestys government that all possible support shall be given to you in this decisive hour he relieved the man of the poignard that had recently been at his throat and with swift savage strokes slashed open the lining of his coat a sigh went round the hut as he passed over an elaborately sealed parchment henri broke it open and held it up to the candlelight this is from a sir saumarez he said accusingly it is said renzi with a haughty sniff commanderinchief and admiral he owes his allegiance directly to london and his word may be accepted i believe would you rather we delayed by requiring a reply all the way from there it speaks of aid and assistance but with no detail no numbers sir you can hardly expect a high commander to concern himself in the kind of specifics a quartermaster might deal with the hut was warm and close renzi was perspiring but it was more from the knowledge of the colossal stakes behind his every word than the lack of air peering intently at the letter henri spotted dachés scrawl across one corner he looked up suddenly robert commends us to accept this letter but we have the biggest decision still if we if you rise up and triumph in your plan where is the certitude that there will be ships and men to join with you in consummating your achievement exactly there was only one way to go forward now sir renzi said it is i who have been charged with the responsibility of ensuring that vessels will be there to receive the tyrantand of course any who wish for any reason to quit france at that time and i have seen with my own eyes the apartment in the castle of mont orgueil that is at this moment being prepared by the prince of bouillon for napoleon bonaparte sir if you have any anxieties on this matter be pleased to address them to me that i might answer them would this suffice in the light from the single candle henris eyes seemed to glowwith satisfaction or suspicion holding up the letter he pronounced by these writings the british government has implicated itself in the greatest threat to bonaparte he has ever experienced in all the chancelleries of europe it will be seen that perfidious albion reaches out to topple its foes by cunning and clandestine means and all might tremble that they are to be next renzi held rigid he had done all that could be expected of him and now the verdict on his efforts was to be made plain henri looked directly at him sir this letter is a gunpowder keg for your government that they have seen fit to trust it to our keeping is all the assurance we desire he held the sheet to the flame it caught and flared until it was consumed and the ashes fluttered to the floor in fortyeight hours you shall have our date and places renzi could find no words and gave a simple bow a scatter of applause and excited talk was halted by henri holding up his hands i would that we were able to extend to you the hospitality you deserve but alas he cocked his head to one side and listened intently then renzi felt an irregular thumping in the ground a jumble of drumbeats out of synchrony dragoons the door burst open les soldats nous sommes trahis the hut turned to bedlam and in the rush for the door renzi heard henri bellowing orders outside in the stygian darkness there was a crashing of vegetation as the conspirators scattered in every direction renzis arm was seized and he was forced to one side stay with me a womans voice urged as she propelled him across the glade into the woods and they plunged deeper into the wilder depths flying over bracken and fallen tree boles shots popped behind them and the squeal of horses pierced the night air mercifully the terrifying sounds lessened and panting uncontrollably they stopped at the edge of a meadow still and serene in the beginnings of a moonrise renzi was confused they were certainly no closer to the sea but the drumming hoofbeats were going away my brother he draws them from us the woman said brokenly hehe is a brave man renzi said affected is his duty she sobbed we must go the mad scramble resumed renzi however now saw that they were going in a wide sweep along the edge of the woods to reach the landing place everything depended on his endurance in overcoming pain and exhaustion but what if the privateer hearing the shots and commotion had considered that this was none of his business and left renzi could tell now that a body of dragoons had entered the wood on its far side not far from where they were he stumbled on aware of the womans agonised breathing then the wan glitter of the sea showed through the trees and they reached the shore this way she gasped urging him to the left they rounded a small point of landand there was a boat ready afloat and bows to sea renzis relief nearly overwhelmed him and it took his last ounce of strength to reach it you waited he panted wildly to jacot the man looked puzzled why in course i wants th other half o me money mr giramondo almost spent with emotion renzi urged the woman quickly into the boat no she wept i stay with henri get in jacot pulled renzi aboard we has t leave now mr giramondo when renzi looked back no one was there kydd sent gostling as prizemaster of the martinicoman an english port was only several days easy sail to leeward the mood aboard was exultant but kydd knew they had been luckythe next could well be hardfought and he insisted on serious practice with cutlass pike and musket a difficult task on a pitching deck flores the farthest flung of the azores was raised as planned the distant bluegrey peak of morro alto reminding him of other times having arrived it would now be nothing but hard work searching waiting lurkingkydd had chosen the area because he knew that merchant masters at this time of the year from both the east indies and the caribbean converged north of the island group to pick up the reliable southwesterly trade winds to speed them into europe on the other hand without fightingtops his single lookout in their tiny crowsnest on the foremast would have a heightofeye of only some forty feet say seven miles to the horizon any number of ships at that very moment were certain to be passing either side as they sailed perhaps only a dozen miles or so away perfectly hidden keep yr eyes open there he roared up at the lookout he had impressed on them time and again that a prize could appear from anywhereahead or just as easily approaching from the beam or even crossing astern the day ended quietly and night saw them lasking along under easy sail soon after midnight the overcast cleared and a fat gibbous moon rose by morning the weather was near balmy with bright sunlight and a glittering sea so far south the temperatures were more than tolerable and kydd was enjoying the utter contentment of flyingfish weather in a wellfound craft knowing that even if the rest of the voyage proved fruitless he had cleared the costs and judging from cheslyns comments probably produced some return into the bargain the ship fell into routine far from naval in its details but as comprehensive as kydd could make it in the circumstances chief of which was practice with weapons in another four days they had reached the limits of their beat across the tracks of homewardbound vessels and put about for the slant to the southwest unusually the weather calmed until they found themselves ghosting along in a glaring sea a luminous band of white concealing where water met sky the sun grew higher and warmer on the bow the mist burned off and there revealed for all to see was a ship incredulous yells broke out as its delicate image took form they were sighted in turn the vessels masts coming together then separating as it put down its helm and made off as fast as it could it had gone into a quartering run to allow its square sails to fill to best advantage and in the light airs the witch was finding it a hard chase no colours or any indication of origin was visible and the angle of the ship made identification impossible their own flag would be difficult to make out end on as it would be as noon passed the situation changed an afternoon breeze strengthened and the schooner picked up speed over the deep blue of the sea within an hour white horses were studding the seascape and their prey encumbered with cargo eventual success was assured larbd side do y think mr cheslyn kydd said amiably he had closed up his crew to quarters the small guncrews at the sixpounders the rest flinting pistols and edging cutlassesno martial thunder of drums or bravely waving pennons simply hardfaced men making ready for a fight the anticlimax when it came was cruel as they forereached on the seaworn ship there was sudden activity among the few on her afterdeck and her topsail sheets were let fly as english colours soared up into her rigging rosco recognised the ship bristol pride or im a dutchman trades wi nova scotia an the west country in dried cod an colonial goods reglar as clockwork an this must be her last voyage o th season the witch of sarnia ranged alongside and the canadian twang of the master floated over the water to confirm that they were indeed on passage from halifax to falmouth with such a freighting kydd waved and hailed back suitably aware that the black schooner hissing along so close to them must make a handsome showing nevertheless this was no prey for the witch sheer off he ordered the helm mr kydd calloway called urgently racing up to him wha there sir he pointed vigorously below the bristol prides bowsprit the buckler a blanking piece inserted in the hawse while at sea had been knocked out and an arm was protruding from the hole frantically jerking a white shirt after a split seconds incomprehension kydd bellowed stand to at the boarders mr perchard a shot afore his bow but they had no stomach for a fight against the numbers that the witch of sarnia could muster and kydd quickly found himself in delighted possession of a french prize of three days before her english crew confined to the focsle had found means to alert them and now the bilingual québecois master and his prizecrew were themselves prisoners some happy sailors going home t england calloway said mournfully as they bade farewell to bristol pride but no prize fr us is she mr kydd no prize agreed kydd then broke into a fierce grin but for us theres th salvage on recapture one sixth o th entire value an no questions asked this was a time for celebrationand relieffor kydd had needed to demonstrate faith in himself before the investors and had commuted his entire pay for the voyage into shares which would accrue to his account if and only if the voyage was successful the length and breadth of the privateer fell quiet as every man figured his own reward and kydd now saw his position in the world transformed even if they met with no more good luck he had not only cleared expenses but was well on the way to being far better off than at any other time in his life it was astonishing how quickly the balance sheet could change a cargo ship could carry the equivalent of the complete stock of hundreds of shops and as prize law conveyed the entire ship and cargo to the captor they were in the same position as a prosperous merchant without the need for capital it was an intoxicating thought but it could all be lostand in a single day should kydds examination and sending in of a vessel be successfully challenged and he be cast into damages then the consequences would be grave a naval officer had a form of compensation but not a privateer captain then there were the fortunes of war it was foolish to believe that only merchant shipping was abroad sooner or later a vengeful warship might loom and predator would become preybonaparte was incensed at the onslaught of privateers on frances vital trade and was showing no mercy to those who fell into his hands and his prizes would they arrive safely in an english port or in turn be recaptured as bristol pride had been that would put everything back to nothing and be a total ruination of their hopes and hardwon gains kydd returned to his cabin like a pendulum his mood changed from awe and delight to despondency then the gleeful chatter from his cabin boy as the place was fussily tidied restored the balance and he turned his mind to the practicalities of the voyage some ten days of provisioning remained and with only one prizecrew away every reason to press on kydd and cheslyn consulted the charts against the prevailing lateseason winds and decided on six days north of the azores and four south before making for home the weather was good but the sport was not day after day in blue seas and trade winds and never a sighting could it be because now was the season of hurricanes dauvergne was solicitous when renzi returned but the strain was showing in the lines of his face date and places duly came henri had survived the incident but there was no mention of the fate of any other renzi threw himself into the work the place of embarkation agreed on it was possible to assess from the depths of water the size of ship they could use bonaparte and his gaolkeepers would be a sizeable party and while bulwarks would have to be low deck space was vital word came that querelle the final link with brittany was in hiding six miles out of paris georges had the keys of the citadel his plot was manifestly coming together reliant on couriers for their news however renzi and dauvergne could only await its unfolding the indomitable pichegru was smuggled into the capital and concealed close by the barracks others converged on paris and within a city in a fever of rumour napoleon was said to have secret police reports brought to him in bed as soon as he awoke from somewhere deep in the normandy countryside henri sent advice that the tenuous line of escape that linked paris to the coast was complete horses were staged ready parties of soldiers set to delay pursuits it was the last act dauvergne alerted his commanderinchief for security reasons the time and place of napoleons embarkation were not given out to the fleet but saumarez promised that within a bracket of time the navy would be conducting live exercises at that precise spot brigsloops inshore frigates in depth the day dawned a crystal clear winters morning like any other the french coast the same irongrey granite the other side of a cold sea the hours passed when renzi and dauvergne sat down at last to dinner tired and overwrought they ate without conversation at the end of the meal they raised a glass in silent tribute to the men who were undoubtedly at that moment engaged in mortal struggle in paris and those who would be stretched out in a desperate gallop towards them i should think it time now renzi said thickly he got to his feet dauvergne stood up and stretched out his hand renzi grasped it neither man able to find words abruptly renzi left to bring back napoleon bonaparte every vessel was in position discreet light signals were exchanged with the shore and renzis vessel closed slowly with the coast it was a tricky task in seamanship the flat beach selected ideal for carriages but a tidal trap kedge anchors were prudently laid to seaward for if they were to ground on the sand as the tide went out and they waited arrival had been timed for early dark but there was still no sign from the interior hours passed and men grew edgy and anxious for they were vulnerable from sea and shore midnight approached the plan called for tight timing and this was an ominous sign in the long early hours the tide rose again and in the deathly silence an hour before dawn they were close enough to hear shouts and disorder carrying in the stillness the commotion grew nearer and renzi knew it could have only one meaning with desperate sadness he watched running figures burst from the trees hurling themselves into the shallows towards the waiting ships the first made it and were hauled up while others so pitifully few broke for safety and followed its georgeshes been taken gulped one were betrayedthat vermin querelle turned informer its all over for usfinished the witch of sarnia passed flores once more and continued south after barely a day they sighted something in the west a tiny blob of white on the rim of the world a sail at first blinking in and out of existence then keeping steady it seized the attention of every soul they altered towards it instantly knowing they had the advantage that as their sails were edge on to the other ship their sighting would be delayed then more and more sail came into view a convoy cheslyn grunted but whose kydd held his telescope steady and tried to make out clues anonymous merchant shippingbluewater vessels certainly there was a frigate in the van a large one possibly of guns no colours he swung back to the merchantmen nothing remarkable if they had been closer he would see identifying vanes at their mastheads numbers in white on their stern quarters he began counting the shipssix eight and that was all this was very likely not a british convoy it was a telling comment on his nations primacy at sea that convoys of sixty or a hundred ships were more the rule johnny crapaud he said crisply and while the witch closed with the distant ships he took in the situation they were running before the southwesterly directly towards the french coast over a week away the frigate was protectively at their head and far too formidable even to think of engaging but if anything happened to it he could take his pick of the brood we stay with th convoy he told cheslyn easing sheets he allowed the ships to advance on him edging round as the frigate pointedly took position between the privateer and the convoy and shortened sail allowing its charges to sail on steadily until they were all past while still remaining between the witch and her intended victims this was exactly what kydd would have done in the circumstances they were now astern of the convoy which was downwind of them but between them and any prize was the impossible menace of the heavy frigate the convoy ploughed on the frigate on guard and immovably positioned astern experimentally kydd allowed the schooner to ease round the rear of the convoy and begin dropping down towards the van but there was no advantage whatsoever to their foreandaft rig in this point of sailing and the frigate kept effortlessly with them kydd eased away and the convoy moved ahead again the frigate keeping pace with the witch as though on wires eventually they took their place astern of the convoy once more and it was time to think again aboard every one of those ships there would be fear of the privateer dogging them but kydd could not see how to move against them he could go tearing downwind to fall on one of the leading vessels but well before he could secure his victim the frigate would be upon him on the other hand his advantage of better sailing into the wind was of no use for the frigate was already on the windward edge of the convoy and perfectly positioned to go to the aid of any as they were all to leeward and in a direct line of sailing there was no easy answer they were only a few days off retiring from the area so perhaps he must let them gobut any accident aboard one of the vessels would make it fall out of line and then it would be theirs or at night some inexperienced master might lose the convoy and in morning light be found alone on the ocean so he would follow in their wake ready to snap up stragglers like a wolf prowling about a flock of frightened sheep waiting to catch them offguard they stayed with it through the afternoon and evening as dusk drew in the frigate having nothing to fear from revealing her position hung two lanthorns along the foreyard three along the main and settled comfortably in the centre of the two columns of four ships where all might see and be comforted by the bright lights there would be no lost sheep it seemed the night passed and the day following with not the slightest false move by the frigate which stayed in perfect station between the witch and the ships huddling together it was a masterly textbook defence and kydd wryly honoured the unknown captain two more days went by they were now approaching france heading probably to a port south of brest possibly nantes or la rochelle still the skilled blocking but this course was not altogether out of their way and kydd would stay with them until the last moment then head for home meanwhile he would take the opportunity to circumnavigate the convoy slowly taking in details of each ship and making a hypothetical choice of which he would choose as victim speculation passed round witch as to their qualities and value but still the frigate kept careful watch and ward as they drew nearer the coast they saw various craft mainly local traders scuttling from port to port and occasionally a larger vessel then with france a low bluegrey smudge ahead at last everything changed with the sighting of a single vessel closer inshore not a particularly large ship a brig but purposefully beating out towards them it posed a dilemma for the frigate captain should he abandon his position to windward of the convoy and stand away to intercept the possible threat or remain if the brig was a warship and hostile it was much more of a threat than the witch but if he went to meet it and kydd struck he would have to claw back against the wind to come to the rescue kydd watched developments keenly soon it became clear that the brig was a manowar a royal navy sloop of the type that was carrying the fight to the enemy in such numbers come out to try its steel wheeling about the head of the advancing ships in an arrogant show of inspection it was too much for the frigate which loosed sail and charged through the convoy towards the interloper an electric thrill whipped through kydd at last here was his chance a cooler voice intervened to point out that if he was caught with half his men on an enemy deck by the returning frigate the witch of sarnia would be blasted out of the water in a single vengeful broadside eight ships three or four miles of sea was there time to fall on one of the convoy in a wild boarding seize and sail off with it before the frigate could reach them all the crew had to do was to put up a stout enough fight to delay matters and they would be saved it would be a hard and bloody affair and he had seconds to decide at the frigates decisive move the sloop had kept its distance and was warily stepping away from confrontation kydds instinct was to secure cooperation from the unknown captain and tackle the problem as a team but a proud navy commander would never stoop to joining with a privateer to the starboard rear there was a mediumsized shiprigged merchantman probably hailing from the caribbean and with no particular attraction other than that she had a modest stern quarter and bulwarks to lessen the dangerous climb aboard she would be his kill mr cheslyn we board there was an instant response he had no need to make bracing speeches they all knew the stakesand the reward sheering over to starboard he let the witch have her head she rapidly overhauled the merchant ship and set her bowsprit to pass down the vessels outer side this was no time to check on the frigates actions for now they were committed and there was no turning back puffs of smoke appeared from along the afterdeck and were joined by others coming from the tops a swivel banged and another kydd heard the vicious whip of bullets overhead and felt their thump through his feet as they slammed into the hull the gap of water narrowed fire he bellowed their sixpounder crashed out its hail of musket balls sleeting across and with a hoarse roar the coehorn mortar joined in throwing grenadoes among the defenders who scattered wildly the two vessels came together with a crash sending kydd staggering men stood to hurl grapnelsone collapsed as he took a ball to the chest but others secured a hold and hauled the ships together while the boarders gathered brandishing their weapons in a bloodthirsty show however there were cool and brave heads on the other ship and seamen darted out and hacked at the grapnel lines with axes and the vessels drifted apart again they had to act or it was all over wi me kydd shrieked at cheslyn in the crazy noise and raced forward throwing over his shoulder at the helmsman take her in on the foredeck kydd looked frantically about for the fall of a line from aloft found one and slashed through it then as though he were a seaman atop a yard aloft he ran out on the bowsprit which was swinging towards the other ship clamping the coil of line under his arm he felt cheslyn behind him and others as wellthey had moments only for their impetus through the water would translate to a deflection out by the shock of impact he reached the cranse iron at the tip of the bowsprit and paused passing a hurried bowline around the fore topmast stay conscious of the racing water below and in the other ship the men tumbling down from the low poop to meet the sudden threat and then the long spar was arcing over the enemy deck instantly he dropped there was only one thing he had to do now but would he live long enough to do it then he heard cheslyns roaring battlecry abovefollowed by the mans body knocking him askew others dropping by him kydd heaved himself to his feet and felt the line tug away from him ignoring the ring and clash of arms around him as cheslyn parried and thrust to protect him he threw himself at a kevelhead and passed turns round the thick timber belaying point the schooners bowsprit was now fastened to its victim and was thus a bridge into the heart of the other vessel in minutes it was all over the defenders falling back in panic at the stream of screeching privateersmen flooding aboard kydd stood apart watching cheslyn urgently dispatch men into the rigging and along the deckthen raised his eyes to seek out the frigate with a lurch of his heart he saw it had skilfully driven the brig clear to leeward then had worn about instantly and was now beating back ferociously they had bare minutes to take possession having seen the masterly handling of the frigate kydd knew it was impossible still under full sail still within the convoy they had to fight their way outbut to do this they needed to learn enough about the rigging operations of a strange ship to put about without a mistake and there was not the time the last of the defenders scuttled out of sighthe was master of the deck but with a hostile crew still unsubdued below he forced his mind to an icy calm one thing was clear this prize was heavy with cargo and would never achieve the swift manoeuvres he neededand all the time the frigate was thrashing closer defiantly he looked back at the wheel one of his men held it firmly not daring to vary the ships heading until he could be sure of the sail handling the body of an unknown sailor lay sprawled at his feet then kydd had it steady as she goes he bawled at the helmsman and hurried over to stand by him cheslyn looked aft questioningly he had groups of men positioned at the base of each mast but kydd knew that to go about now was simply too risky even missing stays would have the frigate right up with them and he shook his head vigorously and concentrated they had just this chance follow m motions he croaked at the nervous helmsman as a squarerigger they were sailing directly before the southwesterly which gave them their only advantagethey had a wide angle of possible courses ahead steer fr th frenchy frigate kydd ordered the helmsman gave a frightened glance but complied and the ship swung ponderously until it was headed directly towards the ship beating up towards them between the two columns of the convoy the manowar did not change its course and kydd guessed there would be frenzied discussion on her quarterdeck they stood on stubbornly but kydd knew that the frigate captain had only one objectto lay them aboard he would do his best to oblige shake out that reef he hailed cheslyn sails had been trimmed to achieve an even speed in convoy loosing the main and forecourse would give them speed in hand the frigates track did not vary in the slightest and head to head the two ships approached each other everything now depended on the timing and the placements kydds eye took in not only the menace of the french frigate but the convoyespecially the nextahead vesseland he made his calculations deliberately passing his orders quietly for fine corrections of heading their advance downwind was drawing the nextahead perilously near and somewhere on her inner beam there would be a meeting one or other of the closing ships must give way the frigate slashed ahead straight for them with no sign of yielding waybut this was not kydds concern for at the last possible moment he gave orders to fall away to starboard instead of coming to a confrontation their ship instead passed to the outer side of the nextahead and so close that the pale shocked faces of the men at the wheel were clear and stark as they bucketed by in one move kydd had placed this ship between him and the frigate as they passed in opposite directionsbut the best was yet to come enraged by kydds bold escape the frigate captain made to bear away closely round the nextaheads stern but in his eagerness to grapple gave insufficient allowance for the strength of the fresh winds in a chorus of splintering smashes twangs and screams of indignity the frigate made close acquaintance with the vessels stern quarters and recoiling fell off the wind helpless quickly kydd had his new prize angling off into the open sea with witch of sarnia close beside outside the three crowns kydd stood in a maze of happiness he was gazing at a poster on a pillar proclaiming boldly for sale by the candle at three crowns tavern st peter port on monday the next by ten o clock in the forenoon the good ship héros de guadeloupe burthen about tons lately taken by the witch of sarnia letter of marque thomas kydd captain a remarkable sailer well found and calculated for the caribbee trade and may be sent to sea at a trifling expence after the sale the entire cargo now landed will be set to auction inventories may be viewed at and this was only the first of his two prizes hearings had taken place immediately and the evidences of french ownership sent to the admiralty prize court had resulted in swift condemnation as prize and the vessel was now in the process of being sold at auction mr kydd is it not a welldressed man asked politely removing his hat i believe the heartiest congratulations would be insufficient to express my sense of admiration at your late action and another prize to your name aye there is sir kydd answered warily magnificent just as in the old days oh might i introduce myself robert de havilland he handed kydd a card as you may see im a banker and it did cross my mind that should you see fit to favour us with your financial interests then im sure that we would be able to offer very advantageous rates to a gentleman as distinguished as yourself a line of credit against your captures perhaps sovereign investment in consols at above market why thank ye mr de havilland kydd came back politely but im not ready t change banks at th moment it was truly amazing how many new friends he had made in the few days since his return from sea curious to see proceedings he entered the tavern it was stifling packed with merchants watching while the auctioneer droned away on the fine qualities of the vessel under the hammer a stir went through them when he had finished and an assistant brought a lighted taper are ye ready gennelmen light th candle the bids were low at first then from all sides the serious ones came in one fifty t you sirtwo hundred mr mauger two seventy kydd had no idea of the value this represented but was content to let it wash over him the bids petered out but all eyes were fixed on the candle and kydd saw that it was burning down to where a blackened pin with a ribbon had been inserted as the flame neared the bids redoubled until there was a staccato hammer of shouts before the pin dropped clear and the highest bidder was declared the new owner turning to go kydd was stopped by the auctioneer who had spotted him to general acclamation he announced that they had been honoured by the presence of the victorious captor kydd blushed and made a hurried escape outside to an unseasonably warm sun he strolled along the parade nodding to respectful passersby and pondered the change in lifes direction that had brought him so much he recalled the smugness of zephaniah job at the windup meeting the almost fawning attention of robidou the ledger figures that told of his restoration to fortune then there was the respect he seemed to have won from cheslyn and the crew of the privateer at payingoff time he chuckled aloud to recall a bold and swashbuckling pookie stepping ashore playing the corsair to the limit as she took home her plunder to present to her mother would renzi believe how things had changed his friends selfless toil in jersey to keep him going was now no longer necessary he would ask him to return but without telling him of his great change in fortune simply say he was due for a surprise yes he must write him a letter kydd then remembered a promise which he would soon be in a position to keep he planned to take one of those grand and very comfortable mansions in grange road a celebration a great dinner occasionand the only ones invited would be those who had stood so nobly by him as he hurried along to set it in train he imagined the room resounding to richard samsons shakespearean declaiming the extravagant gown that griselda mayhew would flaunt the studied nonchalance of carne who would probably complain at the waste of a good flyman it would be a splendid evening chapter renzi was on his way back to guernsey and to kydd he had kept his word and stayed with dauvergne until it was obvious there was no more to be done and then accepting only what he was owed in wages he quit the place it had been a catastrophenot for want of courage there had been every reason to expect a different conclusion but for the treachery of querelle the head of the secret police fouché had moved rapidly and with bloodshed and torture the conspiracy to kidnap bonaparte had been comprehensively crushed georges had been taken after a gigantic struggle the old soldier pichegru dragged from his bed to the temple prison troops had been sent across the rhine to arrest the duc denghien and orders poured out of paris for apprehending lesser names bonapartes vengeance was savage arrests trials and executions followed swiftly one on another georges was guillotined with eleven others bellowing vive le roi even as the blade fell the duc denghien was imprisoned and put on trial for his life while pichegru was found strangled in his cell with a stick and neckerchief some said to prevent unwanted disclosures at the trial it had been a searing experience renzi knew he looked haggard and drawn and that it would take some time to emerge from the darkness of tainted violence to see his friend again was now all he asked he remembered the last letter the reference to his surprise and hoped it would allow some small leavening of kydds existencewhat means he himself had been able to bring back was not as much as he had hoped st peter port was unchanged the waterfront as active as ever he checked the address on kydds letter off fountain street to the south quite up to the fringes of respectabilitywas this his surprise he found the house easily enough a somewhat decayed dwelling but of some size oh the strikingly featured woman who answered the door seemed disconcerted at his appearance madame renzi said with an abject bow i have no wish to intrude my recent understanding is that mr thomas kydd is in residence here ah she said youre naught but a bailiff come after the poor lamb indeed i am not renzi said with the first smile for many weeks i am his friend youre not mr renzi she said incredulous i am she took him by the arm and said warmly why do come in im rosiehes not living here any more but youll have such a surprise when y hear what hes adoing now an hour later warmed by a stiff tot and the odd groups open regard for him as a friend of kydd he stood in the street outside bemused at the turn of events kydd was the talk of the town and to a fair way of thinking a rich mana privateer captain of all thingsstill out on his third voyage but expected daily renzi wandered down to the foreshore where they had last walked together by all accounts kydds days of penury were well and truly behind him and his own little contributions would no longer be neededin fact the new address he had been given was up on grange road one of the imposing villas that looked down haughtily on the bustling seaport it would be a quite different man he would shortly be seeing their time together in teazer was over of course however brief in the larger span of life hed wedge himself no longer in his tight little cabin musing on mystical paradigms and vaulting theories while the sea tossed about their sturdy barqueand he would be so much the poorer to have to develop his thoughts in some dingy shorebound building renzi shook off his selfish concerns now their ways would necessarily diverge given their utterly different courses in life and with kydd busy amassing a fortune as a privateer captain there would be little point in lingering in guernsey waiting for his infrequent returns no it was time to part the bleakness returned threatening to become a desolation he cast about for something to fasten on to was there anything perhaps he could give kydd to show him how much he had appreciated his friendship given his circumstances it would have to be a forlorn sort of present then a thought struck there was one last service he could do for his friend with the prospect of increasing wealth and kydds consequent high standing in society there was little doubt that he would now see any resumption of his attempt to clear his name as irrelevant renzi had heard from rosie of kydds naïve plan to unbribe the perpetrators it had no chance of course but if he himself by other means was able to get to the bottom of it it would be a satisfying thing indeed to offer his friend renzi strode purposefully along the pollet to smith street and made his way up to the headquarters of the commanderinchief renzi he snapped at the guard confidential secretary to commodore dauvergne of the jersey squadron if you pleasemr jessop high clerk to sir james being of such stature the man maintained his own office renzi entered then made play of closing the door behind him and testing the latch then he intoned gravely renzi sir we have corresponded on occasion mystified jessop rose to shake hands sir i have come on a matter of some delicacy you are aware are you not of the commodores other responsibilities um if you are referring to his activities of a clandestine nature arising from his connections with yes mr renzi as high clerk to the commanderinchief i am generally made cognisant there is no necessity for details at this time mr jessop the matter under privy investigation at this time merely requires an indication only concerning a possible breach of confidentiality it may or may not be necessary to take the issue further but for now a simple response will answer jessop frowned and waited within the last several months has any communication of a covert or unusual nature been received by this office from the admiral commanding at plymouth do please indicate with an affirmative or negative only the mans face cleared absolutely not as you must be aware this is a commanderinchiefs station and does not have anything operationally to do with a subordinate admiral in another station therefore we have had nothing from admiral lockwood isnt it apart from the routine and mundane that is you can be quite certain that nothing touching on covert operations or deployments sir you can rest assured that anything of such a nature must pass across my desk and there has been no such nothing that can require a secret deviation from operational orders perhaps mr renzi i myself make up the order packs for captains and there have been no secret orders issued a commander on this station these last six months as you must know such operations as might be classed as covert are generally attended to by commodore dauvergne of course cerberus frigate was once diverted thank you mr jessop that has been most helpful good day to you sir so there could be little doubt that kydds forged secret orders had not originated from lockwood therefore it must have been effected locally renzi fought down his weariness and concentrated on a careful review of the procedure he himself had signed for the orders but not sighted them locking them away in the confidential drawer for the captains later attention when kydd had opened them he recalled that the outer normal orders had been in a packet as usual only the secret orders sealed he did not recall anything singular about the seal surely they could not have been falsely planted in teazer there had been no signs of a lock forced and in any case the idea of any getting past tysoe for access to kydds inner cabin was ludicrous therefore the false orders must have been inserted prior to their delivery to teazer they had been brought in the usual fashion from the commanderinchiefs office by prosser the masters mate who had signed for them properly he had presumably then returned without delay in the boat to hand them over if at the flag office there had been no secret orders and in teazer there werethere could be only one conclusion that prosser had himself inserted them or knew of the act prosser but what possible motivation could he have had for the deed vain insensitive and no leader of men he was much more likely to have been led by another standish there was no way of telling prosser would never risk his career in admitting anythinghe had now his acting lieutenancy and the principal in the affair would have ensured that all tracks had been been well and truly covered it was unfortunate but there was no way forward as a failed commander kydd would therefore be for ever under a cloud anda wave of rage roared through renzi shaking him with its intensity it moved him as nothing else had that the gross world of deceit and treachery had reached out and touched his friend renzi knew that unless he did something he would but then he realised he could the devil that was in him spoke seductively through the storm plotting a course of action that in its very symmetry was beguiling and deeply satisfying if the virtuous were to be brought low by an immoral and felonious act then the wicked should be likewise in one stroke he could turn the world he despised against itself and at the same time achieve justice for kydd at last feverishly he assembled a plan he would need accomplices who wouldnt talkwith his inside knowledge of the shadow world of spies and assassins that would be easy vipère and hyène would now be available he brought to mind their saturnine graverobbing features yes they would do admirably next a suitable location what better than the old sailloft in which kydd had spent so much time recently excellent then let the game commence sitting at the single table in the dank and empty space renzi trimmed the one candle it shone up with a trembling flame illuminating his face from below with a malevolent gleam the table was bare save an open razor in the centre he waited calmly at the appointed hour there was a scuffle outside a struggling body was forced within and flung to the ground before him the pinioned arms splayed immovably sideways the gagged and blindfolded head desperately turning this way and that the struggles eventually ceased and renzi nodded first the gag and then the blindfold were removed and a terrified prosser looked about wildly he tried to rise but was held down for gods sake renzi whats happening he choked out renzi watched him writhe he had no pity for the mans ordeal called from the warmth of the mermaid club on a pretext then rapidly bundled away blindfolded into the night whatre they doing prosser shouted terror rising vipère cuffed him to silence renzi contemplated the creature who had brought kydd down and who was now trembling uncontrollably his eyes staring at renzis cruel mask of a face you played mr kydd false with your poisonous secret orders youll tell me why ii didnt do it it wasnt me i swear icy anger seized renzi ive the blood of far better men than you on my hands he snarled with the conviction of perfect truth yours will not cost me a moments pause he was shaking now at the sudden insight that he really meant it his hand slid to the razor and picking it up slowly he tested its edge youyoure mad prosser gasped hypnotised by the weapons gleaming menace renzi rose suddenly shifting his grip on the razor to a workmanlike underhand the two others yanked prossers head back by the hair no prosser screamed i beg you renzi paused and the man fell limply hhow did you know he said weakly he said no one would ever discover us it all came out such a simple foolish act conceived in jealousy and hatred but with such consequencesit had been carthew when he had seen his position as senior commander and favourite threatened by kydd and aware of saumarezs strict moral code he had bribed a smuggler to land the chest and persuaded prosser to tamper with the orders there had been no one else carthew had promised prosser that on this remote station standish would get the ship and he himself would achieve his longsought lieutenancy he had been right and but for renzi he would certainly have got away with it but renzi could see no path forward without evidence without witnesses there would be no happy ending in lieu should he put an end to this reptiles life he moved forwardprosser shrieked as the razor went straight to his throat it stayed poised while a tiny nick beneath exuded a trail of scarlet your life is now forfeit renzi said levelly my dearest friend has been ruined by your acts can you give me any reason why i should not end it he waited for the hysterical babble to trail off having discovered to his intense satisfaction that prosser had not trusted carthew and had stealthily retrieved the actual secret orders which he still had in his possession renzi pretended to ponder i seeto be produced in court at the proper time he reflected further you will observe he said as though to a lecture audience how trivial a task it has been for one in my position to arrange the abduction and death of any i choose should you fall in with my demands you may yet escape with your lifebut if you fail me i will give orders that will find you out wherever you are and extinguish your miserable existence do you understand yyes mr renzi then this is what you shall do first bring the orders to me with your written confession afterwards you shall stand up and testify against carthewand only then will you stand quite discharged of your obligations this is now your choice sir how will you proceed iill do it mr renzi whoever you are it had been a stiff walk out of town up by elizabeth college to grange road and a little farther to the kydd residence a fine house with many rooms set back discreetly from the road he passed the gardener who touched his hat to him as he reached the ornate front door and found the bell pull a bewigged footman regarded him disdainfully sir fighting down a sense of unreality he said im nicholas renzi i saw that mr kydds ship is now in port is he at home at all he had seen the wicked black lines of the privateer schooner as she had returned to a joyous welcome on the quayside but for some reason had refrained from joining the crowds the footman seemed unimpressed and held out his hand oh er i have no visiting card on my person renzi said uncomfortably but i assure you i am his good friend and sanguine he will offer me welcome he was shown into a receiving room adjacent to the door by the disapproving flunkey renzi settled into a comfortable chair and picked up a gentlemans magazine to avoid gaping at the splendours of decoration to hand it was hard to believe that this was now the residence and home of the young credulous quartermasters mate who had sailed with him in artemis frigate on her legendary voyage round the world the masters mate who had stood with the seamen in the great nore mutiny then spurned an admirals daughter for a country lass at ruinous social cost kydds sea sense had made him a natural predator and he was clearly reaping its rich rewards three voyages now he was a figure of admiration in an island with a long history of privateering and could command the fawning attention of any he choseand this was only the beginning had it altered him was the openhearted sailor now a hardnosed businessman when each cruise was adding massively to his private fortune would he deign to go back to life in a humble sloop like teazer the more renzi thought about it the more unlikely it seemed most of all a gulf now separated them that could not have been greater kydd had found himself and would go on to great things while he could only dream of achieving something in the philosophical line not a path likely to lead to such riches with a sudden stab he realised as well that as kydd and his family rose in the world cecilia might be placed for ever beyond his reach his despondency turned to fear the gritty rolling of wheels outside told him that soon he would know the worst sitting quite still his pulse quickening he heard the cries of an ostler and the jingling of harnessthen a deeper voice of authority probably the majordomo greeting his master a pleasant voyage sir then the blessed sound of kydds hearty voice not s pleasant but a mort profitable id have t say oh er theres a gentleman in the receiving room the voice went on he gave no card but claims to be an acquaintance of yours will you see him or he gave a name well yes sira mr rancy sir renzi the door burst openand kydd stood there utter delight on his face nicholas he cried yere here renzi stood slowly yes dear fellow as you have rightly perceived i am indeed here he said eyes smarting kydd advanced impulsively and hugged his friend then frowning he held him at arms length that rogue the prince o whateverwhy hes been working ye half t death still no need fr that kind o thing any more nicholas were rich while renzi was digesting the we kydd turned on the majordomo rouse up th hands he roared were t have a right true welcome home t two heroes o the sea they moved to the more august surroundings of the spacious drawing room and renzi noted how confidently kydd moved about the sumptuous furnishings soon fortified by a fine brandy the two friends were slipping back into their old familiarity then do i take it that your recent voyage might be accounted successful brother aye kydd said with relish one who thought t go atradin with th french coloniesa right tartar but no match fr the witch o course so now you have taken the character of a man of means not to say wealth oh this pile y think so its on a very favourable lease frm a mr vauvert rich cove whos done well out o investin in m cruises then this bounteous cornucopia might be said sufficient for your plans now to go afoot ahthe plans nicholas ive had time t think about it it wasnt really much of a plan t conceive theyll put emselves up against th law just fr a few guineas foolish t believe so dont y think id be obliged to agree dear fellow but what if we could find some other way to right this grievous wrong done to you y mean lay out the gold t hire a flash london lawyer as will see me right no nicholas without we have th evidence t show him it just wont fadge perhaps then we could find a denizen of the demiworld an abandoned creature not noted for the delicacy of his morals who would follow the trail wheresoever it led but who would know such a person nicholas kydd exclaimed scandalised ill not have dealings wi such its not the place fr a gentleman as you yself tells me he said with heat hesitating he conceded reluctantly so it seems ill have t face it theres no way forward this is m lot in life an if im t be truthful then its t say that its not so hard an im still fightin the kings enemiesin a private way o course umm well do tell me for my interest if it were in any wise made possible that at some future date the vile act is exposed and the malefactors brought to a reckoning would you still desire to set yourself on teazers quarterdeck again to give away the carefree life of a corsair for the stern duties of the navy puzzled kydd blinked why o course why else would i ah i seeyere flamming me well nicholas let me say ye can be sure that if i cn think of another plan asll smoke em out well ill do it with all m heart renzi paused a halfsmile spread as he felt about inside his waistcoat well now if youre ever to be a commander again well have to find a way to deal with these slowly he withdrew a small sheaf of papers unfolding the top one and holding it up he asked innocently oh er do you recognise this at all my god th secret orders where did you from the knave who deliberately inserted them into your lawful orders who as instructed by another who most ardently wished for your ruin who damn it nicholas was it lockwood kydd blazed prosser kydd slumped in amazement thatthat gibfaced shicer in gods name why to achieve his step as an officer an who was th other the principal was carthew in a fit of jealous rage he paid a smuggler to land the chest and used prosser to falsify your orders simple really kydd shook his head in wonder that any should be s low he turned to renzi nicholas how did ye oh merely the application of common logic and when i enquired it of him he most readily admitted the act you will find his written confession here the name of the smuggler and as well he has agreed to testify against carthew speechless kydd could only gaze at him in admiration then then this means it is over dear friend with this evidence your reinstatement will be a matter of formality only and remembering the particular kindness sir james saumarez had for you i would not be in the least surprised to find him especially anxious to make up in some handsome way for what you have suffered stretching out lazily he continued and from henceforth your new fortune will set you in the first rank of society never more to concern yourself with trifles as we mortals must not forgetting that your means now will bring you influence and power perhaps a seat in parliament it were folly for the admiralty to ignore such a one kydd listened quietly then grinned o course nicholas if life in a pawky brigsloop doesnt please ye any more i shall have t find a new clerk it took another brandy before conversation could resume with a triumphant flourish kydd waved the evidence in the air whod have thought it i hold in m hands just a few squiddy papers but theyre enough t see me back in command o dear teazer his eyes shone and a nemesis for the wrongdoer renzi added aye kydd said his voice hardening carthew doesnt know it yet but hes found out an im about t choke his luff with thisn ill now have my revenge on him th dog renzi gave a saintly smile a courtmartial and dismissal with disgrace from his majestys navy scorn and contempt at all levels and no hope whatsoever of being received by polite society ever again and of course little prospect of employment by any who value probity in character the smile grew wider if of course you wish to cast him into damages then you must add penury to his suffering enough kydd rose to his feet im goin t saumarez now renzi gave a little laugh which he tried to smother what kydd grated oh nothing just the irony of a privateers revenge setting a right true sea officer back into his majestys service authors note the ancient castle of mont orgueil still lies at the head of gorey bay in jersey the curious may wish to visit and pace the stone floors of the rooms from which commodore later admiral philippe dauvergne ran la correspondance in those desperate days two hundred years ago they might then desire to mount the old battlements for the thrilling view of the coast of france as countless sentries and others have done over the centuries since good queen bess i would recommend the trip there have been few of my research locations that have proved so little changed and so genuinely atmospheric in fact the channel islands are fascinating indeed st peter port is rightly said to be as prime a georgian city as bath or weymouth and a brisk walk up grange road will allow the interested to view the splendours of the residences built by successful privateers and grand merchants the original harbour remains but within the embrace of a much larger modern edifice however the fearful sea hazards of dizzying tidal currents and the maze of submerged rocks still have the power to chill for the inhabitants of the norman isles as fiercely independent as ever the loyal toast will always be to the duke of normandy they revere those who have loomed large in their thousandyear history perhaps none more than admiral sir james saumarez a grave figure whose integrity and sensitivity ensured that he would always stand in the shadow of other more colourful commanders i was gratified to learn recently that there are plans for his memorial dynamited by the german army to be restored philippe dauvergnes story is a less happy one at the end of the war exhausted and in debt he crossed europe to enter into his princely inheritanceonly to have it bartered away by the great powers in the readjustment of borders after waterloo he died days later as usual i owe a debt of gratitude to three women without whom there would be no books my creative partner and wife kathy my literary agent carole blake and my editor alex bonham ive consulted many in the islands and i apologise for not naming them all however i would be remiss in not mentioning dr gregory stevens cox whose peerless work on the period started me on my quest and whose personal tours stripped away the layers of years the lt governor of guernsey sir fabian malbon who as an admiral and commanderinchief himself shares my respect for sir james and captain eric gill the queens harbour master whose insightful observations on navigation in those waters informed my writing my thanks are due too to captain a j holland nicholas gold peter de sausmarez and the staff of the priaulx library i do hope you enjoyed this story in the next book kydd will be sailing into shoal waters of quite another kind
