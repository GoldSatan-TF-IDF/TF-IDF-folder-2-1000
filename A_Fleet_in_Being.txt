a fleet in being a fleet in being chapter i the sailor men that sail upon the seas to fight the wars and keep the laws and live on yellow peas a gunroom dittybox g s bowles some thirty of her majestys menofwar were involved in this matter say a dozen battleships of the most recent and seventeen or eighteen cruisers but my concern was limited to one of a new type commanded by an old friend i had some dim knowledge of the interior of a warship but none of the new world into which i stepped from a portsmouth wherry one wonderful summer evening in with the exception of the captain the chief engineer and maybe a few petty officers nobody was more than twentyeight years old they ranged in the wardroom from this resourceful age to twentysix or seven clearcut cleanshaved young faces with all manner of varied experience behind them when one comes to think it is only just that a light knot cruiser should be handled under guidance of an older head by affable young gentlemen prepared even sinfully delighted to take chances not set down in books she was new they were new the admiral was new and we were all off to the manoeuvres together thirty keels next day threading their way in and out between a hundred and twenty moored vessels not so fortunate we opened the ball for the benefit of some foreign warships with a piece of rather pretty steering a consort was coming up a waterlane between two lines of shipping just behind us and we nipped in immediately ahead of her precisely as a hansom turning out of bond street nips in in front of a city bus distance on water is deceptive and when i vowed that at one crisis i could have spat on the wicked ram of our next astern pointed straight at our naked turning side the wardroom laughed oh thats nothing said a gentleman of twentytwo wait till we have to keep station tonight its my middle watch close watertight doors then said a sublieutenant i say this to the passenger if you find a secondclass cruisers ram in the small of your back at midnight dont be alarmed fascinating game of general post we were then strung out in a sixmile line thirty ships all heading westwards as soon as we found room the flagship began to signal and there followed a most fascinating game of general post when i came to know our signalmen on the human side i appreciated it even more the admiral wreathed himself with flags strings of them the signalman on our high little narrow little bridge telescope jammed to his eye read out the letters of that order the quartermaster spun the infantine wheel the officer of the bridge rumbled requests down the speakingtube to the engineroom and away we fled to take up station at such and such a distance from our neighbours ahead and astern at such and such an angle on the admiral his bow or beam the end of it was a miracle to lay eyes the long line became four parallel lines of strength and beauty a mile and a quarter from flank to flank and thus we abode till evening two hundred yards or so behind us the ram of our next astern planed through the still water an equal distance in front of us lay the oily water from the screw of our next ahead so it was ordered and so we did as though glued into position but our captain took up the parable and bade me observe how slack we were by reason of recent festivities compared to what we should be in a few days now were all over the shop the ships havent worked together and stationkeeping isnt as easy as it looks later on i found this was perfectly true a varying strain one thing more than all the rest impresses the passenger on a queens ship she is seldom for three whole hours at the same speed the liner clear of her dock strikes her pace and holds it to her journeys end but the manofwar must always have two or three knots up her sleeve in case the admiral demands a spurt she must also be ready to drop three or four knots at the wave of a flag and on occasion she must lie still and meditate this means a varying strain on all the mechanism and constant strain on the people who control it i counted seven speeds in one watch ranging from eight knots to seventeen which with eleven was our point of maximum vibration at eight knots you heard the vicious little twinscrews jigitting like restive horses at seventeen they pegged away into the sea like a pair of shortgaited trotting ponies on a hard road but one felt even in dreams that she was being held back those who talk of a liners freedom from breakdown should take a horsepower boat and hit her and hold her for a fortnight all across the salt seas in club and coteries after a while i went to the galley to get light on these and other matters once forward of the deck torpedotubes you enter another and a fascinating world of seamengunners artificers cooks marines we had twenty and a sergeant ships boys signalmen and the general democracy here the men smoke at the permitted times and in clubs and coteries gossip and say what they please of each other and their superiors their speech is soft if everyone spoke aloud you could not hear yourself think on a cruiser their gestures are few if a man swung his arms about he would interfere with his neighbour their steps are noiseless as they pop in and out of the forward flats they are at all times immensely interesting and as a rule delightfully amusing their slang borrows from the engineroom the working parts of guns the drillbook and the last musichall song it is delivered in a tightlipped undertone the more excruciatingly funny parts without a shade of expression the first thing that strikes a casual observer is their superb health next their quiet adequateness and thirdly a grave courtesy but under the shell of the new navy beats the heart of the old all marryats immortals are there better fed better tended better educated but at heart unchanged i heard swinburne laying down the law to his juniors by the ashshoot chucks was there too inquiring in the politest manner in the world what a friend meant by spreading his limbs about the landscape and a lineal descendant of dispart fussed over a in gun that some one had been rude to they were men of the world at once curiously simple and curiously wily this makes the charm of the naval man of all ranks coming and going about their businesses like shadows not from the admiralty standpoint they were all keenly interested in the manoeuvres not from the admiralty standpoint but the personal many of them had served under one or other of the admirals and they enlightened their fellows as you shall later hear then night fell and our fleet blazed like a lot of chemists shops adrift as one truthfully put it six lights to each ship bewildering the tramps there was a cove of refuge by one of the forward in guns within touch of the traffic to the bridge the break of the focsle the crowded populations below and the light banter near the galley my vigil here was cheered by the society of a marine who delivered a lecture on the thickness of the skulls of the inhabitants of south america as tested by his own hands it ended thus an so i got ten days in one o their stinkin prisons fed me on grapes they did along with one o their own murderers funny people them south americans oh adnt killed any one we only skirmished through their bloomin suburbs lookin for fun like fun weve got all the fun we want growled a voice in the shadow a stoker had risen silently as a seal for a breath of air and stood chest to the breeze scanning the fleet lights ullo wots the matter with your condenser said the marine youd better take your mucky ands off them hammickcloths or youll be spoke to our bunkers said the figure addressing his grievance to the sealine are stuck all about like a lot o womens pockets theyre stuck about like a lot o bunionplasters thats what our bunkers are he slipped back into the darkness presently a signalman pattered by to relieve his mate on the bridge youll be ung said the marine who was a wit and by the same token something of a prophet not if youre anywhere in the crowd i wont was the retort always in a cautious dontwakehim undertone wot are you doin ere never you mind you go on up to the igh an lofty bridge an persecute your vocation my gawd i wouldnt be a signalman not for ever so when i met my friend next morning persecuting his vocation as sentry over the lifebuoy aft neither he nor i recognised each other but i owe him some very nice tales wheeling circling and returning next day both fleets were exercised at steam tactics which is a noble game but i was too interested in the life of my own cruiser unfolding hour by hour to be intelligently interested in evolutions all i remember is that we were eternally taking up positions at fifteen knots an hour amid a crowd of other cruisers all precisely alike all still as death each with a wedge of white foam under her nose wheeling circling and returning the battleships danced stately quadrilles by themselves in another part of the deep we of the light horse did barndances about the windy floors and precisely as couples in the ballroom fling a word over their shoulders so we and our friends whirling past to take up fresh stations snapped out an unofficial sentence or two by means of our bridgesemaphores cruisers are wondrous human in the afternoon the battleships overtook us their white upperworks showing like icebergs as they topped the sealine then we sobered our faces and the engineers had rest and at a wave of the admirals flag off lands end our fleet was split in twain one half would go outside ireland toying with the weight of the atlantic en route to blacksod bay while we turned up the irish channel to lough swilly there we would coal and wait for war after that it would be blind mans bluff within a three hundred and fifty mile ring of the atlantic we of lough swilly would try to catch the blacksod fleet which was supposed to have a rendezvous of its own somewhere out at sea before it could return to the shelter of the bay the experts of the lower deck there was however one small flaw in the rules and as soon as they were in possession of the plan of campaign the experts of the lower deck put their horny thumbs on it thus look ere their admiral as to go out from blacksod to some rendezvous known only to isself aint that so weve eard all that this from an impertinent new to war leavin a cruiser beind im blake most likely or blenheim to bring im word of the outbreak of ostilities aint that so get on what are you drivin at youll see when that cruiser overtakes im e as to navigate back to blacksod from is precious rendezvous to get ome again before we intercepts the beggar well now i put it to you whats to prevent im rendezvousin out slow in order to be overtook by that cruiser an rendezvousin back quick to blacksod before we intercepts im i dont see that is steamin rate is anywhere laid down you mark my word ell take precious good care to be overtook by that cruiser of is we wont catch im theres an ole in the rules an ell slip through i know im if you dont the voice went on to describe im the admiral of our enemy as a wily person who would make the admiralty sit up and truly it came out in the end that the other admiral had done almost exactly what his focsle friends expected he went to his rendezvous slowly was overtaken by his cruiser about a hundred miles from the rendezvous turned back again to blacksod and having won the game of pussy wants a corner played about in front of the bay till we descended on him then he was affable as he could afford to be explained the situation and i presume smiled there was a hole in the rules and he sailed all his fleet through it we of the northern squadron found lough swilly in full possession of a souwest gale and an assortment of dingy colliers lying where they could most annoy the anchoring fleet a collier came alongside with donkeyengines that would not lift more than half their proper load she had no bags no shovels and her crazy derrickboom could not be topped up enough to let the load clear our bulwarks so we supplied our own bags and shovels rearranged the boom put two of our own men on the rickety donkeyengines and fell to work in that howling wind and wet coaling a preparation for war as a preparation for war next day it seemed a little hard on the crew who worked like sailors there is no stronger term from time to time a redeyed black demon with flashing teeth shot into the wardroom for a bite and a drink cried out the number of tons aboard added a few pious words on the colliers appliances and our bunkers like a lot of bunionplasters the stoker had said and tore back to where the donkeyengines wheezed the bags crashed the shovels rasped and scraped the boom whined and creaked and the first lieutenant carved in pure jet said precisely what occurred to him before the collier cast off a fullblooded battleship sent over a boat to take some measurements of her hatch the boat was in charge of a midshipman aged perhaps seventeen though he looked younger he came dripping into the wardroom bloodless with livid lips for he had been invalided from the mediterranean full of malta fever and what are you in said our captain who chanced to pass by the victorious sir and a smart ship he drank his little glass of marsala swirled his dank boatcloak about him and went out serenely to take his boat home through the dark and the dismal welter now the victorious she is some fourteen thousand nine hundred tons and he who gave her her certificate was maybe ten stone two with a touch of malta fever on him the wardroom disported itself we cleaned up at last the first lieutenants face relaxed a little and some one called for the instruments of music out came two violins a mandoline and bagpipes and the wardroom disported itself among tunes of three nations till war should be declared in the middle of a scientific experiment as to how the ships kitten might be affected by bagpipes that hour struck and even more swiftly than pussy fled under the sofa the trim messjackets melted away the chaff ceased the hull shivered to the power of the steamcapstan the slapping of the water on our sides grew and we glided through the moored fleet to the mouth of lough swilly our orders were to follow and support another cruiser who had been already despatched towards blacksod bay to observe the enemy or rather that cruiser who was bearing news of the outbreak of war to the enemys fleet it was then midnight of the th of july by the rules of the game the main body could not move till noon of the th and the north atlantic cold and lumpy was waiting for us as soon as we had put out our lights then i began to understand why a certain type of cruiser is irreverently styled a commodious coffeegrinder we had the length of a smallish liner but by no means her dead weight so where the red duster would have driven heavily through the seas the white ensign danced and the twinscrews gave us more kick than was pleasant at halfpast five of a peculiarly cheerless dawn we picked up the big cruiser who had seen nothing stayed in her company till nearly seven and ran back to rejoin the fleet whom we met coming out of lough swilly about pm of thursday the th and the weather was vile once again we headed wnw in company at an average speed of between thirteen and fourteen knots on a straightaway run of three hundred and fifty miles toward the rockal bank and the lonely rock that rises out of the sea there the idea was that our enemy might have made this his rendezvous in which case we had hope of catching him en masse through that penitential day the little cruiser was disgustingly lively but all we took aboard was spray whereas the lowbowed battleships slugged their bluff noses into the surge and rose dripping like halftide rocks the flagship might have manoeuvred like half a dozen nelsons but i lay immediately above the twinscrews and thought of the quartermaster on the reeling bridge who was not allowed to lie down through the cabindoor i could see the decks dim with spray hear the bugles calling to quarters and catch glimpses of the uninterrupted life of the ship a shining face under a souwester a pair of sealegs cloaked in oilskins a hurrying signalman with a rolling and an anxious eye a warrant officer concerned for the proper housing of his quickfirers as they disappeared in squirts of foam or a lieutenant serenely reporting men and things present or correct behind all as the cruiser flung herself carelessly abroad great grey and slatecoloured scoops of tormented sea about midnight the scouting cruiser same we had left that morning on the lookout for the blake or the blenheim rejoined the fleet but the fleet might have gone down as one keel so far as one unhappy traveller was concerned by noon of july we had covered miles in twentyfour hours with never a sight of the enemy to cheer us and had reached the limit of our ground here we turned and on a front of twentyfour miles from wing to wing swept down miles southeastward to the offing of blacksod bay missed mercifully the weather began to improve and we had the sea more or less behind us it was when we entered on this second slant about three minutes after the fleet swung round that as though all men had thought it together a word went round our forecastle missed after dinner as they were smoking above the spitkids the doctrine was amplified with suitable language by the focsle experts and it was explained to me with a great certainty how the other side had outmanoeuvred us by means of the ole in the rules in other words he had been overtook by is cruiser precisely as the wiser heads had prophesied and even at that early stage of the game we had been sold there was no way of finding out anything for sure a big scouting cruiser slipped off again a little before dawn of the th and six or seven hours later was reported to be in sight with news of the enemy at this point there came as we learned later what you might call a hitch some unhappy signalman they assert misplaced a flag of a signal whereby it was caused to be believed that a cruiser had sighted the enemy where there was no enemy in that direction then the fleet gave chase and though the thing was abortive the run was a beautiful example of what the new navy can do at a pinch we discovered our mistake then i suppose we discovered our mistake about the enemy and hurried all together for blacksod bay in the hope of cutting him off arrived at the scattered islands near the mouth a cruiser was sent inside to see if any one was at home while the flagship bade the rest of us walk foreninst her while she considered on it meteorologically the weather was now glorious a blazing sun and a light swell to which the cruisers rolled lazily as hounds roll on the grass at a check nautically there was a good deal of thunder in the air everybody knew something had gone wrong and when the flagship announced that she was not at all pleased with the signalling throughout the fleet it was no more than every one expected now the flagship had some fifty or sixty signalmen and a bridge as broad as a houseboat and as clear as a ballroom our bridge was perhaps four feet broad the roar of a stokehold ventilatingfan placed apparently for that purpose carefully sucked up twothirds of every shouted order and between the bridge and the poop the luckless signalman for want of an overhead passage had to run an obstacle race along the crowded decks we owned six signalmen after watching them for a week i was prepared to swear that each had six arms and eight cinderproof eyes but the flagship thought otherwise i heard what the signalmen thought later on but that was by no means for publication highspeed scouting back came the cruiser with news that blacksod bay was empty meantime three other boats had been sent off to reinforce the racing cruiser whose constant business it was to keep touch with the enemy that monster did most of our highspeed scouting and several times at least saw something of the other side we were not so lucky with three secondclass friends we were ordered to patrol at twelve knots an hour on a six mile beat thirteen miles to the northeast of eagle island to fire a rocket if we saw anything of the enemy that night and to stay out till we were recalled when we reached our ground the sea was all empty save for one speck on the horizon that marked the next cruiser also patrolling a desolate and a naked shore broken into barren islands turned purplishgrey in the sunset and two lone lighthouses took up their duty we tramped up and down through that marvellous transparent dusk with more than the regularity of the metropolitan police there was no lawful night but a winecoloured twilight cut in half by the moontrack on the still water unless the enemy poled in punts under the shadow of the shore and the faint mist that lay along it he could not hope to creep round from the north unobserved the signalmen blessed their gods marine ones that they were away from the flagship the focsle and my friend the marine assured the signalmen that they would be infallibly hanged at the yardarm when we reached port and we all talked things over forward as the steady tramp continued i told you so es found an ole in the rules an slipped through it was the burden of our song we must have burned more coal than would ever be expedient in war and we saw imaginary hulls with great zeal till the glorious sunrise cut off from the battle peering over the nettings wet with dew and just as ignorant of events around us as we shall be when the real thing begins chapter ii entered suddenly about noon on sunday after the disconcerting fashion of cruisers one of our side flying the general recall and telling us to go down to the flag but when we reached that place we found neither flag nor battle ships but the powerful and the terrible who took us under their wing all six of us second and thirdclass cruisers till that point we had been sizeable ships but those two huge things dwarfed us to mean little tramps one never gets used to the bulk and height of these berserk campanias then we all began talking who knew anything about anything and who had dragged who round the walls of what our next astern gave us one slateful of information which was rather dizzying that a cruiser at that morning had reported to the battle fleet who had spent the night patrolling outside blacksod bay enemy to the westward that the fleet had given chase that the flagship had fired one gun when she came within three miles of the said enemy fifteen miles west of blacksod bay that the enemy had gone in to blacksod bay and he believed our own battleships had gone south to bantry i have already explained rudely what the enemy had done that was all we could then arrive at the fleet will learn no more when the real thing arrives i went forward to hear the text commented on sealawyers said the voice of unshaken experience weve been ad dont tell me we avent weve intercepted the beggar a young sealawyer began e was rendezvousin back to blacksod what were the rules anyow a voice cut in we wasnt fightin rules we was fightin a man i tell you weve been ad didnt i say so when we come round on that long slant from rockall way es got round us someow but look ere the signals make it out weve won e wont make it out weve won though both sidesll claim it thats what they always do when i was in and one went on to tell of other manoeuvres in which he had apparently taken a leading part while we jogged southward behind the powerful as far as the eastern entrance to berehaven but there were no battleships in bantry bay they had gone on to target practice and presently we cruisers dispersed among the headlands for the same business with orders to rendezvous a few miles south of the fastnet that wellworn milepost of the transatlantic liner almost infernal mobility no description will make you realise the almost infernal mobility of a fleet at sea i had seen ours called to all appearance out of the deep split in twain at a word and at a word sent skimming beyond the horizon strung out as vultures string out patiently in the hot sky above a dying beast flung like a lasso gathered anew as a riata is coiled at the saddle bow dealt out cardfashion over fifty miles of green table picked up shuffled and redealt as the game changed i had seen cruisers flown like hawks ridden like horses at a close finish and manoeuvred like bicycles but the wonder of their appearance and disappearance never failed the powerful spoke and in ten minutes the cruisersquadron had vanished each ship taking her own matches and sulphur to make a hell of her own and what that hell might be if worked at full power i could presently guess as we swung round a headland and the bugles began at this point the gunner became a person of importance in the navy each hour of the day has its king and the captains of the guns separated themselves a little from the common herd remember we were merely a thirdclass cruiser capable perhaps of slaying destroyers in a heavy sea but meant for the most part to scout and observe our armament consisted of eight fourinch quickfire wire guns the newest type two on the focsle four in the waist and two on the poop alternating with as many threepounder hotchkiss quickfirers three maxims adorned the low nettings their waterjackets were filled up from an innocent tinpot before the game began it looked like slaking the thirst of devils manslaying deviltries we found an eligible rock the tip of a greyish headland peopled by a few gulls the surge creaming along its base and a portion of this we made our target that we might see the effect of the shots and practise the men at firing on a waterline up came the beautiful solid brass cordite cartridges and the fourinch shells that weigh twentyfive pounds apiece the little threepounders as you know have their venomous shell and charge together like smallarm ammunition the filled belts of the maxims were adjusted and all these manslaying deviltries waked to life and peered over the side at the unsuspecting gulls it was still throughout the ship still as it will be when the real thing arrives from the upper bridge i could hear above the beat of the engines the click of the lieutenants scabbards why should men who need every freedom in action be hampered by an utterly useless sword the faint clink of a fourinch breech swung open the crisper snick of the little hotchkisss fallingblock and an impatient sewingmachine noise from a maxim making sure of its lockaction on his platform over my head the navigating officer was giving the ranges to the rock two thousand seven hundred yards sir two thousand seven hundred yards the order passed from gun to gun ten knots right deflection starboard battery the guncaptains muzzled the rubberfaced shoulderpieces and the long lean muzzles behind the shields shifted fractionally try a sighting shot with that threepounder the smack of cordite is keener and catches one more about the heart than the slowerburning black powder there was a shrillish gasping wail exactly like the preliminary whoop of an hysterical woman as the little shell hurried to the target and a puff of dirty smoke on the rockface sent the gulls flying so far as i could observe there was not even a haze round the lips of the gun till i saw the spent case jerked out i did not know which of the clean precise and devilish four had spoken when the real thing comes two thousand four hundred the voice droned overhead and the starboard bow fourinch quickfirer opened the ball again no smoke again the song of the shell not a shriek this time but a most utterly mournful wail again the few seconds suspense what will they be when the real thing comes and a white star on the target the cruiser winced a little as though some one had pinched her before the next gun had fired the empty cartridges cylinder of the first was extracted and by some sleight of hand i could not see the breech had closed behind a full charge a martinihenri could hardly have been reloaded more swiftly two thousand three hundred cried the reader of that days lessons and we fell seriously to work high shriek and low wail following in an infernal fugue through which with no regard for decency the maxims quacked and jabbered insanely the rock was splintered and ripped and gashed in every direction and great pieces of it bounded into the sea two thousand one hundred good shot oh good shot that was a waterliner that was the marines threepounder good ah ah bad damn bad short miles short who fired that shot a shell had burst short of the mark and the captain of that gun was asked politely if he supposed government supplied him with threepound shell for the purpose of shooting mackerel and so we went on till the big guns had fired their quota and the maxims ran out in one last fiends flurry and targetpractice for the month was over the rock that had been grey was white and a few shining cartridgecases lay beside each gun squirting death through a hose then the horror of the thing began to soak into me what i had seen was a slow peddlingout of admiralty allowance for the month and it seemed to me more like squirting death through a hose than any ordinary gunpractice what will it be when all the ammunitionhoists are working when the maxims waterjacket puffs off in steam when the threepounder charges come up a dozen at a time to be spent twenty to the minute when the sole limit of fourinch fire is the speed with which the shells and cases can be handled what will it be when the real thing is upon us and the smiling careless faces answered with one merry accord hell every kind of hell but things will happen in ancient days there was an etiquette in sea battles no lineofbattle ship fired at a frigate unless the latter deliberately annoyed her then she blew the frigate out of the water what will be the etiquette next time suppose a cruiser met a battleship with one set of engines unusable crawling along at eight knots would she jackal the lame thing and tempt her into wasting ammunition it is a risky game to play with sides no thicker than an average teatray but under circumstances it might be lucrative would she and a fast cruiser can do this try to rush her by night destroyerfashion at the beginning of the war she might do all sorts of things at the end of it she would take exactly that kind of liberty which experience of the other sides personnel had shown to be moderately safe there is no saying what she could or could not do in heavy weather and navies that do not like heavy weather tumblehome boats unused to working in a sea a beaky and a plated navy with big tops that roll and strain might suffer therefore we must pray for foul weather headseas and steep swells gale that bewilders cold that numbs and small fine rain that blinds chills and dispirits our men know them men who take their chances under these conditions the possibilities of a good seaboat are almost illimitable given always the men who know how to handle her the men who will take their chances and as in the army so in the navy runs the unwritten law you must not imperil the property of the taxpayer committed to your charge or you will be publicly broke but if you do not take every risk you can and more also you will be broke in the estimation of your fellows your men will not love you and you will never get on to do him justice the junior officer steers a very fair line between the two councils thanks to our destroyers which give him an independent command early in his career he studies a little ingenuity and artifice they are young on the destroyers the chattering black decks are no place for the middleaged they have learned how to handle ft of shod death that cover a mile in two minutes turn in their own length and leap to racing speed almost before a man knows he has signalled the engineroom in these craft they risk the extreme perils of the sea and make experiments of a kind that would not read well in print it would take much to astonish them when at the completion of their command they are shifted say to a racing cruiser they have been within spitting distance of collision and bumping distance of the bottom they have tested their craft in longdrawn channel gales not grudgingly or of necessity because they could not find harbour but because they wanted to know dont you know and in that embroilment have been very literally thrown together with their men enough to sober ulysses this makes for hardiness coolness of head and above all resource you realise it when you hear the dear boys talk among themselves the naval mans experience begins early and by the time he has reached his majority a sublieutenant should have seen enough to sober ulysses but he utterly refuses to be sobered there is no case on record of a depressed sub it takes three of him to keep one midshipman in order but the combined strength of the assistant engineer the doctor and the paymaster will not subdue one sublieutenant he goes his joyous way impartially and picturesquely criticising his elders and his betters diverse undulating and irrepressible but when he stands on the bridge at midnight and essays to keep the proper distance in front of the next steel ram dreamily muttering through the water ten knots an hour two hundred yards behind him why then the sub sweats big drops till he gets used to it let us suppose he is third in a line of four that the hour is near midnight and he has been on watch since eight so far we have kept our distance beautifully we have even sneered at the next line a mile away to the right where they have once or twice been all over the shop in twenty minutes there will come relief a bowl of hot cocoa three pulls at a pipe and blessed bed the sub watches the speedlights of the next ahead for as those lanterns change so must he adjust his pace but the next ahead is using up all the basest coal she can find and the wind blows not less than two million samples of it into his straining eyes he has he had the distance absolutely correct he would swear to it the quartermaster by the tiny wheel half heaves up one big shoulder till that moment he has given no sign of life the subs heel taps impatiently on the planking his mouth hovers over the engineroom voice tube his lips open to speak to the quartermaster in case in case it should be necessary to sheer out of line for something has gone wrong with the next ahead she has badly overrun her station and sheers to the left of our leading ship the sub wipes the cinders out of his left eye and says something now begins the fun now begins the fun the leading ship has slowed a certain number of revolutions say from ten knots to nine and a half but she has not changed her speedlights in time we slide out to the right of our next ahead swiftly and quietly and now we must all mark time as it were till our leader straightens herself that which was a line has suddenly become a town on the waters representing roughly threequarters of a million sterling in value ten thousand tons weight and eight hundred lives our next ahead lies on our port bow and oh horror our next astern is alongside of us heaven send that the captain may not choose this hour to wake the sub has slowed her down to eightyfive but engines are only engines after all and they cannot obey on the instant meantime we can see into the chartroom of her that should have lain behind us a navigating lieutenant sprawled half over the table cap tilted over forehead to keep out the glare of the lamp is poring on a chart we can hear the officer of the watch on her bridge speaking to his quartermaster and there comes over to us a whiff of navy tobacco she is slowing she has slowed with a vengeance and when ships slow too much they lose steerageway and what is far worse they wake the captain this strikes the sub with lurid clearness but the impetus of the recent ten knots is on us all and we are all going much faster than we think again his foot taps the deck are they never going to slow are they never going to slow in the engineroom the pointer on the dial before the quartermaster moves through some minute arc and our head falls off to the left it is excessively lonely on this high and lofty bridge and the spindleshaped hull beneath looks very unmanageable our next ahead draws away slowly from our port bow and we continue at a safe distance to starboard of her the line is less of a lump and more of a diagonal than it was our next astern is sliding back to where she belongs now two revolutions at a time the sub lets us out till he sees our erring sister ahead return to her place and joyfully slinks in behind her the sub mops his heated brow thanking heaven that the captain didnt wake up and that the tangle was straightened before the end of the watch but speedlights unless properly handled as ours are handled are he doubts not an invention of the devil so also is the fleet so are all cruisers and the sea and everything connected therewith now comes the judgment our leader of course cannot signal back down her line but the signal must be repeated from the leading ship of the line to starboard thus you see we read it diagonally a dull glow breaks out at the masthead of that transmitter of wiggings and a wigging it is for somebody a wigging in drunken winks long and short ones irresistibly comic if you dont happen to be in the service once again we are saved the avenging electric spells out the name of our next ahead a secondclass cruiser and then why dont you keep station let us thank god for secondclass cruisers and all other lightningconductors the middle watch comes up the sub demands of the stars and the deep profound about him who wouldnt sell a farm and go to sea descends the bridge in one lighthearted streak and three minutes later is beautifully asleep the ships kitten purring under his left ear but the captain was awake all the time the change of speed roused him and he lay watching the telltale compass overhead his mouth at the bridge voicetube one eye cocked through the open port and one leg over the edge of the bunk in case the sub must learn his business by himself must find confidence in isolation precisely as the captain did a quarter of a century ago it is not good for him to know that he is being watched next morning the captain makes a casual allusion to massed fleets in line of sixes and sevens it was our next ahead sir says the sub deferentially yes it was the next ahead when i was a sub is the reply i know that next ahead then the wardroom to whom the sub has been confiding the success of his manoeuvres ask him whether he got to windward of the owner much how the sub gets learning and that is one of the ways in which youth gets learning on a big battleship they tell me the sub is little better than the midshipmen he despises he lives in the gunroom he goes to school he is sent on errands and if he is good he is allowed to preserve discipline while a fraction of the decks are being washed but on a thirdclass cruiser he is a watchofficer an ornament of the wardroom pitched into responsibility and he enjoys himself as i have tried to show chapter iii apropos of signals to go on where i left off we were to have more than enough of them after targetpractice we finished first of all the cruisers and went on to our rendezvous the fastnet but if we had listened to the passenger he wanted to lower a boat and investigate the shattered rock we should have been spared many sorrows but we were zealous mr simple and we went to the fastnet and it was hazy and through the haze we heard a horrible elemental moaning that should have warned us the battleships which we had not found at bantry were scattered about those waters at their practice then i remembered that a twelveinch gun discharges a projectile weighing some lb and ranging about ten miles and we went to the rendezvous encircled by these deep mutterings of invisible monsters and behold we came slap on the flagship who was running torpedoes any other of the big ones would not have mattered but our luck sent us to the flag there was a feeling of calamity in the thick air and i know one man who was not in the least relieved when she signalled where are you bound we replied we were waiting as ordered on that spot for the rest of the cruisers and remained in a deferential attitude while the flagship maintained her horrible composure our fatal mistake thinking no harm we drifted some two miles to leeward which was our fatal mistake though we kept a skinned eye on her presently we saw a signal but end on as flags are apt to be when the signaller is dead up wind and the signallee down we hung our answering pennant at the dip to show that we saw but could not understand and scuttled up to the flagship as fast as might be the first part of the signal was an order to close and the second expressed a desire to speak to us by semaphore our signalmens faces were studies in gloom about this crisis and the sad moaning of the guns went on afar we learned that the flag had been trying to attract our attention for some time and did not appreciate our neglige deshabille or words to that effect there is no excuse in the navy and we took what was served out to us by the gibbering semaphore in silence standing at attention to tell the truth we had been rather pleased with our targetpractice and this sudden dash of cold water chilled us but there is a reason for all things now we must signal the name of the officer of the watch frantic searchings of heart among the officers and the signalman the signalmen had got beyond even despair on duty on friday morning last what the nature of their crime was we knew not and it was not ours to ask but later we heard it had something to do with somebody elses error we gave that information the flag could have learned much more if she had asked for it and i effaced myself with a great effacement forward where the wits of the focsle were telling the signalman of friday morning what sorts of death and disrating awaited him weve lost the game weve lost the game said one man first come first served that shows it and with this dark saying i was forced to be content then the flag removed herself her sixty signalmen her fourdeep strings of signals and her grim semaphore truly was it written every day brings a ship every ship brings a word well for him who has no fear looking seaward well assured that the word the vessel brings is the word that he would hear anon the cruisers popped over the horizon led by the powerful all save one and the powerful wished to know where that one had gone now the rendezvous given us by the powerful could have been read in two ways we all knew how the mistake had arisen and with one exception had all repaired to the place which our leader had in her massive mind but there was no ship of course that could stand up to and gently rebuke the powerful save her sister ship the terrible who signalled politely i suppose the is waiting at rendezvous signalled by you to this the powerful stiffly with many flags when ships have any doubt about signal officers should reply not understood the terrible more politely than ever your signal perfectly understood meaning thereby my friend you made a mistake and you jolly well know it we small craft stood back and sniggered while this chaff flew between the two mammoths the thing must have weighed on the powerfuls mind for late that evening as we were going home she woke up and began talking about it in flashes from the masthead to the effect that when signals were obviously wrong ships should do something or other laid down in the regulations astonishing the crowded channel traffic but really it made no difference the missing cruiser cast up presently with one funnel blistered and a windsail rigged aft which gave her a false air of being hurried and hot and home we cruisers all went to portland past the wolf and the toothed edges of the scillies astonishing the crowded channel traffic sometimes a jersey potatoketch full of curiosity or a fullrigged trader of the deep sea bound for one or other of the capes a norwegian dane german or frenchman and now and again a whitesided brass bejewelled yacht for a few minutes every funnel was in line then one saw the powerful pulling out for a sailing ship and blotting half the horizon with her hull then a secondclass cruiser would flicker from the line to starboard all spangled with her masthead her speed helm and sailinglights as the pale glimmer of a fishingsmacks lantern crawled out astern of her and now it was our turn to give way that was a royal progress no blind mans bluff off the lizard or dreary game of hunttheneedles such as the liners play but through the heavenly clear night the leisurely rolling slowmarch of the overlords of all the seas ours by right of birth and the whole thing was my very own that is to say yours mine to me by right of birth mine were the speed and power of the hulls not here only but the world over the hearts and brains and lives of the trained men such strength and such power as we and the world dare hardly guess at and holding this power in the hollow of my hand able at the word to exploit the earth to my own advantage to gather me treasure and honour as men reckon honour i and a few million friends of mine forbore because we were white men any other breed with this engine at their disposal would have used it savagely long ago in our hands it lay as harmless as the levinrods of the vrilya thus i stood astounded at my own moderation and counted up my possessions with most sinful pride the wind and the smell of it off the coasts was mine and it was telling me things it would never dream of confiding to a foreigner the short hollow channel sea was mine bought for me drop by drop every salt drop of it in the last eight hundred years as short a time as it takes to make a perfect lawn in a cathedral close the speech on the deck below was mine for the men were free white men same as me only considerably better their notions of things were my notions of things and the bulk of those notions we could convey one to the other without opening our heads things one takes for granted we had a common tradition one thousand years old of the things one takes for granted a warrant officer said something and the groups melted quietly about some job or other that same caste of man that same type of voice was speaking in the commissariat in burma in barracks in rangoon under double awnings in the persian gulf on the rock at gibraltar wherever else you please and the same instant obedience i knew would follow on that voice and a foreigner would never have understood will never understand but i understood as you would have understood had you been there i went round to make sure of my rights as a taxpayer under schedule d saw my men in my hammocks sleeping without shading their eyes four inches from the white glare of my electric heard my stokers chaffing each other at my ashshoot and fetched up by a petty officer who was murmuring fragments of the riot act into my subordinates attentive ear when he had entirely finished the task in hand he was at liberty to attend to me hope youve enjoyed your trip sir you see i knew what was coming we havent quite shaken down yet in another three months we shall be something like no ship is ever at her best till you leave her then you hold her up as a shining example to your present craft for that is england my marine the skirmisher in south american suburbs stood under the shadow of the poop looking like a stuffed man with an automatic arm for saluting purposes but i knew him on the human side goin off tomorrow aint you sir well there are only twenty of us ere but if you ever want to see the marines a lot of em it might perhaps be worth your while to and he gave me the address of a place where i would find plenty of marines he spoke as though his nineteen friends were noclass animals and a foreigner would have taken him at his word a commodious coffeegrinder the entire wardroom explained carefully that their commodious coffeegrinder must not be taken as a sample of the navy at its best wasnt she a good seaboat oh yes remarkably so couldnt she go on occasion oh yes she could go but after all she wasnt a patch on certain other craft being only a thirdclass cruiser practically an enlarged destroyer a tinpot of the tinniest now in my last ship the captain began that was an unlucky remark for i remembered that last ship and a certain first night aboard her in the long swell of simons bay when the captain took heaven and earth and the admiralty to witness that of all clutteredup boxes of machinery and bags of tricks his new command was the worst to hear him now she must have been a trifle larger than the majestic with twice the powerfuls speed we are a deceptive people come and see us next year when weve shaken down a bit said the wardroom and youll like it better that last was impossible but i accepted the offer our cruiser was about to refit at some dockyard or other in a few days and i gathered that it would be no fault of the captain the wardroom or the warrant officers if she did not arrive with a list of alterations and improvements as long as her mainmast so it is with every new ship the dear boys take her out to see what she can do and in that process discover what she cannot do if by any arrangement or rearrangement of stay stanchion davit steampipe bridge boatchocks or hatchway she can in their judgment be improved rest assured that the dockyard will know it by letter and voice she never gets more than half what she wants and so is careful to apply for thrice her needs discontented and impenitent thieves to her just and picturesque demands the yard opposes the suspicion of centuries saying unofficially you are all a set of discontented and impenitent thieves go away the ship considering her own comfort and wellbeing for the rest of the commission replies also unofficially ah youre thinking of the soandso she a nest of pirates if you like but were good were the most upright ship you ever clapped eyes on and youre the finest yard in the kingdom youre up to all the ropes theres no getting round you and youll pass our indents we wont give you any trouble just a few minor repairs and our own people will carry them out dont disturb yourself in the least send the stuff alongside and well attend to it and when the stuff comes alongside in charge of a slowminded understrapper they do attend to it they talk the man blind and dumb sack his cargoes and turn him adrift to study vouchers at his leisure then the first lieutenant grins like a cheshire cat the carpenter so called because he very rarely deals with wood the armourer and the firstclass artificers sweat with joy and the workshop lathes buzz and hum but the understrapper gets particular beans because a great part of his stuff was meant for another ship and she is very angry about it stolen paint late in the afternoon the defrauded vessel sends over a boat to the early and wants to know if she has seen or heard anything of some oak baulks a new gangway grating some brasswork and a few drums of white paint why was that yours says the first lieutenant we thought it was ours well it isnt its ours where is it im awfully sorry but i say wont you come and have a drink they come just in time to see the brass rods in position the oak baulks converted into some sort of boatfurniture the gangway platform receives their weary feet and a fine flavour of paint from a flat forward tells them all they will ever know of the missing drums then they call the first lieutenant a pirate and he poor lamb says that he was misled by the chuckleheaded understrapper who brought the stuff alongside words cannot express the first lieutenants contrition it is too bad too bad but you know what asses these dockyard chaps can be with soft words and occasional gin and bitters he coaxes the visitors into their boat again for he has studied diplomacy under west african kings they return to their own place being young and guileless and their reception is not cordial their captain says openly that he has not one adequate thief in the ship and that they had better go into the church they should have captured the understrapper early in the day he will speak to the other captain and he does like a brother next time he meets him galley passing galley going to call on the admiral you infernal old pirate what have you done with my paint cries the robbed one me sar not me sar my brother manuel sar that paint mafeesh done gone finish kerritch hogya this from the other potentate the coxswains duck their heads to hide a grin and that is one of the ways they have in the navy see note i the early bird departs with a reputation that would sink a slavedhow to try the same trick on hong kong or bombay yard a blissful fortnight this and more oh much more did my friends fore and aft convey to me in that blissful fortnight when i was privileged to watch their labours i heard undilutedly what a boy thinks of punishment and the man who reported him for it how a carpenter regards a dockyard matey what are the sentiments of a signaller towards an admiral and of a stoker towards the authorities who have designed his washing accommodation i overheard in the darkness of beautiful nights fragments of greek drama from the forward flats which it is my lifes regret that i cannot make public lectures on all manner of curious things delivered by the ships jester and totally unveracious reports of conversations with superiors retailed by a delinquent marine fire and collisiondrill general quarters and the like take on new meaning when they are translated for you once by the head who orders them and again by the tail who carry them out when you have been shown lovingly over a torpedo by an artificer skilled in the working of its tricky bowels torpedoes have a meaning and a reality for you to the end of your days men live there next time you see the blue ashore you do not stare unintelligently you have watched him on his native heath you know what he eats and what he says and where he sleeps and how he is no longer a unit but altogether such an one as yourself only as i have said better the naval officer chance met rather meek and selfeffacing in tweeds at a tennis party is a priest of the mysteries you have seen him by his altars with the navigating lieutenant on the igh an lofty bridge persecuting his vocation you have studied stars masthead angles rangefinders and such all the first lieutenant has enlightened you on his duties as an upper housemaid see note ia and the juniors have guided you through the giddy whirl of gunnery smallarm drill getting up an anchor and taking kinks out of a cable so it comes that next time you see even far off one of her majestys cruisers all your heart goes out to her men live there chapter iv it was the captains coxswain see note ii precise immaculate and adequate as ever who met the returning guest at devonport a year later september this time my cruiser was not with the fleet but on urgent private affairs a misguided collier had seen fit to sit on her ram for a minute or so in milford haven a few days before and had twisted it thirteen inches to starboard the collier was beached as soon as possible and the admiral he said to us this i got from the coxswain as we drove to north corner by night through bluejacketed devonport can you go round to plymouth with your nose in that state lord love you yes said we or words to that effect very good said the admiral then you go this we did at an average speed of sixteen knots through a headsea with a collisionmat over our nose same mat we used when we tied up the thrasher sir and we ran her up to eighteen point two for a few hours to see how the bulkhead would stand it the carpenter and the carpenters mate yes theyre the same as last year sir sat up to watch but nothing happened an now were under orders to go back and join the fleet at bantry weve been cruising all round england since august the record of a year once aboard the lugger the past twelve months rolled up like a chart that one needs no longer the commodious coffeegrinder welcomed me as a brother for by good luck no one had been changed the same faces greeted me in the little wardroom and we fell to chattering like children had i seen the new fore and aft bridge that we had managed to screw out of the dockyard a great contraption a superior contraption we had worked in a little extra deck under the forebridge so that now the signalman had a place to stand in which i would remember was not the case last year had i heard of our new coaling record nearly fifty tons per hour which for a thirdclass cruiser represented four times that amount for a battleship had i heard of the zephyr that blew at funchal of unrecorded evolutions in minorca bay of the first lieutenants great haul of paint of a recent targetpractice when nothing was left of the target of the influenza that overtook the steamwhistle and a hundred other vital matters the record of a year with the channel fleet is not to be told in two hours but i gathered a good deal ere i dropped into my wellremembered berth that joyous night we departed at noon the next day unhampered by signals a liner leaves plymouth in one style a cruiser snakes out from devonport in quite another which was explained to me on the igh an lofty bridge as we skated round buoy after buoy courteously pulled out a little not to interfere with a yacht race and ran through the brownsailed plymouth fishing fleet it was divine weather still cloudless and blue and the bridge was of opinion that he who had a farm should sell it and forthwith go to sea our noble selves the cornwall coast slid past us in great greyblue shadows laid out beyond the little strip of saildotted blue but my eyes were all inboard considering our noble selves we had accumulated all sorts of small improvements since last year she had shaken into shape as a new house does when one has decided where to put the furniture the first lieutenant as usual explained that we were in no sense clean that twenty ton at least of the four hundred we had just taken in lay about the deck in dust and that it would cost a fortnight to put any appearance on her were supposed to be burning no welsh its road sweepings and soot really thats on account of the welsh coal strike isnt it filthy we smoked out the whole of the fleet and the rock of gibraltar the other day but wait till you see some of the others theyre worse isnt she a pukka pigsty from the landsmans point of view she seemed offensively clean but it is hard to please a first lieutenant ours utilised the delay at devonport to touch her up outside and the perfect weather at bantry to paint her thoroughly inside the only time he left her was to pull round her in a boat and see how she looked from various points of view then i think he was satisfied for nearly half a day rash interest in gun practice over against falmouth we found the sea sufficiently empty for gun practice and went to work at two thousand six hundred yards on the little triangular canvas target all splintered and bepatched from past trials this year the threepounders were using up some black powder ammunition and with the wind behind us we were villainously wrapped in smoke but for all that the shots were very efficiently placed on and about the tiny mark one shrapnel burst immediately above the thing and the deep was peppered with iron from above it looked like the cloudwristed hand of a god as they draw it in the dutch picturebooks dropping pebbles into a pond the more one sees of big gun practice the less one likes it but a big yacht of the rys thought otherwise streaming down on us of a sudden with all the rash interest of a boy in nextdoors fireworks she thinks the target is a derelict said the bridge shes coming for salvage shell be right in the middle of it in a minute no she wont starboard bow maxim there thirteen hundred yards the little demon set up the irritating stammer that the nine point two gun found so objectionable and spattered up the blue all about the canvas as a swizzlestick works up a cocktail our friend turned on her heel with immense promptitude and scuttled to windward later on i heard some interesting tales of craft excursion steamers for choice anchoring between a manofwar and her target because their captains had heard that there would be gun practice and the passengers at a shilling a head wished to see the fun but they didnt think said my informant that i was the man whod have been hung drawn and quartered if a life was lost they anchored slap behind the island i was firing at experimental firing at a dummy gun if you please with sixinchers twelvepounders and maxims all turned loose together they were angry when we told em to go away out of the strongshouldered atlantic swell bluer than sapphires rose the doublefanged rock of the fastnet we were close enough to see its steps and derricks and each wave as it shot thirty feet up the rocks the fastnet in fair weather it was like meeting a policeman in evening dress one does not think of the fastnet save as a blessed welcoming wink of light through storm and thick weather big atlantic rollers the irish coast is a neverfailing surprise to the big atlantic rollers they trip and ground you can see them check on the shallows fling up a scornful eyebrow and then lose their temper and shape in great lashings of creamy foam thats berehaven said the bridge indicating an obscure aperture in the jagged coastline we shall find the fleet round the corner the tides setting us up a little did you ever read the two chiefs of dunboy we shall open dunboy house in a minute round the corner and a halfnine sang the leadsman cursing the longstocked portanchor under his breath for he had to cast to one side of it and it stuck out like a cats whiskers we were between two rocky beaches split and weathered by all the gales of the atlantic black boulders embroidered with golden weed and beryl bays where the rollers had lost their way and were running in rings behind them the green tinyfielded land dotted with white cottages climbed up to the barren purple hills ah the arrogants here anyhow see her puff the strongest fleet in the world a monstrous plume of black heavy smoke went up to the sky we whipped round a buoy and came on the fleet there were eight battleships alike as peas to the outsider and four big cruisers they were not cruising or manoeuvring just then but practising their various arts and crafts the marines fell in on the poop and with bugles and all proper observances we paid our compliments as we ran past the sterns of the cruisers waiting the admirals word to moor hes given us a billet of our own under his wing too an officer shot down on to the focsle while the yeoman of signals whose nose is that of a hawk kept an unshut eye on the flag isnt there a fourfoot patch somewhere about here said a calm and disinterested voice the navigator having brought her in did not need to wrestle with cables and our anchors with their low cramped davits are no treat we told em about our anchors in the dockyard said the bridge we told em so distinctly and they said were very much obliged to you for the information and well make the changes you recommend in the next boat of your class thats what i call generosity does that ship always behave like that i asked from all three funnels of a high stubby cruiser the smoke of a london factory insulted the clean air oh no shes only burning muckings like the rest of us shes our chummy ship shes a new type she and the furious fleet rams they call em rather like porcupines arent they the two had an air of bristling hogbacked ferocity strangely out of keeping with the normal reserve of a manofwar the blake long and low looked meek and polite beside them but i was assured that she could blow them out of the water their own captains of course thought otherwise ashore in ireland all ireland was new to me and i went ashore to investigate castletowns street of white houses to smell peat smoke and find dan murphy owner of a jaunting car and ancient friend of the wardroom in this quest me and the navigator mustered not less than half the male population of cork county the remainder being osullivans but we found dan at last old grizzled with an untameable eye voluble and beautifully celtic will i meet ye tomorrow at mill cove at ninethirty i will heres my hand an word on it will i dhrive ye to glenbeg for the fishing i will theres my hand an word on it do i mean it dont i know the whole livin fleet man an boy for years he appeared at the appointed hour with a rawboned horse and wonderful yarns of trout taken by the other gentlemen in glenbeg the lough of our desire fourteen miles across the hills it was a cloudless day with a high wind bad for trout but good for the mere joy of life and the united ages of my companions reached fortyfive we were quite respectable till we cleared castletown and such libertymen as might have been corrupted by our example then we sang and hung on to the car at impossible angles and swore eternal fidelity to the barefooted damosels on the road they being no wise backward to return our vows and behaved ourselves much as all junior officers do when they escape on holiday it was a land of blue and grey mountains of raw green fields stonefenced ribbed with black lines of peat and studded with clumps of gorse and heather and the portercoloured pools of bog water great islanddotted bays ran very far inland and bounding all to westward hung the unswerving line of atlantic such a country it was as without much imagination one could perceive its children in exile would sicken for a land of small holdings and pleasant green ways where nobody did more work than was urgent roaring day of sun and wind at last we came on an inkyblack tarn shut in by mountains locked and lonely and lashed into angry waves by a downwardsmiting blast there was no special point in the fishing not even when the sublieutenant tried to drown himself but the animal delight of that roaring day of sun and wind will live long in one memory we had it all to ourselves the rifted purple flank of lackawee the long vista of the lough darkening as the shadows fell the smell of a new country and the tearing wind that brought down mysterious voices of men from somewhere high above us none but the irish can properly explain away failure we left with our dozen fingerlings under the impression mister cornelius crowley gave it that we had caught tenpounders chapter v so home blown through and through with fresh air sore with hanging on to the car and laughing at nothing to dine with two cruiser captains aboard one of the big fleetrams my hosts had been friends since their britannia days it is this uniformity of early training that gives to the navy its enduring solidarity and one reminiscence leading to another i listened enchanted to weird yarns in which chinese mandarins west coast nigger chiefs archimandrites turkish pashas calabrian counts dignity balls chilian beachcombers and all the queer people of the earth were mingled but its a lonely life a lonely life said one ive commanded a ship since eighty something and you see how could one help seeing between the aftercabin and the rest of the world with very few exceptions lies the deep broad gulf that is only overpassed by sentries signalmen and subordinates entering with reports a light tap a light foot a doffed cap and rounds all correct sir then the silence and the loneliness settle down again beyond the hanging red curtain in the white steel bulkhead herman melville has it all in white jacket but it is awesome to see with bodily eyes sometimes the talk gets serious and the weatherbitten faces discuss how they would work her in a row each delivers his opinion with sidedigs at his neighbour less heavily armoured or more lightly gunned but the general conclusion which i shall not give is nearly always the same it is a terrible power that they wield these captains for saving the admiral there is no one that can dictate to them in the exercise of their business they make their ships as they make or unmake the careers of their men yet mark how providence arranges an automatic check it is in the navy that you hear the wildest and freest adjectives of any service the most blistering characterisation of superiors the most genuinely comic versions of deeds that elsewhere might be judged heroic a service of humourists things are all too deadly serious and important for any one to insult by taking seriously every branch of the service is forced to be a humourist in spite of itself and by the time men reach the rank of captain the least adaptable have some saving sense of fun hammered into them a captain remembers fairly well what song the midshipmen were used to sing about the lieutenant what views he held in his own lieutenancy of his commander and what as a commander he thought of his captain if he forgets these matters as in heat on lonely stations or broken with fever some men do then god help his ship when she comes home with a crop of courtmartials and all hands half crazy but to go back to methods of attack you can hear interesting talk among the juniors when you sit on a mans bunk of an afternoon surrounded by the home photographs with the tinbath and the shoregoing walking sticks slung up overhead they are very directly concerned in war for they have charge of the guns and they speculate at large and carelessly we i speak for our cruiser are not addicted to swear in the words of the torpedo lieutenant because we do not carry those fittings but we do all devoutly believe that it is the business of a cruiser to shoot much and often see note iii what follows is of course nonsense the merest idle chaff of equals over cigarettes but rightly read it has its significance the first thing to do says authority aged twentyone is to be knocked silly by concussion in the conningtower then you revive when all the other chaps are dead and win a victory off your own bat a la illustrated papers wake up in haslar a month later with your girl swabbing your forehead and telling you youve wiped out the whole fleet catch me in the conningtower not much says twentythree those bowguns of yours will stop every shot that misses it an the upper bridge will come down on you in three minutes dont see that youre any better off in the waist youd get the funnels and ventilators and all the upper fanoodleums on top of you anyhow is the retort were a lot too full of wood even with our boats out of the way the poops good enough for me says twentyfour that is his station fine light airy place and we can get our ammunition handier than you can forward whats the use of that says he in charge of the bow guns youve got those beastly deck torpedotubes just under you fancy a whitehead smitten on the nose by one little shell youd go up sod you shed blow the middle out of herself if they took those tubes away we could have a couple more fourinchers there thered be heaps of room for their ammunition in the torpedo magazine guns and torpedoes we are blessed with a pair of deck torpedotubes which weigh about ten tons and are the bane of our lives our class is a compromise and the contractors have generously put in a little bit of everything but public opinion except the gunner is unanimous in condemning those dangerous and hampering tubes torpedoes are all rot on this class unless theyre submerged two more fourinchers ud be a lot better theyre as handy as duckguns i say did you see that last shrapnel of mine burst over the target i laid it myself twentythree looks round for applause but the other guns deride thats all luck says twentyone irreverently mine burst just beyond it would have been dead right for an endon shot it would have snifted her just on the engineroom hatch sound place that it mixes up the engines mahan says somewhere that broadside fighting is going to pay with our low freeboards because most shots go wrong in elevation of course broadsideon a shell that misses you misses you clean it dont go hopping along your upper works as it would if you were endon oh i meant my shot for an endon shot of course says twentyone and some one promptly sits on him bearing in a gale noo says twentyfour meditatively what we really want if we ever go into a row is weather lots of it good old gales regular smellers then we could run in and beak em while its thick i believe in beaking that belief by the way is curiously general in the navy dyou mean to say youd ram with a teatray like ours im glad you arent the skipper i interrupt oh hed beak like a shot if he saw his chance of course he wouldnt beak anything our size it ud be cheaper to hammer her but take the he named a ship that does not fly our flag if you got in on her almost anywhere shed turn turtle and she cost about a million and a quarter its just a question of lsd and what ud we do afterwards please ah thats our strong point what happened when that collier drifted down on us at milford it only improved our steaming power didnt it were a regular honeycomb of compartments forward i believe you could swipe off twenty foot of her forward and shed get home somehow says an expert enthusiastically bit risky says twentyone that ship you talked of is awfully plated up topside but all her underpinnings are pretty weak if you could lob in a few shell under some of those forward sponsons of hers i believe shed crumple up with the weight of her own guns but sorrowfully youd need a nine point two to do that properly beak her beak her catch her in a gale coming out of harbour the speaker named the very port it takes their people a week to get their tummies straight yes but they never come out of harbour at least they didnt in the old days and if they do we shant be allowed a lookin we shall be used for scouting coaling all day and steaming all night but we want those decktubes taken out all the same id like targetpractice every week says another say four times our present allowance of practiceammunition it ud wear the guns out but it ud pay and so the talk goes on varying with each ship some of them are all for torpedoes and have submarine vaults the size of a small church devoted to this game but we being what we are are mainly for guns and the gunner who is in charge of the torpedoes has a hard time of it when he runs his quarterly trials a beautiful thing says he as the silvercoloured devil flops from the tube and tears away towards the mark well im blowed the torpedo has sheered away to the left and now is poisoning the air with its garlicscented holmes light fifty yards from the target what did i tell you says some one sotto voce we could have got in a dozen shots from the four inch while you were touching off that boomerang theyd hang you on the if you laughed at torpedoes i wouldnt if ours were submerged but with these decktubes one never knows how theyll take the water that thing must have canted as it fell the gunner looks grieved to the quick but is presently consoled by a few score pounds of guncotton and goes off with grapnels and batteries to practise sweeping and creeping at the mouth of the bay with a few score other boats they mine and countermine expeditiously in the channel fleet the process is a technical one and need not be described here for there is no necessity to make public either the area covered with mines or the time that it took to lay them the gunner returned with a detailed account and some fish that had been stunned by concussion it was a nice little show he said a very nice little show did you happen to see our smoke i had seen one end of bantry bay ripped up from its foundations but did not inquire farther man and arm boats many things are impressive and not a few terrifying in the fleet but the most impressive sight of all is the swift castingforth from the trim black sides of the instruments and ministers of death they vary hourly according to the taste and fancy of the speller a wisp of signals floats from the flagship our little cruiser erupts boils like a hive and some one takes out a watch there is a continuous low thunder of bare feet a clatter always subdued of arms snatched from the racks a creaking of falls and blocks and the noise of iron doors opening and shutting of a sudden the decks stand empty the maxims have gone from the bulwarks and the big cutters are away pulling mightily for the flagship from each one of our twelve neighbours pour forth the silent crowded boats they cluster round the flag are looked over and return they are not merely boats with men in them they are fully provisioned the larger ones have boatguns the smaller maxims with a proper allowance of ammunition and spare parts medical chests and all the hundred oddments necessary for independent action all or any one of them can be used at once for patrol work or for landing parties can be switched off from the main system as a light engine is switched off up a siding each unit is complete and selfcontained in ten minutes the boats are back again the maxims replaced the rifles stacked and racked the provisions and water returned to store the ordinary routine of man and arm boats is over landing parties another signal see note iv will turn out transport land embark and disembark three thousand armed men with twentyone field guns in the inside of three hours leaving six thousand men in the ships to carry on if necessary the work of a bombardment or you can vary the programme and load a mere thousand or so into eight identical doublefunnelled fifteenknot steam launches one from each battleship and play miniature fleetmanoeuvres to your hearts content they are as used to performing evolutions together as are their big parents they can tow halfadozen cutters apiece and work in four feet of water as an experiment you can land your twentyonefield guns with sufficient men to throw up earthworks round them or you can yoke men to the guns and drag them up the flanks of mountains or as in mining operations you can turn loose all hell with a string to it pay it out and swiftly drag it back again one never wearies of watching the outrush and influx of the landing parties the swift flight of the boats the minutes check at the beach the torrents of blue and red pouring over the bows and the looseknit line of mingled red and blue winding away inland among the boulders and heather long practice so perfectly conceals art that the thing presents no points of the picturesque makes no noise calls for no more comment than the set of the waves before a prevailing wind only when you go over certain ms books giving the name station and duties of every man aboard under all conceivable contingencies do you realise how wheel works within wheel to the ordered effortless end superior and adequate persons you can disarrange the clockwork as much as you please but the surviving cogs and rachets will still go on and finish the job for i do honestly believe that if any accident removed from the fleet every single commissioned officer the warrant and petty officers would still carry on with resource and fertility of invention till properly relieved the public is apt to lump everything that does not carry the executive curl on its coatsleeve as some sort of common sailor but a man of twentyfive years sea experience cool temperate and judgmatic such an one as the ordinary warrant officer is a better man than you shall meet on shore in a long days march his word is very much law forward he knows his men if possible better than the officers he has seen tried approved and discarded hundreds of dodges and tricks in all departments of the ship at a pinch he can wring the last ounce out of his subordinates by appeals unbefitting for an officer to make by thrusts at pride and vanity which he has studied more intimately than any one else hear him expounding his gospel to a youth who does not yet realise that the navy is his father and his mother and his only aunt jemima go out with him when he is in charge of a cutter listen to him in the workshop in the flats forward between the pauses of practicefiring or up on the booms taking stock of the boats and you will concede that he is a superior and an adequate person yes i suppose its all very nice said one of them while i applauded and admired some manoeuvre that he did not trouble to raise an eyelid for but just think what we could do if we had the men all together for three years steady as it is were practically a training squadron when we get back to plymouth theyll snatch a hundred of our best men an turn em over to the mediterranean and well have to take up a lot of new ones the mediterranean have got the better trained men but they havent our chances of working together but the men are trained when you get em surely yes but you get the same lot in one ship all through her commission and you put a polish on em pq cried a signalman that was a wellknown message it meant get into your boats as fast as you know how and pull round the fleet the men leaped on to the nettings and fell outboard like dolphins that shows it said the warrant officer with a sniff look at that man crawlin into his place to me he seemed to be flying our first boat ought to be away in fifteen seconds it was quite thirty before the last drew clear there go the arrogants his face darkened was it possible that that tiptilted hogbacked cruiser had were well first away said a lieutenant hum we ought to have been more previous said the warrant officer the arrogants nearly beat us we love the arrogant but we do not allow her to lead if we can help it a tale worth telling another time we were not so lucky the tale is worth telling to show a how one is at the mercy of ones subordinates and b how there is no excuse in the navy at odd hours chiefly in the black night the admiral feeling lonely calls up one boat from each ship to his gangway and the signal which we will label tvk reads cutter to flagship from each ship thirdclass cruisers to send whaler warned by experience the first lieutenant whom it is not easy to catch napping had the whalers crew sleeping all handy by where one order would send them out like flystung cattle a cutter requires about three times as many men and on a small cruiser one cannot keep these together enter then at pm a zealous signalman with the words cutter to the flagship in his haste he had omitted to read the conclusion of the signal vouchsafing us the whaler and this was his black error told no one that it was tvk which would have explained the situation no he needs must say cutter so cutter it was after the men had been variously dug out of their hammocks and the heavy boat got away the flagship wanted to know why we were several scandalous minutes behind our time it was a direct reflection on the ship and its smartness a galling and unanswerable wigging that makes men dance and swear with rage we could only have said that the signal was misread which would not have helped us in the least so we shut our mouths and killed the signalman next morning his own chief the hawknosed yeoman of signals flung him bound to the executioner saying he ought to have known sir he ought to have known so he was boiled scraped and sandpapered his hair was cut and his number was taken after which he went forward and heard precisely what the lower deck thought of him then a visiting captains galley hanging on to the gangway rubbed it in gracefully and casually and a fat beefboat condoled with us ironically and the whaler see note v heard all about it next time she went sailing without an officer in the sternsheets it was most annoying but cant you see how easily this sort of accident may happen chapter vi i had the honour of dining on the flagship next night and so contagious is the naval spirit that i went there as it were annoyed and uneasy over the matter of the misread signal one cannot regard an admiral in the exercise of his duty as a mere human it is in his power to make you get up an anchor by hand if he thinks you are slack he can stop your coaling and bid you man and arm boats in the middle of the grimy mess he can make you repeat a certain business till you are sick and dizzy or he can raise you to high honour by signalling well done soandso evolution creditably performed he blocks up all the horizon when he appears on it at six miles off across the windy blue the spirit may move him to chat with you and if your best signalman have not his best telescope at his best eye and the admiral be forced to repeat his remarks you will hear about it at closer range the isolation of an admiral the loneliness of a captain is society beside the isolation of an admiral he goes up on the afterbridge and moves some l worth of iron and steel at his pleasure no man can stop him few dare even suggest then comes the sea as it did round the orkneys and a little roaring roost marked with a few hairlines on the chart a tiderip racing between ledges buffets his stately galleons and drives them lightly out of all formation one never connects a clergyman with st paul but one cannot look at an admiral without speculating on our apostolic succession of the sea with these powers were clothed nelson and the rest admirals all and this particular piece of flesh and blood is of the same order and rank and breed and responsibility the admiral in command of the channel fleet and now it is peace yes i have enjoyed my visit very much thank you sir but if war came tomorrow what would he do how would he think what does he think about now he would go up on the bridge with the flaglieutenant and the ships would be cleared for action no ive never seen a temperley transporter at work and then and then it was a strange dinner for one guest at least with its flowers and crystal and quiet conversation the band playing on deck and the lights of the fleet twinkling all down the bay there was a prince in it who was also a flagcaptain and he set one thinking and there were commanders and lieutenants in it and it was all very pretty and gracious but between me and the menu rose a vision of last years playwar a battleship cleared for action naked and grim like a man swimming with a knife between his teeth a wet and streaming hull thundering through heavy rainhammered seas dinner in a gunroom well now youve done that said twentyone suppose you come and dine in a gunroom we have none on the cruiser being all wardroom with a cabin apiece ill chaperon you to the best disciplined gunroom in the fleet well show you so we went twentyone and me to another huge battleship precisely like the admirals but this time captains commanders and lieutenants were invisible or showed only as superior luminaries far along the decks we dealt with nothing above the rank of sublieutenant and the greetings of that grade are cordial and warm down below it was twice the size of our wardroom we found their gunroom which differs in appointments and fittings from everything marryat conceived but i think the old unquenchable spirit persists of the twenty odd inhabitants a dozen at least were midshipmen and therefore as twentyone explained didnt count they talked among themselves in subdued eager whispers dropping in to the meal as they came off duty the senior sublieutenant quite nineteen years old was responsible for the justly vaunted discipline and it is no small thing to reduce to silence boys of sixteen to eighteen all full of natural and acquired deviltry but it was done according to the custom of the navy and the etiquette of the gunroom whose laws change not midshipmen here the young nelson learns to obey in silence and at a run he has been broken in on the britannia but the gunroom gives him enduring polish the admiral knows a midshipman rather as the almighty knows a blackbeetle the captain knows him as the head of harrow might know a babe in a perambulator the first lieutenant knows him as the head of the games knows a fag in the lower third but the senior sublieutenant of the gunroom knows him as a brand to be snatched from the burning and works over him accordingly in return the midshipman patronises the admiral at a safe distance is blandly superior to his captain also at a safe distance sings timehonoured lampoons about the first lieutenant at a very safe distance but most strictly obeys the senior sublieutenant for seven years counting his time in the britannia he dresses at a chest and sleeps in a hammock getting to know himself and his associates with that deadly stark intimacy that only flourishes in the navy there are no excuses in his service he must not answer back and he must do what he is told not immediately but sooner much sooner these are the years that weed out those that have mistaken their calling the incompetents go home and curse the navy evermore the virtuous stay on and learn to steal brass boilertubes for their boats learn to smoke secretly in the fightingtops they are forbidden tobacco till eighteen fall into and out of all manner of tight places that require dexterity and a cheek of colddrawn brass pick up more than they learn under the instructor from the talk of the warrant officers and men and the carefullywatched mistakes of their elders and when they reach commissioned rank impart their lore to their successors with a dirkscabbard a republic and a despotism if white jacket had not served before the mast what a picture he might have given us of the gunroom it is at once a republic and a despotism the extreme left and the unswerving centre of old tradition individually it is always in hot water collectively it can and does criticise with point and freedom anything and everything on its horizon from fleet manoeuvres to the fit of an instructors collar pungent merciless indomitable is the gunroom but it preserves discipline the senior sublieutenant one could not help thinking of obrien when he cured peter of the seasickness stuck a fork into the equivalent for a beam overhead ere it ceased vibrating the midshipmen had gone flitting like bats had flung themselves backwards from their seats and were through the door thats when we think the conversation might hurt their little morals said my host but they can move much quicker than that make em do it again said twentyone a midshipman three years ago youre getting awfully slack i think what do you do when he presented a contingency oh then we the sublieutenant described the course of action with minute particularity adding wouldnt you like to see it done set it to my account that i saved somebodys darling from being butchered to make a gunroom holiday but the midshipmen have an asylum of their own in the schoolroom where i was assured they were worked within an inch of their lives the remnant seemed unusually healthy for when we went out to visit a big smokingconcert on the flagship i caught glimpses of limber youths racketting in dumb show round their hammocks not being privileged to have speech with them i asked twentyone what the protective diplomacy of midshipmen might be he gave me to understand that stirring a hornets nest with the bare toe was tame and pale beside too thoroughly irritating the junior members of the gunroom had himself been concerned in such revolutions we got licked of course he concluded cheerfully but the seniors let us alone after that wasnt it a beautifully disciplined mess though i wish you could see em at sea in weather theres a midshipman he used the other term told off to every scuttle to open it between waves if he lets in any water of course he catches it i had about five years of that sort of thing well now well go over to the concert uncle henrys smoking concert said a shrill voice casually are you goin to patronise our uncle henrys show tonight i think i ought to i dont want him to think im cutting him besides hed like to meet one zealous an efficient officer it ud cheer him up i whipped round to see two small boys of blank countenances studying the deckbeams it was humanly conceivable that uncle henry might be the admirals nickname but could two midshipmen i fled lest the ship should blow up under me and left those zealous and efficient ones to their dignity imagine a quarterdeck seventyfive feet wide and a hundred and twenty long awninged over decked with flags and a triple row of white and purple electrics the massed bands of the fleet at the far end and all the rest from the stern to the snowy barbette a whirl of uniforms of all ranks captains with and without aiguillettes commanders officers of marines in their bluefaced messjackets with the laurelled globe on the lapel engineers paymasters clerks and the others a shifting carpet of blue and gold and red and black the muzzles of the fortysix ton guns sheered up above us and high over all on the top of the barbette which was disguised with flags and carpets sat the admiral it was an amazing spectacle the fleet at play and for some reason it made me choke one recovered here men last met at the other end of the world at gaspe bermuda vancouver yokohama invercargill or bombay rovers and rangers in her majestys menofwar then we danced for this also is the custom of the navy that when a man has been working like several niggers all day he should on chance given dance and that is why the naval man dances so well he begins as i have seen on the britannia whose decks are fairly open then he dances on such occasions as these in and out among all the fittings of a battleships deck makes us awfully handy with our feet said twentyone mopping himself in the pauses of a waltz wont you take a turn no end good exercise no im afraid of the ladies i replied they are rather solid said twentyone reflectively as a postcaptain reversed on to his toes my partner doesnt protect me as a gentleman should he threw me at a paymaster just now how in the course of their work they had saved up enough energy for this diversion was beyond me they danced fair heel and toe unsparingly a couple of hours for the sheer downright exercise of it and they were by no means all youths in the game either we dropped panting into the boats and saw behind us the whole gay show fade flicker and twinkle out the flagship had returned to her ordinary business tomorrow she would take us back to portland on our speed trials no welsh coal isnt it scandalous isnt it perfectly damnable said an officer after we had got under way pointing to the foul greasy columns of smoke that poured from every funnel her majestys channel squadron if you please under steam burning horsedung truthfully it was a sickening sight we could have been seen thirty miles off a curtain of cloud spangled and speckled with bits of burning rubbish and lumps of muck the first lieutenant looked at the beach of clinkers piling up on his hammocknettings and blessed the principality of wales the chief engineer merely said you never know your luck in the navy put on his most ancient kit and was no more seen in the likeness of a christian man fate had hit him hard for just as his fires were at their pink of perfection a battleship chose to get up her anchor by hand delaying us an hour and blackening the wellcherished furnaces no welsh this must have been an admiralty jest needs a lot of coaxing chimneysweeps on the high seas but we were not quite such an exhibition as the arrogant she showed like chemical works in full blast as we swept out of bantry and headed south for the scillies then up came the blake see note vi a beautiful boat giving easily to the swell that was lifting us already and she dodged about left and right till we asked what are you trying to do trying to get out of your smoke said she vomiting cascades of her own the while meantime the fleetrams were doing their best to blind and poison us and the battleships sagged away to leeward looking like wet ricks ablaze it was not the ignominy of the thing the mere dirt and filth that annoyed one so much as the thought that there was no power in the state which owes its existence to the navy whereby a decent supply of stateowned statedug coal could be assured to us there had been a strike and while masters and men were arglebargling ashore her majestys ships were masquerading in the guise of chimneysweeps on the high seas the delay the disorder the cruel extra work on stokers not to mention the engineers who at all times are worked pitilessly is in peace no more than merely brutal in war it would be dangerous four hours at full speed as if that were not enough the swell that the battleships logged as light heaven forgive them began to heave our starboard screw out of the water we raced and we raced and we raced dizzily thunderously paralytically hysterically vibrating all down one side it was of course in our four hours of full speed that the sea most delighted to lift us up on one finger and watch us kick from to pm one screw twizzled for the most part in the circumambient ether and the chief engineer with coaldust and oil driven under his skin volunteered the information that life in his department was gay he would have left a white mark on the assistantengineer whose work lay in the stokehold among a gang of new irish stokers never but once have i been in our enginerooms and i do not go again till i can take with me their designer for four hours at full speed the place is a little cramped and close as you might say a steel guard designed to protect men from a certain toothed wheel round the shaft shore through its bolts and sat down much as a mudguard sits down on a bicyclewheel but the wheel it sat on was also of steel spinning one hundred and ninety revolutions per minute so there were fireworks beautiful but embarrassing of incandescent steel sparks surrounding the assistantengineer as with an aurora borealis they turned the hose on the display and at last knocked the guard sideways and it fell down somewhere under the shaft so that they were at liberty to devote their attention to the starboard thrustblock which was a trifle loose indeed they had been trying to wedge the latter when the fireworks began all up their backs the thing that consoled them was the thought that they had not slowed down one single turn the naval engineer shes a giddy little thing said the chief engineer come down and have a look i declined in suitable language some day when i know more i will write about enginerooms and stokers accommodation the manners and customs of naval engineers and their artificers they are an amazing breed these quiet rather pale men in whose hands lie the strength and power of the ship just think what theyve got to stand up to says twentyone with the beautiful justice of youth of course they are trained at keyham and all that but fancy doing your work with an eightinch steampipe in the nape of your neck an a dynamo buzzin up your back an the whole blessed shoot whizzin round in the pit of your stomach then we jump about an curse if they dont give us enough steam i swear i think theyre no end good men in the engine room if you doubt this descend by the slippery steel ladders into the bluish coppersmelling haze of hurrying mechanism all crowded under the protective deck crawl along the greasy footplates and stand with your back against the lengthwise bulkhead that separates the desperately whirling twin engines wait under the lowbrowed supportingcolumns till the roar and the quiver has soaked into every nerve of you till your knees loosen and your heart begins to pump feel the floors lift below you to the jar and batter of the defrauded propeller as it draws out of its element try now to read the dizzying gaugeneedles or find a meaning in the rumbled signals from the bridge creep into the stokehold a boiler blistering either ear as you stoop and taste what tinned air is like for a while face the intolerable white glare of the opened furnace doors get into a bunker and see how they pass coal along and up and down stand for five minutes with slice and devil to such labour as the stoker endures for four hours his hourly risk the gentleman with the little velvet slip between the gold rings on his sleeve does his unnoticed work among these things if anything goes wrong if he overlooks a subordinates error he will not be wigged by the admiral in gods open air the bill will be presented to him down here under the twoinch steel deck by the power he has failed to control he will be peeled flayed blinded or boiled that is his hourly risk his duty shifts him from one ship to another to good smooth and accessible engines to vicious ones with a long record of deviltry to lying engines that cannot do their work to impostors with mysterious heartbreaking weaknesses to new and untried gear fresh from the contractors hands to boilers that will not make steam to reducingvalves that will not reduce and auxiliary engines for distilling or lighting that often give more trouble than the main concern he must shift his methods for and project himself into the soul of each humouring adjusting bullying coaxing refraining risking and daring as need arises behind him is his own honour and reputation the honour of his ship and her imperious demands for there is no excuse in the navy if he fails in any one particular he severs just one nerve of the ships life if he fails in all the ship dies a prisoner to the set of the sea a gift to the nearest enemy and as i have seen him he is infinitely patient resourceful and unhurried however it might have been in the old days when men clung obstinately to sticks and strings and cloths the newer generation bred to polemasts know that he is the kingpin of their system our assistantengineer had been with the engines from the beginning and one night he told me their story utterly unconscious that there was anything out of the way in the noble little tale no end good men it was his business so to arrange that no single demand from the bridge should go unfulfilled for more than five seconds to that ideal he toiled unsparingly with his chief a black sweating demon in his working hours and a quiet student of professional papers in his scanty leisure an they come into the wardroom says twentyone and you know theyve been having a young hell of a time down below but they never growl at us or get stuffy or anything no end good men i swear they are thank you twentyone i said ill let that stand for the whole navy if you dont mind notes note i paint and gilding a ship who attempted to dress on her service allowance of paint would in three months be as disreputable as a battery or regiment which kept its mess or band on the strict army footing therefore over and above anything that they may secure by strategy and foresight the officers must dip into their own pockets to supply the many trifles none of them cheap which make for the smartness of a ship this was forcibly brought home to me when i admired a shield and scrollwork at the bows of a large cruiser yes said a friend it takes about fifty books of goldleaf to gild that decently no seventy said another how dyou know well somebodys got to gild it and the yard dont give you seventy books for nothing was the significant reply if there were any means of reckoning the taxpayer would be somewhat astonished at the sums spent by navy and army for the privilege of serving the queen both services have curious and crusted tales bearing on this head note ia as the comfort and efficiency of the ship not to mention the captains peace of mind depend on the first lieutenant the captain as a rule takes good care to pick his own man here are a few of the first lieutenants duties he must act as a strainer between the captain and the ship holding back the unessential passing on the vital that is to say he must be a subtle and discriminating editor he must make all his arrangements for the ordering and disposition of every soul aboard through the next day week or month with the cheerful foreknowledge that the bulk of them will be knocked into a naval cocked hat by the exigencies of the service he must then retire into himself with a pack of printed cards one for each man and work out the whole puzzle afresh at the same time he must not allow his own irritation to affect his dealings with the wardroom whose official head he is and whose members are a his subordinates and b gentlemen of leisure assembled of an evening for a quiet rubber he must get the utmost out of them not by the menace of his authority because that means a smashup sooner or later but because of their genuine liking for him as an individual the wardroom is young very male and unable to avoid meeting itself every day and all day long you will concede that a certain amount of tact may be necessary in handling it he must further see with those eyes which he is authorised to wear at the back of his head that no warrant or petty officer no ships corporal or masteratarms is abusing authority to spite some man or boy he must still further see that no official yielding to a natural desire for popularity is quietly letting down the discipline of the lowerdeck he must know the captains mind seventeen and twothirds seconds before the captain opens his mouth because he will need that time to think out arrangements to meet the order he must be the soul of rectitude and honour but he must grasp the inwardness and frustrate the outwardness of every trick and trap sprung on him twenty times a day in the captains absence he is the visitors host and chaperone and as visitors in harbour may range from royalty to ragamuffins his manners must be in the widest sense of the word adaptable finally at all crises where the blue goes there must he lead leaping the larger abyss standing nearer to the danger walking the more slippery foothold passively enduring longer the exposure and through it all he must keep the cool eye and balanced head of authority and the public is surprised when a naval officer proves that he is a diplomat note ii coxswains and galleys the captains coxswain is always an important person as a rule the captain has known him for a long time often for ten or fifteen years and the man follows his superiors fortunes with unswerving loyalty till he blossoms into the dignity of coxswain of the admirals barge beside whom dukes are not even three a penny he is by virtue of his office the smartest man in the ship and by training becomes a cleanshaved miracle of tact and discretion each boats crew have a life of their own a little world into which they enter picking up where they left off so soon as cutter or whaler leaves the ships side but i fancy the esprit de corps is most strongly developed in the captains galley on one occasion we had been out all day fishing and the wind forced us to row the long seven miles back to the fleet against the tide round rocky points fringed with conflicting currents it was a lumpy and disheartening sea leaden grey in the twilight except where the shoals cast up wisps and smudges of halfphosphorescent white a three hours journey enlivened by the incessant dry roar and rattle of the surf around roancarrig and the answering growl of the waves on the mainland i watched the untiring machine digging out over the steeppitched crosswaters eight pair of shoulders rising and falling against the first stars and the smoke of spray about the bows till every muscle in me ached out of sympathy thrice they were invited to rest themselves for they had been ten hours at work and there was six hundred pounds dead weight of fish in the boat and thrice they replied oh we can jog on like this sir so they jogged with never a quiver or a falter through all the tumble and when we reached still water under the lee of the ships they spurted up the avenue as though returning from a call on the flagship half a mile away i demanded of the coxswain how this thing was done oh you get used to it said he besides that wasnt anything particular sometimes you have the boat half full of water jumping out and coming down like a hammer thats the time you learn to row i see why didnt some of you miss your stroke in that tumble coming round the point when we took the water over the bows well still the same smile if you did that why you wouldnt be in the galley theres all the other boats to practise that in youve never seen her properly under sail have you for sheer luxury of motion commend me to a galley which has just taken on a brother captains craft for a small walk down the bay the rig is simplicity itself there is a man to every rope that vitally communicates with anything and the most highly trained shiftingballast in the world spread low between the thwarts obeys the wave of the hand note iii the art of gunnery many men will tell you that our ships are undergunned so they are on paper but on paper a gun merely represents a tube sticking out of the side one does not see the little group of from three to nine men who work it in action the ammunition hoist that feeds it or the pile of live shell and cartridge that would lie beside it these things take up space and the more space you supply the less will the gun be disconcerted by its own or a neighbours disaster our people do not like to work in crowds they prefer as we do ashore to manage their own little shows alone the effect of wounded men kicking and hiccoughing in a crowded secondary battery is bad for cool aiming besides which idlers cooks and servants might be jostling the workers in their efforts to get the wounded below on an open deck with fair intervals between the guns the wounded can be moved out of the way at once and if the gun itself by any chance be dismounted there is a margin of safety for its inboard collapse and room for a workingparty to take charge of it i am speaking now of light armaments behind shields the knowledge that one lucky shot might wreck two or three guns together does not make for happiness this is why our guns are comparatively few in number but exceedingly handy to work a ship knows of course exactly where the crowd would of necessity be gathered in any craft opposed to her two or three shots in a nest of crowded guns open ammunitionhoists and piles of ready cartridges will do more moral and intellectual damage than the effacement of one or two guns in a line strung evenly from bow to stern note iv omdurman you must understand here that the flagship was not only our central authority but reuters agency as well and that between orders for drills were sandwiched little pieces of news from the world ashore one peaceful morning the yeoman of signals came to the captains cabin at the regulation pace but with heightened colour and an eye something brighter than usual signal from the flagship sir said he reading off the slate omdurman fallen killed so many and wounded so many thank you said the captain tell the men on this i went forward to see how the news would be received we were busy painting some deckhouses and the work continued to an accompaniment of subdued voices the hushed tones of men under the eye of authority word was passed to the lower deck and the stokehold and the hum of talk rose perhaps half a note i halted by the painters said one dipping deep in the white lead um ah this ought to make the french sickish almost ear em coughin cant you said another reaching out for the broadest and slabbiest brush i say alf lend us that khartoum brush o yours after a long pause stepping back to catch the effect of a peculiarly juicy stroke head a little aside and one eye shut well weve waited about long enough avent we bosuns mate with a fine mixture of official severity and human tolerance what are you cacklin for over there carry on quiet cant you and that was how we took the news of the little skirmish called omdurman note v boatracing our whaler would go out between lights under pretence of practising but really for the purpose of insulting other whalers whom she had beaten in intership contests boatracing is to the mariner what horseracing is to the landsman the way of it is simple when your racing crew is in proper condition you row under the bows of the ship you wish to challenge and throw up an oar if you are very confident or have a long string of victories to your credit you borrow a cock from the hencoops and make him crow then the match arranges itself a friendly launch tows both of you a couple of miles down the bay and back you come digging out for the dear life to be welcomed by hoarse subdued roars from the crowded focsles of the battleships this deep booming surge of voices is most moving to hear some day a waiting fleet will thus cheer a bruised and battered sister staggering in with a prize at her tail a plugged and splintered wreck of an iron box her planking brown with what has dried there and the bright water cascading down her sides i saw the setting of such a picture one bloodred evening when the hulls of the fleet showed black on olivegreen water and the yellow of the masts turned rawmeat colours in the last light a couple of racing cutters spun down the fairway and long after they had disappeared we could hear faroff ships applauding them it was too dark to catch more than a movement of masses by the bows and it seemed as though the ships themselves were triumphing all together note vi the beauty of battleships do not believe what people tell you of the ugliness of steam nor join those who lament the old sailing days there is one beauty of the sun and another of the moon and we must be thankful for both a modern manofwar photographed in severe profile is not engaging but you should see her with the life hot in her headon across a heavy swell the rambow draws upward and outward in a stately sweep there is no ruck of figurehead bowtimbers or bowspritfittings to distract the eye from its outline or the beautiful curves that mark its melting into the full bosom of the ship it hangs dripping an instant then quietly and cleanly as a tempered knife slices into the hollow of the swell down and down till the surprised sea spits off in foam about the hawseholes as the ship rolls in her descent you can watch curve after new curve revealed humouring and coaxing the water when she recovers her step the long sucking hollow of her own wave discloses just enough of her shape to make you wish to see more in harbour the still waterline hard as the collar of a tailormade jacket hides that vision but when she dances the big sea dance she is as different from her portsmouth shilling photograph as is a matron in a macintosh from the same lady at a ball swaying a little in her gait drunk with sheer delight of movement perfectly apt for the work in hand and in every line of her rejoicing that she is doing it she shows to these eyes at least a miracle of grace and beauty her sides are smooth as a waterworn pebble curved and moulded as the sea loves to have them where the boxsponsioned overhanging trebleturreted ships of some other navies hammer and batter into an element they do not understand she clean cool and sweet uses it to her own advantage the days are over for us when men piled baronial keeps flatirons candlesticks and dore towers on floating platforms the new navy offers to the sea precisely as much to take hold of as
