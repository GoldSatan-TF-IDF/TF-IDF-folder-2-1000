ayn rand the fountainhead to frank oconnor introduction to the twentyfifth anniversary edition many people have asked me how i feel about the fact that the fountainhead has been in print for twentyfive years i cannot say that i feel anything in particular except a kind of quiet satisfaction in this respect my attitude toward my writing is best expressed by a statement of victor hugo if a writer wrote merely for his time i would have to break my pen and throw it away certain writers of whom i am one do not live think or write on the range of the moment novels in the proper sense of the word are not written to vanish in a month or a year that most of them do today that they are written and published as if they were magazines to fade as rapidly is one of the sorriest aspects of todays literature and one of the clearest indictments of its dominant esthetic philosophy concretebound journalistic naturalism which has now reached its dead end in the inarticulate sounds of panic longevitypredominantly though not exclusivelyis the prerogative of a literary school which is virtually nonexistent today romanticism this is not the place for a dissertation on the nature of romantic fiction so let me state for the record and for the benefit of those college students who have never been allowed to discover it only that romanticism is the conceptual school of art it deals not with the random trivia of the day but with the timeless fundamental universal problems and values of human existence it does not record or photograph it creates and projects it is concerned in the words of aristotle not with things as they are but with things as they might be and ought to be and for the benefit of those who consider relevance to ones own time as of crucial importance i will add in regard to our age that never has there been a time when men have so desperately needed a projection of things as they ought to be i do not mean to imply that i knew when i wrote it that the fountainhead would remain in print for twentyfive years i did not think of any specific time period i knew only that it was a book that ought to live it did but that i knew it over twentyfive years ago that i knew it while the fountainhead was being rejected by twelve publishers some of whom declared that it was too intellectual too controversial and would not sell because no audience existed for it that was the difficult part of its history difficult for me to bear i mention it here for the sake of any other writer of my kind who might have to face the same battle as a reminder of the fact that it can be done it would be impossible for me to discuss the fountainhead or any part of its history without mentioning the man who made it possible for me to write it my husband frank oconnor in a play i wrote in my early thirties ideal the heroine a screen star speaks for me when she says i want to see real living and in the hours of my own days that glory i create as an illusion i want it real i want to know that there is someone somewhere who wants it too or else what is the use of seeing it and working and burning oneself for an impossible vision a spirit too needs fuel it can run dry frank was the fuel he gave me in the hours of my own days the reality of that sense of life which created the fountainhead and he helped me to maintain it over a long span of years when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion the essence of the bond between us is the fact that neither of us has ever wanted or been tempted to settle for anything less than the world presented in the fountainhead we never will if there is in me any touch of the naturalistic writer who records reallife dialogue for use in a novel it has been exercised only in regard to frank for instance one of the most effective lines in the fountainhead comes at the end of part ii when in reply to tooheys question why dont you tell me what you think of me roark answers but i dont think of you that line was franks answer to a different type of person in a somewhat similar context youre casting pearls without getting even a pork chop in return was said by frank to me in regard to my professional position i gave that line to dominique at roarks trial i did not feel discouragement very often and when i did it did not last longer than overnight but there was one evening during the writing of the fountainhead when i felt so profound an indignation at the state of things as they are that it seemed as if i would never regain the energy to move one step farther toward things as they ought to be frank talked to me for hours that night he convinced me of why one cannot give up the world to those one despises by the time he finished my discouragement was gone it never came back in so intense a form i had been opposed to the practice of dedicating books i had held that a book is addressed to any reader who proves worthy of it but that night i told frank that i would dedicate the fountainhead to him because he had saved it and one of my happiest moments about two years later was given to me by the look on his face when he came home one day and saw the pageproofs of the book headed by the page that stated in cold clear objective print to frank oconnor i have been asked whether i have changed in these past twentyfive years no i am the same only more so have my ideas changed no my fundamental convictions my view of life and of man have never changed from as far back as i can remember but my knowledge of their applications has grown in scope and in precision what is my present evaluation of the fountainhead i am as proud of it as i was on the day when i finished writing it was the fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy here i shall quote from the goal of my writing an address i gave at lewis and clark college on october this is the motive and purpose of my writing the projection of an ideal man the portrayal of a moral ideal as my ultimate literary goal as an end in itself to which any didactic intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means let me stress this my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers my purpose first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of howard roark or the heroes of atlas shrugged as an end in himself i write and read for the sake of the story my basic test for any story is would i want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man i had to define and present the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires since mans character is the product of his premises i had to define and present the kinds of premises and values that create the character of an ideal man and motivate his actions which means that i had to define and present a rational code of ethics since man acts among and deals with other men i had to present the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to exist and to function a free productive rational system which demands and rewards the best in every man and which is obviously laissezfaire capitalism but neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy is an end in itself neither in life nor in literature only man is an end in himself are there any substantial changes i would want to make in the fountainhead no and therefore i have left its text untouched i want it to stand as it was written but there is one minor error and one possibly misleading sentence which i should like to clarify so i shall mention them here the error is semantic the use of the word egotist in roarks courtroom speech while actually the word should have been egoist the error was caused by my reliance on a dictionary which gave such misleading definitions of these two words that egotist seemed closer to the meaning i intended websters daily use dictionary modern philosophers however are guiltier than lexicographers in regard to these two terms the possibly misleading sentence is in roarks speech from this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction from the wheel to the skyscraper everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man the function of his reasoning mind this could be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of religion or religious ideas i remember hesitating over that sentence when i wrote it and deciding that roarks and my atheism as well as the overall spirit of the book were so clearly established that no one would misunderstand it particularly since i said that religious abstractions are the product of mans mind not of supernatural revelation but an issue of this sort should not be left to implications what i was referring to was not religion as such but a special category of abstractions the most exalted one which for centuries had been the nearmonopoly of religion ethics not the particular content of religious ethics but the abstraction ethics the realm of values mans code of good and evil with the emotional connotations of height uplift nobility reverence grandeur which pertain to the realm of mans values but which religion has arrogated to itself the same meaning and considerations were intended and are applicable to another passage of the book a brief dialogue between roark and hopton stoddard which may be misunderstood if taken out of context youre a profoundly religious man mr roark in your own way i can see that in your buildings thats true said roark in the context of that scene however the meaning is clear it is roarks profound dedication to values to the highest and best to the ideal that stoddard is referring to see his explanation of the nature of the proposed temple the erection of the stoddard temple and the subsequent trial state the issue explicitly this leads me to a wider issue which is involved in every line of the fountainhead and which has to be understood if one wants to understand the causes of its lasting appeal religions monopoly in the field of ethics has made it extremely difficult to communicate the emotional meaning and connotations of a rational view of life just as religion has preempted the field of ethics turning morality against man so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language placing them outside this earth and beyond mans reach exaltation is usually taken to mean an emotional state evoked by contemplating the supernatural worship means the emotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man reverence means the emotion of a sacred respect to be experienced on ones knees sacred means superior to and nottobetouchedby any concerns of man or of this earth etc but such concept do name actual emotions even though no supernatural dimension exists and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling without the selfabasement required by religious definitions what then is their source or referent in reality it is the entire emotional realm of mans dedication to a moral ideal yet apart from the mandegrading aspects introduced by religion that emotional realm is left unidentified without concepts words or recognition it is this highest level of mans emotions that has to be redeemed from the murk of mysticism and redirected at its proper object man it is in this sense with this meaning and intention that i would identify the sense of life dramatized in the fountainhead as manworship it is an emotion that a few a very few men experience consistently some men experience it in rare single sparks that flash and die without consequences some do not know what i am talking about some do and spend their lives as frantically virulent sparkextinguishers do not confuse manworship with the many attempts not to emancipate morality from religion and bring it into the realm of reason but to substitute a secular meaning for the worst the most profoundly irrational elements of religion for instance there are all the variants of modern collectivism communist fascist nazi etc which preserve the religiousaltruist ethics in full and merely substitute society for god as the beneficiary of mans selfimmolation there are the various schools of modern philosophy which rejecting the law of identity proclaim that reality is an indeterminate flux ruled by miracles and shaped by whims not gods whims but mans or societys these neomystics are not manworshipers they are merely the secularizers of as profound a hatred for man as that of their avowedly mystic predecessors a cruder variant of the same hatred is represented by those concretebound statistical mentalities who unable to grasp the meaning of mans volition declare that man cannot be an object of worship since they have never encountered any specimens of humanity who deserved it the manworshipers in my sense of the term are those who see mans highest potential and strive to actualize it the manhaters are those who regard man as a helpless depraved contemptible creature and struggle never to let him discover otherwise it is important here to remember that the only direct introspective knowledge of man anyone possesses is of himself more specifically the essential division between these two camps is those dedicated to the exaltation of mans selfesteem and the sacredness of his happiness on earth and those determined not to allow either to become possible the majority of mankind spend their lives and psychological energy in the middle swinging between these two struggling not to allow the issue to be named this does not change the nature of the issue perhaps the best way to communicate the fountainheads sense of life is by means of the quotation which had stood at the head of my manuscript but which i removed from the final published book with this opportunity to explain it i am glad to bring it back i removed it because of my profound disagreement with the philosophy of its author friedrich nietzsche philosophically nietzsche is a mystic and an irrationalist his metaphysics consists of a somewhat byronic and mystically malevolent universe his epistemology subordinates reason to will or feeling or instinct or blood or innate virtues of character but as a poet he projects at times not consistently a magnificent feeling for mans greatness expressed in emotional not intellectual terms this is especially true of the quotation i had chosen i could not endorse its literal meaning it proclaims an indefensible tenet psychological determinism but if one takes it as a poetic projection of an emotional experience and if intellectually one substitutes the concept of an acquired basic premise for the concept of an innate fundamental certainty then that quotation communicates the inner state of an exalted selfesteem and sums up the emotional consequences for which the fountainhead provides the rational philosophical base it is not the works but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself something which is not to be sought is not to be found and perhaps also is not to be lost the noble soul has reverence for itself friedrich nietzsche beyond good and evil this view of man has rarely been expressed in human history today it is virtually nonexistent yet this is the view with which in various degrees of longing wistfulness passion and agonized confusion the best of mankinds youth start out in life it is not even a view for most of them but a foggy groping undefined sense made of raw pain and incommunicable happiness it is a sense of enormous expectation the sense that ones life is important that great achievements are within ones capacity and that great things lie ahead it is not in the nature of man nor of any living entity to start out by giving up by spitting in ones own face and damning existence that requires a process of corruption whose rapidity differs from man to man some give up at the first touch of pressure some sell out some run down by imperceptible degrees and lose their fire never knowing when or how they lost it then all of these vanish in the vast swamp of their elders who tell them persistently that maturity consists of abandoning ones mind security of abandoning ones values practicality of losing selfesteem yet a few hold on and move on knowing that that fire is not to be betrayed learning how to give it shape purpose and reality but whatever their future at the dawn of their lives men seek a noble vision of mans nature and of lifes potential there are very few guideposts to find the fountainhead is one of them this is one of the cardinal reasons of the fountainheads lasting appeal it is a confirmation of the spirit of youth proclaiming mans glory showing how much is possible it does not matter that only a few in each generation will grasp and achieve the full reality of mans proper stature and that the rest will betray it it is those few that move the world and give life its meaning and it is those few that i have always sought to address the rest are no concern of mine it is not me or the fountainhead that they will betray it is their own souls ayn rand new york may i offer my profound gratitude to the great profession of architecture and its heroes who have given us some of the highest expressions of mans genius yet have remained unknown undiscovered by the majority of men and to the architects who gave me their generous assistance in the technical matters of this book no person or event in this story is intended as a reference to any real person or event the titles of the newspaper columns were invented and used by me in the first draft of this novel five years ago they were not taken from and have no reference to any actual newspaper columns or features ayn rand march part one peter keating howard roark laughed he stood naked at the edge of a cliff the lake lay far below him a frozen explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky over motionless water the water seemed immovable the stone flowing the stone had the stillness of one brief moment in battle when thrust meets thrust and the currents are held in a pause more dynamic than motion the stone glowed wet with sunrays the lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half the rocks went on into the depth unchanged they began and ended in the sky so that the world seemed suspended in space an island floating on nothing anchored to the feet of the man on the cliff his body leaned back against the sky it was a body of long straight lines and angles each curve broken into planes he stood rigid his hands hanging at his sides palms out he felt his shoulder blades drawn tight together the curve of his neck and the weight of the blood in his hands he felt the wind behind him in the hollow of his spine the wind waved his hair against the sky his hair was neither blond nor red but the exact color of ripe orange rind he laughed at the thing which had happened to him that morning and at the things which now lay ahead he knew that the days ahead would be difficult there were questions to be faced and a plan of action to be prepared he knew that he should think about it he knew also that he would not think because everything was clear to him already because the plan had been set long ago and because he wanted to laugh he tried to consider it but he forgot he was looking at the granite he did not laugh as his eyes stopped in awareness of the earth around him his face was like a law of nature a thing one could not question alter or implore it had high cheekbones over gaunt hollow cheeks gray eyes cold and steady a contemptuous mouth shut tight the mouth of an executioner or a saint he looked at the granite to be cut he thought and made into walls he looked at a tree to be split and made into rafters he looked at a streak of rust on the stone and thought of iron ore under the ground to be melted and to emerge as girders against the sky these rocks he thought are here for me waiting for the drill the dynamite and my voice waiting to be split ripped pounded reborn waiting for the shape my hands will give them then he shook his head because he remembered that morning and that there were many things to be done he stepped to the edge raised his arms and dived down into the sky below he cut straight across the lake to the shore ahead he reached the rocks where he had left his clothes he looked regretfully about him for three years ever since he had lived in stanton he had come here for his only relaxation to swim to rest to think to be alone and alive whenever he could find one hour to spare which had not been often in his new freedom the first thing he had wanted to do was to come here because he knew that he was coming for the last time that morning he had been expelled from the architectural school of the stanton institute of technology he pulled his clothes on old denim trousers sandals a shirt with short sleeves and most of its buttons missing he swung down a narrow trail among the boulders to a path running through a green slope to the road below he walked swiftly with a loose lazy expertness of motion he walked down the long road in the sun far ahead stanton lay sprawled on the coast of massachusetts a little town as a setting for the gem of its existence the great institute rising on a hill beyond the township of stanton began with a dump a gray mound of refuse rose in the grass it smoked faintly tin cans glittered in the sun the road led past the first houses to a church the church was a gothic monument of shingles painted pigeon blue it had stout wooden buttresses supporting nothing it had stainedglass windows with heavy traceries of imitation stone it opened the way into long streets edged by tight exhibitionist lawns behind the lawns stood wooden piles tortured out of all shape twisted into gables turrets dormers bulging with porches crushed under huge sloping roofs white curtains floated at the windows a garbage can stood at a side door flowing over an old pekinese sat upon a cushion on a door step its mouth drooling a line of diapers fluttered in the wind between the columns of a porch people turned to look at howard roark as he passed some remained staring after him with sudden resentment they could give no reason for it it was an instinct his presence awakened in most people howard roark saw no one for him the streets were empty he could have walked there naked without concern he crossed the heart of stanton a broad green edged by shop windows the windows displayed new placards announcing welcome to the class of good luck class of the class of of the stanton institute of technology was holding its commencement exercises that afternoon roark swung into a side street where at the end of a long row on a knoll over a green ravine stood the house of mrs keating he had boarded at that house for three years mrs keating was out on the porch she was feeding a couple of canaries in a cage suspended over the railing her pudgy little hand stopped in midair when she saw him she watched him with curiosity she tried to pull her mouth into a proper expression of sympathy she succeeded only in betraying that the process was an effort he was crossing the porch without noticing her she stopped him mr roark yes mr roark im so sorry about she hesitated demurely about what happened this morning what he asked your being expelled from the institute i cant tell you how sorry i am i only want you to know that i feel for you he stood looking at her she knew that he did not see her no she thought it was not that exactly he always looked straight at people and his damnable eyes never missed a thing it was only that he made people feel as if they did not exist he just stood looking he would not answer but what i say she continued is that if one suffers in this world its on account of error of course youll have to give up the architect profession now wont you but then a young man can always earn a decent living clerking or selling or something he turned to go oh mr roark she called yes the dean phoned for you while you were out for once she expected some emotion from him and an emotion would be the equivalent of seeing him broken she did not know what it was about him that had always made her want to see him broken yes he asked the dean she repeated uncertainly trying to recapture her effect the dean himself through his secretary well she said to tell you that the dean wanted to see you immediately the moment you got back thank you what do you suppose he can want now i dont know he had said i dont know she had heard distinctly i dont give a damn she stared at him incredulously by the way she said petey is graduating today she said it without apparent relevance today oh yes its a great day for me when i think of how i skimped and slaved to put my boy through school not that im complaining im not one to complain peteys a brilliant boy she stood drawn up her stout little body was corseted so tightly under the starched folds of her cotton dress that it seemed to squeeze the fat out to her wrists and ankles but of course she went on rapidly with the eagerness of her favorite subject im not one to boast some mothers are lucky and others just arent were all in our rightful place you just watch petey from now on im not one to want my boy to kill himself with work and ill thank the lord for any small success that comes his way but if that boy isnt the greatest architect of this usa his mother will want to know the reason why he moved to go but what am i doing gabbing with you like that she said brightly youve got to hurry and change and run along the deans waiting for you she stood looking after him through the screen door watching his gaunt figure move across the rigid neatness of her parlor he always made her uncomfortable in the house with a vague feeling of apprehension as if she were waiting to see him swing out suddenly and smash her coffee tables her chinese vases her framed photographs he had never shown any inclination to do so she kept expecting it without knowing why roark went up the stairs to his room it was a large bare room made luminous by the clean glow of whitewash mrs keating had never had the feeling that roark really lived there he had not added a single object to the bare necessities of furniture which she had provided no pictures no pennants no cheering human touch he had brought nothing to the room but his clothes and his drawings there were few clothes and too many drawings they were stacked high in one comer sometimes she thought that the drawings lived there not the man roark walked now to these drawings they were the first things to be packed he lifted one of them then the next then another he stood looking at the broad sheets they were sketches of buildings such as had never stood on the face of the earth they were as the first houses built by the first man born who had never heard of others building before him there was nothing to be said of them except that each structure was inevitably what it had to be it was not as if the draftsman had sat over them pondering laboriously piecing together doors windows and columns as his whim dictated and as the books prescribed it was as if the buildings had sprung from the earth and from some living force complete unalterably right the hand that had made the sharp pencil lines still had much to learn but not a line seemed superfluous not a needed plane was missing the structures were austere and simple until one looked at them and realized what work what complexity of method what tension of thought had achieved the simplicity no laws had dictated a single detail the buildings were not classical they were not gothic they were not renaissance they were only howard roark he stopped looking at a sketch it was one that had never satisfied him he had designed it as an exercise he had given himself apart from his schoolwork he did that often when he found some particular site and stopped before it to think of what building it should bear he had spent nights staring at this sketch wondering what he had missed glancing at it now unprepared he saw the mistake he had made he flung the sketch down on the table he bent over it he slashed lines straight through his neat drawing he stopped once in a while and stood looking at it his fingertips pressed to the paper as if his hands held the building his hands had long fingers hard veins prominent joints and wristbones an hour later he heard a knock at his door come in he snapped without stopping mr roark gasped mrs keating staring at him from the threshold what on earth are you doing he turned and looked at her trying to remember who she was how about the dean she moaned the dean thats waiting for you oh said roark oh yes i forgot you forgot yes there was a note of wonder in his voice astonished by her astonishment well all i can say she choked is that it serves you right it just serves you right and with the commencement beginning at fourthirty how do you expect him to have time to see you ill go at once mrs keating it was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action it was a secret fear that the sentence of the board might be revoked he went to the bathroom at the end of the hall she watched him washing his hands throwing his loose straight hair back into a semblance of order he came out again he was on his way to the stairs before she realized that he was leaving mr roark she gasped pointing at his clothes youre not going like this why not but its your dean not any more mrs keating she thought aghast that he said it as if he were actually happy the stanton institute of technology stood on a hill its crenelated walls raised as a crown over the city stretched below it looked like a medieval fortress with a gothic cathedral grafted to its belly the fortress was eminently suited to its purpose with stout brick walls a few slits wide enough for sentries ramparts behind which defending archers could hide and corner turrets from which boiling oil could be poured upon the attacker should such an emergency arise in an institute of learning the cathedral rose over it in lace splendor a fragile defense against two great enemies light and air the deans office looked like a chapel a pool of dreamy twilight fed by one tall window of stained glass the twilight flowed in through the garments of stiff saints their arms contorted at the elbows a red spot of light and a purple one rested respectively upon two genuine gargoyles squatting at the corners of a fireplace that had never been used a green spot stood in the center of a picture of the parthenon suspended over the fireplace when roark entered the office the outlines of the deans figure swam dimly behind his desk which was carved like a confessional he was a short plumpish gentleman whose spreading flesh was held in check by an indomitable dignity ah yes roark he smiled do sit down please roark sat down the dean entwined his fingers on his stomach and waited for the plea he expected no plea came the dean cleared his throat it will be unnecessary for me to express my regret at the unfortunate event of this morning he began since i take it for granted that you have always known my sincere interest in your welfare quite unnecessary said roark the dean looked at him dubiously but continued needless to say i did not vote against you i abstained entirely but you may be glad to know that you had quite a determined little group of defenders at the meeting small but determined your professor of structural engineering acted quite the crusader on your behalf so did your professor of mathematics unfortunately those who felt it their duty to vote for your expulsion quite outnumbered the others professor peterkin your critic of design made an issue of the matter he went so far as to threaten us with his resignation unless you were expelled you must realize that you have given professor peterkin great provocation i do said roark that you see was the trouble i am speaking of your attitude towards the subject of architectural design you have never given it the attention it deserves and yet you have been excellent in all the engineering sciences of course no one denies the importance of structural engineering to a future architect but why go to extremes why neglect what may be termed the artistic and inspirational side of your profession and concentrate on all those dry technical mathematical subjects you intended to become an architect not a civil engineer isnt this superfluous roark asked its past theres no point in discussing my choice of subjects now i am endeavoring to be helpful roark you must be fair about this you cannot say that you were not given many warnings before this happened i was the dean moved in his chair roark made him uncomfortable roarks eyes were fixed on him politely the dean thought theres nothing wrong with the way hes looking at me in fact its quite correct most properly attentive only its as if i were not here every problem you were given the dean went on every project you had to design what did you do with it every one of them done in that well i cannot call it a style in that incredible manner of yours it is contrary to every principle we have tried to teach you contrary to all established precedents and traditions of art you may think you are what is called a modernist but it isnt even that it is it is sheer insanity if you dont mind i dont mind when you were given projects that left the choice of style up to you and you turned in one of your wild stunts well frankly your teachers passed you because they did not know what to make of it but when you were given an exercise in the historical styles a tudor chapel or a french opera house to design and you turned in something that looked like a lot of boxes piled together without rhyme or reason would you say it was an answer to an assignment or plain insubordination it was insubordination said roark we wanted to give you a chance in view of your brilliant record in all other subjects but when you turn in this the dean slammed his fist down on a sheet spread before him this as a renaissance villa for your final project of the year really my boy it was too much the sheet bore a drawing a house of glass and concrete in the comer there was a sharp angular signature howard roark how do you expect us to pass you after this i dont you left us no choice in the matter naturally you would feel bitterness toward us at this moment but i feel nothing of the kind said roark quietly i owe you an apology i dont usually let things happen to me i made a mistake this time i shouldnt have waited for you to throw me out i should have left long ago now now dont get discouraged this is not the right attitude to take particularly in view of what i am going to tell you the dean smiled and leaned forward confidentially enjoying the overture to a good deed here is the real purpose of our interview i was anxious to let you know as soon as possible i did not wish to leave you disheartened oh i did personally take a chance with the presidents temper when i mentioned this to him but mind you he did not commit himself but here is how things stand now that you realize how serious it is if you take a year off to rest to think it over shall we say to grow up there might be a chance of our taking you back mind you i cannot promise anything this is strictly unofficial it would be most unusual but in view of the circumstances and of your brilliant record there might be a very good chance roark smiled it was not a happy smile it was not a grateful one it was a simple easy smile and it was amused i dont think you understood me said roark what made you suppose that i want to come back eh i wont be back i have nothing further to learn here i dont understand you said the dean stiffly is there any point in explaining its of no interest to you any longer you will kindly explain yourself if you wish i want to be an architect not an archeologist i see no purpose in doing renaissance villas why learn to design them when ill never build them my dear boy the great style of the renaissance is far from dead houses of that style are being erected every day they are and they will be but not by me come come now this is childish i came here to learn about building when i was given a project its only value to me was to learn to solve it as i would solve i a real one in the future i did them the way ill build them ive learned all i could learn here in the structural sciences of which you dont approve one more year of drawing italian post cards would give me nothing an hour ago the dean had wished that this interview would proceed as calmly as possible now he wished that roark would display some emotion it seemed unnatural for him to be so quietly natural in the circumstances do you mean to tell me that youre thinking seriously of building that way when and if you are an architect yes my dear fellow who will let you thats not the point the point is who will stop me look here this is serious i am sorry that i havent had a long earnest talk with you much earlier i know i know i know dont interrupt me youve seen a modernistic building or two and it gave you ideas but do you realize what a passing fancy that whole socalled modern movement is you must learn to understand and it has been proved by all authorities that everything beautiful in architecture has been done already there is a treasure mine in every style of the past we can only choose from the great masters who are we to improve upon them we can only attempt respectfully to repeat why asked howard roark no thought the dean no he hasnt said anything else its a perfectly innocent word hes not threatening me but its selfevident said the dean look said roark evenly and pointed at the window can you see the campus and the town do you see how many men are walking and living down there well i dont give a damn what any or all of them think about architecture or about anything else for that matter why should i consider what their grandfathers thought of it that is our sacred tradition why for heavens sake cant you stop being so naive about it but i dont understand why do you want me to think that this is great architecture he pointed to the picture of the parthenon that said the dean is the parthenon so it is i havent the time to waste on silly questions all right then roark got up he took a long ruler from the desk he walked to the picture shall i tell you whats rotten about it its the parthenon said the dean yes god damn it the parthenon the ruler struck the glass over the picture look said roark the famous flutings on the famous columns what are they there for to hide the joints in wood when columns were made of wood only these arent theyre marble the triglyphs what are they wood wooden beams the way they had to be laid when people began to build wooden shacks your greeks took marble and they made copies of their wooden structures out of it because others had done it that way then your masters of the renaissance came along and made copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood now here we are making copies in steel and concrete of copies in plaster of copies in marble of copies in wood why the dean sat watching him curiously something puzzled him not in the words but in roarks manner of saying them rules said roark here are my rules what can be done with one substance must never be done with another no two materials are alike no two sites on earth are alike no two buildings have the same purpose the purpose the site the material determine the shape nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unless its made by one central idea and the idea sets every detail a building is alive like a man its integrity is to follow its own truth its one single theme and to serve its own single purpose a man doesnt borrow pieces of his body a building doesnt borrow hunks of its soul its maker gives it the soul and every wall window and stairway to express it but all the proper forms of expression have been discovered long ago expression of what the parthenon did not serve the same purpose as its wooden ancestor an airline terminal does not serve the same purpose as the parthenon every form has its own meaning every man creates his meaning and form and goal why is it so important what others have done why does it become sacred by the mere fact of not being your own why is anyone and everyone right so long as its not yourself why does the number of those others take the place of truth why is truth made a mere matter of arithmetic and only of addition at that why is everything twisted out of all sense to fit everything else there must be some reason i dont know ive never known it id like to understand for heavens sake said the dean sit down thats better would you mind very much putting that ruler down thank you now listen to me no one has ever denied the importance of modern technique to an architect we must learn to adapt the beauty of the past to the needs of the present the voice of the past is the voice of the people nothing has ever been invented by one man in architecture the proper creative process is a slow gradual anonymous collective one in which each man collaborates with all the others and subordinates himself to the standards of the majority but you see said roark quietly i have lets say sixty years to live most of that time will be spent working ive chosen the work i want to do if i find no joy in it then im only condemning myself to sixty years of torture and i can find the joy only if i do my work in the best way possible to me but the best is a matter of standards and i set my own standards i inherit nothing i stand at the end of no tradition i may perhaps stand at the beginning of one how old are you asked the dean twentytwo said roark quite excusable said the dean he seemed relieved youll outgrow all that he smiled the old standards have lived for thousands of years and nobody has been able to improve upon them what are your modernists a transient mode exhibitionists trying to attract attention have you observed the course of their careers can you name one who has achieved any permanent distinction look at henry cameron a great man a leading architect twenty years ago what is he today lucky if he gets once a year a garage to remodel a bum and a drunkard who we wont discuss henry cameron oh is he a friend of yours no but ive seen his buildings and you found them i said we wont discuss henry cameron very well you must realize that i am allowing you a great deal of shall we say latitude i am not accustomed to hold a discussion with a student who behaves in your manner however i am anxious to forestall if possible what appears to be a tragedy the spectacle of a young man of your obvious mental gifts setting out deliberately to make a mess of his life the dean wondered why he had promised the professor of mathematics to do all he could for this boy merely because the professor had said this and pointed to roarks project is a great man a great man thought the dean or a criminal the dean winced he did not approve of either he thought of what he had heard about roarks past roarks father had been a steel puddler somewhere in ohio and had died long ago the boys entrance papers showed no record of nearest relatives when asked about it roark had said indifferently i dont think i have any relatives i may have i dont know he had seemed astonished that he should be expected to have any interest in the matter he had not made or sought a single friend on the campus he had refused to join a fraternity he had worked his way through high school and through the three years here at the institute he had worked as a common laborer in the building trades since childhood he had done plastering plumbing steel work anything he could get going from one small town to another working his way east to the great cities the dean had seen him last summer on his vacation catching rivets on a skyscraper in construction in boston his long body relaxed under greasy overalls only his eyes intent and his right arm swinging forward once in a while expertly without effort to catch the flying ball of fire at the last moment when it seemed that the hot rivet would miss the bucket and strike him in the face look here roark said the dean gently you have worked hard for your education you had only one year left to go there is something important to consider particularly for a boy in your position theres the practical side of an architects career to think about an architect is not an end in himself he is only a small part of a great social whole cooperation is the key word to our modern world and to the profession of architecture in particular have you thought of your potential clients yes said roark the client said the dean the client think of that above all hes the one to live in the house you build your only purpose is to serve him you must aspire to give the proper artistic expression to his wishes isnt that all one can say on the subject well i could say that i must aspire to build for my client the most comfortable the most logical the most beautiful house that can be built i could say that i must try to sell him the best i have and also teach him to know the best i could say it but i wont because i dont intend to build in order to serve or help anyone i dont intend to build in order to have clients i intend to have clients in order to build how do you propose to force your ideas on them i dont propose to force or be forced those who want me will come to me then the dean understood what had puzzled him in roarks manner you know he said you would sound much more convincing if you spoke as if you cared whether i agreed with you or not thats true said roark i dont care whether you agree with me or not he said it so simply that it did not sound offensive it sounded like the statement of a fact which he noticed puzzled for the first time you dont care what others think which might be understandable but you dont care even to make them think as you do no but thats thats monstrous is it probably i couldnt say im glad of this interview said the dean suddenly too loudly it has relieved my conscience i believe as others stated at the meeting that the profession of architecture is not for you i have tried to help you now i agree with the board you are a man not to be encouraged you are dangerous to whom asked roark but the dean rose indicating that the interview was over roark left the room he walked slowly through the long halls down the stairs out to the lawn below he had met many men such as the dean he had never understood them he knew only that there was some important difference between his actions and theirs it had ceased to disturb him long ago but he always looked for a central theme in buildings and he looked for a central impulse in men he knew the source of his actions he could not discover theirs he did not care he had never learned the process of thinking about other people but he wondered at times what made them such as they were he wondered again thinking of the dean there was an important secret involved somewhere in that question he thought there was a principle which he must discover but he stopped he saw the sunlight of late afternoon held still in the moment before it was to fade on the gray limestone of a stringcourse running along the brick wall of the institute building he forgot men the dean and the principle behind the dean which he wanted to discover he thought only of how lovely the stone looked in the fragile light and of what he could have done with that stone he thought of a broad sheet of paper and he saw rising on the paper bare walls of gray limestone with long bands of glass admitting the glow of the sky into the classrooms in the comer of the sheet stood a sharp angular signature howard roark architecture my friends is a great art based on two cosmic principles beauty and utility in a broader sense these are but part of the three eternal entities truth love and beauty truth to the traditions of our art love for our fellow men whom we are to serve beauty ah beauty is a compelling goddess to all artists be it in the shape of a lovely woman or a building hm yes in conclusion i should like to say to you who are about to embark upon your careers in architecture that you are now the custodians of a sacred heritage hm yes so go forth into the world armed with the three eternal entities armed with courage and vision loyal to the standards this great school has represented for many years may you all serve faithfully neither as slaves to the past nor as those parvenus who preach originality for its own sake which attitude is only ignorant vanity may you all have many rich active years before you and leave as you depart from this world your mark on the sands of time guy francon ended with a flourish raising his right arm in a sweeping salute informal but with an air that gay swaggering air which guy francon could always permit himself the huge hall before him came to life in applause and approval a sea of faces young perspiring and eager had been raised solemnly for fortyfive minutes to the platform where guy francon had held forth as the speaker at the commencement exercises of the stanton institute of technology guy francon who had brought his own person from new york for the occasion guy francon of the illustrious firm of francon heyer vicepresident of the architects guild of america member of the american academy of arts and letters member of the national fine arts commission secretary of the arts and crafts league of new york chairman of the society for architectural enlightenment of the usa guy francon knight of the legion of honor of france decorated by the governments of great britain belgium monaco and siam guy francon stantons greatest alumnus who had designed the famous frink national bank building of new york city on the top of which twentyfive floors above the pavements there burned in a miniature replica of the hadrian mausoleum a windblown torch made of glass and the best general electric bulbs guy francon descended from the platform fully conscious of his timing and movements he was of medium height and not too heavy with just an unfortunate tendency to stoutness nobody he knew would give him his real age which was fiftyone his face bore not a wrinkle nor a single straight line it was an artful composition in globes circles arcs and ellipses with bright little eyes twinkling wittily his clothes displayed an artists infinite attention to details he wished as he descended the steps that this were a coeducational school the hall before him he thought was a splendid specimen of architecture made a bit stuffy today by the crowd and by the neglected problem of ventilation but it boasted green marble dadoes corinthian columns of cast iron painted gold and garlands of gilded fruit on the walls the pineapples particularly thought guy francon had stood the test of years very well it is thought guy francon touching it was i who built this annex and this very hall twenty years ago and here i am the hall was packed with bodies and faces so tightly that one could not distinguish at a glance which faces belonged to which bodies it was like a soft shivering aspic made of mixed arms shoulders chests and stomachs one of the heads pale dark haired and beautiful belonged to peter keating he sat well in front trying to keep his eyes on the platform because he knew that many people were looking at him and would look at him later he did not glance back but the consciousness of those centered glances never left him his eyes were dark alert intelligent his mouth a small upturned crescent faultlessly traced was gentle and generous and warm with the faint promise of a smile his head had a certain classical perfection in the shape of the skull in the natural wave of black ringlets about finely hollowed temples he held his head in the manner of one who takes his beauty for granted but knows that others do not he was peter keating star student of stanton president of the student body captain of the track team member of the most important fraternity voted the most popular man on the campus the crowd was there thought peter keating to see him graduate and he tried to estimate the capacity of the hall they knew of his scholastic record and no one would beat his record today oh well there was shlinker shlinker had given him stiff competition but he had beaten shlinker this last year he had worked like a dog because he had wanted to beat shlinker he had no rivals today then he felt suddenly as if something had fallen down inside his throat to his stomach something cold and empty a blank hole rolling down and leaving that feeling on its way not a thought just the hint of a question asking him whether he was really as great as this day would proclaim him to be he looked for shlinker in the crowd he saw his yellow face and goldrimmed glasses he stared at shlinker warmly in relief in reassurance in gratitude it was obvious that shlinker could never hope to equal his own appearance or ability he had nothing to doubt he would always beat shlinker and all the shlinkers of the world he would let no one achieve what he could not achieve let them all watch him he would give them good reason to stare he felt the hot breaths about him and the expectation like a tonic it was wonderful thought peter keating to be alive his head was beginning to reel a little it was a pleasant feeling the feeling carried him unresisting and unremembering to the platform in front of all those faces he stood slender trim athletic and let the deluge break upon his head he gathered from its roar that he had graduated with honors that the architects guild of america had presented him with a gold medal and that he had been awarded the prix de paris by the society for architectural enlightenment of the usa a fouryear scholarship at the école des beaux arts in paris then he was shaking hands scratching the perspiration off his face with the end of a rolled parchment nodding smiling suffocating in his black gown and hoping that people would not notice his mother sobbing with her arms about him the president of the institute shook his hand booming stanton will be proud of you my boy the dean shook his hand repeating a glorious future a glorious future a glorious future professor peterkin shook his hand and patted his shoulder saying and youll find it absolutely essential for example i had the experience when i built the peabody post office keating did not listen to the rest because he had heard the story of the peabody post office many times it was the only structure anyone had ever known professor peterkin to have erected before he sacrificed his practice to the responsibilities of teaching a great deal was said about keatings final project a palace of fine arts for the life of him keating could not remember at the moment what that project was through all this his eyes held the vision of guy francon shaking his hand and his ears held the sounds of francons mellow voice as i have told you it is still open my boy of course now that you have this scholarship you will have to decide a beauxarts diploma is very important to a young man but i should be delighted to have you in our office the banquet of the class of was long and solemn keating listened to the speeches with interest when he heard the endless sentences about young men as the hope of american architecture and the future opening its golden gates he knew that he was the hope and his was the future and it was pleasant to hear this confirmation from so many eminent lips he looked at the grayhaired orators and thought of how much younger he would be when he reached their positions theirs and beyond them then he thought suddenly of howard roark he was surprised to find that the flash of that name in his memory gave him a sharp little twinge of pleasure before he could know why then he remembered howard roark had been expelled this morning he reproached himself silently he made a determined effort to feel sorry but the secret glow came back whenever he thought of that expulsion the event proved conclusively that he had been a fool to imagine roark a dangerous rival at one time he had worried about roark more than about shlinker even though roark was two years younger and one class below him if he had ever entertained any doubts on their respective gifts hadnt this day settled it all and he remembered roark had been very nice to him helping him whenever he was stuck on a problem not stuck really just did not have the time to think it out a plan or something christ how roark could untangle a plan like pulling a string and it was open well what if he could what did it get him he was done for now and knowing this peter keating experienced at last a satisfying pang of sympathy for howard roark when keating was called upon to speak he rose confidently he could not show that he was terrified he had nothing to say about architecture but he spoke his head high as an equal among equals just subtly diffident so that no great name present could take offense he remembered saying architecture is a great art with our eyes to the future and the reverence of the past in our hearts of all the crafts the most important one sociologically and as the man who is an inspiration to us all has said today the three eternal entities are truth love and beauty then in the corridors outside in the noisy confusion of leavetaking a boy had thrown an arm about keatings shoulders and whispered run on home and get out of the soupandfish pete and its boston for us tonight just our own gang ill pick you up in an hour ted shlinker had urged of course youre coming pete no fun without you and by the way congratulations and all that sort of thing no hard feelings may the best man win keating had thrown his arm about shlinkers shoulders keatings eyes had glowed with an insistent kind of warmth as if shlinker were his most precious friend keatings eyes glowed like that on everybody he had said thanks ted old man i really do feel awful about the aga medal i think you were the one for it but you never can tell what possesses those old fogies and now keating was on his way home through the soft darkness wondering how to get away from his mother for the night his mother he thought had done a great deal for him as she pointed out frequently she was a lady and had graduated from high school yet she had worked hard had taken boarders into their home a concession unprecedented in her family his father had owned a stationery store in stanton changing times had ended the business and a hernia had ended peter keating sr twelve years ago louisa keating had been left with the home that stood at the end of a respectable street an annuity from an insurance kept up accurately she had seen to that and her son the annuity was a modest one but with the help of the boarders and of a tenacious purpose mrs keating had managed in the summers her son helped clerking in hotels or posing for hat advertisements her son mrs keating had decided would assume his rightful place in the world and she had clung to this as softly as inexorably as a leech its funny keating remembered at one time he had wanted to be an artist it was his mother who had chosen a better field in which to exercise his talent for drawing architecture she had said is such a respectable profession besides you meet the best people in it she had pushed him into his career he had never known when or how its funny thought keating he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years its funny that it should hurt him now to remember well this was the night to remember it and to forget it forever architects he thought always made brilliant careers and once on top did they ever fail suddenly he recalled henry cameron builder of skyscrapers twenty years ago old drunkard with offices on some waterfront today keating shuddered and walked faster he wondered as he walked whether people were looking at him he watched the rectangles of lighted windows when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out he tried to guess whether it had leaned to watch his passing if it hadnt some day it would some day they all would howard roark was sitting on the porch steps when keating approached the house he was leaning back against the steps propped up on his elbows his long legs stretched out a morningglory climbed over the porch pillars as a curtain between the house and the light of a lamppost on the corner it was strange to see an electric globe in the air of a spring night it made the street darker and softer it hung alone like a gap and left nothing to be seen but a few branches heavy with leaves standing still at the gaps edges the small hint became immense as if the darkness held nothing but a flood of leaves the mechanical ball of glass made the leaves seem more living it took away their color and gave the promise that in daylight they would be a brighter green than had ever existed it took away ones sight and left a new sense instead neither smell nor touch yet both a sense of spring and space keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darkness of the porch it was the one person whom he had wanted to see tonight he was glad to find roark alone and a little afraid of it congratulations peter said roark oh oh thanks keating was surprised to find that he felt more pleasure than from any other compliment he had received today he was timidly glad that roark approved and he called himself inwardly a fool for it i mean do you know or he added sharply has mother been telling you she has she shouldnt have why not look howard you know that im terribly sorry about your being roark threw his head back and looked up at him forget it said roark i theres something i want to speak to you about howard to ask your advice mind if i sit down what is it keating sat down on the steps beside him there was no part that he could ever play in roarks presence besides he did not feel like playing a part now he heard a leaf rustling in its fall to the earth it was a thin glassy spring sound he knew for the moment that he felt affection for roark an affection that held pain astonishment and helplessness you wont think said keating gently in complete sincerity that its awful of me to be asking about my business when youve just been i said forget about that what is it you know said keating honestly and unexpectedly even to himself ive often thought that youre crazy but i know that you know many things about it architecture i mean which those fools never knew and i know that you love it as they never will well well i dont know why i should come to you but howard ive never said it before but you see id rather have your opinion on things than the deans id probably follow the deans but its just that yours means more to me myself i dont know why i dont know why im saying this either roark turned over on his side looked at him and laughed it was a young kind friendly laughter a thing so rare to hear from roark that keating felt as if someone had taken his hand in reassurance and he forgot that he had a party in boston waiting for him come on said roark youre not being afraid of me are you what do you want to ask about its about my scholarship the paris prize i got yes its for four years but on the other hand guy francon offered me a job with him some time ago today he said its still open and i dont know which to take roark looked at him roarks fingers moved in slow rotation beating against the steps if you want my advice peter he said at last youve made a mistake already by asking me by asking anyone never ask people not about your work dont you know what you want how can you stand it not to know you see thats what i admire about you howard you always know drop the compliments but i mean it how do you always manage to decide how can you let others decide for you but you see im not sure howard im never sure of myself i dont know whether im as good as they all tell me i am i wouldnt admit that to anyone but you i think its because youre always so sure that i petey mrs keatings voice exploded behind them petey sweetheart what are you doing there she stood in the doorway in her best dress of burgundy taffeta happy and angry and here ive been sitting all alone waiting for you what on earth are you doing on those filthy steps in your dress suit get up this minute come on in the house boys ive got hot chocolate and cookies ready for you but mother i wanted to speak to howard about something important said keating but he rose to his feet she seemed not to have heard she walked into the house keating followed roark looked after them shrugged rose and went in also mrs keating settled down in an armchair her stiff skirt crackling well she asked what were you two discussing out there keating fingered an ash tray picked up a matchbox and dropped it then ignoring her turned to roark look howard drop the pose he said his voice high shall i junk the scholarship and go to work or let francon wait and grab the beauxarts to impress the yokels what do you think something was gone the one moment was lost now petey let me get this straight began mrs keating oh wait a minute mother howard ive got to weigh it carefully it isnt everyone who can get a scholarship like that youre pretty good when you rate that a course at the beauxarts you know how important that is i dont said roark oh hell i know your crazy ideas but im speaking practically for a man in my position ideals aside for a moment it certainly is you dont want my advice said roark of course i do im asking you but keating could never be the same when he had an audience any audience something was gone he did not know it but he felt that roark knew roarks eyes made him uncomfortable and that made him angry i want to practice architecture snapped keating not talk about it gives you a great prestige the old école puts you above the rank and file of the explumbers who think they can build on the other hand an opening with francon guy francon himself offering it roark turned away how many boys will match that keating went on blindly a year from now theyll be boasting theyre working for smith or jones if they find work at all while ill be with francon heyer youre quite right peter said mrs keating rising on a question like that you dont want to consult your mother its too important ill leave you to settle it with mr roark he looked at his mother he did not want to hear what she thought of this he knew that his only chance to decide was to make the decision before he heard her she had stopped looking at him ready to turn and leave the room he knew it was not a pose she would leave if he wished it he wanted her to go he wanted it desperately he said why mother how can you say that of course i want your opinion what what do you think she ignored the raw irritation in his voice she smiled petey i never think anything its up to you its always been up to you well he began hesitantly watching her if i go to the beauxarts fine said mrs keating go to the beauxarts its a grand place a whole ocean away from your home of course if you go mr francon will take somebody else people will talk about that everybody knows that mr francon picks out the best boy from stanton every year for his office i wonder how itll look if some other boy gets the job but i guess that doesnt matter what what will people say nothing much i guess only that the other boy was the best man of his class i guess hell take shlinker no he gulped furiously not shlinker yes she said sweetly shlinker but but why should you care what people will say all you have to do is please yourself and you think that francon why should i think of mr francon its nothing to me mother you want me to take the job with francon i dont want anything petey youre the boss he wondered whether he really liked his mother but she was his mother and this fact was recognized by everybody as meaning automatically that he loved her and so he took for granted mat whatever he felt for her was love he did not know whether there was any reason why he should respect her judgment she was his mother this was supposed to take the place of reasons yes of course mother but yes i know but howard it was a plea for help roark was there on a davenport in the corner half lying sprawled limply like a kitten it had often astonished keating he had seen roark moving with the soundless tension the control the precision of a cat he had seen him relaxed like a cat in shapeless ease as if his body held no single solid bone roark glanced up at him he said peter you know how i feel about either one of your opportunities take your choice of the lesser evil what will you learn at the beauxarts only more renaissance palaces and operetta settings theyll kill everything you might have in you you do good work once in a while when somebody lets you if you really want to learn go to work francon is a bastard and a fool but you will be building it will prepare you for going on your own that much sooner even mr roark can talk sense sometimes said mrs keating even if he does talk like a truck driver do you really think that i do good work keating looked at him as if his eyes still held the reflection of that one sentence and nothing else mattered occasionally said roark not often now that its all settled began mrs keating i ill have to think it over mother now that its all settled how about the hot chocolate ill have it out to you in a jiffy she smiled at her son an innocent smile that declared her obedience and gratitude and she rustled out of the room keating paced nervously stopped lighted a cigarette stood spitting the smoke out in short jerks then looked at roark what are you going to do now howard i very thoughtless of me i know going on like that about myself mother means well but she drives me crazy well to hell with that what are you going to do im going to new york oh swell to get a job to get a job in in architecture in architecture peter thats grand im glad got any definite prospects im going to work for henry cameron oh no howard roark smiled slowly the corners of his mouth sharp and said nothing oh no howard yes but hes nothing nobody any more oh i know he has a name but hes done for he never gets any important buildings hasnt had any for years they say hes got a dump for an office what kind of future will you get out of him what will you learn not much only how to build for gods sake you cant go on like that deliberately ruining yourself i thought well yes i thought youd learned something today i have look howard if its because you think that no one else will have you now no one better why ill help you ill work old francon and ill get connections and thank you peter but it wont be necessary its settled what did he say who cameron ive never met him then a horn screamed outside keating remembered started off to change his clothes collided with his mother at the door and knocked a cup off her loaded tray petey never mind mother he seized her elbows im in a hurry sweetheart a little party with the boys now now dont say anything i wont be late and look well celebrate my going with francon heyer he kissed her impulsively with the gay exuberance that made him irresistible at times and flew out of the room up the stairs mrs keating shook her head flustered reproving and happy in his room while flinging his clothes in all directions keating thought suddenly of a wire he would send to new york that particular subject had not been in his mind all day but it came to him with a sense of desperate urgency he wanted to send that wire now at once he scribbled it down on a piece of paper katie dearest coming new york job francon love ever peter that night keating raced toward boston wedged in between two boys the wind and the road whistling past him and he thought that the world was opening to him now like the darkness fleeing before the bobbing headlights he was free he was ready in a few years so very soon for time did not exist in the speed of that car his name would ring like a horn ripping people out of sleep he was ready to do great things magnificent things things unsurpassed in in oh hell in architecture peter keating looked at the streets of new york the people he observed were extremely well dressed he had stopped for a moment before the building on fifth avenue where the office of francon heyer and his first day of work awaited him he looked at the men who hurried past smart he thought smart as hell he glanced regretfully at his own clothes he had a great deal to learn in new york when he could delay it no longer he turned to the door it was a miniature doric portico every inch of it scaled down to the exact proportions decreed by the artists who had worn flowing grecian tunics between the marble perfection of the columns a revolving door sparkled with nickel plate reflecting the streaks of automobiles flying past keating walked through the revolving door through the lustrous marble lobby to an elevator of gilt and red lacquer that brought him thirty floors later to a mahogany door he saw a slender brass plate with delicate letters francon heyer architects the reception room of the office of francon heyer architects looked like a cool intimate ballroom in a colonial mansion the silver white walls were paneled with flat pilasters the pilasters were fluted and curved into ionic snails they supported little pediments broken in the middle to make room for half a grecian urn plastered against the wall etchings of greek temples adorned the panels too small to be distinguished but presenting the unmistakable columns pediments and crumbling stone quite incongruously keating felt as if a conveyor belt was under his feet from the moment he crossed the threshold it carried him to the reception clerk who sat at a telephone switchboard behind the white balustrade of a florentine balcony it transferred him to the threshold of a huge drafting room he saw long flat tables a forest of twisted rods descending from the ceiling to end in greenshaded lamps enormous blueprint files towers of yellow drawers papers tin boxes sample bricks pots of glue and calendars from construction companies most of them bearing pictures of naked women the chief draftsman snapped at keating without quite seeing him he was bored and crackling with purpose simultaneously he jerked his thumb in the direction of a locker room thrust his chin out toward the door of a locker and stood rocking from heels to toes while keating pulled a pearlgray smock over his stiff uncertain body francon had insisted on that smock the conveyor belt stopped at a table in a corner of the drafting room where keating found himself with a set of plans to expand the scaggy back of the chief draftsman retreating from him in the unmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence keating bent over his task at once his eyes fixed his throat rigid he saw nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him the steady lines he drew surprised him for he felt certain that his hand was jerking an inch back and forth across the sheet he followed the lines not knowing where they led or why he knew only that the plan was someones tremendous achievement which he could neither question nor equal he wondered why he had ever thought of himself as a potential architect much later he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair of shoulder blades over the next table he glanced about him cautiously at first then with curiosity then with pleasure then with contempt when he reached this last peter keating became himself again and felt love for mankind he noticed sallow cheeks a funny nose a wart on a receding chin a stomach squashed against the edge of a table he loved these sights what these could do he could do better he smiled peter keating needed his fellow men when he glanced at his plans again he noticed the flaws glaring at him from the masterpiece it was the floor of a private residence and he noted the twisted hallways that sliced great hunks of space for no apparent reason the long rectangular sausages of rooms doomed to darkness jesus he thought theyd have flunked me for this in the first term after which he proceeded with his work swiftly easily expertly and happily before lunchtime keating had made friends in the room not any definite friends but a vague soil spread and ready from which friendship would spring he had smiled at his neighbors and winked in understanding over nothing at all he had used each trip to the water cooler to caress those he passed with the soft cheering glow of his eyes the brilliant eyes that seemed to pick each man in turn out of the room out of the universe as the most important specimen of humanity and as keatings dearest friend there goes there seemed to be left in his wake a smart boy and a hell of a good fellow keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the next table was doing the elevation of an office building keating leaned with chummy respect against the boys shoulder and looked at the laurel garlands entwined about fluted columns three floors high pretty good for the old man said keating with admiration who asked the boy why francon said keating francon hell said the boy placidly he hasnt designed a doghouse in eight years he jerked his thumb over his shoulder at a glass door behind them him what asked keating turning him said the boy stengel he does all these things behind the glass door keating saw a pair of bony shoulders above the edge of a desk a small triangular head bent intently and two blank pools of light in the round frames of glasses it was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have passed beyond the closed door and keating learned from the rustle of whispers around him that guy francon had arrived and had risen to his office on the floor above half an hour later the glass door opened and stengel came out a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers hey you he said his glasses stopping on keatings face you doing the plans for this he swung the cardboard forward take this up to the boss for the okay try to listen to what hell say and try to look intelligent neither of which matters anyway he was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his ankles arms swinging like ropes in the long sleeves with big efficient hands keatings eyes froze darkening for onetenth of a second gathered in a tight stare at the blank lenses then keating smiled and said pleasantly yes sir he carried the cardboard on the tips of his ten fingers up the crimsonplushed stairway to guy francons office the cardboard displayed a watercolor perspective of a gray granite mansion with three tiers of dormers five balconies four bays twelve columns one flagpole and two lions at the entrance in the corner neatly printed by hand stood residence of mr and mrs james s whattles francon heyer architects keating whistled softly james s whattles was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shaving lotions guy francons office was polished no thought keating not polished but shellacked no not shellacked but liquid with mirrors melted and poured over every object he saw splinters of his own reflection let loose like a swarm of butterflies following him across the room on the chippendale cabinets on the jacobean chairs on the louis xv mantelpiece he had time to note a genuine roman statue in a corner sepia photographs of the parthenon of rheims cathedral of versailles and of the frink national bank building with the eternal torch he saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the massive mahogany desk guy francon sat behind the desk guy francons face was yellow and his cheeks sagged he looked at keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before then remembered and smiled expansively well well well kittredge my boy here we are all set and at home so glad to see you sit down boy sit down what have you got there well theres no hurry no hurry at all sit down how do you like it here im afraid sir that im a little too happy said keating with an expression of frank boyish helplessness i thought i could be businesslike on my first job but starting in a place like this i guess it knocked me out a little ill get over it sir he promised of course said guy francon it might be a bit overwhelming for a boy just a bit but dont you worry im sure youll make good ill do my best sir of course you will whats this they sent me francon extended his hand to the drawing but his fingers came to rest limply on his forehead instead its so annoying this headache no no nothing serious he smiled at keatings prompt concern just a little mal de tête one works so hard is there anything i can get for you sir no no thank you its not anything you can get for me its if only you could take something away from me he winked the champagne entre nous that champagne of theirs wasnt worth a damn last night ive never cared for champagne anyway let me tell you kittredge its very important to know about wines for instance when youll take a client out to dinner and will want to be sure of the proper thing to order now ill tell you a professional secret take quail for instance now most people would order burgundy with it what do you do you call for clos vougeot see adds that certain touch correct but original one must always be original who sent you up by the way mr stengel sir oh stengel the tone in which he pronounced the name clicked like a shutter in keatings mind it was a permission to be stored away for future use too grand to bring his own stuff up eh mind you hes a great designer the best designer in new york city but hes just getting to be a bit too grand lately he thinks hes the only one doing any work around here just because he smudges at a board all day long youll learn my boy when youve been in the business longer that the real work of an office is done beyond its walls take last night for instance banquet of the clarion real estate association two hundred guests dinner and champagne oh yes champagne he wrinkled his nose fastidiously in selfmockery a few words to say informally in a little afterdinner speech you know nothing blatant no vulgar sales talk only a few wellchosen thoughts on the responsibility of realtors to society on the importance of selecting architects who are competent respected and well established you know a few bright little slogans that will stick in the mind yes sir like choose the builder of your home as carefully as you choose the bride to inhabit it not bad not bad at all kittredge mind if i jot it down my name is keating sir said keating firmly you are very welcome to the idea im happy if it appeals to you keating of course why of course keating said francon with a disarming smile dear me one meets so many people how did you say it choose the builder it was very well put he made keating repeat it and wrote it down on a pad picking a pencil from an array before him new manycolored pencils sharpened to a professional needle point ready unused then he pushed he pad aside sighed patted the smooth waves of his hair and said wearily well all right i suppose ill have to look at the thing keating extended the drawing respectfully francon leaned back held the cardboard out at arms length and looked at it he closed his left eye then his right eye then moved the cardboard an inch farther keating expected wildly to see him turn the drawing upside down but francon just held it and keating knew suddenly that he had long since stopped seeing it francon was studying it for his keatings benefit and then keating felt light light as air and he saw the road to his future clear and open hm yes francon was saying rubbing his chin with the tips of two soft fingers hm yes he turned to keating not bad said francon not bad at all well perhaps it would have been more distinguished you know but well the drawing is done so neatly what do you think keating keating thought that four of the windows faced four mammoth granite columns but he looked at francons fingers playing with a petuniamauve necktie and decided not to mention it he said instead if i may make a suggestion sir it seems to me that the cartouches between the fourth and fifth floors are somewhat too modest for so imposing a building it would appear that an ornamented stringcourse would be so much more appropriate thats it i was just going to say it an ornamented stringcourse but but look it would mean diminishing the fenestration wouldnt it yes said keating a faint coating of diffidence over the tone he had used in discussions with his classmates but windows are less important than the dignity of a buildings facade thats right dignity we must give our clients dignity above all yes definitely an ornamented stringcourse only look ive approved the preliminary drawings and stengel has had this done up so neatly mr stengel will be delighted to change it if you advise him to francons eyes held keatings for a moment then francons lashes dropped and he picked a piece of lint off his sleeve of course of course he said vaguely but do you think the stringcourse is really important i think said keating slowly it is more important to make changes you find necessary than to okay every drawing just as mr stengel designed it because francon said nothing but only looked straight at him because francons eyes were focused and his hands limp keating knew that he had taken a terrible chance and won he became frightened by the chance after he knew he had won they looked silently across the desk and both saw that they were two men who could understand each other well have an ornamented stringcourse said francon with calm genuine authority leave this here tell stengel that i want to see him he had turned to go francon stopped him francons voice was gay and warm oh keating by the way may i make a suggestion just between us no offense intended but a burgundy necktie would be so much better than blue with your gray smock dont you think so yes sir said keating easily thank you youll see it tomorrow he walked out and closed the door softly on his way back through the reception room keating saw a distinguished grayhaired gentleman escorting a lady to the door the gentleman wore no hat and obviously belonged to the office the lady wore a mink cape and was obviously a client the gentleman was not bowing to the ground he was not unrolling a carpet he was not waving a fan over her head he was only holding the door for her it merely seemed to keating that the gentleman was doing all of that the frink national bank building rose over lower manhattan and its long shadow moved as the sun traveled over the sky like a huge clock hand across grimy tenements from the aquarium to manhattan bridge when the sun was gone the torch of hadrians mausoleum flared up in its stead and made glowing red smears on the glass of windows for miles around on the top stories of buildings high enough to reflect it the frink national bank building displayed the entire history of roman art in wellchosen specimens for a long time it had been considered the best building of the city because no other structure could boast a single classical item which it did not possess it offered so many columns pediments friezes tripods gladiators urns and volutes that it looked as if it had not been built of white marble but squeezed out of a pastry tube it was however built of white marble no one knew that but the owners who had paid for it it was now of a streaked blotched leprous color neither brown nor green but the worst tones of both the color of slow rot the color of smoke gas fumes and acids eating into a delicate stone intended for clean air and open country the frink national bank building however was a great success it had been so great a success that it was the last structure guy francon ever designed its prestige spared him the bother from then on three blocks east of the frink national bank stood the dana building it was some stories lower and without any prestige whatever its lines were hard and simple revealing emphasizing the harmony of the steel skeleton within as a body reveals the perfection of its bones it had no other ornament to offer it displayed nothing but the precision of its sharp angles the modeling of its planes the long streaks of its windows like streams of ice running down from the roof to the pavements new yorkers seldom looked at the dana building sometimes a rare country visitor would come upon it unexpectedly in the moonlight and stop and wonder from what dream that vision had come but such visitors were rare the tenants of the dana building said that they would not exchange it for any structure on earth they appreciated the light the air the beautiful logic of the plan in their halls and offices but the tenants of the dana building were not numerous no prominent man wished his business to be located in a building that looked like a warehouse the dana building had been designed by henry cameron in the eighteeneighties the architects of new york fought one another for second place in their profession no one aspired to the first the first was held by henry cameron henry cameron was hard to get in those days he had a waiting list two years in advance he designed personally every structure that left his office he chose what he wished to build when he built a client kept his mouth shut he demanded of all people the one thing he had never granted anybody obedience he went through the years of his fame like a projectile flying to a goal no one could guess people called him crazy but they took what he gave them whether they understood it or not because it was a building by henry cameron at first his buildings were merely a little different not enough to frighten anyone he made startling experiments once in a while but people expected it and one did not argue with henry cameron something was growing in him with each new building struggling taking shape rising dangerously to an explosion the explosion came with the birth of the skyscraper when structures began to rise not in tier on ponderous tier of masonry but as arrows of steel shooting upward without weight or limit henry cameron was among the first to understand this new miracle and to give it form he was among the first and the few who accepted the truth that a tall building must look tall while architects cursed wondering how to make a twentystory building look like an old brick mansion while they used every horizontal device available in order to cheat it of its height shrink it down to tradition hide the shame of its steel make it small safe and ancient henry cameron designed skyscrapers in straight vertical lines flaunting their steel and height while architects drew friezes and pediments henry cameron decided that the skyscraper must not copy the greeks henry cameron decided that no building must copy any other he was thirtynine years old then short stocky unkempt he worked like a dog missed his sleep and meals drank seldom but then brutally called his clients unprintable names laughed at hatred and fanned it deliberately behaved like a feudal lord and a longshoreman and lived in a passionate tension that stung men in any room he entered a fire neither they nor he could endure much longer it was the year the columbian exposition of chicago opened in the year the rome of two thousand years ago rose on the shores of lake michigan a rome improved by pieces of france spain athens and every style that followed it it was a dream city of columns triumphal arches blue lagoons crystal fountains and popcorn its architects competed on who could steal best from the oldest source and from the most sources at once it spread before the eyes of a new country every structural crime ever committed in all the old ones it was white as a plague and it spread as such people came looked were astounded and carried away with them to the cities of america the seeds of what they had seen the seeds sprouted into weeds into shingled post offices with doric porticos brick mansions with iron pediments lofts made of twelve parthenons piled on top of one another the weeds grew and choked everything else henry cameron had refused to work for the columbian exposition and had called it names that were unprintable but repeatable though not in mixed company they were repeated it was repeated also that he had thrown an inkstand at the face of a distinguished banker who had asked him to design a railroad station in the shape of the temple of diana at ephesus the banker never came back there were others who never came back just as he reached the goal of long struggling years just as he gave shape to the truth he had sought the last barrier fell closed before him a young country had watched him on his way had wondered had begun to accept the new grandeur of his work a country flung two thousand years back in an orgy of classicism could find no place for him and no use it was not necessary to design buildings any longer only to photograph them the architect with the best library was the best architect imitators copied imitations to sanction it there was culture there were twenty centuries unrolling in moldering ruins there was the great exposition there was every european post card in every family album henry cameron had nothing to offer against this nothing but a faith he held merely because it was his own he had nobody to quote and nothing of importance to say he said only that the form of a building must follow its function that the structure of a building is the key to its beauty that new methods of construction demand new forms that he wished to build as he wished and for that reason only but people could not listen to him when they were discussing vitruvius michelangelo and sir christopher wren men hate passion any great passion henry cameron made a mistake he loved his work that was why he fought that was why he lost people said he never knew that he had lost if he did he never let them see it as his clients became rarer his manner to them grew more overbearing the less the prestige of his name the more arrogant the sound of his voice pronouncing it he had had an astute business manager a mild selfeffacing little man of iron who in the days of his glory faced quietly the storms of camerons temper and brought him clients cameron insulted the clients but the little man made them accept it and come back the little man died cameron had never known how to face people they did not matter to him as his own life did not matter as nothing mattered but buildings he had never learned to give explanations only orders he had never been liked he had been feared no one feared him any longer he was allowed to live he lived to loathe the streets of the city he had dreamed of rebuilding he lived to sit at the desk in his empty office motionless idle waiting he lived to read in a wellmeaning newspaper account a reference to the late henry cameron he lived to begin drinking quietly steadily terribly for days and nights at a time and to hear those who had driven him to it say when his name was mentioned for a commission cameron i should say not he drinks like a fish thats why he never gets any work he lived to move from the offices that occupied three floors of a famous building to one floor on a less expensive street then to a suite farther downtown then to three rooms facing an air shaft near the battery he chose these rooms because by pressing his face to the window of his office he could see over a brick wall the top of the dana building howard roark looked at the dana building beyond the windows stopping at each landing as he mounted the six flights of stairs to henry camerons office the elevator was out of order the stairs had been painted a dirty filegreen a long time ago a little of the paint remained to grate under shoe soles in crumbling patches roark went up swiftly as if he had an appointment a folder of his drawings under his arm his eyes on the dana building he collided once with a man descending the stairs this had happened to him often in the last two days he had walked through the streets of the city his head thrown back noticing nothing but the buildings of new york in the dark cubbyhole of camerons anteroom stood a desk with a telephone and a typewriter a grayhaired skeleton of a man sat at the desk in his shirt sleeves with a pair of limp suspenders over his shoulders he was typing specifications intently with two fingers and incredible speed the light from a feeble bulb made a pool of yellow on his back where the damp shirt stuck to his shoulder blades the man raised his head slowly when roark entered he looked at roark said nothing and waited his old eyes weary unquestioning incurious i should like to see mr cameron said roark yeah said the man without challenge offense or meaning about what about a job what job drafting the man sat looking at him blankly it was a request that had not confronted him for a long time he rose at last without a word shuffled to a door behind him and went in he left the door half open roark heard him drawling mr cameron theres a fellow outside says hes looking for a job here then a voice answered a strong clear voice that held no tones of age why the damn fool throw him out wait send him in the old man returned held the door open and jerked his head at it silently roark went in the door closed behind him henry cameron sat at his desk at the end of a long bare room he sat bent forward his forearms on the desk his two hands closed before him his hair and his beard were coal black with coarse threads of white the muscles of his short thick neck bulged like ropes he wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled above the elbows the bare arms were hard heavy and brown the flesh of his broad face was rigid as if it had aged by compression the eyes were dark young living roark stood on the threshold and they looked at each other across the long room the light from the air shaft was gray and the dust on the drafting table on the few green files looked like fuzzy crystals deposited by the light but on the wall between the windows roark saw a picture it was the only picture in the room it was the drawing of a skyscraper that had never been erected roarks eyes moved first and they moved to the drawing he walked across the office stopped before it and stood looking at it camerons eyes followed him a heavy glance like a long thin needle held fast at one end describing a slow circle its point piercing roarks body keeping it pinned firmly cameron looked at the orange hair at the hand hanging by his side its palm to the drawing the fingers bent slightly forgotten not in a gesture but in the overture to a gesture of asking or seizing something well said cameron at last did you come to see me or did you come to look at pictures roark turned to him both said roark he walked to the desk people had always lost their sense of existence in roarks presence but cameron felt suddenly that he had never been as real as in the awareness of the eyes now looking at him what do you want snapped cameron i should like to work for you said roark quietly the voice said i should like to work for you the tone of the voice said im going to work for you are you said cameron not realizing that he answered the unpronounced sentence whats the matter none of the bigger and better fellows will have you i have not applied to anyone else why not do you think this is the easiest place to begin think anybody can walk in here without trouble do you know who i am yes thats why im here who sent you no one why the hell should you pick me i think you know that what infernal impudence made you presume that id want you have you decided that im so hard up that id throw the gates open for any punk whod do me the honor old cameron youve

its not necessary where have you worked before im just beginning what have you done ive had three years at stanton oh the gentleman was too lazy to finish i have been expelled great cameron slapped the desk with his fist and laughed splendid youre not good enough for the lice nest at stanton but youll work for henry cameron youve decided this is the place for refuse what did they kick you out for drink women what these said roark and extended his drawings cameron looked at the first one then at the next then at every one of them to the bottom roark heard the paper rustling as cameron slipped one sheet behind another then cameron raised his head sit down roark obeyed cameron stared at him his thick fingers drumming against the pile of drawings so you think theyre good said cameron well theyre awful its unspeakable its a crime look he shoved a drawing at roarks face look at that what in christs name was your idea what possessed you to indent that plan here did you just want to make it pretty because you had to patch something together who do you think you are guy francon god help you look at this building you fool you get an idea like this and you dont know what to do with it you stumble on a magnificent thing and you have to ruin it do you know how much youve got to learn yes thats why im here and look at that one i wish id done that at your age but why did you have to botch it do you know what id do with that look to hell with your stairways and to hell with your furnace room when you lay the foundations he spoke furiously for a long time he cursed he did not find one sketch to satisfy him but roark noticed that he spoke as of buildings that were in construction he broke off abruptly pushed the drawings aside and put his fist over them he asked when did you decide to become an architect when i was ten years old men dont know what they want so early in life if ever youre lying am i dont stare at me like that cant you look at something else why did you decide to be an architect i didnt know it then but its because ive never believed in god come on talk sense because i love this earth thats all i love i dont like the shape of things on this earth i

didnt either got any family no worked through school yes at what in the building trades how much money have you got left seventeen dollars and thirty cents when did you come to new york yesterday

to anyone else whats your name howard roark if youre late ill fire you yes roark extended his hand for the drawings leave these here bellowed cameron now get out toohey said guy francon ellsworth toohey pretty decent of him dont you think read it peter francon leaned jovially across his desk and handed to keating the august issue of new frontiers new frontiers had a white cover with a black emblem that combined a palette a lyre a hammer a screw driver and a rising sun it had a circulation of thirty thousand and a following that described itself as the intellectual vanguard of the country no one had ever risen to challenge the description keating read from an article entitled marble and mortar by ellsworth m toohey and now we come to another notable achievement of the metropolitan skyline we call the attention of the discriminating to the new melton building by francon heyer it stands in white serenity as an eloquent witness to the triumph of classical purity and common sense the discipline of an immortal tradition has served here as a cohesive factor in evolving a structure whose beauty can reach simply and lucidly the heart of every man in the street there is no freak exhibitionism here no perverted striving for novelty no orgy of unbridled egotism guy francon its designer has known how to subordinate himself to the mandatory canons which generations of craftsmen behind him have proved inviolate and at the same time how to display his own creative originality not in spite of but precisely because of the classical dogma he has accepted with the humility of a true artist it may be worth mentioning in passing that dogmatic discipline is the only thing which makes true originality possible more important however is the symbolic significance of a building such as this rising in our imperial city as one stands before its southern facade one is stricken with the realization that the stringcourses repeated with deliberate and gracious monotony from the third to the eighteenth story these long straight horizontal lines are the moderating leveling principle the lines of equality they seem to bring the towering structure down to the humble level of the observer they are the lines of the earth of the people of the great masses they seem to tell us that none may rise too high above the restraint of the common human level that all is held and shall be checked even as this proud edifice by the stringcourses of mens brotherhood there was more keating read it all then raised his head gee he said awed francon smiled happily pretty good eh and from toohey no less not many people might have heard the name but they will mark my word they will i know the signs so he doesnt think im so bad and hes got a tongue like an icepick when he feels like using it you should see what he says about others more often than not you know durkins latest mousetrap well i was at a party where toohey said francon chuckled he said if mr durkin suffers under the delusion that he is an architect someone should mention to him the broad opportunities offered by the shortage of skilled plumbers thats what he said imagine in public i wonder said keating wistfully what hell say about me when the times comes what on earth does he mean by the symbolic significance stuff and the stringcourses of mens brotherhood oh well if thats what he praises us for we should worry its the critics job to interpret the artist mr francon even to the artist himself mr toohey has merely stated the hidden significance that was subconsciously in your own mind oh said francon vaguely oh do you think so he added brightly quite possible yes quite possible youre a smart boy peter thank you mr francon keating made a movement to rise wait dont go one more cigarette and then well both return to the drudgery francon was smiling over the article reading it again keating had never seen him so pleased no drawing in the office no work accomplished had ever made him as happy as these words from another man on a printed page to be read by other eyes keating sat easily in a comfortable chair his month with the firm had been well spent he had said nothing and done nothing but the impression had spread through the office that guy francon liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever anyone had to be sent hardly a day passed without the pleasant interlude of sitting across the desk from guy francon in a respectful growing intimacy listening to francons sighs about the necessity of being surrounded by men who understood him keating had learned all he could team about guy francon from his fellow draftsmen he had teamed that guy francon ate moderately and exquisitely and prided himself on the title of gourmet that he had graduated with distinction from the école des beauxarts that he had married a great deal of money and that the marriage had not been a happy one that he matched meticulously his socks with his handkerchiefs but never with his neckties that he had a great preference for designing buildings of gray granite that he owned a quarry of gray granite in connecticut which did a thriving business that he maintained a magnificent bachelor apartment done in plumcolored louis xv that his wife of a distinguished old name had died leaving her fortune to their only daughter that the daughter now nineteen was away at college these last facts interested keating a great deal he mentioned to francon tentatively in passing the subject of his daughter oh yes francon said thinly yes indeed keating abandoned all further research into the matter for the time being francons face had declared mat the thought of his daughter was painfully annoying to him for some reason which keating could not discover keating had met lucius n heyer francons partner and had seen him come to the office twice in three weeks but had been unable to learn what service heyer rendered to the firm heyer did not have haemophilia but looked as though he should have it he was a withered aristocrat with a long thin neck pate bulging eyes and a manner of frightened sweetness toward everyone he was the relic of an ancient family and it was suspected mat francon had taken him into partnership for the sake of his social connections people felt sorry for poor dear lucius admired him for the effort of undertaking a professional career and thought it would be nice to let him build their homes francon built them and required no further service from lucius this satisfied everybody the men in the drafting rooms loved peter keating he made them feel as if he had been there for a long time he had always known how to become part of any place he entered he came soft and bright as a sponge to be filled unresisting with the air and the mood of the place his warm smile his gay voice the easy shrug of his shoulders seemed to say that nothing weighed too much within his soul and so he was not one to blame to demand to accuse anything as he sat now watching francon read the article francon raised his head to glance at him francon saw two eyes looking at him with immense approval and two bright little points of contempt in the corners of keatings mouth like two musical notes of laughter visible the second before they were to be heard francon felt a great wave of comfort the comfort came from the contempt the approval together with that wise halfsmile granted him a grandeur he did not have to earn a blind admiration would have been precarious a deserved admiration would have been a responsibility an undeserved admiration was precious when you go peter give this to miss jeffers to put in my scrapbook on his way down the stairs keating flung the magazine high in the air and caught it smartly his lips pursed to whistle without sound in the drafting room he found tim davis his best friend slouched despondently over a drawing tim davis was the tall blond boy at the next table whom keating had noticed long ago because he had known with no tangible evidence but with certainty as keating always knew such things that this was the favored draftsman of the office keating managed to be assigned as frequently as possible to do parts of the projects on which davis worked soon they were going out to lunch together and to a quiet little speakeasy after the days work and keating was listening with breathless attention to davis talk about his love for one elaine duffy not a word of which keating ever remembered afterward he found davis now in black gloom his mouth chewing furiously a cigarette and a pencil at once keating did not have to question him he merely bent his friendly face over davis shoulder davis spit out the cigarette and exploded he had just been told that he would have to work overtime tonight for the third time this week got to stay late god knows how late gotta finish this damn tripe tonight he slammed the sheets spread before him look at it hours and hours and hours to finish it what am i going to do well its because youre the best man here tim and they need you to hell with that ive got a date with elaine tonight howm i going to break it third time she wont believe me she told me so last time thats the end im going up to guy the mighty and tell him where he can put his plans and his job im through wait said keating and leaned closer to him wait theres another way ill finish them for you huh ill stay ill do them dont be afraid no onell tell the difference pete would you sure ive nothing to do tonight you just stay till they all go home then skip oh gee pete davis sighed tempted but look if they find out theyll can me youre too new for this kind of job they wont find out i cant lose my job pete you know i cant elaine and i are going to be married soon if anything happens nothing will happen shortly after six davis departed furtively from the empty drafting room leaving keating at his table bending under a solitary green lamp keating glanced at the desolate expanse of three long rooms oddly silent after the days rush and he felt that he owned them that he would own them as surely as the pencil moved in his hand it was half past nine when he finished the plans stacked them neatly on davis table and left the office he walked down the street glowing with a comfortable undignified feeling as though after a good meal then the realization of his loneliness struck him suddenly he had to share this with someone tonight he had no one for the first time he wished his mother were in new york but she had remained in stanton awaiting the day when he would be able to send for her he had nowhere to go tonight save to the respectable little boardinghouse on west twentyeighth street where he could climb three flights of stairs to his clean airless little room he had met people in new york many people many girls with one of whom he remembered spending a pleasant night though he could not remember her last name but he wished to see none of them and then he thought of catherine halsey he had sent her a wire on the night of his graduation and forgotten her ever since now he wanted to see her the desire was intense and immediate with the first sound of her name in his memory he leaped into a bus for the long ride to greenwich village climbed to the deserted top and sitting alone on the front bench cursed the traffic lights whenever they turned to red it had always been like this where catherine was concerned and he wondered dimly what was the matter with him he had met her a year ago in boston where she had lived with her widowed mother he had found catherine homely and dull on that first meeting with nothing to her credit but her lovely smile not a sufficient reason ever to see her again he had telephoned her the next evening of the countless girls he had known in his student years she was the only one with whom he had never progressed beyond a few kisses he could have any girl he met and he knew it he knew that he could have catherine he wanted her she loved him and had admitted it simply openly without fear or shyness asking nothing of him expecting nothing somehow he had never taken advantage of it he had felt proud of the girls whom he escorted in those days the most beautiful girls the most popular the best dressed and he had delighted in the envy of his schoolmates he had been ashamed of catherines thoughtless sloppiness and of the fact that no other boy would look at her twice but he had never been as happy as when he took her to fraternity dances he had had many violent loves when he swore he could not live without this girl or that he forgot catherine for weeks at a time and she never reminded him he had always come back to her suddenly inexplicably as he did tonight her mother a gentle little schoolteacher had died last winter catherine had gone to live with an uncle in new york keating had answered some of her letters immediately others months later she had always replied at once and never written during his long silences waiting patiently he had felt when he thought of her that nothing would ever replace her then in new york within reach of a bus or a telephone he had forgotten her again for a month he never thought as he hurried to her now that he should have announced his visit he never wondered whether he would find her at home he had always come back like this and she had always been there she was there again tonight she opened the door for him on the top floor of a shabby pretentious brownstone house hello peter she said as if she had seen him yesterday she stood before him too small too thin for her clothes the short black skirt flared out from the slim band of her waist the boyish shirt collar hung loosely pulled to one side revealing the knob of a thin collarbone the sleeves were too long over the fragile hands she looked at him her head bent to one side her chestnut hair was gathered carelessly at the back of her neck but it looked as though it were bobbed standing light and fuzzy as a shapeless halo about her face her eyes were gray wide and nearsighted her mouth smiled slowly delicately enchantingly her lips glistening hello katie he said he felt at peace he felt he had nothing to fear in this house or anywhere outside he had prepared himself to explain how busy hed been in new york but explanations seemed irrelevant now give me your hat she said be careful of that chair its not very steady we have better ones in the living room come in the living room he noticed was modest but somehow distinguished and in surprisingly good taste he noticed the books cheap shelves rising to the ceiling loaded with precious volumes the volumes stacked carelessly actually being used he noticed over a neat shabby desk a rembrandt etching stained and yellow found perhaps in some junk shop by the eyes of a connoisseur who had never parted with it though its price would have obviously been of help to him he wondered what business her uncle could be in he had never asked he stood looking vaguely at the room feeling her presence behind him enjoying that sense of certainty which he found so rarely then he turned and took her in his arms and kissed her her lips met his softly eagerly but she was neither frightened nor excited too happy to accept this in any way save by taking it for granted god ive missed you he said and knew that he had every day since hed seen her last and most of all perhaps on the days when he had not thought of her you havent changed much she said you look a little thinner its becoming youll be very attractive when youre fifty peter thats not very complimentary by implication why oh you mean i think youre not attractive now oh but you are you shouldnt say that right out to me like that why not you know you are but ive been thinking of what youll look like at fifty youll have gray temples and youll wear a gray suit i saw one in a window last week and i thought that would be the one and youll be a very great architect you really think so why yes she was not flattering him she did not seem to realize that it could be flattery she was merely stating a fact too certain to need emphasis he waited for the inevitable questions but instead they were talking suddenly of their old stanton days together and he was laughing holding her across his knees her thin shoulders leaning against the circle of his arm her eyes soft contented he was speaking of their old bathing suits of the runs in her stockings of their favorite icecream parlor in stanton where they had spent so many summer evenings together and he was thinking dimly that it made no sense at all he had more pertinent things to tell and to ask her people did not talk like that when they hadnt seen each other for months but it seemed quite normal to her she did not appear to know that they had been parted he was first to ask finally did you get my wire oh yes thanks dont you want to know how im getting along in the city sure how are you getting along in the city look here youre not terribly interested oh but i am i want to know everything about you why dont you ask youll tell me when you want to it doesnt matter much to you does it what what ive been doing oh yes it does peter no not too much thats sweet of you but you see its not what you do that matters really its only you me what just you here or you in the city or you somewhere in the world i dont know just that you know youre a fool katie your technique is something awful my what your technique you cant tell a man so shamelessly like that that youre practically crazy about him but i am but you cant say so men wont care for you but i dont want men to care for me you want me to dont you but you do dont you i do he said his arms tightening about her damnably im a bigger fool than you are well then

its important im really very interested peter well you know im working for francon heyer and oh hell you dont even know what that means yes i do ive looked them up in whos who in architecture it said some very nice things about them and i asked uncle he said they were tops in the business you bet they are francon hes the greatest designer in new york in the whole country in the world maybe hes put up seventeen skyscrapers eight cathedrals six railroad terminals and god knows what else of course you know hes an old fool and a pompous fraud who oils his way into everything and he stopped his mouth open staring at her he had not intended to say that he had never allowed himself to think that before she was looking at him serenely yes she asked and well and he stammered and he knew that he could not speak differently not to her and thats what i really think of him and i have no respect for him at all and im delighted to be working for him see sure she said quietly youre ambitious peter dont you despise me for it no thats what you wanted sure thats what i wanted well actually its not as bad as that its a tremendous firm the best in the city im really doing good work and francon is very pleased with me im getting ahead i think i can have any job i want in the place eventually why only tonight i took over a mans work and he doesnt know that hell be useless soon because katie what am i saying its all right dear i understand if you did youd call me the names i deserve and make me stop it no peter i dont want to change you i love you peter god help you i know that you know that and you say it like this like youd say hello its a beautiful evening well why not why worry about it i love you no dont worry about it dont ever worry about it katie ill never love anyone else i know that too he held her close anxiously afraid that her weightless little body would vanish he did not know why her presence made him confess things unconfessed in his own mind he did not know why the victory he came here to share had faded but it did not matter he had a peculiar sense of freedom her presence always lifted from him a pressure he could not define he was alone he was himself all that mattered to him now was the feeling of her coarse cotton blouse against his wrist then he was asking her about her own life in new york and she was speaking happily about her uncle hes wonderful peter hes really wonderful hes quite poor but he took me in and he was so gracious about it he gave up his study to make a room for me and now he has to work here in the living room you must meet him peter hes away now on a lecture tour but you must meet him when he comes back sure id love to you know i wanted to go to work and be on my own but he wouldnt let me my dear child he said not at seventeen you dont want me to be ashamed of myself do you i dont believe in child labor that was kind of a funny idea dont you think he has so many funny ideas i dont understand them all but they say hes a brilliant man so he made it look as if i were doing him a favor by letting him keep me and i think that was really very decent of him what do you do with yourself all day long nothing much of anything now i read books on architecture uncle has tons of books on architecture but when hes here i type his lectures for him i really dont think he likes me to do it he prefers the typist he had but i love it and he lets me and he pays me her salary i didnt want to take it but he made me what does he do for a living oh so many things i dont know i cant keep track of them he teaches art history for one hes a kind of professor and when are you going to college by the way oh well well you see i dont think uncle approves of the idea i told him how id always planned to go and that id work my own way through but he seems to think its not for me he doesnt say much only god made the elephant for toil and the mosquito for flitting about and its not advisable as a rule to experiment with the laws of nature however if you want to try it my dear child but hes not objecting really its up to me only well dont let him stop you oh he wouldnt want to stop me only i was thinking i was never any great shakes in high school and darling im really quite utterly lousy at mathematics and so i wonder but then theres no hurry ive got plenty of time to decide listen katie i dont like that youve always planned on college if that uncle of yours you shouldnt say it like this you dont know him hes the most amazing man ive never met anyone quite like him hes so kind so understanding and hes such fun always joking hes so clever at it nothing that you thought was serious ever seems to be when hes around and yet hes a very serious man you know he spends hours talking to me hes never too tired and hes not bored with my stupidity he tells me all about strikes and conditions in the slums and the poor people in the sweatshops always about others never about himself a friend of his told me that uncle could be a very rich man if he tried hes so clever but he wont he just isnt interested in money thats not human wait till you see him oh he wants to meet you too ive told him about you he calls you the tsquare romeo oh he does does he but you dont understand he means it kindly its the way he says things youll have a lot in common maybe he could help you he knows something about architecture too youll love uncle ellsworth who said keating my uncle say keating asked his voice a little husky whats your uncles name ellsworth toohey why his hands fell limply he sat staring at her whats the matter peter he swallowed she saw the jerking motion of his throat then he said his voice hard listen katie i dont want to meet your uncle but why i dont want to meet him not through you you see katie you dont know me im the kind that uses people i dont want to use you ever dont let me not you use me how whats the matter why its just this id give my eyeteeth to meet ellsworth toohey thats all he laughed harshly so he knows something about architecture does he you little fool hes the most important man in architecture not yet maybe but thats what hell be in a couple of years ask francon that old weasel knows hes on his way to becoming the napoleon of all architectural critics your uncle ellsworth is just watch him in the first place there arent many to bother writing about our profession so hes the smart boy whos going to comer the market you should see the big shots in our office lapping up every comma he puts out in print so you think maybe he could help me well he could make me and he will and im going to meet him some day when im ready for him as i met francon but not here not through you understand not from you but peter why not because i dont want it that way because its filthy and i hate it all of it ray work and my profession and what im doing and what im going to do its something i want to keep you out of youre all i really have just keep out of it katie out of what i dont know she rose and stood in the circle of his arms his face hidden against her hip she stroked his hair looking down at him all right peter i think i know you dont have to meet him until you want to just tell me when you want it you can use me if you have to its all right it wont change anything when he raised his head she was laughing softly youve worked too hard peter youre a little unstrung suppose i make you some tea oh id forgotten all about it but ive had no dinner today had no time well of all things well how perfectly disgusting come on to the kitchen this minute ill see what i can fix up for you he left her two hours later and he walked away feeling light clean happy his fears forgotten toohey and francon forgotten he thought only that he had promised to come again tomorrow and that it was an unbearably long time to wait she stood at the door after he had gone her hand on the knob he had touched and she thought that he might come tomorrow or three months later when you finish tonight said henry cameron i want to see you in my office yes said roark cameron veered sharply on his heels and walked out of the drafting room it had been the longest sentence he had addressed to roark in a month roark had come to this room every morning had done his task and had heard no word of comment cameron would enter the drafting room and stand behind roark for a long time looking over his shoulder it was as if his eyes concentrated deliberately on trying to throw the steady hand off its course on the paper the two other draftsmen botched their work from the mere thought of such an apparition standing behind them roark did not seem to notice it he went on his hand unhurried he took his time about discarding a blunted pencil and picking out another uhhuh cameron would grunt suddenly roark would turn his head then politely attentive what is it he would ask cameron would turn away without a word his narrowed eyes underscoring contemptuously the fact that he considered an answer unnecessary and would leave the drafting room roark would go on with his drawing looks bad loomis the young draftsman confided to simpson his ancient colleague the old man doesnt like this guy cant say that i blame him either heres one that wont last long simpson was old and helpless he had survived from camerons threefloor office had stuck and had never understood it loomis was young with the face of a drugstorecorner lout he was here because he had been fired from too many other places both men disliked roark he was usually disliked from the first sight of his face anywhere he went his face was closed like the door of a safety vault things locked in safety vaults are valuable men did not care to feel that he was a cold disquieting presence in the room his presence had a strange quality it made itself felt and yet it made them feel that he was not there or perhaps that he was and they werent after work he walked the long distance to his home a tenement near the east river he had chosen that tenement because he had been able to get for twofifty a week its entire top floor a huge room that had been used for storage it had no ceiling and the roof leaked between its naked beams but it had a long row of windows along two of its walls some panes filled with glass others with cardboard and the windows opened high over the river on one side and the city on the other a week ago cameron had come into the drafting room and had thrown down on roarks table a violent sketch of a country residence see if you can make a house out of this he had snapped and gone without further explanation he had not approached roarks table during the days that followed roark had finished the drawings last night and left them on camerons desk this morning cameron had come in thrown some sketches of steel joints to roark ordered him to appear in his office later and had not entered the drafting room again for the rest of the day the others were gone roark pulled an old piece of oilcloth over his table and went to camerons office his drawings of the country house were spread on the desk the light of the lamp fell on camerons cheek on his beard the white threads glistening on his fist on a corner of the drawing its black lines bright and hard as if embossed on the paper youre fired said cameron roark stood halfway across the long room his weight on one leg his arms hanging by his sides one shoulder raised am i he asked quietly without moving come here said cameron sit down roark obeyed youre too good said cameron youre too good for what you want to do with yourself its no use roark better now than later what do you mean its no use wasting what youve got on an ideal that youll never reach that theyll never let you reach its no use taking that marvelous thing you have and making a torture rack for yourself out of it sell it roark sell it now it wont be the same but youve got enough in you youve got what theyll pay you for and pay plenty if you use it their way accept them roark compromise compromise now because youll have to later anyway only then youll have gone through things youll wish you hadnt you dont know i do save yourself from that leave me go to someone else did you do that you presumptuous bastard how good do you think i said you were did i tell you to compare yourself to he stopped because he saw that roark was smiling he looked at roark and suddenly smiled in answer and it was the most painful thing that roark had ever seen no said cameron softly that wont work huh no it wont well youre right youre as good as you think you are but i want to speak to you i dont know exactly how to go about it ive lost the habit of speaking to men like you lost it maybe ive never had it maybe thats what frightens me now will you try to understand i understand i think youre wasting your time dont be rude because i cant be rude to you now i want you to listen will you listen and not answer me yes im sorry i didnt intend it as rudeness you see of all men im the last one to whom you should have come ill be committing a crime if i keep you here somebody should have warned you against me i wont help you at all i wont discourage you i wont teach you any common sense instead ill push you on ill drive you the way youre going now ill beat you into remaining what you are and ill make you worse dont you see in another month i wont be able to let you go im not sure i can now so dont argue with me and go get out while you can but can i dont you think its too late for both of us it was too late for me twelve years ago try it roark try to be reasonable for once theres plenty of big fellows wholl take you expulsion or no expulsion if i say so they may laugh at me in their luncheon speeches but they steal from me when it suits them and they know that i know a good draftsman when i see one ill give you a letter to guy francon he worked for me once long ago i think i fired him but that wouldnt matter go to him you wont like it at first but youll get used to it and youll thank me for it many years from now why are you saying all this to me thats not what you want to say thats not what you did thats why im saying it because thats not what i did look roark theres one thing about you the thing im afraid of its not just the kind of work you do i wouldnt care if you were an exhibitionist whos being different as a stunt as a lark just to attract attention to himself its a smart racket to oppose the crowd and amuse it and collect admission to the side show if you did that i wouldnt worry but its not that you love your work god help you you love it and thats the curse thats the brand on your forehead for all of them to see you love it and they know it and they know they have you do you ever look at the people in the street arent you afraid of them i am they move past you and they wear hats and they carry bundles but thats not the substance of them the substance of them is hatred for any man who loves his work thats the only kind they fear i dont know why youre opening yourself up roark for each and every one of them but i never notice the people in the streets do you notice what theyve done to me i notice only that you werent afraid of them why do you ask me to be thats just why im asking it he leaned forward his fists closing on the desk before him roark do you want me to say it youre cruel arent you all right ill say it do you want to end up like this do you want to be what i am roark got up and stood against the edge of light on the desk if said roark at the end of my life ill be what you are today here in this office i shall consider it an honor that i could not have deserved sit down roared cameron i dont like demonstrations roark looked down at himself at the desk astonished to find himself standing he said im sorry i didnt know i got up well sit down listen i understand and its very nice of you but you dont know i thought a few days here would be enough to take the hero worship out of you i see it wasnt here you are saying to yourself how grand old cameron is a noble fighter a martyr to a lost cause and youd just love to die on the barricades with me and to eat in dime lunchwagons with me for the rest of your life i know it looks pure and beautiful to you now at your great old age of twentytwo but do you know what it means thirty years of a lost cause that sounds beautiful doesnt it but do you know how many days there are in thirty years do you know what happens in those days roark do you know what happens you dont want to speak of that no i dont want to speak of that but im going to i want you to hear i want you to know whats in store for you there will be days when youll look at your hands and youll want to take something and smash every bone in them because theyll be taunting you with what they could do if you found a chance for them to do it and you cant find that chance and you cant bear your living body because it has failed those hands somewhere there will be days when a bus driver will snap at you as you enter a bus and hell be only asking for a dime but that wont be what youll hear youll hear that youre nothing that hes laughing at you that its written on your forehead that thing they hate you for there will be days when youll stand in the corner of a hall and listen to a creature on a platform talking about buildings about that work which you love and the things hell say will make you wait for somebody to rise and crack him open between two thumbnails and then youll hear the people applauding him and youll want to scream because you wont know whether theyre real or you are whether youre in a room full of gored skulls or whether someone has just emptied your own head and youll say nothing because the sounds you could make theyre not a language in that room any longer but if youd want to speak you wont anyway because youll be brushed aside you who have nothing to tell them about buildings is that what you want roark sat still the shadows sharp on his face a black wedge on a sunken cheek a long triangle of black cutting across his chin his eyes on cameron not enough asked cameron all right then one day youll see on a piece of paper before you a building that will make you want to kneel you wont believe that youve done it but you will have done it then youll think that the earth is beautiful and the air smells of spring and you love your fellow men because there is no evil in the world and youll set out from your house with this drawing to have it erected because you wont have any doubt that it will be erected by the first man to see it but you wont get very far from your house because youll be stopped at the door by the man whos come to turn off the gas you hadnt had much food because you saved money to finish your drawing but still you had to cook something and you hadnt paid for it all right thats nothing you can laugh at that but finally youll get into a mans office with your drawing and youll curse yourself for taking so much space of his air with your body and youll try to squeeze yourself out of his sight so that he wont see you but only hear your voice begging him pleading your voice licking his knees youll loathe yourself for it but you wont care if only hed let you put up that building you wont care youll want to rip your insides open to show him because if he saw whats there hed have to let you put it up but hell say that hes very sorry only the commission has just been given to guy francon and youll go home and do you know what youll do there youll cry youll cry like a woman like a drunkard like an animal thats your future howard roark now do you want it yes said roark camerons eyes dropped then his head moved down a little then a little farther his head went on dropping slowly in long single jerks then stopped he sat still his shoulders hunched his arms huddled together in his lap howard whispered cameron ive never told it to anyone thank you said roark after a long time cameron raised his head go home now said cameron his voice flat youve worked too much lately and you have a hard day ahead he pointed to the drawings of the country house this is all very well and i wanted to see what youd do but its not good enough to build youll have to do it over ill show you what i want tomorrow a year with the firm of francon heyer had given keating the whispered title of crown prince without portfolio still only a draftsman he was francons reigning favorite francon took him out to lunch an unprecedented honor for an employee francon called him to be present at interviews with clients the clients seemed to like seeing so decorative a young man in an architects office lucius n heyer had the annoying habit of asking francon suddenly when did you get the new man and pointing to an employee who had been there for three years but heyer surprised everybody by remembering keatings name and by greeting him whenever they met with a smile of positive recognition keating had had a long conversation with him one dreary november afternoon on the subject of old porcelain it was heyers hobby he owned a famous collection passionately gathered keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the subject though he had never heard of old porcelain till the night before which he had spent at the public library heyer was delighted nobody in the office cared about his hobby few ever noticed his presence heyer remarked to his partner youre certainly good at picking your men guy theres one boy i wish we wouldnt lose whats his name keating yes indeed francon answered smiling yes indeed in the drafting room keating concentrated on tim davis work and drawings were only unavoidable details on the surface of his days tim davis was the substance and the shape of the first step in his career davis let him do most of his own work only night work at first then parts of his daily assignments as well secretly at first then openly davis had not wanted it to be known keating made it known with an air of naive confidence which implied that he was only a tool no more than tims pencil or tsquare that his help enhanced tims importance rather than diminished it and therefore he did not wish to conceal it at first davis relayed instructions to keating then the chief draftsman took the arrangement for granted and began coming to keating with orders intended for davis keating was always there smiling saying ill do it dont bother tim with those little things ill take care of it davis relaxed and let himself be carried along he smoked a great deal he lolled about his legs twisted loosely over the rungs of a stool his eyes closed dreaming of elaine he uttered once in a while is the stuff ready pete davis had married elaine that spring he was frequently late for work he had whispered to keating youre in with the old man pete slip a good word for me once in a while will you so theyll overlook a few things god do i hate to have to be working right now keating would say to francon im sorry mr francon that the murray job subbasement plans were so late but tim davis had a quarrel with his wife last night and you know how newlyweds are you dont want to be too hard on them or its tim davis again mr francon do forgive him he cant help it he hasnt got his mind on his work at all when francon glanced at the list of his employees salaries he noticed that his most expensive draftsman was the man least needed in the office when tim davis lost his job no one in the drafting room was surprised but tim davis he could not understand it he set his lips defiantly in bitterness against a world he would hate forever he felt he had no friend on earth save peter keating keating consoled him cursed francon cursed the injustice of humanity spent six dollars in a speakeasy entertaining the secretary of an obscure architect of his acquaintance and arranged a new job for tim davis whenever he thought of davis afterward keating felt a warm pleasure he had influenced the course of a human being had thrown him off one path and pushed him into another a human being it was not tim davis to him any longer it was a living frame and a mind a conscious mind why had he always feared that mysterious entity of consciousness within others and he had twisted that frame and that mind to his own will by a unanimous decision of francon heyer and the chief draftsman tims table position and salary were given to peter keating but this was only part of his satisfaction there was another sense of it warmer and less real and more dangerous he said brightly and often tim davis oh yes i got him his present job he wrote to his mother about it she said to her friends petey is such an unselfish boy he wrote to her dutifully each week his letters were short and respectful hers long detailed and full of advice which he seldom finished reading he saw catherine halsey occasionally he had not gone to her on that following evening as he had promised he had awakened in the morning and remembered the things he had said to her and hated her for his having said them but he had gone to her again a week later she had not reproached him and they had not mentioned her uncle he saw her after that every month or two he was happy when he saw her but he never spoke to her of his career he tried to speak of it to howard roark the attempt failed he called on roark twice he climbed indignantly the five flights of stairs to roarks room he greeted roark eagerly he waited for reassurance not knowing what sort of reassurance he needed nor why it could come only from roark he spoke of his job and he questioned roark with sincere concern about camerons office roark listened to him answered all his questions willingly but keating felt that he was knocking against a sheet of iron in roarks unmoving eyes and that they were not speaking about the same things at all before the visit was over keating was taking notice of roarks frayed cuffs of his shoes of the patch on the knee of his trousers and he felt satisfied he went away chuckling but he went away miserably uneasy and wondered why and swore never to see roark again and wondered why he knew that he would have to see him well said keating i couldnt quite work it to ask her to lunch but shes coming to mawsons exhibition with me day after tomorrow now what he sat on the floor his head resting against the edge of a couch his bare feet stretched out a pair of guy francons chartreuse pyjamas floating loosely about his limbs through the open door of the bathroom he saw francon standing at the washstand his stomach pressed to its shining edge brushing his teeth thats splendid said francon munching through a thick foam of toothpaste thatll do just as well dont you see no lord pete i explained it to you yesterday before we started mrs dunlops husbands planning to build a home for her oh yeah said keating weakly brushing the matted black curls off his face oh yeah i remember now jesus guy i got a head on me he remembered vaguely the party to which francon had taken him the night before he remembered the caviar in a hollow iceberg the black net evening gown and the pretty face of mrs dunlop but he could not remember how he had come to end up in francons apartment he shrugged he had attended many parties with francon in the past year and had often been brought here like this its not a very large house francon was saying holding the toothbrush in his mouth it made a lump on his cheek and its green handle stuck out fifty thousand or so i understand theyre small fry anyway but mrs dunlops brotherinlaw is quimby you know the big real estate fellow wont hurt to get a little wedge into that family wont hurt at all youre to see where that commission ends up pete can i count on you pete sure said keating his head drooping you can always count on me guy he sat still watching his bare toes and thinking of stengel francons designer he did not want to think but his mind leaped to stengel automatically as it always did because stengel represented his next step stengel was impregnable to friendship for two years keatings attempts had broken against the ice of stengels glasses what stengel thought of him was whispered in the drafting rooms but few dared to repeat it save in quotes stengel said it aloud even though he knew that the corrections his sketches bore when they returned to him from francons office were made by keatings hand but stengel had a vulnerable point he had been planning for some time to leave francon and open an office of his own he had selected a partner a young architect of no talent but of great inherited wealth stengel was waiting only for a chance keating had thought about this a great deal he could think of nothing else he thought of it again sitting there on the floor of francons bedroom two days later when he escorted mrs dunlop through the gallery exhibiting the paintings of one frederic mawson his course of action was set he piloted her through the sparse crowd his fingers closing over her elbow once in a while letting her catch his eyes directed at her young face more often than at the paintings yes he said as she stared obediently at a landscape featuring an auto dump and tried to compose her face into the look of admiration expected of her magnificent work note the colors mrs dunlop they say this fellow mawson had a terribly hard time its an old story trying to get recognition old and heartbreaking its the same in all the arts my own profession included oh indeed said mrs dunlop who quite seemed to prefer architecture at the moment now this said keating stopping before the depiction of an old hag picking at her bare toes on a street curb this is art as a social document it takes a person of courage to appreciate this its simply wonderful said mrs dunlop ah yes courage its a rare quality they say mawson was starving in a garret when mrs stuyvesant discovered him its glorious to be able to help young talent on its way it must be wonderful agreed mrs dunlop if i were rich said keating wistfully id make it my hobby to arrange an exhibition for a new artist to finance the concert of a new pianist to have a house built by a new architect do you know mr keating my husband and i are planning to build a little home on long island oh are you how very charming of you mrs dunlop to confess such a thing to me youre so young if youll forgive my saying this dont you know that you run the danger of my becoming a nuisance and trying to interest you in my firm or are you safe and have chosen an architect already no im not safe at all said mrs dunlop prettily and i wouldnt mind the danger really ive thought a great deal about the firm of francon heyer in these last few days and ive heard they are so terribly good why thank you mrs dunlop mr francon is a great architect oh yes whats the matter nothing nothing really no whats the matter do you really want me to tell you why certainly well you see guy francon its only a name he would have nothing to do with your house its one of those professional secrets that i shouldnt divulge but i dont know what it is about you that makes me want to be honest all the best buildings in our office are designed by mr stengel who claude stengel youve never heard the name but you will when someone has the courage to discover him you see he does all the work hes the real genius behind the scenes but francon puts his signature on it and gets all the credit thats the way its done everywhere but why does mr stengel stand for it what can he do no one will give him a start you know how most people are they stick to the beaten path they pay three times the price for the same thing just to have the trademark courage mrs dunlop they lack courage stengel is a great artist but there are so few discerning people to see it hes ready to go on his own if only he could find some outstanding person like mrs stuyvesant to give him a chance really said mrs dunlop how very interesting tell me more about it he told her a great deal more about it by the time they had finished the inspection of the works of frederic mawson mrs dunlop was shaking keatings hand and saying its so kind so very unusually kind of you are you sure that it wont embarrass you with your office if you arrange for me to meet mr stengel i didnt quite dare to suggest it and it was so kind of you not to be angry at me its so unselfish of you and more than anyone else would have done in your position when keating approached stengel with the suggestion of a proposed luncheon the man listened to him without a word then he jerked his head and snapped whats in it for you before keating could answer stengel threw his head back suddenly oh said stengel oh i see then he leaned forward his mouth drawn thin in contempt okay ill go to that lunch when stengel left the firm of francon heyer to open his own office and proceed with the construction of the dunlop house his first commission guy francon smashed a ruler against the edge of his desk and roared to keating the bastard the abysmal bastard after all ive done for him what did you expect said keating sprawled in a low armchair before him such is life but what beats me is how did that little skunk ever hear of it to snatch it right from under our nose well ive never trusted him anyway keating shrugged human nature the bitterness in his voice was sincere he had received no gratitude from stengel stengels parting remark to him had been only youre a worse bastard than i thought you were good luck youll be a great architect some day thus keating achieved the position of chief designer for francon heyer francon celebrated the occasion with a modest little orgy at one of the quieter and costlier restaurants in a coupla years he kept repeating in a coupla years youll see things happenin pete youre a good boy and i like you and ill do things for you havent i done things for you youre going places pete in a coupla years your ties crooked guy said keating dryly and youre spilling brandy all over your vest facing his first task of designing keating thought of tim davis of stengel of many others who had wanted it had struggled for it had tried had been beaten by him it was a triumphant feeling it was a tangible affirmation of his greatness then he found himself suddenly in his glassenclosed office looking down at a blank sheet of paper alone something rolled in his throat down to his stomach cold and empty his old feeling of the dropping hole he leaned against the table closing his eyes it had never been quite real to him before that this was the thing actually expected of him to fill a sheet of paper to create something on a sheet of paper it was only a small residence but instead of seeing it rise before him he saw it sinking he saw its shape as a pit in the ground and as a pit within him as emptiness with only davis and stengel rattling uselessly within it francon had said to him about the building it must have dignity you know dignity nothing freaky a structure of elegance and stay within the budget which was francons conception of giving his designer ideas and letting him work them out through a cold stupor keating thought of the clients laughing in his face he heard the thin omnipotent voice of ellsworth toohey calling his attention to the opportunities open to him in the field of plumbing he hated every piece of stone on the face of the earth he hated himself for having chosen to be an architect when he began to draw he tried not to think of the job he was doing he thought only that francon had done it and stengel even heyer and all the others and that he could do it if they could he spent many days on his preliminary sketches he spent long hours in the library of francon heyer selecting from classic photographs the appearance of his house he felt the tension melting in his mind it was right and it was good that house growing under his hand because men were still worshipping the masters who had done it before him he did not have to wonder to fear or to take chances it had been done for him when the drawings were ready he stood looking at them uncertainly were he to be told that this was the best or the ugliest house in the world he would agree with either he was not sure he had to be sure he thought of stanton and of what he had relied upon when working on his assignments there he telephoned camerons office and asked for howard roark he came to roarks room that night and spread before him the plans the elevations the perspective of his first building roark stood over it his arms spread wide his hands holding the edge of the table and he said nothing for a long time keating waited anxiously he felt anger growing with his anxiety because he could see no reason for being so anxious when he couldnt stand it he spoke you know howard everybody says stengels the best designer in town and i dont think he was really ready to quit but i made him and i took his place i had to do some pretty fine thinking to work that i he stopped it did not sound bright and proud as it would have sounded anywhere else it sounded like begging roark turned and looked at him roarks eyes were not contemptuous only a little wider than usual attentive and puzzled he said nothing and turned back to the drawings keating felt naked davis stengel francon meant nothing here people were his protection against people roark had no sense of people others gave keating a feeling of his own value roark gave him nothing he thought that he should seize his drawings and run the danger was not roark the danger was that he keating remained roark turned to him do you enjoy doing this sort of thing peter he asked oh i know said keating his voice shrill i know you dont approve of it but this is business i just want to know what you think of this practically not philosophically not no im not going to preach to you i was only wondering if you could help me howard if you could just help me with it a little its my first house and it means so much to me at the office and im not sure what do you think will you help me howard all right roark threw aside the sketch of the graceful facade with the fluted pilasters the broken pediments the roman fasces over the windows and the two eagles of empire by the entrance he picked up the plans he took a sheet of tracing paper threw it over the plan and began to draw keating stood watching the pencil in roarks hand he saw his imposing entrance foyer disappearing his twisted corridors his lightless corners he saw an immense living room growing in the space he had thought too limited a wall of giant windows facing the garden a spacious kitchen he watched for a long time and the facade he asked when roark threw the pencil down i cant help you with that if you must have it classic have it good classic at least you dont need three pilasters where one will do and take those ducks off the door its too much keating smiled at him gratefully when he was leaving his drawings under his arm he descended the stairs hurt and angry he worked for three days making new plans from roarks sketches and a new simpler elevation and he presented his house to francon with a proud gesture that looked like a flourish well said francon studying it well i declare what an imagination you have peter i wonder its a bit daring but i wonder he coughed and added its just what i had in mind of course said keating i studied your buildings and i tried to think of what youd do and if its good its because i think i know how to catch your ideas francon smiled and keating thought suddenly that francon did not really believe it and knew that keating did not believe it and yet they were both contented bound tighter together by a common method and a common guilt the letter on camerons desk informed him regretfully that after earnest consideration the board of directors of the security trust company had not been able to accept his plans for the building to house the new astoria branch of the company and that the commission had been awarded to the firm of gould pettingill a check was attached to the letter in payment for his preliminary drawings as agreed the amount was not enough to cover the expense of making those drawings the letter lay spread out on the desk cameron sat before it drawn back not touching the desk his hands gathered in his lap the back of one in the palm of the other the fingers tight it was only a small piece of paper but he sat huddled and still because it seemed to be a supernatural thing like radium sending forth rays that would hurt him if he moved and exposed his skin to them for three months he had awaited the commission of the security trust company one after another the chances that had loomed before him at rare intervals in the last two years had vanished looming in vague promises vanishing in firm refusals one of his draftsmen had had to be discharged long ago the landlord had asked questions politely at first then dryly then rudely and openly but no one in the office had minded that nor the usual arrears in salaries there had been the commission of the security trust company the vicepresident who had asked cameron to submit drawings had said i know some of the directors wont see it as i do but go ahead mr cameron take the chance with me and ill fight for you cameron had taken the chance he and roark had worked savagely to have the plans ready on time before time before gould pettingill could submit theirs pettingill was a cousin of the bank presidents wife and a famous authority on the ruins of pompeii the bank president was an ardent admirer of julius caesar and had once while in rome spent an hour and a quarter in reverent inspection of the coliseum cameron and roark and a pot of black coffee had lived in the office from dawn till frozen dawn for many days and cameron had thought involuntarily of the electric bill but made himself forget it the lights still burned in the drafting room in the early hours when he sent roark out for sandwiches and roark found gray morning in the streets while it was still night in the office in the windows facing a high brick wall on the last day it was roark who had ordered cameron home after midnight because camerons hands were jerking and his knees kept seeking the tall drafting stool for support leaning against it with a slow cautious sickening precision roark had taken him down to a taxi and in the light of a street lamp cameron had seen roarks face drawn the eyes kept wide artificially the lips dry the next morning cameron had entered the drafting room and found the coffee pot on the floor on its side over a black puddle and roarks hand in the puddle palm up fingers half closed roarks body stretched out on the floor his head thrown back fast asleep on the table cameron had found the plans finished he sat looking at the letter on his desk the degradation was that he could not think of those nights behind him he could not think of the building that should have risen in astoria and of the building that would now take its place it was that he thought only of the bill unpaid to the electric company in these last two years cameron had disappeared from his office for weeks at a time and roark had not found him at home and had known what was happening but could only wait hoping for camerons safe return then cameron had lost even the shame of his agony and had come to his office reeling recognizing no one openly drunk and flaunting it before the walls of the only place on earth he had respected roark learned to face his own landlord with the quiet statement that he could not pay him for another week the landlord was afraid of him and did not insist peter keating heard of it somehow as he always heard everything he wanted to know he came to roarks unheated room one evening and sat down keeping his overcoat on he produced a wallet pulled out five tendollar bills and handed them to roark you need it howard i know you need it dont start protesting now you can pay me back any time roark looked at him astonished took the money saying yes i need it thank you peter then keating said what in hell are you doing wasting yourself on old cameron what do you want to live like this for chuck it howard and come with us all i have to do is say so franconll be delighted well start you at sixty a week roark took the money out of his pocket and handed it back to him oh for gods sake howard i i didnt mean to offend you i didnt either but please howard keep it anyway good night peter roark was thinking of that when cameron entered the drafting room the letter from the security trust company in his hand he gave the letter to roark said nothing turned and walked back to his office roark read the letter and followed him whenever they lost another commission roark knew that cameron wanted to see him in the office but not to speak of it just to see him there to talk of other things to lean upon the reassurance of his presence on camerons desk roark saw a copy of the new york banner it was the leading newspaper of the great wynand chain it was a paper he would have expected to find in a kitchen in a barbershop in a thirdrate drawing room in the subway anywhere but in camerons office cameron saw him looking at it and grinned picked it up this morning on my way here funny isnt it i didnt know wed get that letter today and yet it seems appropriate together this paper and that letter dont know what made me buy it a sense of symbolism i suppose look at it howard its interesting roark glanced through the paper the front page carried the picture of an unwed mother with thick glistening lips who had shot her lover the picture headed the first installment of her autobiography and a detailed account of her trial the other pages ran a crusade against utility companies a daily horoscope extracts from church sermons recipes for young brides pictures of girls with beautiful legs advice on how to hold a husband a baby contest a poem proclaiming that to wash dishes was nobler than to write a symphony an article proving that a woman who had borne a child was automatically a saint thats our answer howard thats the answer given to you and to me this paper that it exists and that its liked can you fight that have you any words to be heard and understood by that they shouldnt have sent us the letter they should have sent a copy of wynands banner it would be simpler and clearer do you know that in a few years that incredible bastard gail wynand will rule the world it will be a beautiful world and perhaps hes right cameron held the paper outstretched weighing it on the palm of his hand to give them what they want howard and to let them worship you for it for licking their feet or or what whats the use only it doesnt matter nothing matters not even that it doesnt matter to me any more then he looked at roark he added if only i could hold on until ive started you on your own howard dont speak of that i want to speak of that its funny howard next spring it will be three years that youve been here seems so much longer doesnt it well have i taught you anything ill tell you ive taught you a great deal and nothing no one can teach you anything not at the core at the source of it what youre doing its yours not mine i can only teach you to do it better i can give you the means but the aim the aims your own you wont be a little disciple putting up anemic little things in early jacobean or late cameron what youll be if only i could live to see it youll live to see it and you know it now cameron stood looking at the bare walls of his office at the white piles of bills on his desk at the sooty rain trickling slowly down the windowpanes i have no answer to give them howard im leaving you to face them youll answer them all of them the wynand papers and what makes the wynand papers possible and what lies behind that its a strange mission to give you i dont know what our answer is to be i know only that there is an answer and that youre holding it that youre the answer howard and some day youll find the words for it sermons in stone by ellsworth m toohey was published in january of the year it had a fastidious jacket of midnight blue with plain silver letters and a silver pyramid in one corner it was subtitled architecture for everybody and its success was sensational it presented the entire history of architecture from mud hut to skyscraper in the terms of the man in the street but it made these terms appear scientific its author stated in his preface that it was an attempt to bring architecture where it belongs to the people he stated further that he wished to see the average man think and speak of architecture as he speaks of baseball he did not bore his readers with the technicalities of the five orders the post and lintel the flying buttress or reinforced concrete he filled his pages with homey accounts of the daily life of the egyptian housekeeper the roman shoecobbler the mistress of louis xiv what they ate how they washed where they shopped and what effect their buildings had upon their existence but he gave his readers the impression that they were learning all they had to know about the five orders and the reinforced concrete he gave his readers the impression that there were no problems no achievements no reaches of thought beyond the common daily routine of people nameless in the past as they were in the present that science had no goal and no expression beyond its influence on this routine that merely by living through their own obscure days his readers were representing and achieving all the highest objectives of any civilization his scientific precision was impeccable and his erudition astounding no one could refute him on the cooking utensils of babylon or the doormats of byzantium he wrote with the flash and the color of a firsthand observer he did not plod laboriously through the centuries he danced said the critics down the road of the ages as a jester a friend and a prophet he said that architecture was truly the greatest of the arts because it was anonymous as all greatness he said that the world had many famous buildings but few renowned builders which was as it should be since no one man had ever created anything of importance in architecture or elsewhere for that matter the few whose names had lived were really impostors expropriating the glory of the people as others expropriated its wealth when we gaze at the magnificence of an ancient monument and ascribe its achievement to one man we are guilty of spiritual embezzlement we forget the army of craftsmen unknown and unsung who preceded him in the darkness of the ages who toiled humbly all heroism is humble each contributing his small share to the common treasure of his time a great building is not the private invention of some genius or other it is merely a condensation of the spirit of a people he explained that the decadence of architecture had come when private property replaced the communal spirit of the middle ages and that the selfishness of individual owners who built for no purpose save to satisfy their own bad taste all claim to an individual taste is bad taste had ruined the planned effect of cities he demonstrated that there was no such thing as free will since mens creative impulses were determined as all else by the economic structure of the epoch in which they lived he expressed admiration for all the great historical styles but admonished against their wanton mixture he dismissed modern architecture stating that so far it has represented nothing but the whim of isolated individuals has borne no relation to any great spontaneous mass movement and as such is of no consequence he predicted a better world to come where all men would be brothers and their buildings would become harmonious and all alike in the great tradition of greece the mother of democracy when he wrote this he managed to convey with no tangible break in the detached calm of his style that the words now seen in ordered print had been blurred in manuscript by a hand unsteady with emotion he called upon architects to abandon their selfish quest for individual glory and dedicate themselves to the embodiment of the mood of their people architects are servants not leaders they are not to assert their little egos but to express the soul of their country and the rhythm of their time they are not to follow the delusions of their personal fancy but to seek the common denominator which will bring their work close to the heart of the masses architects ah my friends theirs is not to reason why theirs is not to command but to be commanded the advertisements for sermons in stone carried quotations from critics magnificent a stupendous achievement unequaled in all art history your chance to get acquainted with a charming man and a profound thinker mandatory reading for anyone aspiring to the title of intellectual there seemed to be a great many aspiring to that title readers acquired erudition without study authority without cost judgment without effort it was pleasant to look at buildings and criticize them with a professional manner and with the memory of page to hold artistic discussions and exchange the same sentences from the same paragraphs in distinguished drawing rooms one could soon hear it said architecture oh yes ellsworth toohey according to his principles ellsworth m toohey listed no architect by name in the text of his book the mythbuilding heroworshipping method of historical research has always been obnoxious to me the names appeared only in footnotes several of these referred to guy francon who has a tendency to the overornate but must be commended for his loyalty to the strict tradition of classicism one note referred to henry cameron prominent once as one of the fathers of the socalled modern school of architecture and relegated since to a welldeserved oblivion vox populi vox dei in february of henry cameron retired from practice for a year he had known that the day would come he had not spoken of it to roark but they both knew and went on expecting nothing save to go on as long as it was still possible a few commissions had dribbled into their office in the past year country cottages garages remodeling of old buildings they took anything but the drops stopped the pipes were dry the water had been turned off by a society to whom cameron had never paid his bill simpson and the old man in the reception room had been dismissed long ago only roark remained to sit still through the winter evenings and look at camerons body slumped over his desk arms flung out head on arms a bottle glistening under the lamp then one day in february when cameron had touched no alcohol for weeks he reached for a book on a shelf and collapsed at roarks feet suddenly simply finally roark took him home and the doctor stated that an attempt to leave his bed would be all the death sentence cameron needed cameron knew it he lay still on his pillow his hands dropped obediently one at each side of his body his eyes unblinking and empty then he said youll close the office for me howard will you yes said roark cameron closed his eyes and would say nothing else and roark sat all night by his bed not knowing whether the old man slept or not a sister of camerons appeared from somewhere in new jersey she was a meek little old lady with white hair trembling hands and a face one could never remember quiet resigned and gently hopeless she had a meager little income and she assumed the responsibility of taking her brother to her home in new jersey she had never been married and had no one else in the world she was neither glad nor sorry of the burden she had lost all capacity for emotion many years ago on the day of his departure cameron handed to roark a letter he had written in the night written painfully an old drawing board on his knees a pillow propping his back the letter was addressed to a prominent architect it was roarks introduction to a job roark read it and looking at cameron not at his own hands tore the letter across folded the pieces and tore it again no said roark youre not going to ask them for anything dont worry about me cameron nodded and kept silent for a long time then he said youll close up the office howard youll let them keep the furniture for their rent but youll take the drawing thats on the wall in my room there and youll ship it to me only that youll burn everything else all the papers the files the drawings the contracts everything yes said roark miss cameron came with the orderlies and the stretcher and they rode in an ambulance to the ferry at the entrance to the ferry cameron said to roark youre going back now he added youll come to see me howard not too often roark turned and walked away while they were carrying cameron to the pier it was a gray morning and there was the cold rotting smell of the sea in the air a gull dipped low over the street gray like a floating piece of newspaper against a corner of damp streaked stone that evening roark went to camerons closed office he did not turn on the lights he made a fire in the franklin heater in camerons room and emptied drawer after drawer into the fire not looking down at them the papers rustled dryly in the silence a thin odor of mold rose through the dark room and the fire hissed crackling leaping in bright streaks at times a white flake with charred edges would flutter out of the flames he pushed it back with the end of a steel ruler there were drawings of camerons famous buildings and of buildings unbuilt there were blueprints with the thin white lines that were girders still standing somewhere there were contracts with famous signatures and at times from out of the red glow there flashed a sum of seven figures written on yellowed paper flashed and went down in a thin burst of sparks from among the letters in an old folder a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor roark picked it up it was dry brittle and yellow and it broke at the folds in his fingers it was an interview given by henry cameron dated may it said architecture is not a business not a career but a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the earth he dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for another folder he gathered every stub of pencil from camerons desk and threw them in also he stood over the heater he did not move he did not look down he felt the movement of the glow a faint shudder at the edge of his vision he looked at the drawing of the skyscraper that had never been built hanging on the wall before him it was peter keatings third year with the firm of francon heyer he carried his head high his body erect with studied uprightness he looked like the picture of a successful young man in advertisements for highpriced razors or mediumpriced cars he dressed well and watched people noticing it he had an apartment off park avenue modest but fashionable and he bought three valuable etchings as well as a first edition of a classic he had never read nor opened since occasionally he escorted clients to the metropolitan opera he appeared once at a fancydress arts ball and created a sensation by his costume of a medieval stonecutter scarlet velvet and tights he was mentioned in a societypage account of the event the first mention of his name in print and he saved the clipping he had forgotten his first building and the fear and doubt of its birth he had learned that it was so simple his clients would accept anything so long as he gave them an imposing facade a majestic entrance and a regal drawing room with which to astound their guests it worked out to everyones satisfaction keating did not care so long as his clients were impressed the clients did not care so long as their guests were impressed and the guests did not care anyway mrs keating rented her house in stanton and came to live with him in new york he did not want her he could not refuse because she was his mother and he was not expected to refuse he met her with some eagerness he could at least impress her by his rise in the world she was not impressed she inspected his rooms his clothes his bank books and said only itll do petey for the time being she made one visit to his office and departed within a halfhour that evening he had to sit still squeezing and cracking his knuckles for an hour and a half while she gave him advice that fellow whithers had a much more expensive suit than yours petey that wont do youve got to watch your prestige before those boys the little one who brought in those blueprints i didnt like the way he spoke to you oh nothing nothing only id keep my eye on him the one with the long nose is no friend of yours never mind i just know watch out for the one they called bennett id get rid of him if i were you hes ambitious i know the signs then she asked guy francon has he any children one daughter oh said mrs keating what is she like ive never met her really peter she said its downright rude to mr francon if youve made no effort to meet his family shes been away at college mother ill meet her some day its getting late mother and ive got a lot of work to do tomorrow but he thought of it that night and the following day he had thought of it before and often he knew that francons daughter had graduated from college long ago and was now working on the banner where she wrote a small column on home decoration he had been able to learn nothing else about her no one in the office seemed to know her francon never spoke of her on that following day at luncheon keating decided to face the subject i hear such nice things about your daughter he said to francon where did you hear nice things about her francon asked ominously oh well you know how it is one hears things and she writes brilliantly yes she writes brilliantly francons mouth snapped shut really guy id love to meet her francon looked at him and sighed wearily you know shes not living with me said francon she has an apartment of her own im not sure that i even remember the address oh i suppose youll meet her some day you wont like her peter now why do you say that its one of those things peter as a father im afraid im a total failure say peter what did mrs mannering say about that new stairway arrangement keating felt angry disappointed and relieved he looked at francons squat figure and wondered what appearance his daughter must have inherited to earn her fathers so obvious disfavor rich and ugly as sin like most of them he decided he thought that this need not stop him some day he was glad only that the day was postponed he thought with new eagerness that he would go to see catherine tonight mrs keating had met catherine in stanton she had hoped that peter would forget now she knew that he had not forgotten even though he seldom spoke of catherine and never brought her to his home mrs keating did not mention catherine by name but she chatted about penniless girls who hooked brilliant young men about promising boys whose careers had been wrecked by marriage to the wrong woman and she read to him every newspaper account of a celebrity divorcing his plebeian wife who could not live up to his eminent position keating thought as he walked toward catherines house that night of the few times he had seen her they had been such unimportant occasions but they were the only days he remembered of his whole life in new york he found in the middle of her uncles living room when she let him in a mess of letters spread all over the carpet a portable typewriter newspapers scissors boxes and a pot of glue oh dear said catherine flopping limply down on her knees in the midst of the litter oh dear she looked up at him smiling disarmingly her hands raised and spread over the crinkling white piles she was almost twenty now and looked no older than she had looked at seventeen sit down peter i thought id be through before you came but i guess im not its uncles fan mail and his press clippings ive got to sort it out and answer it and file it and write notes of thanks and oh you should see some of the things people write to him its wonderful dont stand there sit down will you ill be through in a minute youre through right now he said picking her up in his arms carrying her to a chair he held her and kissed her and she laughed happily her head buried on his shoulder he said katie youre an impossible little fool and your hair smells so nice she said dont move peter im comfortable katie i want to tell you i had a wonderful time today they opened the bordman building officially this afternoon you know down on broadway twentytwo floors and a gothic spire francon had indigestion so i went there as his representative i designed that building anyway and oh well you know nothing about it but i do peter ive seen all your buildings i have pictures of them i cut them out of the papers and im making a scrapbook just like uncles oh peter its so wonderful what uncles scrapbooks and his letters all this she stretched her hands out over the papers on the floor as if she wanted to embrace them think of it all these letters coming from all over the country perfect strangers and yet he means so much to them and here i am helping him me just nobody and look what a responsibility i have its so touching and so big what do they matter all the little things that can happen to us when this concerns a whole nation yeah did he tell you that he told me nothing at all but you cant live with him for years without getting some of that that wonderful selflessness of his he wanted to be angry but he saw her twinkling smile her new kind of fire and he had to smile in answer ill say this katie its becoming to you becoming as hell you know you could look stunning if you learned something about clothes one of these days ill take you bodily and drag you down to a good dressmaker i want you to meet guy francon some day youll like him oh i thought you said once that i wouldnt did i say that well i didnt really know him hes a grand fellow i want you to meet them all youd be hey where are you going she had noticed the watch on his wrist and was edging away from him i its almost nine oclock peter and ive got to have this finished before uncle ellsworth gets home hell be back by eleven hes making a speech at a labor meeting tonight i can work while were talking do you mind i certainly do to hell with your dear uncles fans let him untangle it all himself you stay just where you are she sighed but put her head on his shoulder obediently you mustnt talk like that about uncle ellsworth you dont understand him at all have you read his book yes ive read his book and its grand its stupendous but ive heard nothing but talk of his damn book everywhere i go so do you mind if we change the subject you still dont want to meet uncle ellsworth why what makes you say that id love to meet him oh whats the matter you said once that you didnt want to meet him through me did i how do you always remember all the nonsense i happen to say peter i dont want you to meet uncle ellsworth why not i dont know its kind of silly of me but now i just dont want you to i dont know why well forget it then ill meet him when the time comes katie listen yesterday i was standing at the window in my room and i thought of you and i wanted so much to have you with me i almost called you only it was too late i get so terribly lonely for you like that i she listened her arms about his neck and then he saw her looking suddenly past him her mouth opened in consternation she jumped up dashed across the room and crawled on her hands and knees to reach a lavender envelope lying under a desk now what on earth he demanded angrily its a very important letter she said still kneeling the envelope held tightly in her little fist its a very important letter and there it was practically in the wastebasket i might have swept it out without noticing its from a poor widow who has five children and her eldest son wants to be an architect and uncle ellsworth is going to arrange a scholarship for him well said keating rising ive had just about enough of this lets get out of here katie lets go for a walk its beautiful out tonight you dont seem to belong to yourself in here oh fine lets go for a walk outside there was a mist of snow a dry fine weightless snow that hung still in the air filling the narrow tanks of streets they walked together catherines arm pressed to his their feet leaving long brown smears on the white sidewalks they sat down on a bench in washington square the snow enclosed the square cutting them off from the houses from the city beyond through the shadow of the arch little dots of light rolled past them steelwhite green and smeared red she sat huddled close to him he looked at the city he had always been afraid of it and he was afraid of it now but he had two fragile protections the snow and the girl beside him katie he whispered katie i love you peter katie he said without hesitation without emphasis because the certainty of his words allowed no excitement were engaged arent we he saw her chin move faintly as it dropped and rose to form one word yes she said calmly so solemnly that the word sounded indifferent she had never allowed herself to question the future for a question would have been an admission of doubt but she knew when she pronounced the yes that she had waited for this and that she would shatter it if she were too happy in a year or two he said holding her hand tightly well be married just as soon as im on my feet and set with the firm for good i have mother to take care of but in another year it will be all right he tried to speak as coldly as practically as he could not to spoil the wonder of what he felt ill wait peter she whispered we dont have to hurry we wont tell anyone katie its our secret just ours until and suddenly a thought came to him and he realized aghast that he could not prove it had never occurred to him before yet he knew in complete honesty even though it did astonish him that he had never thought of this before he pushed her aside he said angrily katie you wont think that its because of that great damnable uncle of yours she laughed the sound was light and unconcerned and he knew that he was vindicated lord no peter he wont like it of course but what do we care he wont like it why oh i dont think he approves of marriage not that he preaches anything immoral but hes always told me marriage is oldfashioned an economic device to perpetuate the institution of private property or something like that or anyway that he doesnt like it well thats wonderful well show him in all sincerity he was glad of it it removed not from his mind which he knew to be innocent but from all other minds where it could occur the suspicion that there had been in his feeling for her any hint of such considerations as applied to to francons daughter for instance he thought it was strange that this should seem so important that he should wish so desperately to keep his feeling for her free from ties to all other people he let his head fall back he felt the bite of snowflakes on his lips then he turned and kissed her the touch of her mouth was soft and cold with the snow her hat had slipped to one side her lips were half open her eyes round helpless her lashes glistening he held her hand palm up and looked at it she wore a black woolen glove and her fingers were spread out clumsily like a childs he saw beads of melted snow in the fuzz of the glove they sparkled radiantly once in the light of a car flashing past the bulletin of the architects guild of america carried in its miscellaneous department a short item announcing henry camerons retirement six lines summarized his achievements in architecture and misspelled the names of his two best buildings peter keating walked into francons office and interrupted francons wellbred bargaining with an antique dealer over a snuffbox that had belonged to madame pompadour francon was precipitated into paying nine dollars and twentyfive cents more than he had intended to pay he turned to keating testily after the dealer had left and asked well what is it peter what is it keating threw the bulletin down on francons desk his thumbnail underscoring the paragraph about cameron ive got to have that man said keating what man howard roark who the hell asked francon is howard roark ive told you about him camerons designer oh oh yes i believe you did well go and get him do you give me a free hand on how i hire him what the hell what is there about hiring another draftsman incidentally did you have to interrupt me for that he might be difficult and i want to get him before he decides on anyone else really hes going to be difficult about it is he do you intend to beg him to come here after camerons which is not great recommendation for a young man anyway come on guy isnt it oh well well speaking structurally not esthetically cameron does give them a thorough grounding and of course cameron was pretty important in his day as a matter of fact i was one of his best draftsmen myself once long ago theres something to be said for old cameron when you need that sort of thing go ahead get your roark if you think you need him its not that i really need him but hes an old friend of mine and out of a job and i thought it would be a nice thing to do for him well do anything you wish only dont bother me about it say peter dont you think this is as lovely a snuffbox as youve ever seen that evening keating climbed unannounced to roarks room and knocked nervously and entered cheerfully he found roark sitting on the window sill smoking just passing by said keating with an evening to kill and happened to think that thats where you live howard and thought id drop in to say hello havent seen you for such a long time i know what you want said roark all right how much what do you mean howard you know what i mean sixtyfive a week keating blurted out this was not the elaborate approach he had prepared but he had not expected to find that no approach would be necessary sixtyfive to start with if you think its not enough i could maybe sixtyfive will do you youll come with us howard when do you want me to start why as soon as you can monday all right thanks howard on one condition said roark im not going to do any designing not any no details no louis xv skyscrapers just keep me off esthetics if you want to keep me at all put me in the engineering department send me on inspections out in the field now do you still want me certainly anything you say youll like the place just wait and see youll like francon hes one of camerons men himself he shouldnt boast about it well no dont worry i wont say it to his face i wont say anything to anyone is that what you wanted to know why no i wasnt worried i wasnt even thinking of that then its settled good night see you monday well yes but im in no special hurry really i came to see you and whats the matter peter something bothering you no i you want to know why im doing it roark smiled without resentment or interest is that it ill tell you if you want to know i dont give a damn where i work next theres no architect in town that id want to work for but i have to work somewhere so it might as well be your francon if i can get what i want from you im selling myself and ill play the game that way for the time being really howard you dont have to look at it like that theres no limit to how far you can go with us once you get used to it youll see for a change what a real office looks like after camerons dump well shut up about that peter and well do it damn fast i didnt mean to criticize or i didnt mean anything he did not know what to say nor what he should feel it was a victory but it seemed hollow still it was a victory and he felt that he wanted to feel affection for roark howard lets go out and have a drink just sort of to celebrate the occasion sorry peter thats not part of the job keating had come here prepared to exercise caution and tact to the limit of his ability he had achieved a purpose he had not expected to achieve he knew he should take no chances say nothing else and leave but something inexplicable beyond all practical considerations was pushing him on he said unheedingly cant you be human for once in your life what human simple natural but i am cant you ever relax roark smiled because he was sitting on the window sill leaning sloppily against the wall his long legs hanging loosely the cigarette held without pressure between limp fingers thats not what i mean said keating why cant you go out for a drink with me what for do you always have to have a purpose do you always have to be so damn serious cant you ever do things without reason just like everybody else youre so serious so old everythings important with you everythings great significant in some way every minute even when you keep still cant you ever be comfortable and unimportant no dont you get tired of the heroic whats heroic about me nothing everything i dont know its not what you do its what you make people feel around you what the unnormal the strain when im with you its always like a choice between you and the rest of the world i dont want that kind of a choice i dont want to be an outsider i want to belong theres so much in the world thats simple and pleasant its not all fighting and renunciation it is with you what have i ever renounced oh youll never renounce anything youd walk over corpses for what you want but its what youve renounced by never wanting it thats because you cant want both both what look peter ive never told you any of those things about me what makes you see them ive never asked you to make a choice between me and anything else what makes you feel that there is a choice involved what makes you uncomfortable when you feel that since youre so sure im wrong i i dont know he added i dont know what youre talking about and then he asked suddenly howard why do you hate me i dont hate you well thats it why dont you hate me at least why should i just to give me something i know you cant like me you cant like anybody so it would be kinder to acknowledge peoples existence by hating them im not kind peter and as keating found nothing to say roark added go home peter you got what you wanted let it go at that see you monday roark stood at a table in the drafting room of francon heyer a pencil in his hand a strand of orange hair hanging down over his face the prescribed pearlgray smock like a prison uniform on his body he had learned to accept his new job the lines he drew were to be the clean lines of steel beams and he tried not to think of what these beams would carry it was difficult at times between him and the plan of the building on which he was working stood the plan of that building as it should have been he saw what he could make of it how to change the lines he drew where to lead them in order to achieve a thing of splendor he had to choke the knowledge he had to kill the vision he had to obey and draw the lines as instructed it hurt him so much that he shrugged at himself in cold anger he thought difficult well learn it but the pain remained and a helpless wonder the thing he saw was so much more real than the reality of paper office and commission he could not understand what made others blind to it and what made their indifference possible he looked at the paper before him he wondered why ineptitude should exist and have its say he had never known that and the reality which permitted it could never become quite real to him but he knew that this would not last he had to wait it was his only assignment to wait what he felt didnt matter it had to be done he had to wait mr roark are you ready with the steel cage for the gothic lantern for the american radio corporation building he had no friends in the drafting room he was there like a piece of furniture as useful as impersonal and as silent only the chief of the engineering department to which roark was assigned had said to keating after the first two weeks youve got more sense than i gave you credit for keating thanks for what asked keating for nothing that was intentional im sure said the chief once in a while keating stopped by roarks table to say softly will you drop in at my office when youre through tonight howard nothing important when roark came keating began by saying well how do you like it here howard if theres anything you want just say so and ill roark interrupted to ask where is it this time keating produced sketches from a drawer and said i know its perfectly right just as it is but what do you think of it generally speaking roark looked at the sketches and even though he wanted to throw them at keatings face and resign one thought stopped him the thought that it was a building and that he had to save it as others could not pass a drowning man without leaping in to the rescue then he worked for hours sometimes all night while keating sat and watched he forgot keatings presence he saw only a building and his chance to shape it he knew that the shape would be changed torn distorted still some order and reason would remain in its plan it would be a better building than it would have been if he refused sometimes looking at the sketch of a structure simpler cleaner more honest than the others roark would say thats not so bad peter youre improving and keating would feel an odd little jolt inside something quiet private and precious such as he never felt from the compliments of guy francon of his clients of all others then he would forget it and feel much more substantially pleased when a wealthy lady murmured over a teacup youre the coming architect of america mr keating though she had never seen his buildings he found compensations for his submission to roark he would enter the drafting room in the morning throw a tracing boys assignment down on roarks table and say howard do this up for me will you and make it fast in the middle of the day he would send a boy to roarks table to say loudly mr keating wishes to see you in his office at once he would come out of the office and walk in roarks direction and say to the room at large where the hell are those twelfth street plumbing specifications oh howard will you look through the files and dig them up for me at first he was afraid of roarks reaction when he saw no reaction only a silent obedience he could restrain himself no longer he felt a sensual pleasure in giving orders to roark and he felt also a fury of resentment at roarks passive compliance he continued knowing that he could continue only so long as roark exhibited no anger yet wishing desperately to break him down to an explosion no explosion came roark liked the days when he was sent out to inspect buildings in construction he walked through the steel hulks of buildings more naturally than on pavements the workers observed with curiosity that he walked on narrow planks on naked beams hanging over empty space as easily as the best of them it was a day in march and the sky was a faint green with the first hint of spring in central park five hundred feet below the earth caught the tone of the sky in a shade of brown that promised to become green and the lakes lay like splinters of glass under the cobwebs of bare branches roark walked through the shell of what was to be a gigantic apartment hotel and stopped before an electrician at work the man was toiling assiduously bending conduits around a beam it was a task for hours of strain and patience in a space overfilled against all calculations roark stood his hands in his pockets watching the mans slow painful progress the man raised his head and turned to him abruptly he had a big head and a face so ugly that it became fascinating it was neither old nor flabby but it was creased in deep gashes and the powerful jowls drooped like a bulldogs the eyes were startling wide round and chinablue well the man asked angrily whats the matter bricktop youre wasting your time said roark yeah yeah you dont say it will take you hours to get your pipes around that beam know a better way to do it sure run along punk we dont like college smarties around here cut a hole in that beam and put your pipes through what cut a hole through the beam the hell i will the hell you wont it aint done that way ive done it you its done everywhere it aint gonna be done here not by me then ill do it for you the man roared thats rich when did office boys learn to do a mans work give me your torch look out boy itll burn your pretty pink toes roark took the mans gloves and goggles took the acetylene torch knelt and sent a thin jet of blue fire at the center of the beam the man stood watching him roarks arm was steady holding the tense hissing streak of flame in leash shuddering faintly with its violence but holding it aimed straight there was no strain no effort in the easy posture of his body only in his arm and it seemed as if the blue tension eating slowly through metal came not from the flame but from the hand holding it he finished put the torch down and rose jesus said the electrician do you know how to handle a torch looks like it doesnt it he removed the gloves the goggles and handed them back do it that way from now on tell the foreman i said so the electrician was staring reverently at the neat hole cut through the beam he muttered where did you learn to handle it like that red roarks slow amused smile acknowledged this concession of victory oh ive been an electrician and a plumber and a rivet catcher and many other things and went to school besides well in a way gonna be an architect yes well youll be the first one that knows something besides pretty pictures and tea parties you should see the teachers pets they send us down from the office if youre apologizing dont i dont like them either go back to the pipes so long so long red the next time roark appeared on that job the blueeyed electrician waved to him from afar and called him over and asked advice about his work which he did not need he stated that his name was mike and that he had missed roark for several days on the next visit the day shift was just leaving and mike waited outside for roark to finish the inspection how about a glass of beer red he invited when roark came out sure said roark thanks they sat together at a table in the corner of a basement speakeasy and they drank beer and mike related his favorite tale of how he had fallen five stories when a scaffolding gave way under him how he had broken three ribs but lived to tell it and roark spoke of his days in the building trades mike did have a real name which was sean xavier donnigan but everyone had forgotten it long ago he owned a set of tools and an ancient ford and existed for the sole purpose of traveling around the country from one big construction job to another people meant very little to mike but their performance a great deal he worshipped expertness of any kind he loved his work passionately and had no tolerance for anything save for other singletrack devotions he was a master in his own field and he felt no sympathy except for mastery his view of the world was simple there were the able and there were the incompetent he was not concerned with the latter he loved buildings he despised however all architects there was one red he said earnestly over his fifth beer one only and youd be too young to know about him but that was the only man that knew building i worked for him when i was your age who was that henry cameron was his name hes dead i guess these many years roark looked at him for a long time then said hes not dead mike and added ive worked for him you did for almost three years they looked at each other silently and that was the final seal on their friendship weeks later mike stopped roark one day at the building his ugly face puzzled and asked say red i heard the super tell a guy from the contractors that youre stuckup and stubborn and the lousiest bastard hes ever been up against what did you do to him nothing what the hell did he mean i dont know said roark do you mike looked at him shrugged and grinned no said mike early in may peter keating departed for washington to supervise the construction of a museum donated to the city by a great philanthropist easing his conscience the museum building keating pointed out proudly was to be decidedly different it was not a reproduction of the parthenon but of the maison carrée at nîmes keating had been away for some time when an office boy approached roarks table and informed him that mr francon wished to see him in his office when roark entered the sanctuary francon smiled from behind the desk and said cheerfully sit down my friend sit down but something in roarks eyes which he had never seen at close range before made francons voice shrink and stop and he added dryly sit down roark obeyed francon studied him for a second but could reach no conclusion beyond deciding that the man had a most unpleasant face yet looked quite correctly attentive youre the one whos worked for cameron arent you francon asked yes said roark mr keating has been telling me very nice things about you francon tried pleasantly and stopped it was wasted courtesy roark just sat looking at him waiting listen whats your name roark listen roark we have a client who is a little odd but hes an important man a very important man and we have to satisfy him hes given us a commission for an eightmilliondollar office building but the trouble is that he has very definite ideas on what he wants it to look like he wants it francon shrugged apologetically disclaiming all blame for the preposterous suggestion he wants it to look like this he handed roark a photograph it was a photograph of the dana building roark sat quite still the photograph hanging between his fingers do you know that building asked francon yes well thats what he wants and mr keatings away ive had bennett and cooper and williams make sketches but hes turned them down so i thought id give you a chance francon looked at him impressed by the magnanimity of his own offer there was no reaction there was only a man who still looked as if hed been struck on the head of course said francon its quite a jump for you quite an assignment but i thought id let you try dont be afraid mr keating and i will go over it afterward just draw up the plans and a good sketch of it you must have an idea of what the man wants you know camerons tricks but of course we cant let a crude thing like this come out of our office we must please him but we must also preserve our reputation and not frighten all our other clients away the point is to make it simple and in the general mood of this but also artistic you know the more severe kind of greek you dont have to use the ionic order use the doric plain pediments and simple moldings or something like that get the idea now take this along and show me what you can do bennett will give you all the particulars and whats the mat francons voice cut itself off mr francon please let me design it the way the dana building was designed huh let me do it not copy the dana building but design it as henry cameron would have wanted it done as i will you mean modernistic i well call it that are you crazy mr francon please listen to me roarks words were like the steps of a man walking a tightwire slow strained groping for the only right spot quivering over an abyss but precise i dont blame you for the things youre doing im working for you im taking your money i have no right to express objections but this time this time the client is asking for it youre risking nothing he wants it think of it theres a man one man who sees and understands and wants it and has the power to build it are you going to fight a client for the first time in your life and fight for what to cheat him and to give him the same old trash when you have so many others asking for it and one only one who comes with a request like this arent you forgetting yourself asked francon coldly what difference would it make to you just let me do it my way and show it to him only show it to him hes already turned down three sketches what if he turns down a fourth but if he doesnt if he doesnt roark had never known how to entreat and he was not doing it well his voice was hard toneless revealing the effort so that the plea became an insult to the man who was making him plead keating would have given a great deal to see roark in that moment but francon could not appreciate the triumph he was the first ever to achieve he recognized only the insult am i correct in gathering francon asked that you are criticizing me and teaching me something about architecture im begging you said roark closing his eyes if you werent a protégé of mr keatings i wouldnt bother to discuss the matter with you any further but since you are quite obviously naive and inexperienced i shall point out to you that i am not in the habit of asking for the esthetic opinions of my draftsmen you will kindly take this photograph and i do not wish any building as cameron might have designed it i wish the scheme of this adapted to our site and you will follow my instructions as to the classic treatment of the facade i cant do it said roark very quietly what are you speaking to me are you actually saying sorry i cant do it i havent said sorry mr francon what did you say that i cant do it why you dont want to know why dont ask me to do any designing ill do any other kind of job you wish but not that and not to camerons work what do you mean no designing you expect to be an architect some day or do you not like this oh i see so you cant do it you mean you wont if you prefer listen you impertinent fool this is incredible roark got up may i go mr francon in all my life roared francon in all my experience ive never seen anything like it are you here to tell me what youll do and what you wont do are you here to give me lessons and criticize my taste and pass judgment im not criticizing anything said roark quietly im not passing judgment there are some things that i cant do let it go at that may i leave now you may leave this room and this firm now and from now on you may go straight to the devil go and find yourself another employer try and find him go get your check and get out yes mr francon that evening roark walked to the basement speakeasy where he could always find mike after the days work mike was now employed on the construction of a factory by the same contractor who was awarded most of francons biggest jobs mike had expected to see roark on an inspection visit to the factory that afternoon and greeted him angrily whats the matter red lying down on the job when he heard the news mike sat still and looked like a bulldog baring its teeth then he swore savagely the bastards he gulped between stronger names the bastards keep still mike well what now red someone else of the same kind until the same thing happens again when keating returned from washington he went straight up to francons office he had not stopped in the drafting room and had heard no news francon greeted him expansively boy its great to see you back whatll you have a whiskyandsoda or a little brandy no thanks just give me a cigarette here boy you look fine better than ever how do you do it you lucky bastard i have so many things to tell you how did it go down in washington everything all right and before keating could answer francon rushed on something dreadfuls happened to me most disappointing do you remember lili landau i thought i was all set with her but last time i saw her did i get the cold shoulder do you know whos got her youll be surprised gail wynand no less the girls flying high you should see her pictures and her legs all over his newspapers will it help her show or wont it what can i offer against that and do you know what hes done remember how she always said that nobody could give her what she wanted most her childhood home the dear little austrian village where she was born well wynand bought it long ago the whole damn village and had it shipped here every bit of it and had it assembled again down on the hudson and there it stands now cobbles church apple trees pigsties and all then he springs it on lili two weeks ago wouldnt you just know it if the king of babylon could get hanging gardens for his homesick lady why not gail wynand lilis all smiles and gratitude but the poor girl was really miserable shed have much preferred a mink coat she never wanted the damn village and wynand knew it too but there it stands on the hudson last week he gave a party for her right there in that village a costume party with mr wynand dressed as cesare borgia wouldnt he though and what a party if you can believe what you hear but you know how it is you can never prove anything on wynand then what does he do the next day but pose up there himself with little schoolchildren whod never seen an austrian village the philanthropist and plasters the photos all over his papers with plenty of sob stuff about educational values and gets mush notes from womens clubs id like to know what hell do with the village when he gets rid of lili he will you know they never last long with him do you think ill have a chance with her then sure said keating sure you will hows everything here in the office oh fine same as usual lucius had a cold and drank up all of my best bas armagnac its bad for his heart and a hundred dollars a case besides lucius got himself caught in a nasty little mess its that phobia of his his damn porcelain seems he went and bought a teapot from a fence he knew it was stolen goods too took me quite a bit of bother to save us from a scandal oh by the way i fired that friend of yours whats his name roark oh said keating and let a moment pass then asked why the insolent bastard where did you ever pick him up what happened i thought id be nice to him give him a real break i asked him to make a sketch for the farrell building you know the one brent finally managed to design and we got farrell to accept you know the simplified doric and your friend just up and refused to do it it seems he has ideals or something so i showed him the gate whats the matter what are you smiling at nothing i can just see it now dont you ask me to take him back no of course not for several days keating thought that he should call on roark he did not know what he would say but felt dimly that he should say something he kept postponing it he was gaining assurance in his work he felt that he did not need roark after all the days went by and he did not call on roark and he felt relief in being free to forget him beyond the windows of his room roark saw the roofs the water tanks the chimneys the cars speeding far below there was a threat in the silence of his room in the empty days in his hands hanging idly by his sides and he felt another threat rising from the city below as if each window each strip of pavement had set itself closed grimly in wordless resistance it did not disturb him he had known and accepted it long ago he made a list of the architects whose work he resented least in the order of their lesser evil and he set out upon the search for a job coldly systematically without anger or hope he never knew whether these days hurt him he knew only that it was a thing which had to be done the architects he saw differed from one another some looked at him across the desk kindly and vaguely and their manner seemed to say that it was touching his ambition to be an architect touching and laudable and strange and attractively sad as all the delusions of youth some smiled at him with thin drawn lips and seemed to enjoy his presence in the room because it made them conscious of their own accomplishment some spoke coldly as if his ambition were a personal insult some were brusque and the sharpness of their voices seemed to say that they needed good draftsmen they always needed good draftsmen but this qualification could not possibly apply to him and would he please refrain from being rude enough to force them to express it more plainly it was not malice it was not a judgment passed upon his merit they did not think he was worthless they simply did not care to find out whether he was good sometimes he was asked to show his sketches he extended them across a desk feeling a contraction of shame in the muscles of his hand it was like having the clothes torn off his body and the shame was not that his body was exposed but that it was exposed to indifferent eyes once in a while he made a trip to new jersey to see cameron they sat together on the porch of a house on a hill cameron in a wheel chair his hands on an old blanket spread over his knees how is it howard pretty hard no want me to give you a letter to one of the bastards no then cameron would not speak of it any more he did not want to speak of it he did not want the thought of roark rejected by their city to become real when roark came to him cameron spoke of architecture with the simple confidence of a private possession they sat together looking at he city in the distance on the edge of the sky beyond the river the sky was growing dark and luminous as bluegreen glass the buildings looked like clouds condensed on the glass grayblue clouds frozen for an instant in straight angles and vertical shafts with the sunset caught in the spires as the summer months passed as his list was exhausted and he returned again to the places that had refused him once roark found that a few things were known about him and he heard the same words spoken bluntly or timidly or angrily or apologetically you were kicked out of stanton you were kicked out of francons office all the different voices saying it had one note in common a note of relief in the certainty that the decision had been made for them he sat on the window sill in the evening smoking his hand spread on the pane the city under his fingers the glass cold against his skin in september he read an article entitled make way for tomorrow by gordon l prescott aga in the architectural tribune the article stated that the tragedy of the profession was the hardships placed in the way of its talented beginners that great gifts had been lost in the struggle unnoticed that architecture was perishing from a lack of new blood and new thought a lack of originality vision and courage that the author of the article made it his aim to search for promising beginners to encourage them develop them and give them the chance they deserved roark had never heard of gordon l prescott but there was a tone of honest conviction in the article he allowed himself to start for prescotts office with the first hint of hope the reception room of gordon l prescotts office was done in gray black and scarlet it was correct restrained and daring all at once a young and very pretty secretary informed roark that one could not see mr prescott without an appointment but that she would be very glad to make an appointment for next wednesday at twofifteen on wednesday at twofifteen the secretary smiled at roark and asked him please to be seated for just a moment at four fortyfive he was admitted into gordon l prescotts office gordon l prescott wore a brown checkered tweed jacket and a white turtleneck sweater of angora wool he was tall athletic and thirtyfive but his face combined a crisp air of sophisticated wisdom with the soft skin the button nose the small puffed mouth of a college hero his face was sunscorched his blond hair clipped short in a military prussian haircut he was frankly masculine frankly unconcerned about elegance and frankly conscious of the effect he listened to roark silently and his eyes were like a stop watch registering each separate second consumed by each separate word of roarks he let the first sentence go by on the second he interrupted to say curtly let me see your drawings as if to make it clear that anything roark might say was quite well known to him already he held the drawings in his bronzed hands before he looked down at them he said ah yes so many young men come to me for advice so many he glanced at the first sketch but raised his head before he had seen it of course its the combination of the practical and the transcendental that is so hard for beginners to grasp he slipped the sketch to the bottom of the pile architecture is primarily a utilitarian conception and the problem is to elevate the principle of pragmatism into the realm of esthetic abstraction all else is nonsense he glanced at two sketches and slipped them to the bottom i have no patience with visionaries who see a holy crusade in architecture for architectures sake the great dynamic principle is the common principle of the human equation he glanced at a sketch and slipped it under the public taste and the public heart are the final criteria of the artist the genius is the one who knows how to express the general the exception is to tap the unexceptional he weighed the pile of sketches in his hand noted that he had gone through half of them and dropped them down on the desk ah yes he said your work very interesting but not practical not mature unfocused and undisciplined adolescent originality for originalitys sake not at all in the spirit of the present day if you want an idea of the sort of thing for which there is a crying need here let me show you he took a sketch out of a drawer of the desk heres a young man who came to me totally unrecommended a beginner who had never worked before when you can produce stuff like this you wont find it necessary to look for a job i saw this one sketch of his and i took him on at once started him at twentyfive a week too theres no question but that he is a potential genius he extended the sketch to roark the sketch represented a house in the shape of a grain silo incredibly merged with the simplified emaciated shadow of the parthenon that said gordon l prescott is originality the new in the eternal try toward something like this i cant really say that i predict a great deal for your future we must be frank i wouldnt want to give you illusions based on my authority you have a great deal to learn i couldnt venture a guess on what talent you might possess or develop later but with hard work perhaps architecture is a difficult profession however and the competition is stiff you know very stiff and now if youll excuse me my secretary has an appointment waiting for me roark walked home late on an evening in october it had been another of the many days that stretched into months behind him and he could not tell what had taken place in the hours of that day whom he had seen what form the words of refusal had taken he concentrated fiercely on the few minutes at hand when he was in an office forgetting everything else he forgot these minutes when he left the office it had to be done it had been done it concerned him no longer he was free once more on his way home a long street stretched before him its high banks coming close together ahead so narrow that he felt as if he could spread his arms seize the spires and push them apart he walked swiftly the pavements as a springboard throwing his steps forward he saw a lighted triangle of concrete suspended somewhere hundreds of feet above the ground he could not see what stood below supporting it he was free to think of what hed want to see there what he would have made to be seen then he thought suddenly that now in this moment according to the city according to everyone save that hard certainty within him he would never build again never before he had begun he shrugged those things happening to him in those offices of strangers were only a kind of subreality unsubstantial incidents in the path of a substance they could not reach or touch he turned into side streets leading to the east river a lonely traffic light hung far ahead a spot of red in a bleak darkness the old houses crouched low to the ground hunched under the weight of the sky the street was empty and hollow echoing to his footsteps he went on his collar raised his hands in his pockets his shadow rose from under his heels when he passed a light and brushed a wall in a long black arc like the sweep of a windshield wiper john erik snyte looked through roarks sketches flipped three of them aside gathered the rest into an even pile glanced again at the three tossed them down one after another on top of the pile with three sharp thuds and said remarkable radical but remarkable what are you doing tonight why asked roark stupefied are you free mind starting in at once take your coat off go to the drafting room borrow tools from somebody and do me up a sketch for a department store were remodeling just a quick sketch just a general idea but i must have it tomorrow mind staying late tonight the heats on and ill have joe send you up some dinner want black coffee or scotch or what just tell joe can you stay yes said roark incredulously i can work all night fine splendid thats just what ive always needed a cameron man ive got every other kind oh yes what did they pay you at francons sixtyfive well i cant splurge like guy the epicure fiftys tops okay fine go right in ill have billings explain about the store to you i want something modern understand modern violent crazy to knock their eye out dont restrain yourself go the limit pull any stunt you can think of the goofier the better come on john erik snyte shot to his feet flung a door open into a huge drafting room flew in skidded against a table stopped and said to a stout man with a grim moonface billings roark hes our modernist give him the benton store get him some instruments leave him your keys and show him what to lock up tonight start him as of this morning fifty what time was my appointment with dolson brothers im late already so long i wont be back tonight he skidded out slamming the door billings evinced no surprise he looked at roark as if roark had always been there he spoke impassively in a weary drawl within twenty minutes he left roark at a drafting table with paper pencils instruments a set of plans and photographs of the department store a set of charts and a long list of instructions roark looked at the clean white sheet before him his fist closed tightly about the thin stem of a pencil he put the pencil down and picked it up again his thumb running softly up and down the smooth shaft he saw that the pencil was trembling he put it down quickly and he felt anger at himself for the weakness of allowing this job to mean so much to him for the sudden knowledge of what the months of idleness behind him had really meant his fingertips were pressed to the paper as if the paper held them as a surface charged with electricity will hold the flesh of a man who has brushed against it hold and hurt he tore his fingers off the paper then he went to work john erik snyte was fifty years old he wore an expression of quizzical amusement shrewd and unwholesome as if he shared with each man he contemplated a lewd secret which he would not mention because it was so obvious to them both he was a prominent architect his expression did not change when he spoke of this fact he considered guy francon an impractical idealist he was not restrained by an classic dogma he was much more skillful and liberal he built anything he had no distaste for modern architecture and built cheerfully when a rare client asked for it bare boxes with flat roofs which he called progressive he built roman mansions which he called fastidious he built gothic churches which he called spiritual he saw no difference among any of them he never became angry except when somebody called him eclectic he had a system of his own he employed five designers of various types and he staged a contest among them on each commission he received he chose the winning design and improved it with bits of the four others six minds he said are better than one when roark saw the final drawing of the benton department store he understood why snyte had not been afraid to hire him he recognized his own planes of space his windows his system of circulation he saw added to it corinthian capitals gothic vaulting colonial chandeliers and incredible moldings vaguely moorish the drawing was done in watercolor with miraculous delicacy mounted on cardboard covered with a veil of tissue paper the men in the drafting room were not allowed to look at it except from a safe distance all hands had to be washed all cigarettes discarded john erik snyte attached a great importance to the proper appearance of a drawing for submission to clients and kept a young chinese student of architecture employed solely upon the execution of these masterpieces roark knew what to expect of his job he would never see his work erected only pieces of it which he preferred not to see but he would be free to design as he wished and he would have the experience of solving actual problems it was less than he wanted and more than he could expect he accepted it at that he met his fellow designers the four other contestants and learned that they were unofficially nicknamed in the drafting room as classic gothic renaissance and miscellaneous he winced a little when he was addressed as hey modernistic the strike of the buildingtrades unions infuriated guy francon the strike had started against the contractors who were erecting the noyesbelmont hotel and had spread to all the new structures of the city it had been mentioned in the press that the architects of the noyesbelmont were the firm of francon heyer most of the press helped the fight along urging the contractors not to surrender the loudest attacks against the strikers came from the powerful papers of the great wynand chain we have always stood said the wynand editorials for the rights of the common man against the yellow sharks of privilege but we cannot give our support to the destruction of law and order it had never been discovered whether the wynand papers led the public or the public led the wynand papers it was known only that the two kept remarkably in step it was not known to anyone however save to guy francon and a very few others that gail wynand owned the corporation which owned the corporation which owned the noyesbelmont hotel this added greatly to francons discomfort gail wynands realestate operations were rumored to be vaster than his journalistic empire it was the first chance francon had ever had at a wynand commission and he grasped it avidly thinking of the possibilities which it could open he and keating had put their best efforts into designing the most ornate of all rococo palaces for future patrons who could pay twentyfive dollars per day per room and who were fond of plaster flowers marble cupids and open elevator cages of bronze lace the strike had shattered the future possibilities francon could not be blamed for it but one could never tell whom gail wynand would blame and for what reason the unpredictable unaccountable shifts of wynands favor were famous and it was well known that few architects he employed once were ever employed by him again francons sullen mood led him to the unprecedented breach of snapping over nothing in particular at the one person who had always been immune from it peter keating keating shrugged and turned his back to him in silent insolence then keating wandered aimlessly through the halls snarling at young draftsmen without provocation he bumped into lucius n heyer in a doorway and snapped look where youre going heyer stared after him bewildered blinking there was little to do in the office nothing to say and everyone to avoid keating left early and walked home through a cold december twilight at home he cursed aloud the thick smell of paint from the overheated radiators he cursed the chill when his mother opened a window he could find no reason for his restlessness unless it was the sudden inactivity that left him alone he could not bear to be left alone he snatched up the telephone receiver and called catherine halsey the sound of her clear voice was like a hand pressed soothingly against his hot forehead he said oh nothing important dear i just wondered if youd be home tonight i thought id drop in after dinner of course peter ill be home swell about eightthirty yes oh peter have you heard about uncle ellsworth yes god damn it ive heard about your uncle ellsworth im sorry katie forgive me darling i didnt mean to be rude but ive been hearing about your uncle all day long i know its wonderful and all that only look were not going to talk about him again tonight no of course not im sorry i understand ill be waiting for you so long katie he had heard the latest story about ellsworth toohey but he did not want to think of it because it brought him back to the annoying subject of the strike six months ago on the wave of his success with sermons in stone ellsworth toohey had been signed to write one small voice a daily syndicated column for the wynand papers it appeared in the banner and had started as a department of art criticism but grown into an informal tribune from which ellsworth m toohey pronounced verdicts on art literature new york restaurants international crises and sociology mainly sociology it had been a great success but the building strike had placed ellsworth m toohey in a difficult position he made no secret of his sympathy with the strikers but he had said nothing in his column for no one could say what he pleased on the papers owned by gail wynand save gail wynand however a mass meeting of strike sympathizers had been called for this evening many famous men were to speak ellsworth toohey among them at least tooheys name had been announced the event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on whether toohey would dare to appear he will keating had heard a draftsman insist vehemently hell sacrifice himself hes that kind hes the only honest man in print he wont another had said do you realize what it means to pull a stunt like that on wynand once wynand gets it in for a man hell break the guy for sure as hells fire nobody knows when hell do it or how hell do it but hell do it and nobodyll prove a thing on him and youre done for once you get wynand after you keating did not care about the issue one way or another and the whole matter annoyed him he ate his dinner that evening in grim silence and when mrs keating began with an oh by the way to lead the conversation in a direction he recognized he snapped youre not going to talk about catherine keep still mrs keating said nothing further and concentrated on forcing more food on his plate he took a taxi to greenwich village he hurried up the stairs he jerked at the bell he waited there was no answer he stood leaning against the wall ringing for a long time catherine wouldnt be out when she knew he was coming she couldnt be he walked incredulously down the stairs out to the street and looked up at the windows of her apartment the windows were dark he stood looking up at the windows as at a tremendous betrayal then came a sick feeling of loneliness as if he were homeless in a great city for the moment he forgot his own address or its existence then he thought of the meeting the great mass meeting where her uncle was publicly to make a martyr of himself tonight thats where she went he thought the damn little fool he said aloud to hell with her and he was walking rapidly in the direction of the meeting hall there was one naked bulb of light over the square frame of the halls entrance a small bluewhite lump glowing ominously too cold and too bright it leaped out of the dark street lighting one thin trickle of rain from some ledge above a glistening needle of glass so thin and smooth that keating thought crazily of stories where men had been killed by being pierced with an icicle a few curious loafers stood indifferently in the rain around the entrance and a few policemen the door was open the dim lobby was crowded with people who could not get into the packed hall they were listening to a loudspeaker installed there for the occasion at the door three vague shadows were handing out pamphlets to passersby one of the shadows was a consumptive unshaved young man with a long bare neck the other was a trim youth with a fur collar on an expensive coat the third was catherine halsey she stood in the rain slumped her stomach jutting forward in weariness her nose shiny her eyes bright with excitement keating stopped staring at her her hand shot toward him mechanically with a pamphlet then she raised her eyes and saw him she smiled without astonishment and said happily why peter how sweet of you to come here katie he choked a little katie what the hell but i had to peter her voice had no trace of apology you dont understand but i get out of the rain get inside but i cant i have to get out of the rain at least you fool he pushed her roughly through the door into a corner of the lobby peter darling youre not angry are you you see it was like this i didnt think uncle would let me come here tonight but at the last minute he said i could if i wanted to and that i could help with the pamphlets i knew youd understand and i left you a note on the living room table explaining and you left me a note inside yes oh oh dear me i never thought of that you couldnt get in of course how silly of me but i was in such a rush no youre not going to be angry you cant dont you see what this means to him dont you know what hes sacrificing by coming here and i knew he would i told them so those people who said not a chance itll be the end of him and it might be but he doesnt care thats what hes like im frightened and im terribly happy because what hes done it makes me believe in all human beings but im frightened because you see wynand will keep still i know it all im sick of it i dont want to hear about your uncle or wynand or the damn strike lets get out of here oh no peter we cant i want to hear him and shut up over there someone hissed at them from the crowd were missing it all she whispered thats austen heller speaking dont you want to hear austen heller keating looked up at the loudspeaker with a certain respect which he felt for all famous names he had not read much of austen heller but he knew that heller was the star columnist of the chronicle a brilliant independent newspaper archenemy of the wynand publications that heller came from an old distinguished family and had graduated from oxford that he had started as a literary critic and ended by becoming a quiet fiend devoted to the destruction of all forms of compulsion private or public in heaven or on earth that he had been cursed by preachers bankers clubwomen and labor organizers that he had better manners than the social elite whom he usually mocked and a tougher constitution than the laborers whom he usually defended that he could discuss the latest play on broadway medieval poetry or international finance that he never donated to charity but spent more of his own money than he could afford on defending political prisoners anywhere the voice coming from the loudspeaker was dry precise with the faint trace of a british accent and we must consider austen heller was saying unemotionally that since unfortunately we are forced to live together the most important thing for us to remember is that the only way in which we can have any law at all is to have as little of it as possible i see no ethical standard to which to measure the whole unethical conception of a state except in the amount of time of thought of money of effort and of obedience which a society extorts from its every member its value and its civilization are in inverse ratio to that extortion there is no conceivable law by which a man can be forced to work on any terms except those he chooses to set there is no conceivable law to prevent him from setting them just as there is none to force his employer to accept them the freedom to agree or disagree is the foundation of our kind of society and the freedom to strike is a part of it i am mentioning this as a reminder to a certain petronius from hells kitchen an exquisite bastard who has been rather noisy lately about telling us that this strike represents a destruction of law and order the loudspeaker coughed out a high shrill sound of approval and a clatter of applause there were gasps among the people in the lobby catherine grasped keatings arm oh peter she whispered he means wynand wynand was born in hells kitchen he can afford to say that but wynand will take it out on uncle ellsworth keating could not listen to the rest of hellers speech because his head was swimming in so violent an ache that the sounds hurt his eyes and he had to keep his eyelids shut tightly he leaned against the wall he opened his eyes with a jerk when he became aware of the peculiar silence around him he had not noticed the end of hellers speech he saw the people in the lobby standing in tense solemn expectation and the blank rasping of the loudspeaker pulled every glance into its dark funnel then a voice came through the silence loudly and slowly ladies and gentlemen i have the great honor of presenting to you now mr ellsworth monkton toohey well thought keating bennetts won his six bits down at the office there were a few seconds of silence then the thing which happened hit keating on the back of the head it was not a sound nor a blow it was something that ripped time apart that cut the moment from the normal one preceding it he knew only the shock at first a distinct conscious second was gone before he realized what it was and that it was applause it was such a crash of applause that he waited for the loudspeaker to explode it went on and on and on pressing against the walls of the lobby and he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the street the people around him were cheering catherine stood her lips parted and he felt certain that she was not breathing at all it was a long time before silence came suddenly as abrupt and shocking as the roar the loudspeaker died choking on a high note those in the lobby stood still then came the voice my friends it said simply and solemnly my brothers it added softly involuntarily both full of emotion and smiling apologetically at the emotion i am more touched by this reception than i should allow myself to be i hope i shall be forgiven for a trace of the vain child which is in all of us but i realize and in that spirit i accept it that this tribute was paid not to my person but to a principle which chance has granted me to represent in all humility tonight it was not a voice it was a miracle it unrolled as a velvet banner it spoke english words but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like a new language spoken for the first time it was the voice of a giant keating stood his mouth open he did not hear what the voice was saying he heard the beauty of the sounds without meaning he felt no need to know the meaning he could accept anything he would be led blindly anywhere and so my friends the voice was saying the lesson to be learned from our tragic struggle is the lesson of unity we shall unite or we shall be defeated our will the will of the disinherited the forgotten the oppressed shall weld us into a solid bulwark with a common faith and a common goal this is the time for every man to renounce the thoughts of his petty little problems of gain of comfort of selfgratification this is the time to merge his self in a great current in the rising tide which is approaching to sweep us all willing or unwilling into the future history my friends does not ask questions or acquiescence it is irrevocable as the voice of the masses that determine it let us listen to the call let us organize my brothers let us organize let us organize let us organize keating looked at catherine there was no catherine there was only a white face dissolving in the sounds of the loudspeaker it was not that she heard her uncle keating could feel no jealousy of him he wished he could it was not affection it was something cold and impersonal that left her empty her will surrendered and no human will holding hers but a nameless thing in which she was being swallowed lets get out of here he whispered his voice was savage he was afraid she turned to him as if she were emerging from unconsciousness he knew that she was trying to recognize him and everything he implied she whispered yes lets get out they walked through the streets through the rain without direction it was cold but they went on to move to feel the movement to know the sensation of their own muscles moving were getting drenched keating said at last as bluntly and naturally as he could their silence frightened him it proved that they both knew the same thing and that the thing had been real lets find some place where we can have a drink yes said catherine lets its so cold isnt it stupid of me now ive missed uncles speech and i wanted so much to hear it it was all right she had mentioned it she had mentioned it quite naturally with a healthy amount of proper regret the thing was gone but i wanted to be with you peter i want to be with you always the thing gave a last jerk not in the meaning of what she said but in the reason that had prompted her to say it then it was gone and keating smiled his fingers sought her bare wrist between her sleeve and glove and her skin was warm against his many days later keating heard the story that was being told all over town it was said that on the day after the mass meeting gail wynand had given ellsworth toohey a raise in salary toohey had been furious and had tried to refuse it you cannot bribe me mr wynand he said im not bribing you wynand had answered dont flatter yourself when the strike was settled interrupted construction went forward with a spurt throughout the city and keating found himself spending days and nights at work with new commissions pouring into the office francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his staff to erase the memory of anything he might have said the palatial residence of mr and mrs dale ainsworth on riverside drive a pet project of keatings done in late renaissance and gray granite was complete at last mr and mrs dale ainsworth gave a formal reception as a housewarming to which guy francon and peter keating were invited but lucius n heyer was ignored quite accidentally as always happened to him of late francon enjoyed the reception because every square foot of granite in the house reminded him of the stupendous payment received by a certain granite quarry in connecticut keating enjoyed the reception because the stately mrs ainsworth said to him with a disarming smile but i was certain that you were mr francons partner its francon and heyer of course how perfectly careless of me all i can offer by way of excuse is that if you arent his partner one would certainly say you were entitled to be life in the office rolled on smoothly in one of those periods when everything seemed to go well keating was astonished therefore one morning shortly after the ainsworth reception to see francon arrive at the office with a countenance of nervous irritation oh nothing he waved his hand at keating impatiently nothing at all in the drafting room keating noticed three draftsmen their heads close together bent over a section of the new york banner reading with a guilty kind of avid interest he heard an unpleasant chuckle from one of them when they saw him the paper disappeared too quickly he had no time to inquire into this a contractors job runner was waiting for him in his office also a stack of mail and drawings to be approved he had forgotten the incident three hours later in a rush of appointments he felt light clearheaded exhilarated by his own energy when he had to consult his library on a new drawing which he wished to compare with its best prototypes he walked out of his office whistling swinging the drawing gaily his motion had propelled him halfway across the reception room when he stopped short the drawing swung forward and flapped back against his knees he forgot that it was quite improper for him to pause there like that in the circumstances a young woman stood before the railing speaking to the reception clerk her slender body seemed out of all scale in relation to a normal human body its lines were so long so fragile so exaggerated that she looked like a stylized drawing of a woman and made the correct proportions of a normal being appear heavy and awkward beside her she wore a plain gray suit the contrast between its tailored severity and her appearance was deliberately exorbitant and strangely elegant she let the fingertips of one hand rest on the railing a narrow hand ending the straight imperious line of her arm she had gray eyes that were not ovals but two long rectangular cuts edged by parallel lines of lashes she had an air of cold serenity and an exquisitely vicious mouth her face her pale gold hair her suit seemed to have no color but only a hint just on the verge of the reality of color making the full reality seem vulgar keating stood still because he understood for the first time what it was that artists spoke about when they spoke of beauty ill see him now if i see him at all she was saying to the reception clerk he asked me to come and this is the only time i have it was not a command she spoke as if it were not necessary for her voice to assume the tones of commanding yes but a light buzzed on the clerks switchboard she plugged the connection through hastily yes mr francon she listened and nodded with relief yes mr francon she turned to the visitor will you go right in please the young woman turned and looked at keating as she passed him on her way to the stairs her eyes went past him without stopping something ebbed from his stunned admiration he had had time to see her eyes they seemed weary and a little contemptuous but they left him with a sense of cold cruelty he heard her walking up the stairs and the feeling vanished but the admiration remained he approached the reception clerk eagerly who was that he asked the clerk shrugged thats the bosss little girl why the lucky stiff said keating hes been holding out on me you misunderstood me the clerk said coldly its his daughter its dominique francon oh said keating oh lord yeah the girl looked at him sarcastically have you read this mornings banner no why read it her switchboard buzzed and she turned away from him he sent a boy for a copy of the banner and turned anxiously to the column your house by dominique francon he had heard that shed been quite successful lately with descriptions of the homes of prominent new yorkers her field was confined to home decoration but she ventured occasionally into architectural criticism today her subject was the new residence of mr and mrs dale ainsworth on riverside drive he read among many other things the following you enter a magnificent lobby of golden marble and you think that this is the city hall or the main post office but it isnt it has however everything the mezzanine with the colonnade and the stairway with a goitre and the cartouches in the form of looped leather belts only its not leather its marble the dining room has a splendid bronze gate placed by mistake on the ceiling in the shape of a trellis entwined with fresh bronze grapes there are dead ducks and rabbits hanging on the wall panels in bouquets of carrots petunias and string beans i do not think these would have been very attractive if real but since they are bad plaster imitations it is all right the bedroom windows face a brick wall not a very neat wall but nobody needs to see the bedrooms the front windows are large enough and admit plenty of light as well as the feet of the marble cupids that roost on the outside the cupids are well fed and present a pretty picture to the street against the severe granite of the façade they are quite commendable unless you just cant stand to look at dimpled soles every time you glance out to see whether its raining if you get tired of it you can always look out of the central windows of the third floor and into the castiron rump of mercury who sits on top of the pediment over the entrance its a very beautiful entrance tomorrow we shall visit the home of mr and mrs smythepickering keating had designed the house but he could not help chuckling through his fury when he thought of what francon must have felt reading this and of how francon was going to face mrs dale ainsworth then he forgot the house and the article he remembered only the girl who had written it he picked three sketches at random from his table and started for francons office to ask his approval of the sketches which he did not need on the stair landing outside francons closed door he stopped he heard francons voice behind the door loud angry and helpless the voice he always heard when francon was beaten to expect such an outrage from my own daughter im used to anything from you but this beats it all what am i going to do how am i going to explain do you have any kind of a vague idea of my position then keating heard her laughing it was a sound so gay and so cold that he knew it was best not to go in he knew he did not want to go in because he was afraid again as he had been when hed seen her eyes he turned and descended the stairs when he had reached the floor below he was thinking that he would meet her that he would meet her soon and that francon would not be able to prevent it now he thought of it eagerly laughing in relief at the picture of francons daughter as he had imagined her for years revising his vision of his future even though he felt dimly that it would be better if he never met her again ralston holcombe had no visible neck but his chin took care of that his chin and jaws formed an unbroken arc resting on his chest his cheeks were pink soft to the touch with the irresilient softness of age like the skin of a peach that has been scalded his rich white hair rose over his forehead and fell to his shoulders in the sweep of a medieval mane it left dandruff on the back of his collar he walked through the streets of new york wearing a broadbrimmed hat a dark business suit a pale green satin shirt a vest of white brocade a huge black bow emerging from under his chin and he carried a staff not a cane but a tall ebony staff surmounted by a bulb of solid gold it was as if his huge body were resigned to the conventions of a prosaic civilization and to its drab garments but the oval of his chest and stomach sallied forth flying the colors of his inner soul these things were permitted to him because he was a genius he was also president of the architects guild of america ralston holcombe did not subscribe to the views of his colleagues in the organization he was not a grubbing builder nor a businessman he was he stated firmly a man of ideals he denounced the deplorable state of american architecture and the unprincipled eclecticism of its practitioners in any period of history he declared architects built in the spirit of their own time and did not pick designs from the past we could be true to history only in heeding her law which demanded that we plant the roots of our art firmly in the reality of our own life he decried the stupidity of erecting buildings that were greek gothic or romanesque let us he begged be modern and build in the style that belongs to our days he had found that style it was renaissance he stated his reasons clearly inasmuch he pointed out as nothing of great historical importance had happened in the world since the renaissance we should consider ourselves still living in that period and all the outward forms of our existence should remain faithful to the examples of the great masters of the sixteenth century he had no patience with the few who spoke of a modern architecture in terms quite different from his own he ignored them he stated only that men who wanted to break with all of the past were lazy ignoramuses and that one could not put originality above beauty his voice trembled reverently on that last word he accepted nothing but stupendous commissions he specialized in the eternal and the monumental he built a great many memorials and capitols he designed for international expositions he built like a composer improvising under the spur of a mystic guidance he had sudden inspirations he would add an enormous dome to the flat roof of a finished structure or encrust a long vault with goldleaf mosaic or rip off a facade of limestone to replace it with marble his clients turned pale stuttered and paid his imperial personality carried him to victory in any encounter with a clients thrift behind him stood the stern unspoken overwhelming assertion that he was an artist his prestige was enormous he came from a family listed in the social register in his middle years he had married a young lady whose family had not made the social register but made piles of money instead in a chewinggum empire left to an only daughter ralston holcombe was now sixtyfive to which he added a few years for the sake of his friends compliments on his wonderful physique mrs ralston holcombe was fortytwo from which she deducted considerably mrs ralston holcombe maintained a salon that met informally every sunday afternoon everybody who is anybody in architecture drops in on us she told her friends theyd better she added on a sunday afternoon in march keating drove to the holcombe mansion a reproduction of a florentine palazzo dutifully but a little reluctantly he had been a frequent guest at these celebrated gatherings and he was beginning to be bored for he knew everybody he could expect to find there he felt however that he had to attend this time because the occasion was to be in honor of the completion of one more capitol by ralston holcombe in some state or another a substantial crowd was lost in the marble ballroom of the holcombes scattered in forlorn islets through an expanse intended for court receptions the guests stood about selfconsciously informal working at being brilliant steps rang against the marble with the echoing sound of a crypt the flames of tall candles clashed desolately with the gray of the light from the street the light made the candles seem dimmer the candles gave to the day outside a premonitory tinge of dusk a scale model of the new state capitol stood displayed on a pedestal in the middle of the room ablaze with tiny electric bulbs mrs ralston holcombe presided over the tea table each guest accepted a fragile cup of transparent porcelain took two delicate sips and vanished in the direction of the bar two stately butlers went about collecting the abandoned cups mrs ralston holcombe as an enthusiastic girl friend had described her was petite but intellectual her diminutive stature was her secret sorrow but she had learned to find compensations she could talk and did of wearing dresses size ten and of shopping in the junior departments she wore highschool garments and short socks in summer displaying spindly legs with hard blue veins she adored celebrities that was her mission in life she hunted them grimly she faced them with wideeyed admiration and spoke of her own insignificance of her humility before achievement she shrugged tightlipped and rancorous whenever one of them did not seem to take sufficient account of her own views on life after death the theory of relativity aztec architecture birth control and the movies she had a great many poor friends and advertised the fact if a friend happened to improve his financial position she dropped him feeling that he had committed an act of treason she hated the wealthy in all sincerity they shared her only badge of distinction she considered architecture her private domain she had been christened constance and found it awfully clever to be known as kiki a nickname she had forced on her friends when she was well past thirty keating had never felt comfortable in mrs holcombes presence because she smiled at him too insistently and commented on his remarks by winking and saying why peter how naughty of you when no such intention had been in his mind at all he bowed over her hand however this afternoon as usual and she smiled from behind the silver teapot she wore a regal gown of emerald velvet and a magenta ribbon in her bobbed hair with a cute little bow in front her skin was tanned and dry with enlarged pores showing on her nostrils she handed a cup to keating a squarecut emerald glittering on her finger in the candlelight keating expressed his admiration for the capitol and escaped to examine the model he stood before it for a correct number of minutes scalding his lips with the hot liquid that smelled of cloves holcombe who never looked in the direction of the model and never missed a guest stopping before it slapped keatings shoulder and said something appropriate about young fellows learning the beauty of the style of the renaissance then keating wandered off shook a few hands without enthusiasm and glanced at his wrist watch calculating the time when it would be permissible to leave then he stopped beyond a broad arch in a small library with three young men beside her he saw dominique francon she stood leaning against a column a cocktail glass in her hand she wore a suit of black velvet the heavy cloth which transmitted no light rays held her anchored to reality by stopping the light that flowed too freely through the flesh of her hands her neck her face a white spark of fire flashed like a cold metallic cross in the glass she held as if it were a lens gathering the diffused radiance of her skin keating tore forward and found francon in the crowd well peter said francon brightly want me to get you a drink not so hot he added lowering his voice but the manhattans arent too bad no said keating thanks entre nous said francon winking at the model of the capitol its a holy mess isnt it yes said keating miserable proportions that dome looks like holcombes face imitating a sunrise on the roof they had stopped in full view of the library and keatings eyes were fixed on the girl in black inviting francon to notice it he enjoyed having francon in a trap and the plan the plan do you see that on the second floor oh said francon noticing he looked at keating then at the library then at keating again well said francon at last dont blame me afterward youve asked for it come on they entered the library together keating stopped correctly but allowing his eyes an improper intensity while francon beamed with unconvincing cheeriness dominique my dear may i present this is peter keating my own right hand peter my daughter how do you do said keating his voice soft dominique bowed gravely i have waited to meet you for such a long time miss francon this will be interesting said dominique you will want to be nice to me of course and yet that wont be diplomatic what do you mean miss francon father would prefer you to be horrible with me father and i dont get along at all why miss francon i i think its only fair to tell you this at the beginning you may want to redraw some conclusions he was looking for francon but francon had vanished no she said softly father doesnt do these things well at all hes too obvious you asked him for the introduction but he shouldnt have let me notice that however its quite all right since we both admit it sit down she slipped into a chair and he sat down obediently beside her the young men whom he did not know stood about for a few minutes trying to be included in the conversation by smiling blankly then wandered off keating thought with relief that there was nothing frightening about her there was only a disquieting contrast between her words and the candid innocence of the manner she used to utter them he did not know which to trust i admit i asked for the introduction he said thats obvious anyway isnt it who wouldnt ask for it but dont you think that the conclusions ill draw may have nothing to do with your father dont say that im beautiful and exquisite and like no one youve ever met before and that youre very much afraid that youre going to fall in love with me youll say it eventually but lets postpone it apart from that i think well get along very nicely but youre trying to make it very difficult for me arent you yes father should have warned you he did you should have listened be very considerate of father ive met so many of his own right hands that i was beginning to be skeptical but youre the first one whos lasted and who looks like hes going to last ive heard a great deal about you my congratulations ive been looking forward to meeting you for years and ive been reading your column with so much he stopped he knew he shouldnt have mentioned that and above all he shouldnt have stopped so much she asked gently so much pleasure he finished hoping that she would let it go at that oh yes she said the ainsworth house you designed it im sorry you just happened to be the victim of one of my rare attacks of honesty i dont have them often as you know if youre read my stuff yesterday ive read it and well ill follow your example and ill be perfectly frank dont take it as a complaint one must never complain against ones critics but really that capitol of holcombes is much worse in all those very things that you blasted us for why did you give him such a glowing tribute yesterday or did you have to dont flatter me of course i didnt have to do you think anyone on the paper pays enough attention to a column on home decoration to care what i say in it besides im not even supposed to write about capitols only im getting tired of home decorations then why did you praise holcombe because that capitol of his is so awful that to pan it would have been an anticlimax so i thought it would be amusing to praise it to the sky it was is that the way you go about it thats the way i go about it but no one reads my column except housewives who can never afford to decorate their homes so it doesnt matter at all but what do you really like in architecture i dont like anything in architecture well you know of course that i wont believe that why do you write if you have nothing you want to say to have something to do something more disgusting than many other things i could do and more amusing come on thats not a good reason i never have any good reasons but you must be enjoying your work i am dont you see that i am you know ive actually envied you working for a magnificent enterprise like the wynand papers the largest organization in the country commanding the best writing talent and look she said leaning toward him confidentially let me help you if you had just met father and he were working for the wynand papers that would be exactly the right thing to say but not with me thats what id expect you to say and i dont like to hear what i expect it would be much more interesting if you said that the wynand papers are a contemptible dump heap of yellow journalism and all their writers put together arent worth two bits is that what you really think of them not at all but i dont like people who try to say only what they think i think thanks ill need your help ive never met anyone oh no of course thats what you didnt want me to say but i really meant it about your papers ive always admired gail wynand ive always wished i could meet him what is he like just what austen heller called him an exquisite bastard he winced he remembered where he had heard austen heller say that the memory of catherine seemed heavy and vulgar in the presence of the thin white hand he saw hanging over the arm of the chair before him but i mean he asked whats he like in person i dont know ive never met him you havent no oh ive heard hes so interesting undoubtedly when im in a mood for something decadent ill probably meet him do you know toohey oh she said he saw what he had seen in her eyes before and he did not like the sweet gaiety of her voice oh ellsworth toohey of course i know him hes wonderful hes a man i always enjoy talking to hes such a perfect blackguard why miss francon youre the first person whos ever im not trying to shock you i meant all of it i admire him hes so complete you dont meet perfection often in this world one way or the other do you and hes just that sheer perfection in his own way everyone else is so unfinished broken up into so many different pieces that dont fit together but not toohey hes a monolith sometimes when i feel bitter against the world i find consolation in thinking that its all right that ill be avenged that the world will get whats coming to it because theres ellsworth toohey what do you want to be avenged for she looked at him her eyelids lifted for a moment so that her eyes did not seem rectangular but soft and clear that was very clever of you she said that was the first clever thing youve said why because you knew what to pick out of all the rubbish i uttered so ill have to answer you id like to be avenged for the fact that i have nothing to be avenged for now lets go on about ellsworth toohey well ive always heard from everybody that hes a sort of saint the one pure idealist utterly incorruptible and thats quite true a plain grafter would be much safer but toohey is like a testing stone for people you can learn about them by the way they take him why what do you actually mean she leaned back in her chair and stretched her arms down to her knees twisting her wrists palms out the fingers of her two hands entwined she laughed easily nothing that one should make a subject of discussion at a tea party kikis right she hates the sight of me but shes got to invite me once in a while and i cant resist coming because shes so obvious about not wanting me you know i told ralston tonight what i really thought of his capitol but he wouldnt believe me he only beamed and said that i was a very nice little girl well arent you what a very nice little girl no not today ive made you thoroughly uncomfortable so ill make up for it ill tell you what i think of you because youll be worrying about that i think youre smart and safe and obvious and quite ambitious and youll get away with it and i like you ill tell father that i approve of his right hand very much so you see you have nothing to fear from the bosss daughter though it would be better if i didnt say anything to father because my recommendation would work the other way with him may i tell you only one thing that i think about you certainly any number of them i think it would have been better if you hadnt told me that you liked me then i would have had a better chance of its being true she laughed if you understand that she said then well get along beautifully then it might even be true gordon l prescott appeared in the arch of the ballroom glass in hand he wore a gray suit and a turtleneck sweater of silver wool his boyish face looked freshly scrubbed and he had his usual air of soap tooth paste and the outdoors dominique darling he cried waving his glass hello keating he added curtly dominique where have you been hiding yourself i heard you were here and ive had a hell of a time looking for you hello gordon she said she said it quite correctly there was nothing offensive in the quiet politeness of her voice but following his high note of enthusiasm her voice struck a tone that seemed flat and deadly in its indifference as if the two sounds mingled into an audible counterpoint around the melodic thread of her contempt prescott had not heard darling he said you look lovelier every time i see you one wouldnt think it were possible seventh time said dominique what seventh time that youve said it when meeting me gordon im counting them you simply wont be serious dominique youll never be serious oh yes gordon i was just having a very serious conversation here with my friend peter keating a lady waved to prescott and he accepted the opportunity escaping looking very foolish and keating delighted in the thought that she had dismissed another man for a conversation she wished to continue with her friend peter keating but when he turned to her she asked sweetly what was it we were talking about mr keating and then she was staring with too great an interest across the room at the wizened figure of a little man coughing over a whisky glass why said keating we were oh theres eugene pettingill my great favorite i must say hello to eugene and she was up moving across the room her body leaning back as she walked moving toward the most unattractive septuagenarian present keating did not know whether he had been made to join the brotherhood of gordon l prescott or whether it had been only an accident he returned to the ballroom reluctantly he forced himself to join groups of guests and to talk he watched dominique francon as she moved through the crowd as she stopped in conversation with others she never glanced at him again he could not decide whether he had succeeded with her or failed miserably he managed to be at the door when she was leaving she stopped and smiled at him enchantingly no she said before he could utter a word you cant take me home i have a car waiting thank you just the same she was gone and he stood at the door helpless and thinking furiously that he believed he was blushing he felt a soft hand on his shoulder and turned to find francon beside him going home peter let me give you a lift but i thought you had to be at the club by seven oh thats all right ill be a little late doesnt matter ill drive you home no trouble at all there was a peculiar expression of purpose on francons face quite unusual for him and unbecoming keating followed him silently amused and said nothing when they were alone in the comfortable twilight of francons car well francon asked ominously keating smiled youre a pig guy you dont know how to appreciate what youve got why didnt you tell me shes the most beautiful woman ive ever seen oh yes said francon darkly maybe thats the trouble what trouble where do you see any trouble what do you really think of her peter forget the looks youll see how quickly youll forget that what do you think well i think she has a great deal of character thanks for the understatement francon was gloomily silent and then he said with an awkward little note of something like hope in his voice you know peter i was surprised i watched you and you had quite a long chat with her thats amazing i fully expected her to chase you away with one nice poisonous crack maybe you could get along with her after all ive concluded that you just cant tell anything about her maybe you know peter what i wanted to tell you is this dont pay any attention to what she said about my wanting you to be horrible with her the heavy earnestness of that sentence was such a hint that keatings lips moved to shape a soft whistle but he caught himself in time francon added heavily i dont want you to be horrible with her at all you know guy said keating in a tone of patronizing reproach you shouldnt have run away like that i never know how to speak to her he sighed ive never learned to i cant understand what in blazes is the matter with her but something is she just wont behave like a human being you know shes been expelled from two finishing schools how she ever got through college i cant imagine but i can tell you that i dreaded to open my mail for four solid years waiting for word of the inevitable then i thought well once shes on her own im through and i dont have to worry about it but shes worse than ever what do you find to worry about i dont i try not to im glad when i dont have to think of her at all i cant help it i just wasnt cut out for a father but sometimes i get to feel that its my responsibility after all though god knows i dont want it but still there it is i should do something about it theres no one else to assume it youve let her frighten you guy and really theres nothing to be afraid of you dont think so no maybe youre the man to handle her i dont regret your meeting her now and you know that i didnt want you to yes i think youre the one man who could handle her you youre quite determined arent you peter when youre after something well said keating throwing one hand up in a careless gesture im not afraid very often then he leaned back against the cushions as if he were tired as if he had heard nothing of importance and he kept silent for the rest of the drive francon kept silent also boys said john erik snyte dont spare yourselves on this its the most important thing weve had this year not much money you understand but the prestige the connections if we do land it wont some of those great architects turn green you see austen heller has told me frankly that were the third firm hes approached he would have none of what those big fellows tried to sell him so its up to us boys you know something different unusual but in good taste and you know different now do your best his five designers sat in a semicircle before him gothic looked bored and miscellaneous looked discouraged in advance renaissance was following the course of a fly on the ceiling roark asked what did he actually say mr snyte snyte shrugged and looked at roark with amusement as if he and roark shared a shameful secret about the new client not worth mentioning nothing that makes great sense quite between us boys said snyte he was somewhat inarticulate considering his great command of the english language in print he admitted he knew nothing about architecture he didnt say whether he wanted it modernistic or period or what he said something to the effect that he wanted a house of his own but hes hesitated for a long time about building one because all houses look alike to him and they all look like hell and he doesnt see how anyone can become enthusiastic about any house and yet he has the idea that he wants a building he could love a building that would mean something is what he said though he added that he didnt know what or how there thats about all he said not much to go on and i wouldnt have undertaken to submit sketches if it werent austen heller but i grant you that it doesnt make sense whats the matter roark nothing said roark this ended the first conference on the subject of a residence for austen heller later that day snyte crowded his five designers into a train and they went to connecticut to see the site heller had chosen they stood on a lonely rocky stretch of shore three miles beyond an unfashionable little town they munched sandwiches and peanuts and they looked at a cliff rising in broken ledges from the ground to end in a straight brutal naked drop over the sea a vertical shaft of rock forming a cross with the long pale horizontal of the sea there said snyte thats it he twirled a pencil in his hand damnable eh he sighed i tried to suggest a more respectable location but he didnt take it so well so i had to shut up he twirled the pencil thats where he wants the house right on top of that rock he scratched the tip of his nose with the point of the pencil i tried to suggest setting it farther back from the shore and keeping the damn rock for a view but that didnt go so well either he bit the eraser between the tips of his teeth just think of the blasting the leveling ones got to do on that top he cleaned his fingernail with the lead leaving a black mark well thats that observe the grade and the quality of the stone the approach will be difficult i have all the surveys and the photographs in the office well whos got a cigarette well i think thats about all ill help you with suggestions anytime well what time is that damn train back thus the five designers were started on their task four of them proceeded immediately at their drawing boards roark returned alone to the site many times roarks five months with snyte stretched behind him like a blank had he wished to ask himself what he had felt he would have found no answer save in the fact that he remembered nothing of these months he could remember each sketch he had made he could if he tried remember what had happened to those sketches he did not try but he had not loved any of them as he loved the house of austen heller he stayed in the drafting room through evening after evening alone with a sheet of paper and the thought of a cliff over the sea no one saw his sketches until they were finished when they were finished late one night he sat at his table with the sheets spread before him sat for many hours one hand propping his forehead the other hanging by his side blood gathering in the fingers numbing them while the street beyond the window became deep blue then pale gray he did not look at the sketches he felt empty and very tired the house on the sketches had been designed not by roark but by the cliff on which it stood it was as if the cliff had grown and completed itself and proclaimed the purpose for which it had been waiting the house was broken into many levels following the ledges of the rock rising as it rose in gradual masses in planes flowing together up into one consummate harmony the walls of the same granite as the rock continued its vertical lines upward the wide projecting terraces of concrete silver as the sea followed the line of the waves of the straight horizon roark was still sitting at his table when the men returned to begin their day in the drafting room then the sketches were sent to snytes office two days later the final version of the house to be submitted to austen heller the version chosen and edited by john erik snyte executed by the chinese artist lay swathed in tissue paper on a table it was roarks house his competitors had been eliminated it was roarks house but its walls were now of red brick its windows were cut to conventional size and equipped with green shutters two of its projecting wings were omitted the great cantilevered terrace over the sea was replaced by a little wroughtiron balcony and the house was provided with an entrance of ionic columns supporting a broken pediment and with a little spire supporting a weather vane john erik snyte stood by the table his two hands spread in the air over the sketch without touching the virgin purity of its delicate colors that is what mr heller had in mind im sure he said pretty good yes pretty good roark how many times do i have to ask you not to smoke around a final sketch stand away youll get ashes on it austen heller was expected at twelve oclock but at half past eleven mrs symington arrived unannounced and demanded to see mr snyte immediately mrs symington was an imposing dowager who had just moved into her new residence designed by mr snyte besides snyte expected a commission for an apartment house from her brother he could not refuse to see her and he bowed her into his office where she proceeded to state without reticence of expression that the ceiling of her library had cracked and the bay windows of her drawing room were hidden under a perpetual veil of moisture which she could not combat snyte summoned his chief engineer and they launched together into detailed explanations apologies and damnations of contractors mrs symington showed no sign of relenting when a signal buzzed on snytes desk and the reception clerks voice announced austen heller it would have been impossible to ask mrs symington to leave or austen heller to wait snyte solved the problem by abandoning her to the soothing speech of his engineer and excusing himself for a moment then he emerged into the reception room shook hellers hand and suggested would you mind stepping into the drafting room mr heller better light in there you know and the sketch is all ready for you and i didnt want to take the chance of moving it heller did not seem to mind he followed snyte obediently into the drafting room a tall broadshouldered figure in english tweeds with sandy hair and a square face drawn in countless creases around the ironical calm of the eyes the sketch lay on the chinese artists table and the artist stepped aside diffidently in silence the next table was roarks he stood with his back to heller he went on with his drawing and did not turn the employees had been trained not to intrude on the occasions when snyte brought a client into the drafting room snytes fingertips lifted the tissue paper as if raising the veil of a bride then he stepped back and watched hellers face heller bent down and stood hunched drawn intent saying nothing for a long time listen mr snyte he began at last listen i think and stopped snyte waited patiently pleased sensing the approach of something he didnt want to disturb this said heller suddenly loudly slamming his fist down on the drawing and snyte winced this is the nearest anyones ever come to it i knew youd like it mr heller said snyte i dont said heller snyte blinked and waited its so near somehow said heller regretfully but its not right i dont know where but its not do forgive me if this sounds vague but i like things at once or i dont i know that i wouldnt be comfortable for instance with that entrance its a lovely entrance but you wont even notice it because youve seen it so often ah but allow me to point out a few considerations mr heller one wants to be modern of course but one wants to preserve the appearance of a home a combination of stateliness and coziness you understand a very austere house like this must have a few softening touches it is strictly correct architecturally no doubt said heller i wouldnt know about that ive never been strictly correct in my life just let me explain this scheme and youll see that its i know said heller wearily i know im sure youre right only his voice had a sound of the eagerness he wished he could feel only if it had some unity some some central idea which is there and isnt if it seemed to live which it doesnt it lacks something and it has too much if it were cleaner more clearcut whats the word ive heard used if it were integrated roark turned he was at the other side of the table he seized the sketch his hand flashed forward and a pencil ripped across the drawing slashing raw black lines over the untouchable watercolor the lines blasted off the ionic columns the pediment the entrance the spire the blinds the bricks they flung up two wings of stone they rent the windows wide they splintered the balcony and hurled a terrace over the sea it was being done before the others had grasped the moment when it began then snyte jumped forward but heller seized his wrist and stopped him roarks hand went on razing walls splitting rebuilding in furious strokes roark threw his head up once for a flash of a second to look at heller across the table it was all the introduction they needed it was like a handshake roark went on and when he threw the pencil down the house as he had designed it stood completed in an ordered pattern of black streaks the performance had not lasted five minutes snyte made an attempt at a sound as heller said nothing snyte felt free to whirl on roark and scream youre fired god damn you get out of here youre fired were both fired said austen heller winking to roark come on have you had any lunch lets go some place i want to talk to you roark went to his locker to get his hat and coat the drafting room witnessed a stupefying act and all work stopped to watch it austen heller picked up the sketch folded it over four times cracking the sacred cardboard and slipped it into his pocket but mr heller snyte stammered let me explain its perfectly all right if thats what you want well do the sketch over let me explain not now said heller not now he added at the door ill send you a check then heller was gone and roark with him and the door as heller swung it shut behind them sounded like the closing paragraph in one of hellers articles roark had not said a word in the softly lighted booth of the most expensive restaurant that roark had ever entered across the crystal and silver glittering between them heller was saying because thats the house i want because thats the house ive always wanted can you build it for me draw up the plans and supervise the construction yes said roark how long will it take if we start at once about eight months ill have the house by late fall yes just like that sketch just like that look i have no idea what kind of a contract one makes with an architect and you must know so draw up one and let my lawyer okay it this afternoon will you yes heller studied the man who sat facing him he saw the hand lying on the table before him hellers awareness became focused on that hand he saw the long fingers the sharp joints the prominent veins he had the feeling that he was not hiring this man but surrendering himself into his employment how old are you asked heller whoever you are twentysix do you want any references hell no i have them here in my pocket whats your name howard roark heller produced a checkbook spread it open on the table and reached for his fountain pen look he said writing ill give you five hundred dollars on account get yourself an office or whatever you have to get and go ahead he tore off the check and handed it to roark between the tips of two straight fingers leaning forward on his elbow swinging his wrist in a sweeping curve his eyes were narrowed amused watching roark quizzically but the gesture had the air of a salute the check was made out to howard roark architect howard roark opened his own office it was one large room on the top of an old building with a broad window high over the roofs he could see the distant band of the hudson at his window sill with the small streaks of ships moving under his fingertips when he pressed them to the glass he had a desk two chairs and a huge drafting table the glass entrance door bore the words howard roark architect he stood in the hall for a long time looking at the words then he went in and slammed his door he picked up a tsquare from the table and flung it down again as if throwing an anchor john erik snyte had objected when roark came to the office for his drawing instruments snyte emerged into the reception room shook his hand warmly and said well roark well how are you come in come right in i want to speak to you and with roark seated before his desk snyte proceeded loudly look fellow i hope youve got sense enough not to hold it against me anything that i mightve said yesterday you know how it is i lost my head a little and it wasnt what you did but that you had to go and do it on that sketch that sketch well never mind no hard feelings no said roark none at all of course youre not fired you didnt take me seriously did you you can go right back to work here this very minute what for mr snyte what do you mean what for oh youre thinking of the heller house but youre not taking heller seriously are you you saw how he is that madman can change his mind sixty times a minute he wont really give you that commission you know it isnt as simple as that it isnt being done that way weve signed the contract yesterday oh you have well thats splendid well look roark ill tell you what well do you bring the commission back to us and ill let you put your name on it with mine john erik snyte howard roark and well split the fee thats in addition to your salary and youre getting a raise incidentally then well have the same arrangement on any other commission you bring in and lord man what are you laughing at excuse me mr snyte im sorry i dont believe you understand said snyte bewildered dont you see its your insurance you dont want to break loose just yet commissions wont fall into your lap like this then what will you do this way youll have a steady job and youll be building toward independent practice if thats what youre after in four or five years youll be ready to take the leap thats the way everybody does it you see yes then you agree no but good lord man youve lost your mind to set up alone now without experience without connections without well without anything at all i never heard of such a thing ask anybody in the profession see what theyll tell you its preposterous probably listen roark wont you please listen ill listen if you want me to mr snyte but i think i should tell you now that nothing you can say will make any difference if you dont mind that i dont mind listening snyte went on speaking for a long time and roark listened without objecting explaining or answering well if thats how you are dont expect me to take you back when you find yourself on the pavement i dont expect it mr snyte dont expect anyone else in the profession to take you in after they hear what youve done to me i dont expect that either for a few days snyte thought of suing roark and heller but he decided against it because there was no precedent to follow under the circumstances because heller had paid him for his efforts and the house had been actually designed by roark and because no one ever sued austen heller the first visitor to roarks office was peter keating he walked in without warning one noon walked straight across the room and sat down on roarks desk smiling gaily spreading his arms wide in a sweeping gesture well howard he said well fancy that he had not seen roark for a year hello peter said roark your own office your own name and everything already just imagine who told you peter oh one hears things you wouldnt expect me not to keep track of your career now would you you know what ive always thought of you and i dont have to tell you that i congratulate you and wish you the very best no you dont have to nice place you got here light and roomy not quite as imposing as it should be perhaps but what can one expect at the beginning and then the prospects are uncertain arent they howard quite its an awful chance that youve taken probably are you really going to go through with it i mean on your own looks that way doesnt it well its not too late you know i thought when i heard the story that youd surely turn it over to snyte and make a smart deal with him i didnt arent you really going to no keating wondered why he should experience that sickening feeling of resentment why he had come here hoping to find the story untrue hoping to find roark uncertain and willing to surrender that feeling had haunted him ever since hed heard the news about roark the sensation of something unpleasant that remained after hed forgotten the cause the feeling would come back to him without reason a blank wave of anger and he would ask himself now what the hell what was it i heard today then he would remember oh yes roark roarks opened his own office he would ask himself impatiently so what and know at the same time that the words were painful to face and humiliating like an insult you know howard i admire your courage really you know ive had much more experience and ive got more of a standing in the profession dont mind my saying it im only speaking objectively but i wouldnt dare take such a step no you wouldnt so youve made the jump first well well who would have thought it i wish you all the luck in the world thank you peter i know youll succeed im sure of it are you of course of course i am arent you i havent thought of it you havent thought of it not much then youre not sure howard you arent why do you ask that so eagerly what why no not eagerly but of course im concerned howard its bad psychology not to be certain now in your position so you have doubts none at all but you said im quite sure of things peter have you thought about getting your registration ive applied for it youve got no college degree you know theyll make it difficult for you at the examination probably what are you going to do if you dont get the license ill get it well i guess ill be seeing you now at the aga if you dont go high hat on me because youll be a fullfledged member and im only a junior im not joining the aga what do you mean youre not joining youre eligible now possibly youll be invited to join tell them not to bother what you know peter we had a conversation just like this seven years ago when you tried to talk me into joining your fraternity at stanton dont start it again you wont join the aga when you have a chance to i wont join anything peter at any time but dont you realize how it helps in what in being an architect i dont like to be helped in being an architect youre just making things harder for yourself i am and it will be plenty hard you know i know youll make enemies of them if you refuse such an invitation ill make enemies of them anyway the first person to whom roark had told the news was henry cameron roark went to new jersey the day after he signed the contract with heller it had rained and he found cameron in the garden shuffling slowly down the damp paths leaning heavily on a cane in the past winter cameron had improved enough to walk a few hours each day he walked with effort his body bent he looked at the first shoots of green on the earth under his feet he lifted his cane once in a while bracing his legs to stand firm for a moment with the tip of the cane he touched a folded green cup and watched it spill a glistening drop in the twilight he saw roark coming up the hill and frowned he had seen roark only a week ago and because these visits meant too much to both of them neither wished the occasion to be too frequent well cameron asked gruffly what do you want here again i have something to tell you it can wait i dont think so well im opening my own office ive just signed for my first building cameron rotated his cane the tip pressed into the earth the shaft describing a wide circle his two hands bearing down on the handle the palm of one on the back of the other his head nodded slowly in rhythm with the motion for a long time his eyes closed then he looked at roark and said well dont brag about it he added help me to sit down it was the first time cameron had ever pronounced this sentence his sister and roark had long since learned that the one outrage forbidden in his presence was any intention of helping him to move roark took his elbow and led him to a bench cameron asked harshly staring ahead at the sunset what for whom how much he listened silently to roarks story he looked for a long time at the sketch on cracked cardboard with the pencil lines over the watercolor then he asked many questions about the stone the steel the roads the contractors the costs he offered no congratulations he made no comment only when roark was leaving cameron said suddenly howard when you open your office take snapshots of it and show them to me then he shook his head looked away guiltily and swore im being senile forget it roark said nothing three days later he came back youre getting to be a nuisance said cameron roark handed him an envelope without a word cameron looked at the snapshots at the one of the broad bare office of the wide window of the entrance door he dropped the others and held the one of the entrance door for a long time well he said at last i did live to see it he dropped the snapshot not quite exactly he added not in the way i had wanted to but i did its like the shadows some say well see of the earth in that other world maybe thats how ill see the rest of it im learning he picked up the snapshot howard he said look at it he held it between them it doesnt say much only howard roark architect but its like those mottoes men carved over the entrance of a castle and died for its a challenge in the face of something so vast and so dark that all the pain on earth and do you know how much suffering there is on earth all the pain comes from that thing you are going to face i dont know what it is i dont know why it should be unleashed against you i know only that it will be and i know that if you carry these words through to the end it will be a victory howard not just for you but for something that should win that moves the world and never wins acknowledgment it will vindicate so many who have fallen before you who have suffered as you will suffer may god bless you or whoever it is that is alone to see the best the highest possible to human hearts youre on your way into hell howard roark walked up the path to the top of the cliff where the steel hulk of the heller house rose into a blue sky the skeleton was up and the concrete was being poured the great mats of the terraces hung over the silver sheet of water quivering far below plumbers and electricians had started laying their conduits he looked at the squares of sky delimited by the slender lines of girders and columns the empty cubes of space he had torn out of the sky his hands moved involuntarily filling in the planes of walls to come enfolding the future rooms a stone clattered from under his feet and went bouncing down the hill resonant drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of the summer air he stood on the summit his legs planted wide apart leaning back against space he looked at the materials before him the knobs of rivets in steel the sparks in blocks of stone the weaving spirals in fresh yellow planks then he saw a husky figure enmeshed in electric wires a bulldog face spreading into a huge grin and chinablue eyes gloating in a kind of unholy triumph mike he said incredulously mike had left for a big job in philadelphia months ago long before the appearance of heller in snytes office and mike had never heard the news or so he supposed hello red said mike much too casually and added hello boss mike how did you youre a hell of an architect neglecting the job like that its my third day here waiting for you to show up mike how did you get here why such a comedown he had never known mike to bother with small private residences dont play the sap you know how i got here you didnt think id miss it your first house did you and you think its a comedown well maybe it is and maybe its the other way around roark extended his hand and mikes grimy fingers closed about it ferociously as if the smudges he left implanted in roarks skin said everything he wanted to say and because he was afraid that he might say it mike growled run along boss run along dont clog up the works like that roark walked through the house there were moments when he could be precise impersonal and stop to give instructions as if this were not his house but only a mathematical problem when he felt the existence of pipes and rivets while his own person vanished there were moments when something rose within him not a thought nor a feeling but a wave of some physical violence and then he wanted to stop to lean back to feel the reality of his person heightened by the frame of steel that rose dimly about the bright outstanding existence of his body as its center he did not stop he went on calmly but his hands betrayed what he wanted to hide his hands reached out ran slowly down the beams and joints the workers in the house had noticed it they said that guys in love with the thing he cant keep his hands off the workers liked him the contractors superintendents did not he had had trouble in finding a contractor to erect the house several of the better firms had refused the commission we dont do that kinda stuff nan we wont bother too complicated for a small job like that who the hell wants that kind of house most likely well never collect from the crank afterwards to hell with it never did anything like it wouldnt know how to go about it ill stick to construction that is construction one contractor had looked at the plans briefly and thrown them aside declaring with finality it wont stand it will said roark the contractor drawled indifferently yeah and who are you to tell me mister he had found a small firm that needed the work and undertook it charging more than the job warranted on the ground of the chance they were taking with a queer experiment the construction went on and the foremen obeyed sullenly in disapproving silence as if they were waiting for their predictions to come true and would be glad when the house collapsed about their heads roark had bought an old ford and drove down to the job more often than was necessary it was difficult to sit at a desk in his office to stand at a table forcing himself to stay away from the construction site at the site there were moments when he wished to forget his office and his drawing board to seize the mens tools and go to work on the actual erection of the house as he had worked in his childhood to build that house with his own hands he walked through the structure stepping lightly over piles of planks and coils of wire he made notes he gave brief orders in a harsh voice he avoided looking in mikes direction but mike was watching him following his progress through the house mike winked at him in understanding whenever he passed by mike said once control yourself red youre open like a book god its indecent to be so happy roark stood on the cliff by the structure and looked at the countryside at the long gray ribbon of the road twisting past along the shore an open car drove by fleeing into the country the car was overfilled with people bound for a picnic there was a jumble of bright sweaters and scarves fluttering in the wind a jumble of voices shrieking without purpose over the roar of the motor and overstressed hiccoughs of laughter a girl sat sidewise her legs flung over the side of the car she wore a mans straw hat slipping down to her nose and she yanked savagely at the strings of a ukulele ejecting raucous sounds yelling hey these people were enjoying a day of their existence they were shrieking to the sky their release from the work and the burdens of the days behind them they had worked and carried the burdens in order to reach a goal and this was the goal he looked at the car as it streaked past he thought that there was a difference some important difference between the consciousness of this day in him and in them he thought that he should try to grasp it but he forgot he was looking at a truck panting up the hill loaded with a glittering mound of cut granite austen heller came to look at the house frequently and watched it grow curious still a little astonished he studied roark and the house with the same meticulous scrutiny he felt as if he could not quite tell them apart heller the fighter against compulsion was baffled by roark a man so impervious to compulsion that he became a kind of compulsion himself an ultimatum against things heller could not define within a week heller knew that he had found the best friend he would ever have and he knew that the friendship came from roarks fundamental indifference in the deeper reality of roarks existence there was no consciousness of heller no need for heller no appeal no demand heller felt a line drawn which he could not touch beyond that line roark asked nothing of him and granted him nothing but when roark looked at him with approval when roark smiled when roark praised one of his articles heller felt the strangely clean joy of a sanction that was neither a bribe nor alms in the summer evenings they sat together on a ledge halfway up the hill and talked while darkness mounted slowly up the beams of the house above them the last sunrays retreating to the tips of the steel uprights what is it that i like so much about the house youre building for me howard a house can have integrity just like a person said roark and just as seldom in what way well look at it every piece of it is there because the house needs it and for no other reason you see it from here as it is inside the rooms in which youll live made the shape the relation of masses was determined by the distribution of space within the ornament was determined by the method of construction an emphasis of the principle that makes it stand you can see each stress each support that meets it your own eyes go through a structural process when you look at the house you can follow each step you see it rise you know what made it and why it stands but youve seen buildings with columns that support nothing with purposeless cornices with pilasters moldings false arches false windows youve seen buildings that look as if they contained a single large hall they have solid columns and single solid windows six floors high but you enter and find six stories inside or buildings that contain a single hall but with a facade cut up into floor lines band courses tiers of windows do you understand the difference your house is made by its own needs those others are made by the need to impress the determining motive of your house is in the house the determining motive of the others is in the audience do you know that thats what ive felt in a way ive felt that when i move into this house ill have a new sort of existence and even my simple daily routine will have a kind of honesty or dignity that i cant quite define dont be astonished if i tell you that i feel as if ill have to live up to that house i intended that said roark and incidentally thank you for all the thought you seem to have taken about my comfort there are so many things i notice that had never occurred to me before but youve planned them as if you knew all my needs for instance my study is the room ill need most and youve given it the dominant spot and incidentally i see where youve made it the dominant mass from the outside too and then the way it connects with the library and the living room well out of my way and the guest rooms where i wont hear too much of them and all that you were very considerate of me you know said roark i havent thought of you at all i thought of the house he added perhaps thats why i knew how to be considerate of you the heller house was completed in november of in january of the architectural tribune published a survey of the best american homes erected during the past year it devoted twelve large glossy pages to photographs of the twentyfour houses its editors had selected as the worthiest architectural achievements the heller house was not mentioned the realestate sections of the new york papers presented each sunday brief accounts of the notable new residences in the vicinity there was no account of the heller house the year book of the architects guild of america which presented magnificent reproductions of what it chose as the best buildings of the country under the title looking forward gave no reference to the heller house there were many occasions when lecturers rose to platforms and addressed trim audiences on the subject of the progress of american architecture no one spoke of the heller house in the club rooms of the aga some opinions were expressed its a disgrace to the country said ralston holcombe that a thing like that heller house is allowed to be erected its a blot on the profession there ought to be a law thats what drives clients away said john erik snyte they see a house like that and they think all architects are crazy i see no cause for indignation said gordon l prescott i think its screamingly funny it looks like a cross between a filling station and a comicstrip idea of a rocket ship to the moon you watch it in a couple of years said eugene pettingill and see what happens the thingll collapse like a house of cards why speak in terms of years said guy francon those modernistic stunts never last more than a season the owner will get good and sick of it and hell come running home to a good old early colonial the heller house acquired fame throughout the countryside surrounding it people drove out of their way to park on the road before it to stare point and giggle gasstation attendants snickered when hellers car drove past hellers cook had to endure the derisive glances of shopkeepers when she went on her errands the heller house was known in the neighborhood as the booby hatch peter keating told his friends in the profession with an indulgent smile now now you shouldnt say that about him ive known howard roark for a long time and hes got quite a talent quite hes even worked for me once hes just gone haywire on that house hell learn he has a future oh you dont think he has you really dont think he has ellsworth m toohey who let no stone spring from the ground of america without his comment did not know that the heller house had been erected as far as his column was concerned he did not consider it necessary to inform his readers about it if only to damn it he said nothing a column entitled observations and meditations by alvah scarret appeared daily on the front page of the new york banner it was a trusted guide a source of inspiration and a molder of public philosophy in small towns throughout the country in this column there had appeared years ago the famous statement wed all be a heap sight better off if wed forget the highfalutin notions of our fancy civilization and mind more what the savages knew long before us to honor our mother alvah scarret was a bachelor had made two millions dollars played golf expertly and was editorinchief of the wynand papers it was alvah scarret who conceived the idea of the campaign against living conditions in the slums and landlord sharks which ran in the banner for three weeks this was material such as alvah scarret relished it had human appeal and social implications it lent itself to sundaysupplement illustrations of girls leaping into rivers their skirts flaring well above their knees it boosted circulation it embarrassed the sharks who owned a stretch of blocks by the east river selected as the dire example of the campaign the sharks had refused to sell these blocks to an obscure realestate company at the end of the campaign they surrendered and sold no one could prove that the realestate company was owned by a company owned by gail wynand the wynand papers could not be left without a campaign for long they had just concluded one on the subject of modern aviation they had run scientific accounts of the history of aviation in the sunday family magazine supplement with pictures ranging from leonardo da vincis drawings of flying machines to the latest bomber with the added attraction of icarus writhing in scarlet flames his nude body bluegreen his wax wings yellow and the smoke purple also of a leprous hag with flaming eyes and a crystal ball who had predicted in the xith century that man would fly also of bats vampires and werewolves they had run a model plane construction contest it was open to all boys under the age of ten who wished to send in three new subscriptions to the banner gail wynand who was a licensed pilot had made a solo flight from los angeles to new york establishing a transcontinental speed record in a small specially built craft costing one hundred thousand dollars he had made a slight miscalculation on reaching new york and had been forced to land in a rocky pasture it had been a hairraising landing faultlessly executed it had just so happened that a battery of photographers from the banner were present in the neighborhood gail wynand had stepped out of the plane an ace pilot would have been shaken by the experience gail wynand had stood before the cameras an immaculate gardenia in the lapel of his flying jacket his hand raised with a cigarette held between two fingers that did not tremble when questioned about his first wish on returning to earth he had expressed the desire to kiss the most attractive woman present had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the crowd and bent to kiss her gravely on the forehead explaining that she reminded him of his mother later at the start of the slum campaign gail wynand had said to alvah scarret go ahead squeeze all you can out of the thing and had departed on his yacht for a world cruise accompanied by an enchanting aviatrix of twentyfour to whom he had made a present of his transcontinental plane alvah scarret went ahead among many other steps of his campaign he assigned dominique francon to investigate the condition of homes in the slums and to gather human material dominique francon had just returned from a summer in biarritz she always took a whole summers vacation and alvah scarret granted it because she was one of his favorite employees because he was baffled by her and because he knew that she could quit her job whenever she pleased dominique francon went to live for two weeks in the hall bedroom of an eastside tenement the room had a skylight but no windows there were five flights of stairs to climb and no running water she cooked her own meals in the kitchen of a numerous family on the floor below she visited neighbors she sat on the landings of fire escapes in the evenings and went to dime movies with the girls of the neighborhood she wore frayed skirts and blouses the abnormal fragility of her normal appearance made her look exhausted with privation in these surroundings the neighbors felt certain that she had tb but she moved as she had moved in the drawing room of kiki holcombe with the same cold poise and confidence she scrubbed the floor of her room she peeled potatoes she bathed in a tin pan of cold water she had never done these things before she did them expertly she had a capacity for action a competence that clashed incongruously with her appearance she did not mind this new background she was indifferent to the slums as she had been indifferent to the drawing rooms at the end of two weeks she returned to her penthouse apartment on the roof of a hotel over central park and her articles on life in the slums appeared in the banner they were a merciless brilliant account she heard baffled questions at a dinner party my dear you didnt actually write those things dominique you didnt really live in that place oh yes she answered the house you own on east twelfth street mrs palmer she said her hand circling lazily from under the cuff of an emerald bracelet too broad and heavy for her thin wrist has a sewer that gets clogged every other day and runs over all through the courtyard it looks blue and purple in the sun like a rainbow the block you control for the claridge estate mr brooks has the most attractive stalactites growing on all the ceilings she said her golden head leaning to her corsage of white gardenias with drops of water sparkling on the lusterless petals she was asked to speak at a meeting of social workers it was an important meeting with a militant radical mood led by some of the most prominent women in the field alvah scarret was pleased and gave her his blessing go to it kid he said lay it on thick we want the social workers she stood in the speakers pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at a flat sheet of faces faces lecherously eager with the sense of their own virtue she spoke evenly without inflection she said among many other things the family on the first floor rear do not bother to pay their rent and the children cannot go to school for lack of clothes the father has a charge account at a corner speakeasy he is in good health and has a good job the couple on the second floor have just purchased a radio for sixtynine dollars and ninetyfive cents cash in the fourth floor front the father of the family has not done a whole days work in his life and does not intend to there are nine children supported by the local parish there is a tenth one on its way when she finished there were a few claps of angry applause she raised her hand and said you dont have to applaud i dont expect it she asked politely are there any questions there were no questions when she returned home she found alvah scarret waiting for her he looked incongruous in the drawing room of her penthouse his huge bulk perched on the edge of a delicate chair a hunched gargoyle against the glowing spread of the city beyond a solid wall of glass the city was like a mural designed to illuminate and complete the room the fragile lines of spires on a black sky continued the fragile lines of the furniture the lights glittering in distant windows threw reflections on the bare lustrous floor the cold precision of the angular structures outside answered the cold inflexible grace of every object within alvah scarret broke the harmony he looked like a kindly country doctor and like a cardsharp his heavy face bore the benevolent paternal smile that had always been his passkey and his trademark he had the knack of making the kindliness of his smile add to not detract from his solemn appearance of dignity his long thin hooked nose did detract from the kindliness but it added to the dignity his stomach cantilevered over his legs did detract from the dignity but it added to the kindliness he rose beamed and held dominiques hand thought id drop in on my way home he said ive got something to tell you how did it go kid as i expected it she tore her hat off and threw it down on the first chair in sight her hair slanted in a flat curve across her forehead and fell in a straight line to her shoulders it looked smooth and tight like a bathing cap of pale polished metal she walked to the window and stood looking out over the city she asked without turning what did you want to tell me alvah scarret watched her pleasurably he had long since given up any attempts beyond holding her hand when not necessary or patting her shoulder he had stopped thinking of the subject but he had a dim halfconscious feeling which he summed up to himself in the words you never can tell ive got good news for you child he said ive been working out a little scheme just a bit of reorganization and ive figured where ill consolidate a few things together into a womens welfare department you know the schools the home economics the care of babies the juvenile delinquents and all the rest of it all to be under one head and i see no better woman for the job than my little girl do you mean me she asked without turning no one else but just as soon as gail comes back ill get his okay she turned and looked at him her arms crossed her hands holding her elbows she said thank you alvah but i dont want it what do you mean you dont want it i mean that i dont want it for heavens sake do you realize what an advance that would be toward what your career i never said i was planning a career but you dont want to be running a dinky backpage column forever not forever until i get bored with it but think of what you could do in the real game think of what gail could do for you once you come to his attention i have no desire to come to his attention but dominique we need you the women will be for you solid after tonight i dont think so why ive ordered two columns held for a yarn on the meeting and your speech she reached for the telephone and handed the receiver to him she said youd better tell them to kill it why she searched through a litter of papers on a desk found some typewritten sheets and handed them to him heres the speech i made tonight she said he glanced through it he said nothing but clasped his forehead once then he seized the telephone and gave orders to run as brief an account of the meeting as possible and not to mention the speaker by name all right said dominique when he dropped the receiver am i fired he shook his head dolefully do you want to be not necessarily ill squash the business he muttered ill keep it from gail if you wish i dont really care one way or the other listen dominique oh i know im not to ask any questions only why on earth are you always doing things like that for no reason on earth look you know ive heard about that swank dinner where you made certain remarks on this same subject and then you go and say things like these at a radical meeting theyre true though both sides of it arent they oh sure but couldnt you have reversed the occasions when you chose to express them there wouldnt have been any point in that was there any in what youve done no none at all but it amused me i cant figure you out dominique youve done it before you go along so beautifully you do brilliant work and just when youre about to make a real step forward you spoil it by pulling something like this why perhaps that is precisely why will you tell me as a friend because i like you and im interested in you what are you really after i should think thats obvious im after nothing at all he spread his hands open shrugging helplessly she smiled gaily what is there to look so mournful about i like you too alvah and im interested in you i even like to talk to you which is better now sit still and relax and ill get you a drink you need a drink alvah she brought him a frosted glass with ice cubes ringing in the silence youre just a nice child dominique he said of course thats what i am she sat down on the edge of a table her hands flat behind her leaning back on two straight arms swinging her legs slowly she said you know alvah it would be terrible if i had a job i really wanted well of all things well of all fool things to say what do you mean just that that it would be terrible to have a job i enjoyed and did not want to lose why because i would have to depend on you youre a wonderful person alvah but not exactly inspiring and i dont think it would be beautiful to cringe before a whip in your hand oh dont protest it would be such a polite little whip and thats what would make it uglier i would have to depend on our boss gail hes a great man im sure only id just as soon never set eyes on him whatever gives you such a crazy attitude when you know that gail and i would do anything for you and i personally its not only that alvah its not you alone if i found a job a project an idea or a person i wanted id have to depend on the whole world everything has strings leading to everything else were all so tied together were all in a net the net is waiting and were pushed into it by one single desire you want a thing and its precious to you do you know who is standing ready to tear it out of your hands you cant know it may be so involved and so far away but someone is ready and youre afraid of them all and you cringe and you crawl and you beg and you accept them just so theyll let you keep it and look at whom you come to accept if im correct in gathering that youre criticizing mankind in general you know its such a peculiar thing our idea of mankind in general we all have a sort of vague glowing picture when we say that something solemn big and important but actually all we know of it is the people we meet in our lifetime look at them do you know any youd feel big and solemn about theres nothing but housewives haggling at pushcarts drooling brats who write dirty words on the sidewalks and drunken debutantes or their spiritual equivalent as a matter of fact one can feel some respect for people when they suffer they have a certain dignity but have you ever looked at them when theyre enjoying themselves thats when you see the truth look at those who spend the money theyve slaved for at amusement parks and side shows look at those whore rich and have the whole world open to them observe what they pick out for enjoyment watch them in the smarter speakeasies thats your mankind in general i dont want to touch it but hell thats not the way to look at it thats not the whole picture theres some good in the worst of us theres always a redeeming feature so much the worse is it an inspiring sight to see a man commit a heroic gesture and then learn that he goes to vaudeville shows for relaxation or see a man whos painted a magnificent canvas and learn that he spends his time sleeping with every slut he meets what do you want perfection or nothing so you see i take the nothing that doesnt make sense i take the only desire one can really permit oneself freedom alvah freedom you call that freedom to ask nothing to expect nothing to depend on nothing what if you found something you wanted i wont find it i wont choose to see it it would be part of that lovely world of yours id have to share it with all the rest of you and i wouldnt you know i never open again any great book ive read and loved it hurts me to think of the other eyes that have read it and of what they were things like that cant be shared not with people like that dominique its abnormal to feel so strongly about anything thats the only way i can feel or not at all dominique my dear he said with earnest sincere concern i wish id been your father what kind of a tragedy did you have in your childhood why none at all i had a wonderful childhood free and peaceful and not bothered too much by anybody well yes i did feel bored very often but im used to that i suppose youre just an unfortunate product of our times thats what ive always said were too cynical too decadent if we went back in all humility to the simple virtues alvah how can you start on that stuff thats only for your editorials and she stopped seeing his eyes they looked puzzled and a little hurt then she laughed im wrong you really do believe all that if its actually believing or whatever it is you do that takes its place oh alvah thats why i love you thats why im doing again right now what i did tonight at the meeting what he asked bewildered talking as i am talking to you as you are its nice talking to you about such things do you know alvah that primitive people made statues of their gods in mans likeness just think of what a statue of you would look like of you nude your stomach and all now whats that in relation to to nothing at all darling forgive me she added you know i love statues of naked men dont look so silly i said statues i had one in particular it was supposed to be helios i got it out of a museum in europe i had a terrible time getting it it wasnt for sale of course i think i was in love with it alvah i brought it home with me where is it id like to see something you like for a change its broken broken a museum piece how did that happen i broke it how i threw it down the air shaft theres a concrete floor below are you totally crazy why so that no one else would ever see it dominique she jerked her head as if to shake off the subject the straight mass of her hair stirred in a heavy ripple like a wave through a halfliquid pool of mercury she said im sorry darling i didnt want to shock you i thought i could speak to you because youre the one person whos impervious to any sort of shock i shouldnt have its no use i guess she jumped lightly off the table run on home alvah she said its getting late im tired see you tomorrow guy francon read his daughters articles he heard of the remarks she had made at the reception and at the meeting of social workers he understood nothing of it but he understood that it had been precisely the sequence of events to expect from his daughter it preyed on his mind with the bewildered feeling of apprehension which the thought of her always brought him he asked himself whether he actually hated his daughter but one picture came back to his mind irrelevantly whenever he asked himself that question it was a picture of her childhood of a day from some forgotten summer on his country estate in connecticut long ago he had forgotten the rest of that day and what had led to the one moment he remembered but he remembered how he stood on the terrace and saw her leaping over a high green hedge at the end of the lawn the hedge seemed too high for her little body he had time to think that she could not make it in the very moment when he saw her flying triumphantly over the green barrier he could not remember the beginning nor the end of that leap but he still saw clearly and sharply as on a square of movie film cut out and held motionless forever the one instant when her body hung in space her long legs flung wide her thin arms thrown up hands braced against the air her white dress and blond hair spread in two broad flat mats on the wind a single moment the flash of a small body in the greatest burst of ecstatic freedom he had ever witnessed in his life he did not know why that moment remained with him what significance unheeded at the time had preserved it for him when so much else of greater import had been lost he did not know why he had to see that moment again whenever he felt bitterness for his daughter nor why seeing it he felt that unbearable twinge of tenderness he told himself merely that his paternal affection was asserting itself quite against his will but in an awkward unthinking way he wanted to help her not knowing not wanting to know what she had to be helped against so he began to look more frequently at peter keating he began to accept the solution which he never quite admitted to himself he found comfort in the person of peter keating and he felt that keatings simple stable wholesomeness was just the support needed by the unhealthy inconstancy of his daughter keating would not admit that he had tried to see dominique again persistently and without results he had obtained her telephone number from francon long ago and he had called her often she had answered and laughed gaily and told him that of course shed see him she knew she wouldnt be able to escape it but she was so busy for weeks to come and would he give her a ring by the first of next month francon guessed it he told keating he would ask dominique to lunch and bring them together again that is he added ill try to ask her shell refuse of course dominique surprised him again she accepted promptly and cheerfully she met them at a restaurant and she smiled as if this were a reunion she welcomed she talked gaily and keating felt enchanted at ease wondering why he had ever feared her at the end of a half hour she looked at francon and said it was wonderful of you to take time off to see me father particularly when youre so busy and have so many appointments francons face assumed a look of consternation my god dominique that reminds me you have an appointment you forgot she asked gently confound it yes it slipped my mind entirely old andrew colson phoned this morning and i forgot to make a note of it and he insisted on seeing me at two oclock you know how it is i just simply cant refuse to see andrew colson confound it today of all he added suspiciously how did you know it why i didnt know it at all its perfectly all right father mr keating and i will excuse you and well have a lovely luncheon together and i have no appointments at all for the day so you dont have to be afraid that ill escape from him francon wondered whether she knew that that had been the excuse hed prepared in advance in order to leave her alone with keating he could not be sure she was looking straight at him her eyes seemed just a bit too candid he was glad to escape dominique turned to keating with a glance so gentle that it could mean nothing but contempt now lets relax she said we both know what father is after so its perfectly all right dont let it embarrass you it doesnt embarrass me its nice that youve got father on a leash but i know its not helpful to you to have him pulling ahead of the leash so lets forget it and eat our lunch he wanted to rise and walk out and knew in furious helplessness that he wouldnt she said dont frown peter you might as well call me dominique because well come to that anyway sooner or later ill probably see a great deal of you i see so many people and if it will please father to have you as one of them why not for the rest of the luncheon she spoke to him as to an old friend gaily and openly with a disquieting candor which seemed to show that there was nothing to conceal but showed that it was best to attempt no probe the exquisite kindliness of her manner suggested that their relationship was of no possible consequence that she could not pay him the tribute of hostility he knew that he disliked her violently but he watched the shape of her mouth the movements of her lips framing words he watched the way she crossed her legs a gesture smooth and exact like an expensive instrument being folded and he could not escape the feeling of incredulous admiration he had experienced when he had seen her for the first time when they were leaving she said will you take me to the theater tonight peter i dont care what play any one of them call for me after dinner tell father about it it will please him though of course he should know better than to be pleased said keating and so should i but ill be delighted just the same dominique why should you know better because you have no desire to go to a theater or to see me tonight none whatever im beginning to like you peter call for me at half past eight when keating returned to the office francon called him upstairs at once well francon asked anxiously whats the matter guy said keating his voice innocent why are you so concerned well i im just frankly im interested to see whether you two could get together at all i think youd be a good influence for her what happened nothing at all we had a lovely time you know your restaurants the food was wonderful oh yes im taking your daughter to a show tonight no why yes how did you ever manage that keating shrugged i told you one mustnt be afraid of dominique im not afraid but oh is it dominique already my congratulations peter im not afraid its only that i cant figure her out no one can approach her shes never had a single girl friend not even in kindergarten theres always a mob around her but never a friend i dont know what to think there she is now living all alone always with a crowd of men around and now guy you mustnt think anything dishonorable about your own daughter i dont thats just the trouble that i dont i wish i could but shes twentyfour peter and shes a virgin i know im sure of it cant you tell just by looking at a woman im no moralist peter and i think thats abnormal its unnatural at her age with her looks with the kind of utterly unrestricted existence that she leads i wish to god shed get married i honestly do well now dont repeat that of course and dont misinterpret it i didnt mean it as an invitation of course not by the way peter the hospital called while you were out they said poor lucius is much better they think hell pull through lucius n heyer had had a stroke and keating had exhibited a great deal of concern for his progress but had not gone to visit him at the hospital im so glad said keating but i dont think hell ever be able to come back to work hes getting old peter yes hes getting old one reaches an age when one cant be burdened with business any longer he let a paper knife hang between two fingers and tapped it pensively against the edge of a desk calendar it happens to all of us peter sooner or later one must look ahead keating sat on the floor by the imitation logs in the fireplace of his living room his hands clasped about his knees and listened to his mothers questions on what did dominique look like what did she wear what had she said to him and how much money did he suppose her mother had actually left her he was meeting dominique frequently now he had just returned from an evening spent with her on a round of night clubs she always accepted his invitations he wondered whether her attitude was a deliberate proof that she could ignore him more completely by seeing him often than by refusing to see him but each time he met her he planned eagerly for the next meeting he had not seen catherine for a month she was busy with research work which her uncle had entrusted to her in preparation for a series of his lectures mrs keating sat under a lamp mending a slight tear in the lining of peters dinner jacket reproaching him between questions for sitting on the floor in his dress trousers and best formal shirt he paid no attention to the reproaches or the questions but under his bored annoyance he felt an odd sense of relief as if the stubborn stream of her words were pushing him on and justifying him he answered once in a while yes no i dont know oh yes shes lovely shes very lovely its awfully late mother im tired i think ill go to bed the doorbell rang well said mrs keating what can that be at this hour keating rose shrugging and ambled to the door it was catherine she stood her two hands clasped on a large old shapeless pocketbook she looked determined and hesitant at once she drew back a little she said good evening peter can i come in ive got to speak to you katie of course how nice of you come right in mother its katie mrs keating looked at the girls feet which stepped as if moving on the rolling deck of a ship she looked at her son and she knew that something had happened to be handled with great caution good evening catherine she said softly keating was conscious of nothing save the sudden stab of joy he had felt on seeing her the joy told him that nothing had changed that he was safe in certainty that her presence resolved all doubts he forgot to wonder about the lateness of the hour about her first uninvited appearance in his apartment good evening mrs keating she said her voice bright and hollow i hope im not disturbing you its late probably is it why not at all child said mrs keating catherine hurried to speak senselessly hanging on to the sound of words ill just take my hat off where can i put it mrs keating here on the table would that be all right no maybe id better put it on this bureau though its a little damp from the street the hat is it might hurt the varnish its a nice bureau i hope it doesnt hurt the varnish whats the matter katie keating asked noticing at last she looked at him and he saw that her eyes were terrified her lips parted she was trying to smile katie he gasped she said nothing take your coat off come here get yourself warm by the fire he pushed a low bench to the fireplace he made her sit down she was wearing a black sweater and an old black skirt schoolgirlish house garments which she had not changed for her visit she sat hunched her knees drawn tight together she said her voice lower and more natural with the first released sound of pain in it you have such a nice place so warm and roomy can you open the windows any time you want to katie darling he said gently what happened nothing its not that anything really happened only i had to speak to you now tonight he looked at mrs keating if youd rather no its perfectly all right mrs keating can hear it maybe its better if she hears it she turned to his mother and said very simply you see mrs keating peter and i are engaged she turned to him and added her voice breaking peter i want to be married now tomorrow as soon as possible mrs keatings hand descended slowly to her lap she looked at catherine her eyes expressionless she said quietly with a dignity keating had never expected of her i didnt know it i am very happy my dear you dont mind you really dont mind at all catherine asked desperately why child such things are to be decided only by you and my son katie he gasped regaining his voice what happened why as soon as possible oh oh it did sound as if as if i were in the kind of trouble girls are supposed to she blushed furiously oh my god no its not that you know it couldnt be oh you couldnt think peter that i that no of course not he laughed sitting down on the floor by her side slipping an arm around her but pull yourself together what is it you know id marry you tonight if you wanted me to only what happened nothing im all right now ill tell you youll think im crazy i just suddenly had the feeling that id never marry you that something dreadful was happening to me and i had to escape from it what was happening to you i dont know not a thing i was working on my research notes all day and nothing had happened at all no calls or visitors and then suddenly tonight i had that feeling it was like a nightmare you know the kind of horror that you cant describe thats not like anything normal at all just the feeling that i was in mortal danger that something was closing in on me that id never escape it because it wouldnt let me and it was too late that youd never escape what i dont know exactly everything my whole life you know like quicksand smooth and natural with not a thing that you can notice about it or suspect and you walk on it easily when youve noticed its too late and i felt that it would get me that id never marry you that i had to run now now or never havent you ever had a feeling like that just fear that you couldnt explain yes he whispered you dont think im crazy no katie only what was it exactly that started it anything in particular well it seems so silly now she giggled apologetically it was like this i was sitting in my room and it was a little chilly so i didnt open the window i had so many papers and books on the table i hardly had room to write and every time i made a note my elbowd push something off there were piles of things on the floor all around me all paper and it rustled a little because i had the door to the living room half open and there was a little draft i guess uncle was working too in the living room i was getting along fine id been at it for hours didnt even know what time it was and then suddenly it got me i dont know why maybe the room was stuffy or maybe it was the silence i couldnt hear a thing not a sound in the living room and there was that paper rustling so softly like somebody being choked to death and then i looked around and and i couldnt see uncle in the living room but i saw his shadow on the wall a huge shadow all hunched and it didnt move only it was so huge she shuddered the thing did not seem silly to her any longer she whispered thats when it got me it wouldnt move that shadow but i thought all that paper was moving i thought it was rising very slowly off the floor and it was going to come to my throat and i was going to drown thats when i screamed and peter he didnt hear he didnt hear it because the shadow didnt move then i seized my hat and coat and i ran when i was running through the living room i think he said why catherine what time is it where are you going something like that im not sure but i didnt look back and i didnt answer i couldnt i was afraid of him afraid of uncle ellsworth whos never said a harsh word to me in his life that was all peter i cant understand it but im afraid not so much any more not here with you but im afraid mrs keating spoke her voice dry and crisp why its plain what happened to you my dear you worked too hard and overdid it and you just got a mite hysterical yes probably no said keating dully no it wasnt that he was thinking of the loudspeaker in the lobby of the strike meeting then he added quickly yes mothers right youre killing yourself with work katie that uncle of yours ill wring his neck one of these days oh but its not his fault he doesnt want me to work he often takes the books away from me and tells me to go to the movies hes said that himself that i work too hard but i like it i think that every note i make every little bit of information its going to be taught to hundreds of young students all over the country and i think its me whos helping to educate people just my own little bit in such a big cause and i feel proud and i dont want to stop you see ive really got nothing to complain about and then then like tonight i dont know whats the matter with me look katie well get the license tomorrow morning and then well be married at once anywhere you wish lets peter she whispered you really dont mind i have no real reasons but i want it i want it so much then ill know that everythings all right well manage i can get a job if you if youre not quite ready or oh nonsense dont talk about that well manage it doesnt matter only lets get married and everything else will take care of itself darling you understand you do understand yes katie now that its all settled said mrs keating ill fix you a cup of hot tea catherine youll need it before you go home she prepared the tea and catherine drank it gratefully and said smiling i ive often been afraid that you wouldnt approve mrs keating whatever gave you that idea mrs keating drawled her voice not in the tone of a question now you run on home like a good girl and get a good nights sleep mother couldnt katie stay here tonight she could sleep with you well now peter dont get hysterical what would her uncle think oh no of course not ill be perfectly all right peter ill go home not if you im not afraid not now im fine you dont think that im really scared of uncle ellsworth well all right but dont go yet now peter said mrs keating you dont want her to be running around the streets later than she has to ill take her home no said catherine i dont want to be sillier than i am no i wont let you he kissed her at the door and he said ill come for you at ten oclock tomorrow morning and well go for the license yes peter she whispered he closed the door after her and he stood for a moment not noticing that he was clenching his fists then he walked defiantly back to the living room and he stopped his hands in his pockets facing his mother he looked at her his glance a silent demand mrs keating sat looking at him quietly without pretending to ignore the glance and without answering it then she asked do you want to go to bed peter he had expected anything but that he felt a violent impulse to seize the chance to turn leave the room and escape but he had to learn what she thought he had to justify himself now mother im not going to listen to any objections ive made no objections said mrs keating mother i want you to understand that i love katie that nothing can stop me now and thats that very well peter i dont see what it is that you dislike about her what i like or dislike is of no importance to you any more oh yes mother of course it is you know it is how can you say that peter i have no likes or dislikes as far as im concerned i have no thought for myself at all because nothing in the world matters to me except you it might be oldfashioned but thats the way i am i know i shouldnt be because children dont appreciate it nowadays but i cant help it oh mother you know that i appreciate it you know that i wouldnt want to hurt you you cant hurt me peter except by hurting yourself and that thats hard to bear how am i hurting myself well if you wont refuse to listen to me ive never refused to listen to you if you do want to hear my opinion ill say that this is the funeral of twentynine years of my life of all the hopes ive had for you but why why its not that i dislike catherine peter i like her very much shes a nice girl if she doesnt let herself go to pieces often and pick things out of thin air like that but shes a respectable girl and id say shed make a good wife for anybody for any nice plodding respectable boy but to think of it for you peter for you but youre modest peter youre too modest thats always been your trouble you dont appreciate yourself you think youre just like anybody else i certainly dont and i wont have anyone think that then use your head dont you know whats ahead of you dont you see how far youve come already and how far youre going you have a chance to become well not the very best but pretty near the top in the architectural profession and pretty near the top is that what you think if i cant be the very best if i cant be the one architect of this country in my day i dont want any damn part of it ah but one doesnt get to that peter by falling down on the job one doesnt get to be first in anything without the strength to make some sacrifices but your life doesnt belong to you peter if youre really aiming high you cant allow yourself to indulge every whim as ordinary people can because with them it doesnt matter anyway its not you or me or what we feel peter its your career it takes strength to deny yourself in order to win other peoples respect you just dislike katie and you let your own prejudice whatever would i dislike about her well of course i cant say that i approve of a girl who has so little consideration for her man that shell run to him and upset him over nothing at all and ask him to chuck his future out the window just because she gets some crazy notion that shows what help you can expect from a wife like that but as far as im concerned if you think that im worried about myself well youre just blind peter dont you see that for me personally it would be a perfect match because id have no trouble with catherine i could get along with her beautifully shed be respectful and obedient to her motherinlaw while on the other hand miss francon he winced he had known that this would come it was the one subject he had been afraid to hear mentioned oh yes peter said mrs keating quietly firmly weve got to speak of that now im sure i could never manage miss francon and an elegant society girl like that wouldnt even stand for a dowdy uneducated mother like me shed probably edge me out of the house oh yes peter but you see its not me that im thinking of mother he said harshly that part of it is pure drivel about my having a chance with dominique that hellcat im not sure shed ever look at me youre slipping peter there was a time when you wouldnt have admitted that there was anything you couldnt get but i dont want her mother oh you dont dont you well there you are isnt that what ive been saying look at yourself there youve got francon the best architect in town just where you want him hes practically begging you to take a partnership at your age over how many other older mens heads hes not permitting hes asking you to marry his daughter and youll walk in tomorrow and youll present to him the little nobody youve gone and married just stop thinking of yourself for a moment and think of others a bit how do you suppose hell like that how will he like it when you show him the little guttersnipe that youve preferred to his daughter he wont like it keating whispered you bet your life he wont you bet your life hell kick you right out on the street hell find plenty wholl jump at the chance to take your place how about that bennett fellow oh no keating gasped so furiously that she knew she had struck right not bennett yes she said triumphantly bennett thats what itll be francon bennett while youll be pounding the pavements looking for a job but youll have a wife oh yes youll have a wife mother please he whispered so desperately that she could allow herself to go on without restraint this is the kind of a wife youll have a clumsy little girl who wont know where to put her hands or feet a sheepish little thing wholl run and hide from any important person that youll want to bring to the house so you think youre so good dont kid yourself peter keating no great man ever got there alone dont you shrug it off how much the right womans helped the best of them your francon didnt marry a chambermaid you bet your life he didnt just try to see things through other peoples eyes for a bit what will they think of your wife what will they think of you you dont make your living building chicken coops for soda jerkers dont you forget that youve got to play the game as the big men of this world see it youve got to live up to them what will they think of a man whos married to a common little piece of baggage like that will they admire you will they trust you will they respect you shut up he cried but she went on she spoke for a long time while he sat cracking his knuckles savagely moaning once in a while but i love her i cant mother i cant i love her she released him when the streets outside were gray with the light of morning she let him stumble off to his room to the accompaniment of the last gentle weary sounds of her voice at least peter you can do that much just a few months ask her to wait just a few months heyer might die any moment and then once youre a partner you can marry her and you might get away with it she wont mind waiting just that little bit longer if she loves you think it over peter and while youre thinking it over think just a bit that if you do this now youll be breaking your mothers heart its not important but take just a tiny notice of that think of yourself for an hour but give one minute to the thought of others he did not try to sleep he did not undress but sat on his bed for hours and the thing clearest in his mind was the wish to find himself transported a year ahead when everything would have been settled he did not care how he had decided nothing when he rang the doorbell of catherines apartment at ten oclock he felt dimly that she would take his hand that she would lead him that she would insist and thus the decision would be made catherine opened the door and smiled happily and confidently as if nothing had happened she led him to her room where broad shafts of sunlight flooded the columns of books and papers stacked neatly on her desk the room was clean orderly the pile of the rug still striped in bands left by a carpet sweeper catherine wore a crisp organdy blouse with sleeves standing stiffly cheerfully about her shoulders little fluffy needles glittered through her hair in the sunlight he felt a brief wrench of disappointment that no menace met him in her house a wrench of relief also and of disappointment im ready peter she said get me my coat did you tell your uncle he asked oh yes i told him last night he was still working when i got back what did he say nothing he just laughed and asked me what i wanted for a wedding present but he laughed so much where is he didnt he want to meet me at least he had to go to his newspaper office he said hed have plenty of time to see more than enough of you but he said it so nicely listen katie i theres one thing i wanted to tell you he hesitated not looking at her his voice was flat you see its like this lucius heyer francons partner is very ill and they dont expect him to live francons been hinting quite openly mat im to take heyers place but francon has the crazy idea that he wants me to marry his daughter now dont misunderstand me you know theres not a chance but i cant tell him so and i thought i thought that if we waited for just a few weeks id be set with the firm and then francon could do nothing to me when i come and tell him that im married but of course its up to you he looked at her and his voice was eager if you want to do it now well go at once but peter she said calmly serene and astonished but of course well wait he smiled in approval and relief but he closed his eyes of course well wait she said firmly i didnt know this and its very important theres really no reason to hurry at all youre not afraid that francons daughter might get me she laughed oh peter i know you too well but if youd rather no its much better you see to tell you the truth i thought this morning that it would be better if we waited but i didnt want to say anything if you had made up your mind since youd rather wait id much rather too because you see we got word this morning that uncles invited to repeat this same course of lectures at a terribly important university on the west coast this summer i felt horrible about leaving him flat with the work unfinished and then i thought also that perhaps we were being foolish were both so young and uncle ellsworth laughed so much you see its really wiser to wait a little yes well thats fine but katie if you feel as you did last night but i dont im so ashamed of myself i cant imagine what ever happened to me last night i try to remember it and i cant understand you know how it is you feel so silly afterward everythings so clear and simple the next day did i say a lot of awful nonsense last night well forget it youre a sensible little girl were both sensible and well wait just a while it wont be long yes peter he said suddenly fiercely insist on it now katie and then he laughed stupidly as if he had not been quite serious she smiled gaily in answer you see she said spreading her hands out well he muttered well all right katie well wait its better of course i ill run along then ill be late at the office he felt he had to escape her room for the moment for that day ill give you a ring lets have dinner together tomorrow yes peter that will be nice he went away relieved and desolate cursing himself for the dull persistent feeling that told him he had missed a chance which would never return that something was closing in on them both and they had surrendered he cursed because he could not say what it was that they should have fought he hurried on to his office where he was being late for an appointment with mrs moorehead catherine stood in the middle of the room after he had left and wondered why she suddenly felt empty and cold why she hadnt known until this moment that she had hoped he would force her to follow him then she shrugged and smiled reproachfully at herself and went back to the work on her desk on a day in october when the heller house was nearing completion a lanky young man in overalls stepped out of a small group that stood watching the house from the road and approached roark you the fellow who built the booby hatch he asked quite diffidently if you mean this house yes roark answered oh i beg your pardon sir its only that thats what they call the place around here its not what id call it you see ive got a building job well not exactly but im going to build a filling station of my own about ten miles from here down on the post road id like to talk to you later on a bench in front of the garage where he worked jimmy gowan explained in detail he added and how i happened to think of you mr roark is that i like it that funny house of yours cant say why but i like it it makes sense to me and then again i figured everybodys gaping at it and talking about it well thats no use to a house but thatd be plenty smart for a business let them giggle but let them talk about it so i thought id get you to build it and then theyll all say im crazy but do you care i dont jimmy gowan had worked like a mule for fifteen years saving money for a business of his own people voiced indignant objections to his choice of architect jimmy uttered no word of explanation or selfdefense he said politely maybe so folks maybe so and proceeded to have roark build his station the station opened on a day in late december it stood on the edge of the boston post road two small structures of glass and concrete forming a semicircle among the trees the cylinder of the office and the long low oval of the diner with the gasoline pumps as the colonnade of a forecourt between them it was a study in circles there were no angles and no straight lines it looked like shapes caught in a flow held still at the moment of being poured at the precise moment when they formed a harmony that seemed too perfect to be intentional it looked like a cluster of bubbles hanging low over the ground not quite touching it to be swept aside in an instant on a wind of speed it looked gay with the hard bracing gaiety of efficiency like a powerful airplane engine roark stayed at the station on the day of its opening he drank coffee in a clean white mug at the counter of the diner and he watched the cars stopping at the door he left late at night he looked back once driving down the long empty road the lights of the station winked flowing away from him there it stood at the crossing of two roads and cars would be streaming past it day and night cars coming from cities in which there was no room for buildings such as this going to cities in which there would be no buildings such as this he turned his face to the road before him and he kept his eyes off the mirror which still held glittering softly dots of light that moved away far behind him he drove back to months of idleness he sat in his office each morning because he knew that he had to sit there looking at a door that never opened his fingers forgotten on a telephone that never rang the ash trays he emptied each day before leaving contained nothing but the stubs of his own cigarettes what are you doing about it howard austen heller asked him at dinner one evening nothing but you must theres nothing i can do you must learn how to handle people i cant why i dont know how i was born without some one particular sense its something one acquires i have no organ to acquire it with i dont know whether its something i lack or something extra i have that stops me besides i dont like people who have to be handled but you cant sit still and do nothing now youve got to go after commissions what can i tell people in order to get commissions i can only show my work if they dont hear that they wont hear anything i say im nothing to them but my work my work is all we have in common and i have no desire to tell them anything else then what are you going to do youre not worried no i expected it im waiting for what my kind of people what kind is that i dont know yes i do know but i cant explain it ive often wished i could there must be some one principle to cover it but i dont know what it is honesty yes no only partly guy francon is an honest man but it isnt that courage ralston holcombe has courage in his own manner i dont know im not that vague on other things but i can tell my kind of people by their faces by something in their faces there will be thousands passing by your house and by the gas station if out of those thousands one stops and sees it thats all i need then you do need other people after all dont you howard of course what are you laughing at ive always thought that you were the most antisocial animal ive ever had the pleasure of meeting i need people to give me work im not building mausoleums do you suppose i should need them in some other way in a closer more personal way you dont need anyone in a very personal way no youre not even boasting about it should i you cant youre too arrogant to boast is that what i am dont you know what you are no not as far as youre seeing me or anyone else heller sat silently his wrist describing circles with a cigarette then heller laughed and said that was typical what that you didnt ask me to tell you what you are as i see you anybody else would have im sorry it wasnt indifference youre one of the few friends i want to keep i just didnt think of asking i know you didnt thats the point youre a selfcentered monster howard the more monstrous because youre utterly innocent about it thats true you should show a little concern when you admit that why you know theres a thing that stumps me youre the coldest man i know and i cant understand why knowing that youre actually a fiend in your quiet sort of way why i always feel when i see you that youre the most lifegiving person ive ever met what do you mean i dont know just that the weeks went by and roark walked to his office each day sat at his desk for eight hours and read a great deal at five oclock he walked home he had moved to a better room near the office he spent little he had enough money for a long time to come on a morning in february the telephone rang in his office a brisk emphatic feminine voice asked for an appointment with mr roark the architect that afternoon a brisk small darkskinned woman entered the office she wore a mink coat and exotic earrings that tinkled when she moved her head she moved her head a great deal in sharp little birdlike jerks she was mrs wayne wilmot of long island and she wished to build a country house she had selected mr roark to build it she explained because he had designed the home of austen heller she adored austen heller he was she stated an oracle to all those pretending just the tiniest bit to the title of progressive intellectual she thought dont you and she followed heller like a zealot yes literally like a zealot mr roark was very young wasnt he but she didnt mind that she was very liberal and glad to help youth she wanted a large house she had two children she believed in expressing their individuality dont you and each had to have a separate nursery she had to have a library i read to distraction a music room a conservatory we grow liliesofthevalley my friends tell me its my flower a den for her husband who trusted her implicitly and let her plan the house because im so good at it if i werent a woman im sure id be an architect servants rooms and all that and a threecar garage after an hour and a half of details and explanations she said and of course as to the style of the house it will be english tudor i adore english tudor he looked at her he asked slowly have you seen austen hellers house no though i did want to see it but how could i ive never met mr heller im only his fan just that a plain ordinary fan what is he like in person you must tell me im dying to hear it no i havent seen his house its somewhere up in maine isnt it roark took photographs out of the desk drawer and handed them to her this he said is the heller house she looked at the photographs her glance like water skimming off their glossy surfaces and threw them down on the desk very interesting she said most unusual quite stunning but of course thats not what i want that kind of a house wouldnt express my personality my friends tell me i have the elizabethan personality quietly patiently he tried to explain to her why she should not build a tudor house she interrupted him in the middle of a sentence look here mr roark youre not trying to teach me something are you im quite sure that i have good taste and i know a great deal about architecture ive taken a special course at the club my friends tell me that i know more than many architects ive quite made up my mind that i shall have an english tudor house i do not care to argue about it youll have to go to some other architect mrs wilmot she stared at him incredulously you mean youre refusing the commission yes you dont want my commission no but why i dont do this sort of thing but i thought architects yes architects will build you anything you ask for any other architect in town will but i gave you first chance will you do me a favor mrs wilmot will you tell me why you came to me if all you wanted was a tudor house well i certainly thought youd appreciate the opportunity and then i thought i could tell my friends that i had austen hellers architect he tried to explain and to convince he knew while he spoke that it was useless because his words sounded as if they were hitting a vacuum there was no such person as mrs wayne wilmot there was only a shell containing the opinions of her friends the picture post cards she had seen the novels of country squires she had read it was this that he had to address this immateriality which could not hear him or answer deaf and impersonal like a wad of cotton im sorry said mrs wayne wilmot but im not accustomed to dealing with a person utterly incapable of reason im quite sure i shall find plenty of bigger men wholl be glad to work for me my husband was opposed to my idea of having you in the first place and im sorry to see that he was right good day mr roark she walked out with dignity but she slammed the door he slipped the photographs back into the drawer of his desk mr robert l mundy who came to roarks office in march had been sent by austin heller mr mundys voice and hair were gray as steel but his eyes were blue gentle and wistful he wanted to build a house in connecticut and he spoke of it tremulously like a young bridegroom and like a man groping for his last secret goal its not just a house mr roark he said with timid diffidence as if he were speaking to a man older and more prominent than himself its like like a symbol to me its what ive been waiting and working for all these years its so many years now i must tell you this so youll understand i have a great deal of money now more than i care to think about i didnt always have it maybe it came too late i dont know young people think that you forget what happens on the way when you get there but you dont something stays ill always remember how i was a boy in a little place down in georgia that was and how i ran errands for the harness maker and the kids laughed when carriages drove by and splashed mud all over my pants thats how long ago i decided that some day id have a house of my own the kind of house that carriages stop before after that no matter how hard it got to be at times id always think of that house and it helped afterward there were years when i was afraid of it i could have built it but i was afraid well now the time has come do you understand mr roark austen said youd be just the man whod understand yes said roark eagerly i do there was a place said mr mundy down there near my home town the mansion of the whole county the randolph place an old plantation house as they dont build them any more i used to deliver things there sometimes at the back door thats the house i want mr roark just like it but not back there in georgia i dont want to go back right here near the city ive bought the land you must help me to have it landscaped just like the randolph place well plant trees and shrubs the kind they have in georgia the flowers and everything well find a way to make them grow i dont care how much it costs of course well have electric lights and garages now not carriages but i want the electric lights made like candles and i want the garages to look like the stables everything just as it was i have photographs of the randolph place and ive bought some of their old furniture when roark began to speak mr mundy listened in polite astonishment he did not seem to resent the words they did not penetrate dont you see roark was saying its a monument you want to build but not to yourself not to your own life or your own achievement to other people to their supremacy over you youre not challenging that supremacy youre immortalizing it you havent thrown it off youre putting it up forever will you be happy if you seal yourself for the rest of your life in that borrowed shape or if you strike free for once and build a new house your own you dont want the randolph place you want what it stood for but what it stood for is what youve fought all your life mr mundy listened blankly and roark felt again a bewildered helplessness before unreality there was no such person as mr mundy there were only the remnants long dead of the people who had inhabited the randolph place one could not plead with remnants or convince them no said mr mundy at last no you may be right but thats not what i want at all i dont say you havent got your reasons and they sound like good reasons but i like the randolph place why just because i like it just because thats what i like when roark told him that he would have to select another architect mr mundy said unexpectedly but i like you why cant you build it for me what difference would it make to you roark did not explain later austen heller said to him i expected it i was afraid youd turn him down im not blaming you howard only hes so rich it could have helped you so much and after all youve got to live not that way said roark in april mr nathaniel janss of the janssstuart real estate company called roark to his office mr janss was frank and blunt he stated that his company was planning the erection of a small office building thirty stories on lower broadway and that he was not sold on roark as the architect in fact he was more or less opposed to him but his friend austen heller had insisted that he should meet roark and talk to him about it mr janss did not think very much of roarks stuff but heller had simply bullied him and he would listen to roark before deciding on anyone and what did roark have to say on the subject roark had a great deal to say he said it calmly and this was difficult at first because he wanted that building because what he felt was the desire to wrench that building out of mr janss at the point of a gun if hed had one but after a few minutes it became simple and easy the thought of the gun vanished and even his desire for the building it was not a commission to get and he was not there to get it he was only speaking of buildings mr janss when you buy an automobile you dont want it to have rose garlands about the windows a lion on each fender and an angel sitting on the roof why dont you that would be silly stated mr janss why would it be silly now i think it would be beautiful besides louis the fourteenth had a carriage like that and what was good enough for louis is good enough for us we shouldnt go in for rash innovations and we shouldnt break with tradition now you know damn well you dont believe anything of the sort i know i dont but thats what you believe isnt it now take a human body why wouldnt you like to see a human body with a curling tail with a crest of ostrich feathers at the end and with ears shaped like acanthus leaves it would be ornamental you know instead of the stark bare ugliness we have now well why dont you like the idea because it would be useless and pointless because the beauty of the human body is that it hasnt a single muscle which doesnt serve its purpose that theres not a line wasted that every detail of it fits one idea the idea of a man and the life of a man will you tell me why when it comes to a building you dont want it to look as if it had any sense or purpose you want to choke it with trimmings you want to sacrifice its purpose to its envelope not knowing even why you want that kind of an envelope you want it to look like a hybrid beast produced by crossing the bastards of ten different species until you get a creature without guts without heart or brain a creature all pelt tail claws and feathers why you must tell me because ive never been able to understand it well said mr janss ive never thought of it that way he added without great conviction but we want our building to have dignity you know and beauty what they call real beauty what who calls what beauty wellll tell me mr janss do you really think that greek columns and fruit baskets are beautiful on a modern steel office building i dont know that ive ever thought anything about why a building was beautiful one way or another mr janss confessed but i guess thats what the public wants why do you suppose they want it i dont know then why should you care what they want youve got to consider the public dont you know that most people take most things because thats whats given them and they have no opinion whatever do you wish to be guided by what they expect you to think they think or by your own judgment you cant force it down their throats you dont have to you must only be patient because on your side you have reason oh i know its something no one really wants to have on his side and against you you have just a vague fat blind inertia why do you think that i dont want reason on my side its not you mr janss its the way most people feel they have to take a chance everything they do is taking a chance but they feel so much safer when they take it on something they know to be ugly vain and stupid thats true you know said mr janss at the conclusion of the interview mr janss said thoughtfully i cant say that it doesnt make sense mr roark let me think it over youll hear from me shortly mr janss called him a week later its the board of directors that will have to decide are you willing to try roark draw up the plans and some preliminary sketches ill submit them to the board i cant promise anything but im for you and ill fight them on it roark worked on the plans for two weeks of days and nights the plans were submitted then he was called before the board of directors of the janssstuart real estate company he stood at the side of a long table and he spoke his eyes moving slowly from face to face he tried not to look down at the table but on the lower rim of his vision there remained the white spot of his drawings spread before the twelve men he was asked a great many questions mr janss jumped up at times to answer instead to pound the table with his fist to snarl dont you see isnt it clear what of it mr grant what if no one has ever built anything like it gothic mr hubbard why must we have gothic ive a jolly good mind to resign if you turn this down roark spoke quietly he was the only man in the room who felt certain of his own words he felt also that he had no hope the twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances but there was something neither color nor feature upon all of them as a common denominator something that dissolved their expressions so that they were not faces any longer but only empty ovals of flesh he was addressing everyone he was addressing no one he felt no answer not even the echo of his own words striking against the membrane of an eardrum his words were falling down a well hitting stone salients on their way and each salient refused to stop them threw them farther tossed them from one another sent them to seek a bottom that did not exist he was told that he would be informed of the boards decision he knew that decision in advance when he received the letter he read it without feeling the letter was from mr janss and it began dear mr roark i am sorry to inform you that our board of directors find themselves unable to grant you the commission for there was a plea in the letters brutal offensive formality the plea of a man who could not face him john fargo had started in life as a pushcart peddler at fifty he owned a modest fortune and a prosperous department store on lower sixth avenue for years he had fought successfully against a large store across the street one of many inherited by a numerous family in the fall of last year the family had moved that particular branch to new quarters farther uptown they were convinced that the center of the citys retail business was shifting north and they had decided to hasten the downfall of their former neighborhood by leaving their old store vacant a grim reminder and embarrassment to their competitor across the street john fargo had answered by announcing that he would build a new store of his own on the very same spot next door to his old one a store newer and smarter than any the city had seen he would he declared keep the prestige of his old neighborhood when he called roark to his office he did not say that he would have to decide later or think things over he said youre the architect he sat his feet on his desk smoking a pipe snapping out words and puffs of smoke together ill tell you what space i need and how much i want to spend if you need more say so the rest is up to you i dont know much about buildings but i know a man who knows when i see him go ahead fargo had chosen roark because fargo had driven one day past gowans service station and stopped and gone in and asked a few questions after that he bribed hellers cook to show him through the house in hellers absence fargo needed no further argument late in may when the drafting table in roarks office was buried deep in sketches for the fargo store he received another commission mr whitford sanborn the client owned an office building that had been built for him many years ago by henry cameron when mr sanborn decided that he needed a new country residence he rejected his wifes suggestions of other architects he wrote to henry cameron cameron wrote a tenpage letter in answer the first three lines of the letter stated that he had retired from practice the rest of it was about howard roark roark never learned what had been said in that letter sanborn would not show it to him and cameron would not tell him but sanborn signed him to build the country residence in spite of mrs sanborns violent objections mrs sanborn was the president of many charity organizations and this had given her an addiction to autocracy such as no other avocation could develop mrs sanborn wished a french chateau built upon their new estate on the hudson she wished it to look stately and ancient as if it had always belonged to the family of course she admitted people would know that it hadnt but it would appear as if it had mr sanborn signed the contract after roark had explained to him in detail the kind of a house he was to expect mr sanborn had agreed to it readily had not wished even to wait for sketches but of course fanny mr sanborn said wearily i want a modern house i told you that long ago thats what cameron would have designed what in heavens name does cameron mean now she asked i dont know fanny i know only that theres no building in new york like the one he did for me the arguments continued for many long evenings in the dark cluttered polished mahogany splendor of the sanborns victorian drawing room mr sanborn wavered roark asked his arm sweeping out at the room around them is this what you want well if youre going to be impertinent mrs sanborn began but mr sanborn exploded christ fanny hes right thats just what i dont want thats just what im sick of roark saw no one until his sketches were ready the house of plain fieldstone with great windows and many terraces stood in the gardens over the river as spacious as the spread of water as open as the gardens and one had to follow its lines attentively to find the exact steps by which it was tied to the sweep of the gardens so gradual was the rise of the terraces the approach to and the full reality of the walls it seemed only that the trees flowed into the house and through it it seemed that the house was not a barrier against the sunlight but a bowl to gather it to concentrate it into brighter radiance than that of the air outside mr sanborn was first to see the sketches he studied them and then he said i i dont know quite how to say it mr roark its great cameron was right about you after others had seen the sketches mr sanborn was not certain of this any longer mrs sanborn said that the house was awful and the long evening arguments were resumed now why why cant we add turrets there on the corners mrs sanborn asked theres plenty of room on those flat roofs when she had been talked out of the turrets she inquired why cant we have mullioned windows what difference would that make god knows the windows are large enough though why they have to be so large i fail to see it gives one no privacy at all but im willing to accept your windows mr roark if youre so stubborn about it but why cant you put mullions on the panes it will soften things and it gives a regal air you know a feudal sort of mood the friends and relatives to whom mrs sanborn hurried with the sketches did not like the house at all mrs walling called it preposterous and mrs hooper crude mr melander said he wouldnt have it as a present mrs applebee stated that it looked like a shoe factory miss davitt glanced at the sketches and said with approval oh how very artistic my dear who designed it roark roark never heard of him well frankly fanny it looks like something phony the two children of the family were divided on the question june sanborn aged nineteen had always thought that all architects were romantic and she had been delighted to learn that they would have a very young architect but she did not like roarks appearance and his indifference to her hints so she declared that the house was hideous and she for one would refuse to live in it richard sanborn aged twentyfour who had been a brilliant student in college and was now slowly drinking himself to death startled his family by emerging from his usual lethargy and declaring that the house was magnificent no one could tell whether it was esthetic appreciation or hatred of his mother or both whitford sanborn swayed with every new current he would mutter well now not mullions of course thats utter rubbish but couldnt you give her a cornice mr roark to keep peace in the family just a kind of a crenelated cornice it wouldnt spoil anything or would it the arguments ended when roark declared that he would not build the house unless mr sanborn approved the sketches just as they were and signed his approval on every sheet of the drawings mr sanborn signed mrs sanborn was pleased to learn shortly afterward that no reputable contractor would undertake the erection of the house you see she stated triumphantly mr sanborn refused to see he found an obscure firm that accepted the commission grudgingly and as a special favor to him mrs sanborn learned that she had an ally in the contractor and she broke social precedent to the extent of inviting him for tea she had long since lost all coherent ideas about the house she merely hated roark her contractor hated all architects on principle the construction of the sanborn house proceeded through the months of summer and fall each day bringing new battles but of course mr roark i told you i wanted three closets in my bedroom i remember distinctly it was on a friday and we were sitting in the drawing room and mr sanborn was sitting in the big chair by the window and i was what about the plans what plans how do you expect me to understand plans aunt rosalie says she cant possibly climb a circular stairway mr roark what are we going to do select our guests to fit your house mr hulburt says that kind of ceiling wont hold oh yes mr hulburt knows a lot about architecture hes spent two summers in venice june poor darling says her room will be dark as a cellar well thats the way she feels mr roark even if it isnt dark but if it makes her feel dark its the same thing roark stayed up nights redrafting the plans for the alterations which he could not avoid it meant days of tearing down floors stairways partitions already erected it meant extras piling up on the contractors budget the contractor shrugged and said i told you so thats what always happens when you get one of those fancy architects you wait and see what this thing will cost you before he gets through then as the house took shape it was roark who found that he wanted to make a change the eastern wing had never quite satisfied him watching it rise he saw the mistake he had made and the way to correct it he knew it would bring the house into a more logical whole he was making his first steps in building and they were his first experiments he could admit it openly but mr sanborn refused to allow the change it was his turn roark pleaded with him once the picture of that new wing had become clear in roarks mind he could not bear to look at the house as it stood its not that i disagree with you mr sanborn said coldly in fact i do think youre right but we cannot afford it sorry it will cost you less than the senseless changes mrs sanborn has forced me to make dont bring that up again mr sanborn roark asked slowly will you sign a paper that you authorize this change provided it costs you nothing certainly if you can conjure up a miracle to work that he signed the eastern wing was rebuilt roark paid for it himself it cost him more than the fee he received mr sanborn hesitated he wanted to repay it mrs sanborn stopped him its just a low trick she said just a form of highpressure hes blackmailing you on your better feelings he expects you to pay wait and see hell ask for it dont let him get away with that roark did not ask for it mr sanborn never paid him when the house was completed mrs sanborn refused to live in it mr sanborn looked at it wistfully too tired to admit that he loved it that he had always wanted a house just like it he surrendered the house was not furnished mrs sanborn took herself her husband and her daughter off to florida for the winter where she said we have a house thats a decent spanish thank god because we bought it readymade this is what happens when you venture to build for yourself with some halfbaked idiot of an architect her son to everybodys amazement exhibited a sudden burst of savage will power he refused to go to florida he liked the new house he would live nowhere else so three of the rooms were furnished for him the family left and he moved alone into the house on the hudson at night one could see from the river a single rectangle of yellow small and lost among the windows of the huge dead house the bulletin of the architects guild of america carried a small item a curious incident which would be amusing if it were not deplorable is reported to us about a home recently built by mr whitford sanborn noted industrialist designed by one howard roark and erected at a cost of well over this house was found by the family to be uninhabitable it stands now abandoned as an eloquent witness to professional incompetence lucius n heyer stubbornly refused to die he had recovered from the stroke and returned to his office ignoring the objections of his doctor and the solicitous protests of guy francon francon offered to buy him out heyer refused his pale watering eyes staring obstinately at nothing at all he came to his office every two or three days he read the copies of correspondence left in his letter basket according to custom he sat at his desk and drew flowers on a clean pad then he went home he walked dragging his feet slowly he held his elbows pressed to his sides and his forearms thrust forward with the fingers half closed like claws the fingers shook he could not use his left hand at all he would not retire he liked to see his name on the firms stationery he wondered dimly why he was no longer introduced to prominent clients why he never saw the sketches of their new buildings until they were half erected if he mentioned this francon protested but lucius i couldnt think of bothering you in your condition any other man would have retired long ago francon puzzled him mildly peter keating baffled him keating barely bothered to greet him when they met and then as an afterthought keating walked off in the middle of a sentence addressed to him when heyer issued some minor order to one of the draftsmen it was not carried out and the draftsman informed him that the order had been countermanded by mr keating heyer could not understand it he always remembered keating as the diffident boy who had talked to him so nicely about old porcelain he excused keating at first then he tried to mollify him humbly and clumsily then he conceived an unreasoning fear of keating he complained to francon he said petulantly assuming the tone of an authority he could never have exercised that boy of yours guy that keating fellow hes getting to be impossible hes rude to me you ought to get rid of him now you see lucius francon answered dryly why i say that you should retire youre overstraining your nerves and youre beginning to imagine things then came the competition for the cosmoslotnick building cosmoslotnick pictures of hollywood california had decided to erect a stupendous home office in new york a skyscraper to house a motionpicture theater and forty floors of offices a worldwide competition for the selection of the architect had been announced a year in advance it was stated that cosmoslotnick were not merely the leaders in the art of the motion picture but embraced all the arts since all contributed to the creation of the films and architecture being a lofty though neglected branch of esthetics cosmoslotnick were ready to put it on the map with the latest news of the casting of ill take a sailor and the shooting of wives for sale came stories about the parthenon and the pantheon miss sally odawn was photographed on the steps of the rheims cathedral in a bathing suit and mr pratt pardner purcell gave an interview stating that he had always dreamed of being a master builder if he hadnt been a movie actor ralston holcombe guy francon and gordon l prescott were quoted on the future of american architecture in an article written by miss dimples williams and an imaginary interview quoted what sir christopher wren would have said about the motion picture in the sunday supplements there were photographs of cosmoslotnick starlets in shorts and sweaters holding tsquares and sliderules standing before drawing boards that bore the legend cosmoslotnick building over a huge question mark the competition was open to all architects of all countries the building was to rise on broadway and to cost ten million dollars it was to symbolize the genius of modern technology and the spirit of the american people it was announced in advance as the most beautiful building in the world the jury of award consisted of mr shupe representing cosmo mr slotnick representing slotnick professor peterkin of the stanton institute of technology the mayor of the city of new york ralston holcombe president of the aga and ellsworth m toohey go to it peter francon told keating enthusiastically do your best give me all youve got this is your great chance youll be known the world over if you win and heres what well do well put your name on our entry along with the firms if we win youll get one fifth of the prize the grand prize is sixty thousand dollars you know heyer will object said keating cautiously let him object thats why im doing it he might get it through his head whats the decent thing for him to do and i well you know how i feel peter i think of you as my partner already i owe it to you youve earned it this might be your key to it keating redrew his project five times he hated it he hated every girder of that building before it was born he worked his hand trembling he did not think of the drawing under his hand he thought of all the other contestants of the man who might win and be proclaimed publicly as his superior he wondered what that other one would do how the other would solve the problem and surpass him he had to beat that man nothing else mattered there was no peter keating there was only a suction chamber like the kind of tropical plant hed heard about a plant that drew an insect into its vacuum and sucked it dry and thus acquired its own substance he felt nothing but immense uncertainty when his sketches were ready and the delicate perspective of a white marble edifice lay neatly finished before him it looked like a renaissance palace made of rubber and stretched to the height of forty stories he had chosen the style of the renaissance because he knew the unwritten law that all architectural juries liked columns and because he remembered ralston holcombe was on the jury he had borrowed from all of holcombes favorite italian palaces it looked good it might be good he was not sure he had no one to ask he heard these words in his own mind and he felt a wave of blind fury he felt it before he knew the reason but he knew the reason almost in the same instant there was someone whom he could ask he did not want to think of that name he would not go to him the anger rose to his face and he felt the hot tight patches under his eyes he knew that he would go he pushed the thought out of his mind he was not going anywhere when the time came he slipped his drawings into a folder and went to roarks office he found roark alone sitting at the desk in the large room that bore no signs of activity hello howard he said brightly how are you im not interrupting anything am i hello peter said roark you arent not awfully busy are you no mind if i sit down for a few minutes sit down well howard youve been doing great work ive seen the fargo store its splendid my congratulations thank you youve been forging straight ahead havent you had three commissions already four oh yes of course four pretty good i hear youve been having a little trouble with the sanborns i have well its not all smooth sailing not all of it you know no new commissions since nothing no nothing well it will come ive always said that architects dont have to cut one anothers throat theres plenty of work for all of us we must develop a spirit of professional unity and cooperation for instance take that competition have you sent your entry in already what competition why the competition the cosmoslotnick competition im not sending any entry youre not not at all no why i dont enter competitions why for heavens sake come on peter you didnt come here to discuss that as a matter of fact i did think id show you my own entry you understand im not asking you to help me i just want your reaction just a general opinion he hastened to open the folder roark studied the sketches keating snapped well is it all right no its rotten and you know it then for hours while keating watched and the sky darkened and lights flared up in the windows of the city roark talked explained slashed lines through the plans untangled the labyrinth of the theaters exits out windows unraveled halls smashed useless arches straightened stairways keating stammered once jesus howard why dont you enter the competition if you can do it like this roark answered because i cant i couldnt if i tried i dry up i go blank i cant give them what they want but i can straighten someone elses damn mess when i see it it was morning when he pushed the plans aside keating whispered and the elevation oh to hell with your elevation i dont want to look at your damn renaissance elevations but he looked he could not prevent his hand from cutting lines across the perspective all right damn you give them good renaissance if you must and if there is such a thing only i cant do that for you figure it out yourself something like this simpler peter simpler more direct as honest as you can make of a dishonest thing now go home and try to work out something on this order keating went home he copied roarks plans he worked out roarks hasty sketch of the elevation into a neat finished perspective then the drawings were mailed properly addressed to the most beautiful building in the world competition cosmoslotnick pictures inc new york city the envelope accompanying the entry contained the names francon heyer architects peter keating associated designer through the months of that winter roark found no other chances no offers no prospects of commissions he sat at his desk and forgot at times to turn on the lights in the early dusk it was as if the heavy immobility of all the hours that had flowed through the office of its door of its air were beginning to seep into his muscles he would rise and fling a book at the wall to feel his arm move to hear the burst of sound he smiled amused picked up the book and laid it neatly back on the desk he turned on the desk lamp then he stopped before he had withdrawn his hands from the cone of light under the lamp and he looked at his hands he spread his fingers out slowly then he remembered what cameron had said to him long ago he jerked his hands away he reached for his coat turned the lights off locked the door and went home as spring approached he knew that his money would not last much longer he paid the rent on his office promptly on the first of each month he wanted the feeling of thirty days ahead during which he would still own the office he entered it calmly each morning he found only that he did not want to look at the calendar when it began to grow dark and he knew that another day of the thirty had gone when he noticed this he made himself look at the calendar it was a race he was running now a race between his rent money and he did not know the name of the other contestant perhaps it was every man whom he passed on the street when he went up to his office the elevator operators looked at him in a queer lazy curious sort of way when he spoke they answered not insolently but in an indifferent drawl that seemed to say it would become insolent in a moment they did not know what he was doing or why they knew only that he was a man to whom no clients ever came he attended because austen heller asked him to attend the few parties heller gave occasionally he was asked by guests oh youre an architect youll forgive me i havent kept up with architecture what have you built when he answered he heard them say oh yes indeed and he saw the conscious politeness of their manner tell him that he was an architect by presumption they had never seen his buildings they did not know whether his buildings were good or worthless they knew only that they had never heard of these buildings it was a war in which he was invited to fight nothing yet he was pushed forward to fight he had to fight he had no choice and no adversary he passed by buildings under construction he stopped to look at the steel cages he felt at times as if the beams and girders were shaping themselves not into a house but into a barricade to stop him and the few steps on the sidewalk that separated him from the wooden fence enclosing the construction were the steps he would never be able to take it was pain but it was a blunted unpenetrating pain its true he would tell himself its not his body would answer the strange untouchable healthiness of his body the fargo store had opened but one building could not save a neighborhood fargos competitors had been right the tide had turned was flowing uptown his customers were deserting him remarks were made openly on the decline of john fargo who had topped his poor business judgment by an investment in a preposterous kind of a building which proved it was stated that the public would not accept these architectural innovations it was not stated that the store was the cleanest and brightest in the city that the skill of its plan made its operation easier than had ever been possible that the neighborhood had been doomed before its erection the building took the blame athelstan beasely the wit of the architectural profession the court jester of the aga who never seemed to be building anything but organized all the charity balls wrote in his column entitled quips and quirks in the aga bulletin well lads and lassies heres a fairy tale with a moral seems there was once upon a time a little boy with hair the color of a halloween pumpkin who thought that he was better than all you common boys and girls so to prove it he up and built a house which is a very nice house except that nobody can live in it and a store which is a very lovely store except that its going bankrupt he also erected a very eminent structure to wit a dogcart on a mud road this last is reported to be doing very well indeed which perhaps is the right field of endeavor for that little boy at the end of march roark read in the papers about roger enright roger enright possessed millions an oil concern and no sense of restraint this made his name appear in the papers frequently he aroused a halfadmiring halfderisive awe by the incoherent variety of his sudden ventures the latest was a project for a new type of residential development an apartment building with each unit complete and isolated like an expensive private home it was to be known as the enright house enright had declared that he did not want it to look like anything anywhere else he had approached and rejected several of the best architects in town roark felt as if this newspaper item were a personal invitation the kind of chance created expressly for him for the first time he attempted to go after a commission he requested an interview with roger enright he got an interview with a secretary the secretary a young man who looked bored asked him several questions about his experience he asked them slowly as if it required an effort to decide just what it would be appropriate to ask under the circumstances since the answers would make no difference whatever he glanced at some photographs of roarks buildings and declared that mr enright would not be interested in the first week of april when roark had paid his last rental for one more month at the office he was asked to submit drawings for the new building of the manhattan bank company he was asked by mr weidler a member of the board of directors who was a friend of young richard sanborn weidler told him ive had a stiff fight mr roark but i think ive won ive taken them personally through the sanborn house and dick and i explained a few things however the board must see the drawings before they make a decision so its not quite certain as yet i must tell you frankly but its almost certain theyve turned down two other architects theyre very much interested in you go ahead good luck henry cameron had had a relapse and the doctor warned his sister that no recovery could be expected she did not believe it she felt a new hope because she saw that cameron lying still in bed looked serene and almost happy a word she had never found it possible to associate with her brother but she was frightened one evening when he said suddenly call howard ask him to come here in the three years since his retirement he had never called for roark he had merely waited for roarks visits roark arrived within an hour he sat by the side of camerons bed and cameron talked to him as usual he did not mention the special invitation and did not explain the night was warm and the window of camerons bedroom stood open to the dark garden when he noticed in a pause between sentences the silence of the trees outside the unmoving silence of late hours cameron called his sister and said fix the couch in the living room for howard hes staying here roark looked at him and understood roark inclined his head in agreement he could acknowledge what cameron had just declared to him only by a quiet glance as solemn as camerons roark remained at the house for three days no reference was made to his staying here nor to how long he would have to stay his presence was accepted as a natural fact requiring no comment miss cameron understood and knew that she must say nothing she moved about silently with the meek courage of resignation cameron did not want roarks continuous presence in his room he would say go out take a walk through the garden howard its beautiful the grass is coming up he would lie in bed and watch with contentment through the open window roarks figure moving among the bare trees that stood against a pale blue sky he asked only that roark eat his meals with him miss cameron would put a tray on camerons knees and serve roarks meal on a small table by the bed cameron seemed to take pleasure in what he had never had nor sought a sense of warmth in performing a daily routine the sense of family on the evening of the third day cameron lay back on his pillow talking as usual but the words came slowly and he did not move his head roark listened and concentrated on not showing that he knew what went on in the terrible pauses between camerons words the words sounded natural and the strain they cost was to remain camerons last secret as he wished cameron spoke about the future of building materials watch the light metals industry howard in a few years youll see them do some astounding things watch the plastics theres a whole new era coming from that youll find new tools new means new forms youll have to show the damn fools what wealth the human brain has made for them what possibilities last week i read about a new kind of composition tile and ive thought of a way to use it where nothing else would do take for instance a small house about five thousand dollars after a while he stopped and remained silent his eyes closed then roark heard him whisper suddenly gail wynand roark leaned closer to him bewildered i dont hate anybody any more only gail wynand no ive never laid eyes on him but he represents everything thats wrong with the world the triumph of overbearing vulgarity its gail wynand that youll have to fight howard then he did not speak for a long time when he opened his eyes again he smiled he said i know what youre going through at your office just now roark had never spoken to him of that no dont deny and dont say anything i know but its all right dont be afraid do you remember the day when i tried to fire you forget what i said to you then it was not the whole story this is dont be afraid it was worth it his voice failed and he could not use it any longer but the faculty of sight remained untouched and he could lie silently and look at roark without effort he died half an hour later keating saw catherine often he had not announced their engagement but his mother knew and it was not a precious secret of his own any longer catherine thought at times that he had dropped the sense of significance in their meetings she was spared the loneliness of waiting for him but she had lost the reassurance of his inevitable returns keating had told her lets wait for the results of that movie competition katie it wont be long theyll announce the decision in may if i win ill be set for life then well be married and thats when ill meet your uncle and hell want to meet me and ive got to win i know youll win besides old heyer wont last another month the doctor told us that we can expect a second stroke at any time and that will be that if it doesnt get him to the graveyard itll certainly get him out of the office oh peter i dont like to hear you talk like that you mustnt be so so terribly selfish im sorry dear well yes i guess im selfish everybody is he spent more time with dominique dominique watched him complacently as if he presented no further problem to her she seemed to find him suitable as an inconsequential companion for an occasional inconsequential evening he thought that she liked him he knew that this was not an encouraging sign he forgot at times that she was francons daughter he forgot all the reasons that prompted him to want her he felt no need to be prompted he wanted her he needed no reasons now but the excitement of her presence yet he felt helpless before her he refused to accept the thought that a woman could remain indifferent to him but he was not certain even of her indifference he waited and tried to guess her moods to respond as he supposed she wished him to respond he received no answer on a spring night they attended a ball together they danced and he drew her close he stressed the touch of his fingers on her body he knew that she noticed and understood she did not withdraw she looked at him with an unmoving glance that was almost expectation when they were leaving he held her wrap and let his fingers rest on her shoulders she did not move or draw the wrap closed she waited she let him lift his hands then they walked together down to the cab she sat silently in a corner of the cab she had never before considered his presence important enough to require silence she sat her legs crossed her wrap gathered tightly her fingertips beating in slow rotation against her knee he closed his hand softly about her forearm she did not resist she did not answer only her fingers stopped beating his lips touched her hair it was not a kiss he merely let his lips rest against her hair for a long time when the cab stopped he whispered dominique let me come up for just a moment yes she answered the word was flat impersonal with no sound of invitation but she had never allowed it before he followed her his heart pounding there was one fragment of a second as she entered her apartment when she stopped waiting he stared at her helplessly bewildered too happy he noticed the pause only when she was moving again walking away from him into the drawing room she sat down and her hands fell limply one at each side her arms away from her body leaving her unprotected her eyes were half closed rectangular empty dominique he whispered dominique how lovely you are then he was beside her whispering incoherently dominique dominique i love you dont laugh at me please dont laugh my whole life anything you wish dont you know how beautiful you are dominique i love you he stopped with his arms around her and his face over hers to catch some hint of response or resistance he saw nothing he jerked her violently against him and kissed her lips his arms fell open he let her body fall back against the seat and he stared at her aghast it had not been a kiss he had not held a woman in his arms what he had held and kissed had not been alive her lips had not moved in answer against his her arms had not moved to embrace him it was not revulsion he could have understood revulsion it was as if he could hold her forever or drop her kiss her again or go further to satisfy his desire and her body would not know it would not notice it she was looking at him past him she saw a cigarette stub that had fallen off a tray on a table beside her she moved her hand and slipped the cigarette back into the tray dominique he whispered stupidly didnt you want me to kiss you yes she was not laughing at him she was answering simply and helplessly havent you ever been kissed before yes many times do you always act like that always just like that why did you want me to kiss you i wanted to try it youre not human dominique she lifted her head she got up and the sharp precision of the movement was her own again he knew he would hear no simple confessing helplessness in her voice he knew the intimacy was ended even though her words when she spoke were more intimate and revealing than anything she had said but she spoke as if she did not care what she revealed or to whom i suppose im one of those freaks you hear about an utterly frigid woman im sorry peter you see you have no rivals but that includes you also a disappointment darling you youll outgrow it some day im really not so young peter twentyfive it must be an interesting experience to sleep with a man ive wanted to want it i should think it would be exciting to become a dissolute woman i am you know in everything but in fact peter you look as if you were going to blush in a moment and thats very amusing dominique havent you ever been in love at all not even a little i havent i really wanted to fall in love with you i thought it would be convenient id have no trouble with you at all but you see i cant feel anything i cant feel any difference whether its you or alvah scarret or lucius heyer he got up he did not want to look at her he walked to a window and stood staring out his hands clasped behind his back he had forgotten his desire and her beauty but he remembered now that she was francons daughter dominique will you marry me he knew he had to say it now if he let himself think of her he would never say it what he felt for her did not matter any longer he could not let it stand between him and his future and what lie felt for her was growing into hatred youre not serious she asked he turned to her he spoke rapidly easily he was lying now and so he was sure of himself and it was not difficult i love you dominique im crazy about you give me a chance if theres no one else why not youll learn to love me because i understand you ill be patient ill make you happy she shuddered suddenly and then she laughed she laughed simply completely he saw the pale form of her dress trembling she stood straight her head thrown back like a string shaking with the vibrations of a blinding insult to him an insult because her laughter was not bitter or mocking but quite simply gay then it stopped she stood looking at him she said earnestly peter if i ever want to punish myself for something terrible if i ever want to punish myself disgustingly ill marry you she added consider it a promise ill wait no matter what reason you choose for it then she smiled gaily the cold gay smile he dreaded really peter you dont have to do it you know youll get that partnership anyway and well always be good friends now its time for you to go home dont forget youre taking me to the horse show wednesday oh yes were going to the horse show wednesday i adore horse shows good night peter he left and walked home through the warm spring night he walked savagely if at that moment someone had offered him sole ownership of the firm of francon heyer at the price of marrying dominique he would have refused it he knew also hating himself that he would not refuse if it were offered to him on the following morning this was fear this was what one feels in nightmares thought peter keating only then one awakens when it becomes unbearable but he could neither awaken nor bear it any longer it had been growing for days for weeks and now it had caught him this lewd unspeakable dread of defeat he would lose the competition he was certain that he would lose it and the certainty grew as each day of waiting passed he could not work he jerked when people spoke to him he had not slept for nights he walked toward the house of lucius heyer he tried not to notice the faces of the people he passed but he had to notice he had always looked at people and people looked at him as they always did he wanted to shout at them and tell them to turn away to leave him alone they were staring at him he thought because he was to fail and they knew it he was going to heyers house to save himself from the coming disaster in the only way he saw left to him if he failed in that competition and he knew he was to fail francon would be shocked and disillusioned then if heyer died as he could die at any moment francon would hesitate in the bitter aftermath of a public humiliation to accept keating as his partner if francon hesitated the game was lost there were others waiting for the opportunity bennett whom he had been unable to get out of the office claude stengel who had been doing very well on his own and had approached francon with an offer to buy heyers place keating had nothing to count on except francons uncertain faith in him once another partner replaced heyer it would be the end of keatings future he had come too close and had missed that was never forgiven through the sleepless nights the decision had become clear and hard in his mind he had to close the issue at once he had to take advantage of francons deluded hopes before the winner of the competition was announced he had to force heyer out and take his place he had only a few days left he remembered francons gossip about heyers character he looked through the files in heyers office and found what he had hoped to find it was a letter from a contractor written fifteen years ago it stated merely that the contractor was enclosing a check for twenty thousand dollars due mr heyer keating looked up the records for that particular building it did seem that the structure had cost more than it should have cost that was the year when heyer had started his collection of porcelain he found heyer alone in his study it was a small dim room and the air in it seemed heavy as if it had not been disturbed for years the dark mahogany paneling the tapestries the priceless pieces of old furniture were kept faultlessly clean but the room smelt somehow of indigence and of decay there was a single lamp burning on a small table in a corner and five delicate precious cups of ancient porcelain on the table heyer sat hunched examining the cups in the dim light with a vague pointless enjoyment he shuddered a little when his old valet admitted keating and he blinked in vapid bewilderment but he asked keating to sit down when he heard the first sounds of his own voice keating knew he had lost the fear that had followed him on his way through the streets his voice was cold and steady tim davis he thought claude stengel and now just one more to be removed he explained what he wanted spreading upon the still air of the room one short concise complete paragraph of thought perfect as a gem with clean edges and so unless you inform francon of your retirement tomorrow morning he concluded holding the letter by a corner between two fingers this goes to the aga he waited heyer sat still with his pale bulging eyes blank and his mouth open in a perfect circle keating shuddered and wondered whether he was speaking to an idiot then heyers mouth moved and his pale pink tongue showed flickering against his lower teeth but i dont want to retire he said it simply guilelessly in a little petulant whine you will have to retire i dont want to im not going to im a famous architect ive always been a famous architect i wish people would stop bothering me they all want me to retire ill tell you a secret he leaned forward he whispered slyly you may not know it but i know he cant deceive me guy wants me to retire he thinks hes outwitting me but i can see through him thats a good one on guy he giggled softly i dont think you understood me do you understand this keating pushed the letter into heyers halfclosed fingers he watched the thin sheet trembling as heyer held it then it dropped to the table and heyers left hand with the paralyzed fingers jabbed at it blindly purposelessly like a hook he said gulping you cant send this to the aga theyll have my license taken away certainly said keating they will and it will be in the papers in all of them you cant do that im going to unless you retire heyers shoulders drew down to the edge of the table his head remained above the edge timidly as if he were ready to draw it also out of sight you wont do that please you wont heyer mumbled in one long whine without pauses youre a nice boy youre a very nice boy you wont do it will you the yellow square of paper lay on the table heyers useless left hand reached for it crawling slowly over the edge keating leaned forward and snatched the letter from under his hand heyer looked at him his head bent to one side his mouth open he looked as if he expected keating to strike him with a sickening pleading glance that said he would allow keating to strike him please whispered heyer you wont do that will you i dont feel very well ive never hurt you i seem to remember i did something very nice for you once what snapped keating what did you do for me your names peter keating peter keating i remember i did something nice for you youre the boy guy has so much faith in dont trust guy i dont trust him but i like you well make you a designer one of these days his mouth remained hanging open on the word a thin strand of saliva trickled down from the corner of his mouth please dont keatings eyes were bright with disgust aversion goaded him on he had to make it worse because he couldnt stand it youll be exposed publicly said keating the sounds of his voice glittering youll be denounced as a grafter people will point at you theyll print your picture in the papers the owners of that building will sue you theyll throw you in jail heyer said nothing he did not move keating heard the cups on the table tinkling suddenly he could not see the shaking of heyers body he heard a thin glassy ringing in the silence of the room as if the cups were trembling of themselves get out said keating raising his voice not to hear that sound get out of the firm what do you want to stay for youre no good youve never been any good the yellow face at the edge of the table opened its mouth and made a wet gurgling sound like a moan keating sat easily leaning forward his knees spread apart one elbow resting on his knee the hand hanging down swinging the letter i heyer choked i shut up youve got nothing to say except yes or no think fast now im not here to argue with you heyer stopped trembling a shadow cut diagonally across his face keating saw one eye that did not blink and half a mouth open the darkness flowing in through the hole into the face as if it were drowning answer me keating screamed frightened suddenly why dont you answer me the halfface swayed and he saw the head lurch forward it fell down on the table and went on and rolled to the floor as it cut off two of the cups fell after it cracking softly to pieces on the carpet the first thing keating felt was relief to see that the body had followed the head and lay crumpled in a heap on the floor intact there had been no sound only the muffled musical bursting of porcelain hell be furious thought keating looking down at the cups he had jumped to his feet he was kneeling gathering the pieces pointlessly he saw that they were broken beyond repair he knew he was thinking also at the same time that it had come that second stroke they had been expecting and that he would have to do something about it in a moment but that it was all right because heyer would have to retire now then he moved on his knees closer to heyers body he wondered why he did not want to touch it mr heyer he called his voice was soft almost respectful he lifted heyers head cautiously he let it drop he heard no sound of its falling he heard the hiccough in his own throat heyer was dead he sat beside the body his buttocks against his heels his hands spread on his knees he looked straight ahead his glance stopped on the folds of the hangings by the door he wondered whether the gray sheen was dust or the nap of velvet and was it velvet and how oldfashioned it was to have hangings by a door then he felt himself shaking he wanted to vomit he rose walked across the room and threw the door open because he remembered that there was the rest of the apartment somewhere and a valet in it and he called trying to scream for help keating came to the office as usual he answered questions he explained that heyer had asked him that day to come to his house after dinner heyer had wanted to discuss the matter of his retirement no one doubted the story and keating knew that no one ever would heyers end had come as everybody had expected it to come francon felt nothing but relief we knew he would sooner or later said francon why regret that he spared himself and all of us a prolonged agony keatings manner was calmer than it had been for weeks it was the calm of blank stupor the thought followed him gentle unstressed monotonous at his work at home at night he was a murderer no but almost a murderer almost a murderer he knew that it had not been an accident he knew he had counted on the shock and the terror he had counted on that second stroke which would send heyer to the hospital for the rest of his days but was that all he had expected hadnt he known what else a second stroke could mean had he counted on that he tried to remember he tried wringing his mind dry he felt nothing he expected to feel nothing one way or another only he wanted to know he did not notice what went on in the office around him he forgot that he had but a short time left to close the deal with francon about the partnership a few days after heyers death francon called him to his office sit down peter he said with a brighter smile than usual well i have some good news for you kid they read luciuss will this morning he had no relatives left you know well i was surprised i didnt give him enough credit i guess but it seems he could make a nice gesture on occasion hes left everything to you pretty grand isnt it now you wont have to worry about investment when we make arrangements for whats the matter peter peter my boy are you sick keatings face fell upon his arm on the corner of the desk he could not let francon see his face he was going to be sick sick because through the horror he had caught himself wondering how much heyer had actually left the will had been made out five years ago perhaps in a senseless spurt of affection for the only person who had shown heyer consideration in the office perhaps as a gesture against his partner it had been made and forgotten the estate amounted to two hundred thousand dollars plus heyers interest in the firm and his porcelain collection keating left the office early that day not hearing the congratulations he went home told the news to his mother left her gasping in the middle of the living room and locked himself in his bedroom he went out saying nothing before dinner he had no dinner that night but he drank himself into a ferocious lucidity at his favorite speakeasy and in that heightened state of luminous vision his head nodding over a glass but his mind steady he told himself that he had nothing to regret he had done what anyone would have done catherine had said it he was selfish everybody was selfish it was not a pretty thing to be selfish but he was not alone in it he had merely been luckier than most he had been because he was better than most he felt fine he hoped the useless questions would never come back to him again every man for himself he muttered falling asleep on the table the useless questions never came back to him again he had no time for them in the days that followed he had won the cosmoslotnick competition peter keating had known it would be a triumph but he had not expected the thing that happened he had dreamed of a sound of trumpets he had not foreseen a symphonic explosion it began with the thin ringing of a telephone announcing the names of the winners then every phone in the office joined in screaming bursting from under the fingers of the operator who could barely control the switchboard calls from every paper in town from famous architects questions demands for interviews congratulations then the flood rushed out of the elevators poured through the office doors the messages the telegrams the people keating knew the people he had never seen before the reception clerk losing all sense not knowing whom to admit or refuse and keating shaking hands an endless stream of hands like a wheel with soft moist cogs flapping against his fingers he did not know what he said at that first interview with francons office full of people and cameras francon had thrown the doors of his liquor cabinet wideopen francon gulped to all these people that the cosmoslotnick building had been created by peter keating alone francon did not care he was magnanimous in a spurt of enthusiasm besides it made a good story it made a better story than francon had expected from the pages of newspapers the face of peter keating looked upon the country the handsome wholesome smiling face with the brilliant eyes and the dark curls it headed columns of print about poverty struggle aspiration and unremitting toil that had won their reward about the faith of a mother who had sacrificed everything to her boys success about the cinderella of architecture cosmoslotnick were pleased they had not thought that prizewinning architects could also be young handsome and poor well so recently poor they had discovered a boy genius cosmoslotnick adored boy geniuses mr slotnick was one himself being only fortythree keatings drawings of the most beautiful skyscraper on earth were reproduced in the papers with the words of the award underneath for the brilliant skill and simplicity of its plan for its clean ruthless efficiency for its ingenious economy of space for the masterful blending of the modern with the traditional in art to francon heyer and peter keating keating appeared in newsreels shaking hands with mr shupe and mr slotnick and the subtitle announced what these two gentlemen thought of his building keating appeared in newsreels shaking hands with miss dimples williams and the subtitle announced what he thought of her current picture he appeared at architectural banquets and at film banquets in the place of honor and he had to make speeches forgetting whether he was to speak of buildings or of movies he appeared at architectural clubs and at fan clubs cosmoslotnick put out a composite picture of keating and of his building which could be had for a selfaddressed stamped envelope and two bits he made a personal appearance each evening for a week on the stage of the cosmo theater with the first run of the latest cosmoslotnick special he bowed over the footlights slim and graceful in a black tuxedo and he spoke for two minutes on the significance of architecture he presided as judge at a beauty contest in atlantic city the winner to be awarded a screen test by cosmoslotnick he was photographed with a famous prizefighter under the caption champions a scale model of his building was made and sent on tour together with the photographs of the best among the other entries to be exhibited in the foyers of cosmoslotnick theaters throughout the country mrs keating had sobbed at first clasped peter in her arms and gulped that she could not believe it she had stammered answering questions about petey and she had posed for pictures embarrassed eager to please then she became used to it she told peter shrugging that of course he had won it was nothing to gape at no one else could have won she acquired a brisk little tone of condescension for the reporters she was distinctly annoyed when she was not included in the photographs taken of petey she acquired a mink coat keating let himself be carried by the torrent he needed the people and the clamor around him there were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces the air was heavy compact saturated with a single solvent admiration there was no room for anything else he was great great as the number of people who told him so he was right right at the number of people who believed it he looked at the faces at the eyes he saw himself born in them he saw himself being granted the gift of life that was peter keating that the reflection in those staring pupils and his body was only its reflection he found time to spend two hours with catherine one evening he held her in his arms and she whispered radiant plans for their future he glanced at her with contentment he did not hear her words he was thinking of how it would look if they were photographed like this together and in how many papers it would be syndicated he saw dominique once she was leaving the city for the summer dominique was disappointing she congratulated him quite correctly but she looked at him as she had always looked as if nothing had happened of all architectural publications her column had been the only one that had never mentioned the cosmoslotnick competition or its winner im going to connecticut she told him im taking over fathers place down there for the summer hes letting me have it all to myself no peter you cant come to visit me not even once im going there so i wont have to see anybody he was disappointed but it did not spoil the triumph of his days he was not afraid of dominique any longer he felt confident that he could bring her to change her attitude that he would see the change when she came back in the fall but there was one thing which did spoil his triumph not often and not too loudly he never tired of hearing what was said about him but he did not like to hear too much about his building and when he had to hear it he did not mind the comments on the masterful blending of the modern with the traditional in its facade but when they spoke of the plan and they spoke so much of the plan when he heard about the brilliant skill and simplicity the clean ruthless efficiency the ingenious economy of space when he heard it and thought of he did not think it there were no words in his brain he would not allow them there was only a heavy dark feeling and a name for two weeks after the award he pushed this thing out of his mind as a thing unworthy of his concern to be buried as his doubting humble past was buried all winter long he had kept his own sketches of the building with the pencil lines cut across them by anothers hands on the evening of the award he had burned them it was the first thing he had done but the thing would not leave him then he grasped suddenly that it was not a vague threat but a practical danger and he lost all fear of it he could deal with a practical danger he could dispose of it quite simply he chuckled with relief he telephoned roarks office and made an appointment to see him he went to that appointment confidently for the first time in his life he felt free of the strange uneasiness which he had never been able to explain or escape in roarks presence he felt safe now he was through with howard roark roark sat at the desk in his office waiting the telephone had rung once that morning but it had been only peter keating asking for an appointment he had forgotten now that keating was coming he was waiting for the telephone he had become dependent on that telephone in the last few weeks he was to hear at any moment about his drawings for the manhattan bank company his rent on the office was long since overdue so was the rent on the room where he lived he did not care about the room he could tell the landlord to wait the landlord waited it would not have mattered greatly if he had stopped waiting but it mattered at the office he told the rental agent that he would have to wait he did not ask for the delay he only said flatly quietly that there would be a delay which was all he knew how to do but his knowledge that he needed his alms from the rental agent that too much depended on it and made it sound like begging in his own mind that was torture all right he thought its torture what of it the telephone bill was overdue for two months he had received the final warning the telephone was to be disconnected in a few days he had to wait so much could happen in a few days the answer of the bank board which weidler had promised him long ago had been postponed from week to week the board could reach no decision there had been objectors and there had been violent supporters there had been conferences weidler told him eloquently little but he could guess much there had been days of silence of silence in the office of silence in the whole city of silence within him he waited he sat slumped across the desk his face on his arm his fingers on the stand of the telephone he thought dimly that he should not sit like that but he felt very tired today he thought that he should take his hand off that phone but he did not move it well yes he depended on that phone he could smash it but he would still depend on it he and every breath in him and every bit of him his fingers rested on the stand without moving it was this and the mail he had lied to himself also about the mail he had lied when he had forced himself not to leap as a rare letter fell through the slot in the door not to run forward but to wait to stand looking at me white envelope on the floor then to walk to it slowly and pick it up the slot in the door and the telephone there was nothing else left to him of the world he raised his head as he thought of it to look down at the door at the foot of the door there was nothing it was late in the afternoon probably past the time of the last delivery he raised his wrist to glance at his watch he saw his bare wrist the watch had been pawned he turned to the window there was a clock he could distinguish on a distant tower it was half past four there would be no other delivery today he saw that his hand was lifting the telephone receiver his fingers were dialing the number no not yet weidlers voice told him over the wire we had that meeting scheduled for yesterday but it had to be called off im keeping after them like a bulldog i can promise you that well have a definite answer tomorrow i can almost promise you if not tomorrow then it will have to wait over the week end but by monday i promise it for certain youve been wonderfully patient with us mr roark we appreciate it roark dropped the receiver he closed his eyes he thought he would allow himself to rest just to rest blankly like this for a few minutes before he would begin to think of what the date on the telephone notice had been and in what way he could manage to last until monday hello howard said peter keating he opened his eyes keating had entered and stood before him smiling he wore a light tan spring coat thrown open the loops of its belt like handles at his sides a blue cornflower in his buttonhole he stood his legs apart his fists on his hips his hat on the back of his head his black curls so bright and crisp over his pale forehead that one expected to see drops of spring dew glistening on them as on the cornflower hello peter said roark keating sat down comfortably took his hat off dropped it in the middle of the desk and clasped one hand over each knee with a brisk little slap well howard things are happening arent they congratulations thanks whats the matter howard you look like hell surely youre not overworking yourself from what i hear this was not the manner he had intended to assume he had planned the interview to be smooth and friendly well he decided hed switch back to that later but first he had to show that he was not afraid of roark that hed never be afraid again no im not overworking look howard why dont you drop it that was something he had not intended saying at all his mouth remained open a little in astonishment drop what the pose oh the ideals if you prefer why dont you come down to earth why dont you start working like everybody else why dont you stop being a damn fool he felt himself rolling down a hill without brakes he could not stop whats the matter peter how do you expect to get along in the world you have to live with people you know there are only two ways you can join them or you can fight them but you dont seem to be doing either no not either and people dont want you they dont want you arent you afraid no you havent worked for a year and you wont wholl ever give you work you might have a few hundreds left and then its the end thats wrong peter i have fourteen dollars left and fiftyseven cents well and look at me i dont care if its crude to say that myself thats not the point im not boasting it doesnt matter who says it but look at me remember how we started then look at us now and then think that its up to you just drop that fool delusion that youre better than everybody else and go to work in a year youll have an office thatll make you blush to think of this dump youll have people running after you youll have clients youll have friends youll have an army of draftsmen to order around hell howard its nothing to me what can it mean to me but this time im not fishing for anything for myself in fact i know that youd make a dangerous competitor but ive got to say this to you just think howard think of it youll be rich youll be famous youll be respected youll be praised youll be admired youll be one of us well say something why dont you say something he saw that roarks eyes were not empty and scornful but attentive and wondering it was close to some sort of surrender for roark because he had not dropped the iron sheet in his eyes because he allowed his eyes to be puzzled and curious and almost helpless look peter i believe you i know that you have nothing to gain by saying this i know more than that i know that you dont want me to succeed its all right im not reproaching you ive always known it you dont want me ever to reach these things youre offering me and yet youre pushing me on to reach them quite sincerely and you know that if i take your advice ill reach them and its not love for me because that wouldnt make you so angry and so frightened peter what is it that disturbs you about me as i am i dont know whispered rearing he understood that it was a confession that answer of his and a terrifying one he did not know the nature of what he had confessed and he felt certain that roark did not know it either but the thing had been bared they could not grasp it but they felt its shape and it made them sit silently facing each other in astonishment in resignation pull yourself together peter said roark gently as to a comrade well never speak of that again then keating said suddenly his voice clinging in relief to the bright vulgarity of its new tone aw hell howard i was only talking good plain horse sense now if you wanted to work like a normal person shut up snapped roark keating leaned back exhausted he had nothing else to say he had forgotten what he had come here to discuss now said roark what did you want to tell me about the competition keating jerked forward he wondered what had made roark guess that and then it became easier because he forgot the rest in a sweeping surge of resentment oh yes said keating crisply a bright edge of irritation in the sound of his voice yes i did want to speak to you about that thanks for reminding me of course youd guess it because you know that im not an ungrateful swine i really came here to thank you howard i havent forgotten that you had a share in that building you did give me some advice on it id be the first one to give you part of the credit thats not necessary oh its not that id mind but im sure you wouldnt want me to say anything about it and im sure you dont want to say anything yourself because you know how it is people are so funny they misinterpret everything in such a stupid way but since im getting part of the award money i thought its only fair to let you have some of it im glad that it comes at a time when you need it so badly he produced his billfold pulled from it a check he had made out in advance and put it down on the desk it read pay to the order of howard roark the sum of five hundred dollars thank you peter said roark taking the check then he turned it over took his fountain pen wrote on the back pay to the order of peter keating signed and handed the check to keating and heres my bribe to you peter he said for the same purpose to keep your mouth shut keating stared at him blankly thats all i can offer you now said roark you cant extort anything from me at present but later when ill have money id like to ask you please not to blackmail me im telling you frankly that you could because i dont want anyone to know that i had anything to do with that building he laughed at the slow look of comprehension on keatings face no said roark you dont want to blackmail me on that go home peter youre perfectly safe ill never say a word about it its yours the building and every girder of it and every foot of plumbing and every picture of your face in the papers then keating jumped to his feet he was shaking god damn you he screamed god damn you who do you think you are who told you that you could do this to people so youre too good for that building you want to make me ashamed of it you rotten lousy conceited bastard who are you you dont even have the wits to know that youre a flop an incompetent a beggar a failure a failure a failure and you stand there pronouncing judgment you against the whole country you against everybody why should i listen to you you cant frighten me you cant touch me i have the whole world with me dont stare at me like that ive always hated you you didnt know that did you ive always hated you i always will ill break you some day i swear i will if its the last thing i do peter said roark why betray so much keatings breath failed on a choked moan he slumped down on a chair he sat still his hands clasping the sides of the seat under him after a while he raised his head he asked woodenly oh god howard what have i been saying are you all right now can you go howard im sorry i apologize if you want me to his voice was raw and dull without conviction i lost my head guess im just unstrung i didnt mean any of it i dont know why i said it honestly i dont fix your collar its unfastened i guess i was angry about what you did with that check but i suppose you were insulted too im sorry im stupid like that sometimes i didnt mean to offend you well just destroy the damn thing he picked up the check struck a match cautiously watched the paper burn till he had to drop the last scrap howard well forget it dont you think youd better go now keating rose heavily his hands poked about in a few useless gestures and he mumbled well well good night howard i ill see you soon its because so muchs happened to me lately guess i need a rest so long howard when he stepped out into the hall and closed the door behind him keating felt an icy sense of relief he felt heavy and very tired but drearily sure of himself he had acquired the knowledge of one thing he hated roark it was not necessary to doubt and wonder and squirm in uneasiness any longer it was simple he hated roark the reasons it was not necessary to wonder about the reasons it was necessary only to hate to hate blindly to hate patiently to hate without anger only to hate and let nothing intervene and not let oneself forget ever the telephone rang late on monday afternoon mr roark said weidler can you come right over i dont want to say anything over the phone but get here at once the voice sounded clear gay radiantly premonitory roark looked at the window at the clock on the distant tower he sat laughing at that clock as at a friendly old enemy he would not need it any longer he would have a watch of his own again he threw his head back in defiance to that pale gray dial hanging high over the city he rose and reached for his coat he threw his shoulders back slipping the coat on he felt pleasure in the jolt of his muscles in the street outside he took a taxi which he could not afford the chairman of the board was waiting for him in his office with weidler and with the vicepresident of the manhattan bank company there was a long conference table in the room and roarks drawings were spread upon it weidler rose when he entered and walked to meet him his hand outstretched it was in the air of the room like an overture to the words weidler uttered and roark was not certain of the moment when he heard them because he thought he had heard them the instant he entered well mr roark the commissions yours said weidler roark bowed it was best not to trust his voice for a few minutes the chairman smiled amiably inviting him to sit down roark sat down by the side of the table that supported his drawings his hand rested on the table the polished mahogany felt warm and living under his fingers it was almost as if he were pressing his hand against the foundations of his building his greatest building fifty stories to rise in the center of manhattan i must tell you the chairman was saying that weve had a hell of a fight over that building of yours thank god its over some of our members just couldnt swallow your radical innovations you know how stupidly conservative some people are but weve found a way to please them and we got their consent mr weidler here was really magnificently convincing on your behalf a great deal more was said by the three men roark barely heard it he was thinking of the first bite of machine into earth that begins an excavation then he heard the chairman saying and so its yours on one minor condition he heard that and looked at the chairman its a small compromise and when you agree to it we can sign the contract its only an inconsequential matter of the buildings appearance i understand that you modernists attach no great importance to a mere facade its the plan that counts with you quite rightly and we wouldnt think of altering your plan in any way its the logic of the plan that sold us on the building so im sure you wont mind what do you want its only a matter of a slight alteration in the facade ill show you our mr parkers son is studying architecture and we had him draw us up a sketch just a rough sketch to illustrate what we had in mind and to show the members of the board because they couldnt have visualized the compromise we offered here it is he pulled a sketch from under the drawings on the table and handed it to roark it was roarks building on the sketch very neatly drawn it was his building but it had a simplified doric portico in front a cornice on top and his ornament was replaced by a stylized greek ornament roark got up he had to stand he concentrated on the effort of standing it made the rest easier he leaned on one straight arm his hand closed over the edge of the table the tendons showing under the skin of his wrist you see the point said the chairman soothingly our conservatives simply refused to accept a queer stark building like yours and they claim that the public wont accept it either so we hit upon the middle course in this way though its not traditional architecture of course it will give the public the impression of what theyre accustomed to it adds a certain air of sound stable dignity and thats what we want in a bank isnt it it does seem to be an unwritten law that a bank must have a classic portico and a bank is not exactly the right institution to parade lawbreaking and rebellion undermines that intangible feeling of confidence you know people dont trust novelty but this is the scheme that pleased everybody personally i wouldnt insist on it but i really dont see that it spoils anything and thats what the board has decided of course we dont mean that we want you to follow this sketch but it gives you our general idea and youll work it out yourself make your own adaptation of the classic motive to the facade then roark answered the men could not classify the tone of his voice they could not decide whether it was too great a calm or too great an emotion they concluded that it was calm because the voice moved forward evenly without stress without color each syllable spaced as by a machine only the air in the room was not the air that vibrates to a calm voice they concluded that there was nothing abnormal in the manner of the man who was speaking except the fact that his right hand would not leave the edge of the table and when he had to move the drawings he did it with his left hand like a man with one arm paralyzed he spoke for a long time he explained why this structure could not have a classic motive on its facade he explained why an honest building like an honest man had to be of one piece and one faith what constituted the life source the idea in any existing thing or creature and why if one smallest part committed treason to that idea the thing of the creature was dead and why the good the high and the noble on earth was only that which kept its integrity the chairman interrupted him mr roark i agree with you theres no answer to what youre saying but unfortunately in practical life one cant always be so flawlessly consistent theres always the incalculable human element of emotion we cant fight that with cold logic this discussion is actually superfluous i can agree with you but i cant help you the matter is closed it was the boards final decision after more than usually prolonged consideration as you know will you let me appear before the board and speak to them im sorry mr roark but the board will not reopen the question for further debate it was final i can only ask you to state whether you agree to accept the commission on our terms or not i must admit that the board has considered the possibility of your refusal in which case the name of another architect one gordon l prescott has been mentioned most favorably as an alternative but i told the board that i felt certain you would accept he waited roark said nothing you understand the situation mr roark yes said roark his eyes were lowered he was looking down at the drawings well roark did not answer yes or no mr roark roarks head leaned back he closed his eyes no said roark after a while the chairman asked do you

moved a little pressing them to his body he said that was the most selfish thing youve ever seen a man do he walked back to his office he gathered his drawing instruments and the few things he had there it made one package and he carried it under his arm he locked the door and gave the key to the rental agent he told the agent that he was closing his office he walked home and left the package

youll like that sure ill go see him we wont be telling him who you are just a friend of mine thats all thanks mike mike reached for his coat and then his hands fell back and he looked at the floor red it will be all right mike roark walked home it was dark and the street was deserted there was a strong wind he could feel the cold whistling pressure strike his cheeks it was the only evidence of the flow ripping the air nothing moved in the stone corridor about him there was not a tree to stir no curtains no awnings only naked masses of stone glass asphalt and sharp corners it was strange to feel that fierce movement against his face but in a trash basket on a corner a crumpled sheet of newspaper was rustling beating convulsively against the wire mesh it made the wind real in the evening two days later roark left for connecticut from the train he looked back once at the skyline of the city as it flashed into sight and was held for some moments beyond the windows the twilight had washed off the details of the buildings they rose in thin shafts of a soft porcelain blue a color not of real things but of evening and distance they rose in bare outlines like empty molds waiting to be filled the distance had flattened the city the single shafts stood immeasurably tall out of scale to the rest of the earth they were of their own world and they held up to the sky the statement of what man had conceived and made possible they were empty molds but man had come so far he could go farther the city on the edge of the sky held a question and a promise little pinheads of light flared up about the peak of one famous tower in the windows of the star roof restaurant then the train swerved around a bend and the city vanished that evening in the banquet hall of the star roof restaurant a dinner was held to celebrate the admittance of peter keating to partnership in the firm to be known henceforward as francon keating at the long table that seemed covered not with a tablecloth but with a sheet of light sat guy francon somehow tonight he did not mind the streaks of silver that appeared on his temples they sparkled crisply against the black of his hair and they gave him an air of cleanliness and elegance like the rigid white of his shirt against his black evening clothes in the place of honor sat peter keating he leaned back his shoulders straight his hand closed about the stem of a glass his black curls glistened against his white forehead in that one moment of silence the guests felt no envy no resentment no malice there was a grave feeling of brotherhood in the room in the presence of the pale handsome boy who looked solemn as at his first communion ralston holcombe had risen to speak he stood his glass in hand he had prepared his speech but he was astonished to hear himself saying something quite different in a voice of complete sincerity he said we are the guardians of a great human function perhaps of the greatest function among the endeavors of man we have achieved much and we have erred often but we are willing in all humility to make way for our heirs we are only men and we are only seekers but we seek for truth with the best there is in our hearts we seek with what there is of the sublime granted to the race of men it is a great quest to the future of american architecture part two ellsworth m toohey to hold his fists closed tight as if the skin of his palms had grown fast to the steel he clasped to keep his feet steady pressed down hard the flat rock an upward thrust against his soles not to feel the existence of his body but only a few clots of tension his knees his wrists his shoulders and the drill he held to feel the drill trembling in a long convulsive shudder to feel his stomach trembling his lungs trembling the straight lines of the stone ledges before him dissolving into jagged streaks of trembling to feel the drill and his body gathered into the single will of pressure that a shaft of steel might sink slowly into granite this was all of life for howard roark as it had been in the days of the two months behind him he stood on the hot stone in the sun his face was scorched to bronze his shirt stuck in long damp patches to his back the quarry rose about him in flat shelves breaking against one another it was a world without curves grass or soil a simplified world of stone planes sharp edges and angles the stone had not been made by patient centuries welding the sediment of winds and tides it had come from a molten mass cooling slowly at unknown depth it had been flung forced out of the earth and it still held the shape of violence against the violence of the men on its ledges the straight planes stood witness to the force of each cut the drive of each blow had run in an unswerving line the stone had cracked open in unbending resistance drills bored forward with a low continuous drone the tension of the sound cutting through nerves through skulls as if the quivering tools were shattering slowly both the stone and the men who held them he liked the work he felt at times as if it were a match of wrestling between his muscles and the granite he was very tired at night he liked the emptiness of his bodys exhaustion each evening he walked the two miles from the quarry to the little town where the workers lived the earth of the woods he crossed was soft and warm under his feet it was strange after a day spent on the granite ridges he smiled as at a new pleasure each evening and looked down to watch his feet crushing a surface that responded gave way and conceded faint prints to be left behind there was a bathroom in the garret of the house where he roomed the paint had peeled off the floor long ago and the naked boards were graywhite he lay in the tub for a long time and let the cool water soak the stone dust out of his skin he let his head hang back on the edge of the tub his eyes closed the greatness of the weariness was its own relief it allowed no sensation but the slow pleasure of the tension leaving his muscles he ate his dinner in a kitchen with other quarry workers he sat alone at a table in a corner the fumes of the grease crackling eternally on the vast gas range hid the rest of the room in a sticky haze he ate little he drank a great deal of water the cold glittering liquid in a clean glass was intoxicating he slept in a small wooden cube under the roof the boards of the ceiling slanted down over his bed when it rained he could hear the burst of each drop against the roof and it took an effort to realize why he did not feel the rain beating against his body sometimes after dinner he would walk into the woods that began behind the house he would stretch down on the ground on his stomach his elbows planted before him his hands propping his chin and he would watch the patterns of veins on the green blades of grass under his face he would blow at them and watch the blades tremble then stop again he would roll over on his back and lie still feeling the warmth of the earth under him far above the leaves were still green but it was a thick compressed green as if the color were condensed in one last effort before the dusk coming to dissolve it the leaves hung without motion against a sky of polished lemon yellow its luminous pallor emphasized that its light was failing he pressed his hips his back into the earth under him the earth resisted but it gave way it was a silent victory he felt a dim sensuous pleasure in the muscles of his legs sometimes not often he sat up and did not move for a long time then he smiled the slow smile of an executioner watching a victim he thought of his days going by of the buildings he could have been doing should have been doing and perhaps never would be doing again he watched the pains unsummoned appearance with a cold detached curiosity he said to himself well here it is again he waited to see how long it would last it gave him a strange hard pleasure to watch his fight against it and he could forget that it was his own suffering he could smile in contempt not realizing that he smiled at his own agony such moments were rare but when they came he felt as he did in the quarry that he had to drill through granite that he had to drive a wedge and blast the thing within him which persisted in calling to his pity dominique francon lived alone that summer in the great colonial mansion of her fathers estate three miles beyond the quarry town she received no visitors an old caretaker and his wife were the only human beings she saw not too often and merely of necessity they lived some distance from the mansion near the stables the caretaker attended to the grounds and the horses his wife attended to the house and cooked dominiques meals the meals were served with the gracious severity the old woman had learned in the days when dominiques mother lived and presided over the guests in that great dining room at night dominique found her solitary place at the table laid out as for a formal banquet the candles lighted the tongues of yellow flame standing motionless like the shining metal spears of a guard of honor the darkness stretched the room into a hall the big windows rose like a flat colonnade of sentinels a shallow crystal bowl stood in a pool of light in the center of the long table with a single water lily spreading white petals about a heart yellow like a drop of candle fire the old woman served the meal in unobtrusive silence and disappeared from the house as soon as she could afterward when dominique walked up the stairs to her bedroom she found the fragile lace folds of her nightgown laid out on the bed in the morning she entered her bathroom and found water in the sunken bathtub the hyacinth odor of her bath sails the aquamarine tiles polished shining under her feet her huge towels spread out like snowdrifts to swallow her body yet she heard no steps and felt no living presence in the house the old womans treatment of dominique had the same reverent caution with which she handled the pieces of venetian glass in the drawingroom cabinets dominique had spent so many summers and winters surrounding herself with people in order to feel alone that the experiment of actual solitude was an enchantment to her and a betrayal into a weakness she had never allowed herself the weakness of enjoying it she stretched her arms and let them drop lazily feeling a sweet drowsy heaviness above her elbows as after a first drink she was conscious of her summer dresses she felt her knees her thighs encountering the faint resistance of cloth when she moved and it made her conscious not of the cloth but of her knees and thighs the house stood alone amidst vast grounds and the woods stretched beyond there were no neighbors for miles she rode on horseback down long deserted roads down hidden paths leading nowhere leaves glittered in the sun and twigs snapped in the wind of her flying passage she caught her breath at times from the sudden feeling that something magnificent and deadly would meet her beyond the next turn of the road she could give no identity to what she expected she could not say whether it was a sight a person or an event she knew only its quality the sensation of a defiling pleasure sometimes she started on foot from the house and walked for miles setting herself no goal and no hour of return cars passed her on the road the people of the quarry town knew her and bowed to her she was considered the chatelaine of the countryside as her mother had been long ago she turned off the road into the woods and walked on her arms swinging loosely her head thrown back watching the tree tops she saw clouds swimming behind the leaves it looked as if a giant tree before her were moving slanting ready to fall and crush her she stopped she waited her head thrown back her throat pulled tight she felt as if she wanted to be crushed then she shrugged and went on she flung thick branches impatiently out of her way and let them scratch her bare arms she walked on long after she was exhausted she drove herself forward against the weariness of her muscles then she fell down on her back and lay still her arms and legs flung out like a cross on the ground breathing in release feeling empty and flattened feeling the weight of the air like a pressure against her breasts some mornings when she awakened in her bedroom she heard the explosions of blasting at the granite quarry she stretched her arms flung back above her head on the white silk pillow and she listened it was the sound of destruction and she liked it because the sun was too hot that morning and she knew it would be hotter at the granite quarry because she wanted to see no one and knew she would face a gang of workers dominique walked to the quarry the thought of seeing it on that blazing day was revolting she enjoyed the prospect when she came out of the woods to the edge of the great stone bowl she felt as if she were thrust into an execution chamber filled with scalding steam the heat did not come from the sun but from that broken cut in the earth from the reflectors of flat ridges her shoulders her head her back exposed to the sky seemed cool while she felt the hot breath of the stone rising up her legs to her chin to her nostrils the air shimmered below sparks of fire shot through the granite she thought the stone was stirring melting running in white trickles of lava drills and hammers cracked the still weight of the air it was obscene to see men on the shelves of the furnace they did not look like workers they looked like a chain gang serving an unspeakable penance for some unspeakable crime she could not turn away she stood as an insult to the place below her dress the color of water a pale greenblue too simple and expensive its pleats exact like edges of glass her thin heels planted wide apart on the boulders the smooth helmet of her hair the exaggerated fragility of her body against the sky flaunted the fastidious coolness of the gardens and drawing rooms from which she came she looked down her eyes stopped on the orange hair of a man who raised his head and looked at her she stood very still because her first perception was not of sight but of touch the consciousness not of a visual presence but of a slap in the face she held one hand awkwardly away from her body the fingers spread wide on the air as against a wall she knew that she could not move until he permitted her to she saw his mouth and the silent contempt in the shape of his mouth the planes of his gaunt hollow cheeks the cold pure brilliance of the eyes that had no trace of pity she knew it was the most beautiful face she would ever see because it was the abstraction of strength made visible she felt a convulsion of anger of protest of resistance and of pleasure he stood looking up at her it was not a glance but an act of ownership she thought she must let her face give him the answer he deserved but she was looking instead at the stone dust on his burned arms the wet shirt clinging to his ribs the lines of his long legs she was thinking of those statues of men she had always sought she was wondering what he would look like naked she saw him looking at her as if he knew that she thought she had found an aim in life a sudden sweeping hatred for that man she was first to move she turned and walked away from him she saw the superintendent of the quarry on the path ahead and she waved the superintendent rushed forward to meet her why miss francon he cried why how do you do miss francon she hoped the words were heard by the man below for the first time in her life she was glad of being miss francon glad of her fathers position and possessions which she had always despised she thought suddenly that the man below was only a common worker owned by the owner of this place and she was almost the owner of this place the superintendent stood before her respectfully she smiled and said i suppose ill inherit the quarry some day so i thought i should show some interest in it once in a while the superintendent preceded her down the path displayed his domain to her explained the work she followed him far to the other side of the quarry she descended to the dusty green dell of the work sheds she inspected the bewildering machinery she allowed a convincingly sufficient time to elapse then she walked back alone down the edge of the granite bowl she saw him from a distance as she approached he was working she saw one strand of red hair that fell over his face and swayed with the trembling of the drill she thought hopefully that the vibrations of the drill hurt him hurt his body everything inside his body when she was on the rocks above him he raised his head and looked at her she had not caught him noticing her approach he looked up as if he expected her to be there as if he knew she would be back she saw the hint of a smile more insulting than words he sustained the insolence of looking straight at her he would not move he would not grant the concession of turning away of acknowledging that he had no right to look at her in such manner he had not merely taken that right he was saying silently that she had given it to him she turned sharply and walked on down the rocky slope away from the quarry it was not his eyes not his mouth that she remembered but his hands the meaning of that day seemed held in a single picture she had noted the simple instant of his one hand resting against granite she saw it again his fingertips pressed to the stone his long fingers continuing the straight lines of the tendons that spread in a fan from his wrist to his knuckles she thought of him but the vision present through all her thoughts was the picture of that hand on the granite it frightened her she could not understand it hes only a common worker she thought a hired man doing a convicts labor she thought of that sitting before the glass shelf of her dressing table she looked at the crystal objects spread before her they were like sculptures in ice they proclaimed her own cold luxurious fragility and she thought of his strained body of his clothes drenched in dust and sweat of his hands she stressed the contrast because it degraded her she leaned back closing her eyes she thought of the many distinguished men whom she had refused she thought of the quarry worker she thought of being broken not by a man she admired but by a man she loathed she let her head fall down on her arm the thought left her weak with pleasure for two days she made herself believe that she would escape from this place she found old travel folders in her trunk studied them chose the resort the hotel and the particular room in that hotel selected the train she would take the boat and the number of the stateroom she found a vicious amusement in doing that because she knew she would not take this trip she wanted she would go back to the quarry she went back to the quarry three days later she stopped over the ledge where he worked and she stood watching him openly when he raised his head she did not turn away her glance told him she knew the meaning of her action but did not respect him enough to conceal it his glance told her only that he had expected her to come he bent over his drill and went on with his work she waited she wanted him to look up she knew that he knew it he would not look again she stood watching his hands waiting for the moments when he touched stone she forgot the drill and the dynamite she liked to think of the granite being broken by his hands she heard the superintendent calling her name hurrying to her up the path she turned to him when he approached i like to watch the men working she explained yes quite a picture isnt it the superintendent agreed theres the train starting over there with another load she was not watching the train she saw the man below looking at her she saw the insolent hint of amusement tell her that he knew she did not want him to look at her now she turned her head away the superintendents eyes traveled over the pit and stopped on the man below them hey you down there he shouted are you paid to work or to gape the man bent silently over his drill dominique laughed aloud the superintendent said its a tough crew we got down here miss francon some of em even with jail records has that man a jail record she asked pointing down well i couldnt say wouldnt know them all by sight she hoped he had she wondered whether they whipped convicts nowadays she hoped they did at the thought of it she felt a sinking gasp such as she had felt in childhood in dreams of falling down a long stairway but she felt the sinking in her stomach she turned brusquely and left the quarry she came back many days later she saw him unexpectedly on a flat stretch of stone before her by the side of the path she stopped short she did not want to come too close it was strange to see him before her without the defense and excuse of distance he stood looking straight at her their understanding was too offensively intimate because they had never said a word to each other she destroyed it by speaking to him why do you always stare at me she asked sharply she thought with relief that words were the best means of estrangement she had denied everything they both knew by naming it for a moment he stood silently looking at her she felt terror at the thought that he would not answer that he would let his silence tell her too clearly why no answer was necessary but he answered he said for the same reason youve been staring at me i dont know what youre talking about if you didnt youd be much more astonished and much less angry miss francon so you know my name youve been advertising it loudly enough youd better not be insolent i can have you fired at a moments notice you know he turned his head looking for someone among the men below he asked shall i call the superintendent she smiled contemptuously no of course not it would be too simple but since you know who i am it would be better if you stopped looking at me when i come here it might be misunderstood i dont think so she turned away she had to control her voice she looked over the stone ledges she asked do you find it very hard to work here yes terribly do you get tired inhumanly how does that feel i can hardly walk when the days ended i cant move my arms at night when i lie in bed i can count every muscle in my body to the number of separate different pains she knew suddenly that he was not telling her about himself he was speaking of her he was saying the things she wanted to hear and telling her that he knew why she wanted to hear these particular sentences she felt anger a satisfying anger because it was cold and certain she felt also a desire to let her skin touch his to let the length of her bare arm press against the length of his just that the desire went no further she was asking calmly you dont belong here do you you dont talk like a worker what were you before an electrician a plumber a plasterer many things why are you working here for the money youre paying me miss francon she shrugged she turned and walked away from him up the path she knew that he was looking after her she did not glance back she continued on her way through the quarry and she left it as soon as she could but she did not go back down the path where she would have to see him again dominique awakened each morning to the prospect of a day made significant by the existence of a goal to be reached the goal of making it a day on which she would not go to the quarry she had lost the freedom she loved she knew that a continuous struggle against the compulsion of a single desire was compulsion also but it was the form she preferred to accept it was the only manner in which she could let him motivate her life she found a dark satisfaction in pain because that pain came from him she went to call on he distant neighbors a wealthy gracious family who had bored her in new york she had visited no one all summer they were astonished and delighted to see her she sat among a group of distinguished people at the edge of a swimming pool she watched the air of fastidious elegance around her she watched the deference of these peoples manner when they spoke to her she glanced at her own reflection in the pool she looked more delicately austere than any among them and she thought with a vicious thrill of what these people would do if they read her mind in this moment if they knew that she was thinking of a man in a quarry thinking of his body with a sharp intimacy as one does not think of anothers body but only of ones own she smiled the cold purity of her face prevented them from seeing the nature of that smile she came back again to visit these people for the same of such thoughts in the presence of their respect for her one evening a guest offered to drive her back to her house he was an eminent young poet he was pale and slender he had a soft sensitive mouth and eyes hurt by the whole universe she had not noticed the wistful attention with which he had watched her for a long time as they drove through the twilight she saw him leaning hesitantly closer to her she heard his voice whispering the pleading incoherent things she had heard from many men he stopped the car she felt his lips pressed to her shoulder she jerked away from him she sat still for an instant because she would have to brush against him if she moved and she could not bear to touch him then she flung the door open she leaped out she slammed the door behind her as if the crash of sound could wipe him out of existence and she ran blindly she stopped running after a while and she walked on shivering walked down the dark road until she saw the roof line of her own house she stopped looking about her with her first coherent thought of astonishment such incidents had happened to her often in the past only then she had been amused she had felt no revulsion she had felt nothing she walked slowly across the lawn to the house on the stairs to her room she stopped she thought of the man in the quarry she thought in clear formed words that the man in the quarry wanted her she had known it before she had known it with his first glance at her but she had never stated the knowledge to herself she laughed she looked about her at the silent splendor of her house the house made the words preposterous she knew that would never happen to her and she knew the kind of suffering she could impose on him for days she walked with satisfaction through the rooms of her house it was her defense she heard the explosions of blasting from the quarry and smiled but she felt too certain and the house was too safe she felt a desire to underscore the safety by challenging it she chose the marble slab in front of the fireplace in her bedroom she wanted it broken she knelt hammer in hand and tried to smash the marble she pounded it her thin arm sweeping high over her head crashing down with ferocious helplessness she felt the pain in the bones of her arms in her shoulder sockets she succeeded in making a long scratch across the marble she went to the quarry she saw him from a distance and walked straight to him hello she said casually he stopped the drill he leaned against a stone shelf he answered hello i have been thinking of you she said softly and stopped then added her voice flowing on in the same tone of compelling invitation because theres a bit of a dirty job to be done at my house would you like to make some extra money certainly miss francon will you come to my house tonight the way to the servants entrance is off ridgewood road theres a marble piece at a fireplace thats broken and has to be replaced i want you to take it out and order a new one made for me she expected anger and refusal he asked what time shall i come at seven oclock what are you paid here sixtytwo cents an hour im sure youre worth that im quite willing to pay you at the same rate do you know how to find my house no miss francon just ask anyone in the village to direct you yes miss francon she walked away disappointed she felt that their secret understanding was lost he had spoken as if it were a simple job which she could have offered to any other workman then she felt the sinking gasp inside that feeling of shame and pleasure which he always gave her she realized that their understanding had been more intimate and flagrant than ever in his natural acceptance of an unnatural offer he had shown her how much he knew by his lack of astonishment she asked her old caretaker and his wife to remain in the house that evening their diffident presence completed the picture of a feudal mansion she heard the bell of the servants entrance at seven oclock the old woman escorted him to the great front hall where dominique stood on the landing of a broad stairway she watched him approaching looking up at her she held the pose long enough to let him suspect that it was a deliberate pose deliberately planned she broke it at the exact moment before he could become certain of it she said good evening her voice was austerely quiet he did not answer but inclined his head and walked on up the stairs toward her he wore his work clothes and he carried a bag of tools his movements had a swift relaxed kind of energy that did not belong here in her house on the polished steps between the delicate rigid banisters she had expected him to seem incongruous in her house but it was the house that seemed incongruous around him she moved one hand indicating the door of her bedroom he followed obediently he did not seem to notice the room when he entered he entered it as if it were a workshop he walked straight to the fireplace there it is she said one finger pointing to the marble slab he said nothing he knelt took a thin metal wedge from his bag held its point against the scratch on the slab took a hammer and struck one blow the marble split in a long deep cut he glanced up at her it was the look she dreaded a look of laughter that could not be answered because the laughter could not be seen only felt he said now its broken and has to be replaced she asked calmly would you know what kind of marble this is and where to order another piece like it yes miss francon go ahead then take it out yes miss francon she stood watching him it was strange to feel a senseless necessity to watch the mechanical process of the work as if her eyes were helping it then she knew that she was afraid to look at the room around them she made herself raise her head she saw the shelf of her dressing table its glass edge like a narrow green satin ribbon in the semidarkness and the crystal containers she saw a pair of white bedroom slippers a pale blue towel on the floor by a mirror a pair of stockings thrown over the arm of a chair she saw the white satin cover of her bed his shirt had damp stains and gray patches of stone dust the dust made streaks on the skin of his arms she felt as if each object in the room had been touched by him as if the air were a heavy pool of water into which they had been plunged together and the water that touched him carried the touch to her to every object in the room she wanted him to look up he worked without raising his head she approached him and stood silently over him she had never stood so close to him before she looked down at the smooth skin on the back of his neck she could distinguish single threads of his hair she glanced down at the tip of her sandal it was there on the floor an inch away from his body she needed but one movement a very slight movement of her foot to touch him she made a step back he moved his head but not to look up only to pick another tool from the bag and bent over his work again she laughed aloud he stopped and glanced at her yes he asked her face was grave her voice gentle when she answered oh im sorry you might have thought that i was laughing at you but i wasnt of course she added i didnt want to disturb you im sure youre anxious to finish and get out of here i mean of course because you must be tired but then on the other hand im paying you by the hour so its quite all right if you stretch your time a little if you want to make more out of it there must be things youd like to talk about oh yes miss francon well i think this is an atrocious fireplace really this house was designed by my father yes of course miss francon theres no point in your discussing the work of an architect none at all surely we could choose some other subject yes miss francon she moved away from him she sat down on the bed leaning back on straight arms her legs crossed and pressed close together in a long straight line her body sagging limply from her shoulders contradicted the inflexible precision of the legs the cold austerity of her face contradicted the pose of her body he glanced at her occasionally as he worked he was speaking obediently he was saying i shall make certain to get a piece of marble of precisely the same quality miss francon it is very important to distinguish between the various kinds of marble generally speaking there are three kinds the white marbles which are derived from the recrystallization of limestone the onyx marbles which are chemical deposits of calcium carbonate and the green marbles which consist mainly of hydrous magnesium silicate or serpentine this last must not be considered as true marble true marble is a metamorphic form of limestone produced by heat and pressure pressure is a powerful factor it leads to consequences which once started cannot be controlled what consequences she asked leaning forward the recrystallization of the particles of limestone and the infiltration of foreign elements from the surrounding soil these constitute the colored streaks which are to be found in most marbles pink marble is caused by the presence of manganese oxides gray marble is due to carbonaceous matter yellow marble is attributed to a hydrous oxide of iron this piece here is of course white marble there are a great many varieties of white marble you should be very careful miss francon she sat leaning forward gathered into a dim black huddle the lamp light fell on one hand she had dropped limply on her knees palm up the fingers halfclosed a thin edge of fire outlining each finger the dark cloth of her dress making the hand too naked and brilliant to make certain that i order a new piece of precisely the same quality it would not be advisable for instance to substitute a piece of white georgia marble which is not as finegrained as the white marble of alabama this is alabama marble very high grade very expensive he saw her hand close and drop down out of the light he continued his work in silence when he had finished he rose asking where shall i put the stone leave it there ill have it removed ill order a new piece cut to measure and delivered to you cod do you wish me to set it yes certainly ill let you know when it comes how much do i owe you she glanced at a clock on her bedside table let me see youve been here three quarters of an hour thats fortyeight cents she reached for her bag she took out the dollar bill she handed it to him keep the change she said she hoped he would throw it back in her face he slipped the bill into his pocket he said thank you miss francon he saw the edge of her long black sleeve trembling over her closed fingers good night she said her voice hollow in anger he bowed good night miss francon he turned and walked down the stairs out of the house she stopped thinking of him she thought of the piece of marble he had ordered she waited for it to come with the feverish intensity of a sudden mania she counted the days she watched the rare trucks on the road beyond the lawn she told herself fiercely that she merely wanted the marble to come just that nothing else no hidden reasons no reasons at all it was a last hysterical aftermath she was free of everything else the stone would come and that would be the end when the stone came she barely glanced at it the delivery truck had not left the grounds when she was at her desk writing a note on a piece of exquisite stationery she wrote the marble is here i want it set tonight she sent her caretaker with the note to the quarry she ordered it delivered to i dont know his name the redheaded workman who was here the caretaker came back and brought her a scrap torn from a brown paper bag bearing in pencil youll have it set tonight she waited in the suffocating emptiness of impatience at the window of her bedroom the servants entrance bell rang at seven oclock there was a knock at her door come in she snapped to hide the strange sound of her own voice the door opened and the caretakers wife entered motioning for someone to follow the person who followed was a short squat middleaged italian with bow legs a gold hoop in one ear and a frayed hat held respectfully in both hands the man sent from the quarry miss francon said the caretakers wife dominique asked her voice not a scream and not a question who are you pasquale orsini the man answered obediently bewildered what do you want well i well red down at the quarry said fireplace gotta be fixed he said you wanta i fix her yes yes of course she said rising i forgot go ahead she had to get out of the room she had to run not to be seen by anyone not to be seen by herself if she could escape it she stopped somewhere in the garden and stood trembling pressing her fists against her eyes it was anger it was a pure single emotion that swept everything clean everything but the terror under the anger terror because she knew that she could not go near the quarry now and that she would go it was early evening many days later when she went to the quarry she returned on horseback from a long ride through the country and she saw the shadows lengthening on the lawn she knew that she could not live through another night she had to get there before the workers left she wheeled about she rode to the quarry flying the wind cutting her cheeks he was not there when she reached the quarry she knew at once that he was not there even though the workers were just leaving and a great many of them were filing down the paths from the stone bowl she stood her lips tight and she looked for him but she knew that he had left she rode into the woods she flew at random between walls of leaves that melted ahead in the gathering twilight she stopped broke a long thin branch off a tree tore the leaves off and went on using the flexible stick as a whip lashing her horse to fly faster she felt as if the speed would hasten the evening on force the hours ahead to pass more quickly let her leap across time to catch the coming morning before it came and then she saw him walking alone on the path before her she tore ahead she caught up with him and stopped sharply the jolt throwing her forward then back like the release of a spring he stopped they said nothing they looked at each other she thought that every silent instant passing was a betrayal this wordless encounter was too eloquent this recognition that no greeting was necessary she asked her voice flat why didnt you come to set the marble i didnt think it would make any difference to you who came or did it miss francon she felt the words not as sounds but as a blow flat against her mouth the branch she held went up and slashed across his face she started off in the sweep of the same motion dominique sat at the dressing table in her bedroom it was very late there was no sound in the vast empty house around her the french windows of the bedroom were open on a terrace and there was no sound of leaves in the dark garden beyond the blankets on her bed were turned down waiting for her the pillow white against the tall black windows she thought she would try to sleep she had not seen him for three days she ran her hands over her head the curves of her palms pressing against the smooth planes of hair she pressed her fingertips wet with perfume to the hollows of her temples and held them there for a moment she felt relief in the cold contracting bite of the liquid on her skin a spilled drop of perfume remained on the glass of the dressing table a drop sparkling like a gem and as expensive she did not hear the sound of steps in the garden she heard them only when they rose up the stairs to the terrace she sat up frowning she looked at the french windows he came in he wore his work clothes the dirty shirt with rolled sleeves the trousers smeared with stone dust he stood looking at her there was no laughing understanding in his face his face was drawn austere in cruelty ascetic in passion the cheeks sunken the lips pulled down set tight she jumped to her feet she stood her arms thrown back her fingers spread apart he did not move she saw a vein of his neck rise beating and fall down again then he walked to her he held her as if his flesh had cut through hers and she felt the bones of his arms on the bones of her ribs her legs jerked tight against his his mouth on hers she did not know whether the jolt of terror shook her first and she thrust her elbows at his throat twisting her body to escape or whether she lay still in his arms in the first instant in the shock of feeling his skin against hers the thing she had thought about had expected had never known to be like this could not have known because this was not part of living but a thing one could not bear longer than a second she tried to tear herself away from him the effort broke against his arms that had not felt it her fists beat against his shoulders against his face he moved one hand took her two wrists pinned them behind her under his arm wrenching her shoulder blades she twisted her head back she felt his lips on her breast she tore herself free she fell back against the dressing table she stood crouching her hands clasping the edge behind her her eyes wide colorless shapeless in terror he was laughing there was the movement of laughter on his face but no sound perhaps he had released her intentionally he stood his legs apart his arms hanging at his sides letting her be more sharply aware of his body across the space between them than she had been in his arms she looked at the door behind him he saw the first hint of movement no more than a thought of leaping toward that door he extended his arm not touching her and fell back her shoulders moved faintly rising he took a step forward and her shoulders fell she huddled lower closer to the table he let her wait then he approached he lifted her without effort she let her teeth sink into his hand and felt blood on the tip of her tongue he pulled her head back and he forced her mouth open against his she fought like an animal but she made no sound she did not call for help she heard the echoes of her blows in a gasp of his breath and she knew that it was a gasp of pleasure she reached for the lamp on the dressing table he knocked the lamp out of her hand the crystal burst to pieces in the darkness he had thrown her down on the bed and she felt the blood beating in her throat in her eyes the hatred the helpless terror in her blood she felt the hatred and his hands his hands moving over her body the hands that broke granite she fought in a last convulsion then the sudden pain shot up through her body to her throat and she screamed then she lay still it was an act that could be performed in tenderness as a seal of love or in contempt as a symbol of humiliation and conquest it could be the act of a lover or the act of a soldier violating an enemy woman he did it as an act of scorn not as love but as defilement and this made her lie still and submit one gesture of tenderness from him and she would have remained cold untouched by the thing done to her body but the act of a master taking shameful contemptuous possession of her was the kind of rapture she had wanted then she felt him shaking with the agony of a pleasure unbearable even to him she knew that she had given that to him that it came from her from her body and she bit her lips and she knew what he had wanted her to know he lay still across the bed away from her his head hanging back over the edge she heard the slow ending gasps of his breath she lay on her back as he had left her not moving her mouth open she felt empty light and flat she saw him get up she saw his silhouette against the window he went out without a word or a glance at her she noticed that but it did not matter she listened blankly to the sound of his steps moving away in the garden she lay still for a long time then she moved her tongue in her open mouth she heard a sound that came from somewhere within her and it was the dry short sickening sound of a sob but she was not crying her eyes were held paralyzed dry and open the sound became motion a jolt running down her throat to her stomach it flung her up she stood awkwardly bent over her forearms pressed to her stomach she heard the small table by the bed rattling in the darkness and she looked at it in empty astonishment that a table should move without reason then she understood that she was shaking she was not frightened it seemed foolish to shake like that in short separate jerks like soundless hiccoughs she thought she must take a bath the need was unbearable as if she had felt it for a long time nothing mattered if only she would take a bath she dragged her feet slowly to the door of her bathroom she turned the light on in the bathroom she saw herself in a tall mirror she saw the purple bruises left on her body by his mouth she heard a moan muffled in her throat not very loud it was not the sight but the sudden flash of knowledge she knew that she would not take a bath she knew that she wanted to keep the feeling of his body the traces of his body on hers knowing also what such a desire implied she fell on her knees clasping the edge of the bathtub she could not make herself crawl over that edge her hands slipped she lay still on the floor the tiles were hard and cold under her body she lay there till morning roark awakened in the morning and thought that last night had been like a point reached like a stop in the movement of his life he was moving forward for the sake of such stops like the moments when he had walked through the halffinished heller house like last night in some unstated way last night had been what building was to him in some quality of reaction within him in what it gave to his consciousness of existence they had been united in an understanding beyond the violence beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action had she meant less to him he would not have taken her as he did had he meant less to her she would not have fought so desperately the unrepeatable exultation was in knowing that they both understood this he went to the quarry and he worked that day as usual she did not come to the quarry and he did not expect her to come but the thought of her remained he watched it with curiosity it was strange to be conscious of another persons existence to feel it as a close urgent necessity a necessity without qualifications neither pleasant nor painful merely final like an ultimatum it was important to know that she existed in the world it was important to think of her of how she had awakened this morning of how she moved with her body still his now his forever of what she thought that evening at dinner in the sooted kitchen he opened a newspaper and saw the name of roger enright in the lines of a gossip column he read the short paragraph it looks like another grand project on its way to the wastebasket roger enright the oil king seems to be stumped this time hell have to call a halt to his latest pipe dream of an enright house architect trouble we are told seems as if half a dozen of the big building boys have been shown the gate by the unsatisfiable mr enright topnotchers all of them roark felt the wrench he had tried so often to fight not to let it hurt him too much the wrench of helplessness before the vision of what he could do what should have been possible and was closed to him then without reason he thought of dominique francon she had no relation to the things in his mind he was shocked only to know that she could remain present even among these things a week passed then one evening he found a letter waiting for him at home it had been forwarded from his former office to his last new york address from there to mike from mike to connecticut the engraved address of an oil company on the envelope meant nothing to him he opened the letter he read dear mr roark i have been endeavoring for some time to get in touch with you but have been unable to locate you please communicate with me at your earliest convenience i should like to discuss with you my proposed enright house if you are the man who built the fargo store sincerely yours roger enright half an hour later roark was on a train when the train started moving he remembered dominique and that he was leaving her behind the thought seemed distant and unimportant he was astonished only to know that he still thought of her even now she could accept thought dominique and come to forget in time everything that had happened to her save one memory that she had found pleasure in the thing which had happened that he had known it and more that he had known it before he came to her and that he would not have come but for that knowledge she had not given him the one answer that would have saved her an answer of simple revulsion she had found joy in her revulsion in her terror and in his strength that was the degradation she had wanted and she hated him for it she found a letter one morning waiting for her on the breakfast table it was from alvah scarret when are you coming back dominique i cant tell you how much we miss you here youre not a comfortable person to have around im actually scared of you but i might as well inflate your inflated ego some more at a distance and confess that were all waiting for you impatiently it will be like the homecoming of an empress she read it and smiled she thought if they knew those people that old life and that awed reverence before her person ive been raped ive been raped by some redheaded hoodlum from a stone quarry i dominique francon through the fierce sense of humiliation the words gave her the same kind of pleasure she had felt in his arms she thought of it when she walked through the countryside when she passed people on the road and the people bowed to her the chatelaine of the town she wanted to scream it to the hearing of all she was not conscious of the days that passed she felt content in a strange detachment alone with the words she kept repeating to herself then one morning standing on the lawn in her garden she understood that a week had passed and that she had not seen him for a week she turned and walked rapidly across the lawn to the road she was going to the quarry she walked the miles to the quarry down the road bareheaded in the sun she did not hurry it was not necessary to hurry it was inevitable to see him again she had no purpose the need was too great to name a purpose afterward there were other things hideous important things behind her and rising vaguely in her mind but first above all just one thing to see him again she came to the quarry and she looked slowly carefully stupidly about her stupidly because the enormity of what she saw would not penetrate her brain she saw at once that he was not there the work was in full swing the sun was high over the busiest hour of the day there was not an idle man in sight but he was not among the men she stood waiting numbly for a long time then she saw the foreman and she motioned for him to approach good afternoon miss francon lovely day miss francon isnt it just like the middle of summer again and yet falls not far away yes falls coming look at the leaves miss francon she asked there was a man you had here a man with very bright orange hair where is he oh yes that one hes gone gone quit left for new york i think very suddenly too when a week ago why no just yesterday who was then she stopped she was going to ask who was he she asked instead who was working here so late last night i heard blasting that was for a special order for mr francons building the cosmoslotnick building you know a rash job yes i see sorry it disturbed you miss francon oh not at all she walked away she would not ask for his name it was her last chance of freedom she walked swiftly easily in sudden relief she wondered why she had never noticed that she did not know his name and why she had never asked him perhaps because she had known everything she had to know about him from that first glance she thought one could not find some nameless worker in the city of new york she was safe if she knew his name she would be on her way to new york now the future was simple she had nothing to do except never to ask for his name she had a reprieve she had a chance to fight she would break it or it would break her if it did she would ask for his name when peter keating entered the office the opening of the door sounded like a single high blast on a trumpet the door flew forward as if it had opened of itself to the approach of a man before whom all doors were to open in such manner his day in the office began with the newspapers there was a neat pile of them waiting stacked on his desk by his secretary he liked to see what new mentions appeared in print about the progress of the cosmoslotnick building or the firm of francon keating there were no mentions in the papers this morning and keating frowned he saw however a story about ellsworth m toohey it was a startling story thomas l foster noted philanthropist had died and had left among larger bequests the modest sum of one hundred thousand dollars to ellsworth m toohey my friend and spiritual guide in appreciation of his noble mind and true devotion to humanity ellsworth m toohey had accepted the legacy and had turned it over intact to the workshop of social study a progressive institute of learning where he held the post of lecturer on art as a social symptom he had given the simple explanation that he did not believe in the institution of private inheritance he had refused all further comment no my friends he had said not about this and had added with his charming knack for destroying the earnestness of his own moment i like to indulge in the luxury of commenting solely upon interesting subjects i do not consider myself one of these peter keating read the story and because he knew that it was an action which he would never have committed he admired it tremendously then he thought with a familiar twinge of annoyance that he had not been able to meet ellsworth toohey toohey had left on a lecture tour shortly after the award in the cosmoslotnick competition and the brilliant gatherings keating had attended ever since were made empty by the absence of the one man hed been most eager to meet no mention of keatings name had appeared in tooheys column keating turned hopefully as he did each morning to one small voice in the banner but one small voice was subtitled songs and things today and was devoted to proving the superiority of folk songs over any other forms of musical art and of choral singing over any other manner of musical rendition keating dropped the banner he got up and paced viciously across the office because he had to turn now to a disturbing problem he had been postponing it for several mornings it was the matter of choosing a sculptor for the cosmoslotnick building months ago the commission for the giant statue of industry to stand in the main lobby of the building had been awarded tentatively to steven mallory the award had puzzled keating but it had been made by mr slotnick so keating had approved of it he had interviewed mallory and said in recognition of your unusual ability of course you have no name but you will have after a commission like this they dont come every day like this building of mine he had not liked mallory mallorys eyes were like black holes left after a fire not quite put out and mallory had not smiled once he was twentyfour years old had had one show of his work but not many commissions his work was strange and too violent keating remembered that ellsworth toohey had said once long ago in one small voice mr mallorys human figures would have been very fine were it not for the hypothesis that god created the world and the human form had mr mallory been entrusted with the job he might perhaps have done better than the almighty if we are to judge by what he passes as human bodies in stone or would he keating had been baffled by mr slotnicks choice until he heard that dimples williams had once lived in the same greenwich village tenement with steven mallory and mr slotnick could refuse nothing to dimples williams at the moment mallory had been hired had worked and had submitted a model of his statue of industry when he saw it keating knew that the statue would look like a raw gash like a smear of fire in the neat elegance of his lobby it was a slender naked body of a man who looked as if he could break through the steel plate of a battleship and through any barrier whatever it stood like a challenge it left a strange stamp on ones eyes it made the people around it seem smaller and sadder than usual for the first time in his life looking at that statue keating thought he understood what was meant by the word heroic he said nothing but the model was sent on to mr slotnick and many people said with indignation what keating had felt mr slotnick asked him to select another sculptor and left the choice in his hands keating flopped down in an armchair leaned back and clicked his tongue against his palate he wondered whether he should give the commission to bronson the sculptor who was a friend of mrs shupe wife of the president of cosmo or to palmer who had been recommended by mr huseby who was planning the erection of a new fivemilliondollar cosmetic factory keating discovered that he liked this process of hesitation he held the fate of two men and of many potential others their fate their work their hope perhaps even the amount of food in their stomachs he could choose as he pleased for any reason without reasons he could flip a coin he could count them off on the buttons of his vest he was a great man by the grace of those who depended on him then he noticed the envelope it lay on top of a pile of letters on his desk it was a plain thin narrow envelope but it bore the small masthead of the banner in one corner he reached for it hastily it contained no letter only a strip of proofs for tomorrows banner he saw the familiar one small voice by ellsworth m toohey and under it a single word as subtitle in large spaced letters a single word blatant in its singleness a salute by dint of omission keating he dropped the paper strip and seized it again and read choking upon great unchewed hunks of sentences the paper trembling in his hand the skin on his forehead drawing into tight pink spots toohey had written greatness is an exaggeration and like all exaggerations of dimension it connotes at once the necessary corollary of emptiness one thinks of an inflated toy balloon does one not there are however occasions when we are forced to acknowledge the promise of an approach brilliantly close to what we designate loosely by the term of greatness such a promise is looming on our architectural horizon in the person of a mere boy named peter keating we have heard a great deal and with justice about the superb cosmoslotnick building which he has designed let us glance for once beyond the building at the man whose personality is stamped upon it there is no personality stamped upon that building and in this my friend lies the greatness of the personality it is the greatness of a selfless young spirit that assimilates all things and returns them to the world from which they came enriched by the gentle brilliance of its own talent thus a single man comes to represent not a lone freak but the multitude of all men together to embody the reach of all aspirations in his own those gifted with discrimination will be able to hear the message which peter keating addresses to us in the shape of the cosmoslotnick building to see that the three simple massive ground floors are the solid bulk of our working classes which support all of society that the rows of identical windows offering their panes to the sun are the souls of the common people of the countless anonymous ones alike in the uniformity of brotherhood reaching for the light that the graceful pilasters rising from their firm base in the ground floors and bursting into the gay effervescence of their corinthian capitals are the flowers of culture which blossom only when rooted in the rich soil of the broad masses in answer to those who consider all critics as fiends devoted solely to the destruction of sensitive talent this column wishes to thank peter keating for affording us the rare oh so rare opportunity to prove our delight in our true mission which is to discover young talent when it is there to be discovered and if pete keating should chance to read these lines we expect no gratitude from him the gratitude is ours it was when keating began to read the article for the third time that he noticed a few lines written in red pencil across the space by its title dear peter keating drop in to see me at my office one of these days would love to discover what you look like emt he let the clipping flutter down to his desk and he stood over it running a strand of hair between his fingers in a kind of happy stupor then he whirled around to his drawing of the cosmoslotnick building that hung on the wall between a huge photograph of the parthenon and one of the louvre he looked at the pilasters of his building he had never thought of them as culture flowering from out of the broad masses but he decided that one could very well think that and all the rest of the beautiful stuff then he seized the telephone he spoke to a high flat voice which belonged to ellsworth tooheys secretary and he made an appointment to see toohey at fourthirty of the next afternoon in the hours that followed his daily work assumed a new relish it was as if his usual activity had been only a bright flat mural and had now become a noble basrelief pushed forward given a threedimensional reality by the words of ellsworth toohey guy francon descended from his office once in a while for no ascertainable purpose the subtler shades of his shirts and socks matched the gray of his temples he stood smiling benevolently in silence keating flashed past him in the drafting room and acknowledged his presence not stopping but slowing his steps long enough to plant a crackling bit of newspaper into the folds of the mauve handkerchief in francons breastpocket with read that when you have time guy he added his steps halfway across the next room want to have lunch with me today guy wait for me at the plaza when he came back from lunch keating was stopped by a young draftsman who asked his voice high with excitement say mr keating whos it took a shot at ellsworth toohey keating managed to gasp out who is it did what shot mr toohey who thats what i want to know who shot ellsworth toohey thats what i saw in the paper in the restaurant a guy had didnt have time to get one hes killed thats what i dont know saw only it said about a shot if hes dead does that mean they wont publish his column tomorrow dunno why mr keating go get me a paper but ive got to get me that paper you damned idiot the story was there in the afternoon papers a shot had been fired at ellsworth toohey that morning as he stepped out of his car in front of a radio station where he was to deliver an address on the voiceless and the undefended the shot had missed him ellsworth toohey had remained calm and sane throughout his behavior had been theatrical only in too complete an absence of anything theatrical he had said we cannot keep a radio audience waiting and had hurried on upstairs to the microphone where never mentioning the incident he delivered a halfhours speech from memory as he always did the assailant had said nothing when arrested keating stared his throat dry at the name of the assailant it was steven mallory only the inexplicable frightened keating particularly when the inexplicable lay not in tangible facts but in that causeless feeling of dread within him there was nothing to concern him directly in what had happened except his wish that it had been someone else anyone but steven mallory and that he didnt know why he should wish this steven mallory had remained silent he had given no explanation of his act at first it was supposed that he might have been prompted by despair at the loss of his commission for the cosmoslotnick building since it was learned that he lived in revolting poverty but it was learned beyond any doubt that ellsworth toohey had had no connection whatever with his loss toohey had never spoken to mr slotnick about steven mallory toohey had not seen the statue of industry on this point mallory had broken his silence to admit that he had never met toohey nor seen him in person before nor known any of tooheys friends do you think that mr toohey was in some way responsible for your losing that commission he was asked mallory had answered no then why mallory said nothing toohey had not recognized his assailant when he saw him seized by policemen on the sidewalk outside the radio station he did not learn his name until after the broadcast then stepping out of the studio into an anteroom full of waiting newsmen toohey said no of course i wont press any charges i wish theyd let him go who is he by the way when he heard the name tooheys glance remained fixed somewhere between the shoulder of one man and the hat brim of another then toohey who had stood calmly while a bullet struck an inch from his face against the glass of the entrance door below uttered one word and the word seemed to fall at his feet heavy with fear why no one could answer presently toohey shrugged smiled and said if it was an attempt at free publicity well what atrocious taste but nobody believed this explanation because all felt that toohey did not believe it either through the interviews that followed toohey answered questions gaily he said i had never thought myself important enough to warrant assassination it would be the greatest tribute one could possibly expect if it werent so much in the style of an operetta he managed to convey the charming impression that nothing of importance had happened because nothing of importance ever happened on earth mallory was sent to jail to await trial all efforts to question him failed the thought that kept keating uneasily awake for many hours that night was the groundless certainty that toohey felt exactly as he did he knows thought keating and i know that there is in steven mallorys motive a greater danger than in his murderous attempt but we shall never know his motive or shall we and then he touched the core of fear it was the sudden wish that he might be guarded through the years to come to the end of his life from ever learning that motive ellsworth tooheys secretary rose in a leisurely manner when keating entered and opened for him the door into ellsworth tooheys office keating had grown past the stage of experiencing anxiety at the prospect of meeting a famous man but he experienced it in the moment when he saw the door opening under her hand he wondered what toohey really looked like he remembered the magnificent voice he had heard in the lobby of the strike meeting and he imagined a giant of a man with a rich mane of hair perhaps just turning gray with bold broad features of an ineffable benevolence something vaguely like the countenance of god the father mr peter keating mr toohey said the secretary and closed the door behind him at a first glance upon ellsworth monkton toohey one wished to offer him a heavy wellpadded overcoat so frail and unprotected did his thin little body appear like that of a chicken just emerging from the egg in all the sorry fragility of unhardened bones at a second glance one wished to be sure that the overcoat should be an exceedingly good one so exquisite were the garments covering that body the lines of the dark suit followed frankly the shape within it apologizing for nothing they sank with the concavity of the narrow chest they slid down from the long thin neck with the sharp slope of the shoulders a great forehead dominated the body the wedgeshaped face descended from the broad temples to a small pointed chin the hair was black lacquered divided into equal halves by a thin white line this made the skull look tight and trim but left too much emphasis to the ears that flared out in solitary nakedness like the handles of a bouillon cup the nose was long and thin prolonged by the small dab of a black mustache the eyes were dark and startling they held such a wealth of intellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be worn not to protect his eyes but to protect other men from their excessive brilliance hello peter keating said ellsworth monkton toohey in his compelling magical voice what do you think of the temple of nike apteros how do you do mr toohey said keating stopped stupefied what do i think of what sit down my friend of the temple of nike apteros well well i i feel certain that you couldnt have overlooked that little gem the parthenon has usurped the recognition which and isnt that usually the case the bigger and stronger appropriating all the glory while the beauty of the unprepossessing goes unsung which should have been awarded to that magnificent little creation of the great free spirit of greece youve noted im sure the fine balance of its mass the supreme perfection of its modest proportions ah yes you know the supreme in the modest the delicate craftsmanship of detail yes of course muttered keating thats always been my favorite the temple of nike apteros really said ellsworth toohey with a smile which keating could not quite classify i was certain of it i was certain youd say it you have a very handsome face peter keating when you dont stare like this which is really quite unnecessary and toohey was laughing suddenly laughing quite obviously quite insultingly at keating and at himself it was as if he were underscoring the falseness of the whole procedure keating sat aghast for an instant and then he found himself laughing easily in answer as if at home with a very old friend thats better said toohey dont you find it advisable not to talk too seriously in an important moment and this might be a very important moment who knows for both of us and of course i knew youd be a little afraid of me and oh i admit i was quite a bit afraid of you so isnt this much better oh yes mr toohey said keating happily his normal assurance in meeting people had vanished but he felt at ease as if all responsibility were taken away from him and he did not have to worry about saying the right things because he was being led gently into saying them without any effort on his part ive always known it would be an important moment when i met you mr toohey always for years really said ellsworth toohey the eyes behind the glasses attentive why because id always hoped that i would please you that youd approve of me of my work when the time came why i even yes i even thought so often when drawing is this the kind of building that ellsworth toohey would say is good i tried to see it like that through your eyes i ive toohey listened watchfully ive always wanted to meet you because youre such a profound thinker and a man of such cultural distinc now said toohey his voice kindly but a little impatient his interest had dropped on that last sentence none of that i dont mean to be ungracious but well dispense with that sort of thing shall we unnatural as this may sound i really dont like to hear personal praise it was tooheys eyes thought keating that put him at ease there was such a vast understanding in tooheys eyes and such an unfastidious kindness no what a word to think of such an unlimited kindness it was as if one could hide nothing from him but it was not necessary to hide it because he would forgive anything they were the most unaccusing eyes that keating had ever seen but mr toohey he muttered i did want to you wanted to thank me for my article said toohey and made a little grimace of gay despair and here ive been trying so hard to prevent you from doing it do let me get away with it wont you theres no reason why you should thank me if you happened to deserve the things i said well the credit belongs to you not to me doesnt it but i was so happy that you thought im a great architect but surely my boy you knew that or werent you quite sure never quite sure of it well i it was only a seconds pause and it seemed to keating that this pause was all toohey had wanted to hear from him toohey did not wait for the rest but spoke as if he had received a full answer and an answer that pleased him and as for the cosmoslotnick building who can deny that its an extraordinary achievement you know i was greatly intrigued by its plan its a most ingenious plan a brilliant plan very unusual quite different from what i have observed in your previous work isnt it naturally said keating his voice clear and hard for the first time the problem was different from anything id done before so i worked out that plan to fit the particular requirements of the problem of course said toohey gently a beautiful piece of work you should be proud of it keating noticed that tooheys eyes stood centered in the middle of the lenses and the lenses stood focused straight on his pupils and keating knew suddenly that toohey knew he had not designed the plan of the cosmoslotnick building this did not frighten him what frightened him was that he saw approval in tooheys eyes if you must feel no not gratitude gratitude is such an embarrassing word but shall we say appreciation toohey continued and his voice had grown softer as if keating were a fellow conspirator who would know that the words used were to be from now on a code for a private meaning you might thank me for understanding the symbolic implications of your building and for stating them in words as you stated them in marble since of course you are not just a common mason but a thinker in stone yes said keating that was my abstract theme when i designed the building the great masses and the flowers of culture ive always believed that true culture springs from the common man but i had no hope that anyone would ever understand me toohey smiled his thin lips slid open his teeth showed he was not looking at keating he was looking down at his own hand the long slender sensitive hand of a concert pianist moving a sheet of paper on the desk then he said perhaps were brothers of the spirit keating the human spirit that is all that matters in life not looking at keating but past him the lenses raised flagrantly to a line over keatings face and keating knew that toohey knew he had never thought of any abstract theme until hed read that article and more that toohey approved again when the lenses moved slowly to keatings face the eyes were sweet with affection an affection very cold and very real then keating felt as if the walls of the room were moving gently in upon him pushing him into a terrible intimacy not with toohey but with some unknown guilt he wanted to leap to his feet and run he sat still his mouth half open and without knowing what prompted him keating heard his own voice in the silence and i did want to say how glad i was that you escaped that maniacs bullet yesterday mr toohey oh oh thanks that well dont let it upset you just one of the minor penalties one pays for prominence in public life ive never liked mallory a strange sort of person too tense i dont like people whore tense ive never liked his work either just an exhibitionist wont amount to much it wasnt my idea of course to give him a try it was mr slotnicks pull you know but mr slotnick knew better in the end did mallory ever mention my name to you no never i havent even met him you know never saw him before why did he do it and then it was toohey who sat still before what he saw on keatings face toohey alert and insecure for the first time this was it thought keating this was the bond between them and the bond was fear and more much more than that but fear was the only recognizable name to give it and he knew with unreasoning finality that he liked toohey better than any man he had ever met well you know how it is said keating brightly hoping that the commonplace he was about to utter would close the subject mallory is an incompetent and knows it and he decided to take it out on you as a symbol of the great and the able but instead of a smile keating saw the shot of tooheys sudden glance at him it was not a glance it was a fluoroscope he thought he could feel it crawling searchingly inside his bones then tooheys face seemed to harden drawing together again in composure and keating knew that toohey had found relief somewhere in his bones or in his gaping bewildered face that some hidden immensity of ignorance within him had given toohey reassurance then toohey said slowly strangely derisively you and i were going to be great friends peter keating let a moment pass before he caught himself to answer hastily oh i hope so mr toohey really peter im not as old as all that am i ellsworth is the monument to my parents peculiar taste in nomenclature yes ellsworth thats better i really dont mind the name when compared to some of the things ive been called privately and publicly these many years oh well flattering when one makes enemies one knows that ones dangerous where its necessary to be dangerous there are things that must be destroyed or theyll destroy us well see a great deal of each other peter the voice was smooth and sure now with the finality of a decision tested and reached with the certainty that never again would anything in keating be a question mark to him for instance ive been thinking for some time of getting together a few young architects i know so many of them just an informal little organization to exchange ideas you know to develop a spirit of cooperation to follow a common line of action for the common good of the profession if necessity arises nothing as stuffy as the aga just a youth group think youd be interested why of course and youd be the chairman oh dear no im never chairman of anything peter i dislike titles no i rather thought youd make the right chairman for us cant think of anyone better me you peter oh well its only a project nothing definite just an idea ive been toying with in odd moments well talk about it some other time theres something id like you to do and thats really one of the reasons why i wanted to meet you oh sure mr too sure ellsworth anything i can do for you its not for me do you know lois cook lois who cook you dont but you will that young woman is the greatest literary genius since goethe you must read her peter i dont suggest that as a rule except to the discriminating shes so much above the heads of the middleclass who love the obvious shes planning to build a house a little private residence on the bowery yes on the bowery just like lois shes asked me to recommend an architect im certain that it will take a person like you to understand a person like lois im going to give her your name if youre interested in what is to be a small though quite costly residence but of course thats very kind of you ellsworth you know i thought when you said and when i read your note that you wanted well some favor from me you know a good turn for a good turn and here youre my dear peter how naive you are oh i suppose i shouldnt have said that im sorry i didnt mean to offend you i i dont mind you must learn to know me better strange as it may sound a totally selfless interest in ones fellow men is possible in this world peter then they talked about lois cook and her three published works novels no peter not exactly novels no not collections of stories either thats just it just lois cook a new form of literature entirely about the fortune she had inherited from a long line of successful tradesmen and about the house she planned to build it was only when toohey had risen to escort keating to the door and keating noted how precariously erect he stood on his very small feet that toohey paused suddenly to say incidentally it seems to me as if i should remember some personal connection between us though for the life of me i cant quite place oh yes of course my niece little catherine keating felt his face tighten and knew he must not allow this to be discussed but smiled awkwardly instead of protesting i understand youre engaged to her yes charming said toohey very charming should enjoy being your uncle you love her very much yes said keating very much the absence of stress in his voice made the answer solemn it was laid before toohey the first bit of sincerity and of importance within keatings being how pretty said toohey young love spring and dawn and heaven and drugstore chocolates at a dollar and a quarter a box the prerogative of the gods and of the movies oh i do approve peter i think its lovely you couldnt have made a better choice than catherine shes just the kind for whom the world is well lost the world with all its problems and all its opportunities for greatness oh yes well lost because shes innocent and sweet and pretty and anemic if youre going to keating began but toohey smiled with a luminous sort of kindliness oh peter of course i understand and i approve im a realist man has always insisted on making an ass of himself oh come now we must never lose our sense of humor nothings really sacred but a sense of humor still ive always loved the tale of tristan and isolde its the most beautiful story ever told next to that of mickey and minnie mouse toothbrush in the jaw toothbrush brush brush tooth jaw foam dome in the foam roman dome come home home in the jaw rome dome tooth toothbrush toothpick pickpocket socket rocket peter keating squinted his eyes his glance unfocused as for a great distance but put the book down the book was thin and black with scarlet letters forming clouds and shrouds by lois cook the jacket said that it was a record of miss cooks travels around the world keating leaned back with a sense of warmth and wellbeing he liked this book it had made the routine of his sunday morning breakfast a profound spiritual experience he was certain that it was profound because he didnt understand it peter keating had never felt the need to formulate abstract convictions but he had a working substitute a thing is not high if one can reach it it is not great if one can reason about it it is not deep if one can see its bottom this had always been his credo unstated and unquestioned this spared him any attempt to reach reason or see and it cast a nice reflection of scorn on those who made the attempt so he was able to enjoy the work of lois cook he felt uplifted by the knowledge of his own capacity to respond to the abstract the profound the ideal toohey had said thats just it sound as sound the poetry of words as words style as a revolt against style but only the fines spirit can appreciate it peter keating thought he could talk of this book to his friends and if they did not understand he would know that he was superior to them he would not need to explain that superiority thats just it superiority as superiority automatically denied to those who asked for explanations he loved the book he reached for another piece of toast he saw at the end of the table left there for him by his mother the heavy pile of the sunday paper he picked it up feeling strong enough in this moment in the confidence of his secret spiritual grandeur to face the whole world contained in that pile he pulled out the rotogravure section he stopped he saw the reproduction of a drawing the enright house by howard roark he did not need to see the caption or the brusque signature in the corner of the sketch he knew that no one else had conceived that house and he knew the manner of drawing serene and violent at once the pencil lines like hightension wires on the paper slender and innocent to see but not to be touched it was a structure on a broad space by the east river he did not grasp it as a building at first glance but as a rising mass of rock crystal there was the same severe mathematical order holding together a free fantastic growth straight lines and clean angles space slashed with a knife yet in a harmony of formation as delicate as the work of a jeweler an incredible variety of shapes each separate unit unrepeated but leading inevitably to the next one and to the whole so that the future inhabitants were to have not a square cage out of a square pile of cages but each a single house held to the other houses like a single crystal to the side of a rock keating looked at the sketch he had known for a long time that howard roark had been chosen to build the enright house he had seen a few mentions of roarks name in the papers not much all of it to be summed up only as some young architect chosen by mr enright for some reason probably an interesting young architect the caption under the drawing announced that the construction of the project was to begin at once well thought keating and dropped the paper so what the paper fell beside the black and scarlet book he looked at both he felt dimly as if lois cook were his defense against howard roark whats that petey his mothers voice asked behind him he handed the paper to her over his shoulder the paper fell past him back to the table in a second oh shrugged mrs keating huh she stood beside him her trim silk dress was fitted too tightly revealing the solid rigidity of her corset a small pin glittered at her throat small enough to display ostentatiously that it was made of real diamonds she was like the new apartment into which they had moved conspicuously expensive the apartments decoration had been keatings first professional job for himself it had been furnished in fresh new midvictorian it was conservative and stately over the fireplace in the drawing room hung a large old painting of what was not but looked like an illustrious ancestor petey sweetheart i do hate to rush you on a sunday morning but isnt it time to dress up ive got to run now and id hate you to forget the time and be late its so nice of mr toohey asking you to his house yes mother any famous guests coming too no no guests but there will be one other person there not famous she looked at him expectantly he added katie will be there the name seemed to have no effect on her whatever a strange assurance had coated her lately like a layer of fat through which that particular question could penetrate no longer just a family tea he emphasized thats what he said very nice of him im sure mr toohey is a very intelligent man yes mother he rose impatiently and went to his room it was keatings first visit to the distinguished residential hotel where catherine and her uncle had moved recently he did not notice much about the apartment beyond remembering that it was simple very clean and smartly modest that it contained a great number of books and very few pictures but these authentic and precious one never remembered the apartment of ellsworth toohey only its host the host on this sunday afternoon wore a dark gray suit correct as a uniform and bedroom slippers of black patent leather trimmed with red the slippers mocked the severe elegance of the suit yet completed the elegance as an audacious anticlimax he sat in a broad low chair and his face wore an expression of cautious gentleness so cautious that keating and catherine felt at times as if they were insignificant soap bubbles keating did not like the way catherine sat on the edge of a chair hunched her legs drawn awkwardly together he wished she would not wear the same suit for the third season but she did she kept her eyes on one point somewhere in the middle of the carpet she seldom looked at keating she never looked at her uncle keating found no trace of that joyous admiration with which she had always spoken of toohey which he had expected to see her display in his presence there was something heavy and colorless about catherine and very tired tooheys valet brought in the tea tray you will pour wont you please my dear said toohey to catherine ah theres nothing like tea in the afternoon when the british empire collapses historians will find that it had made but two invaluable contributions to civilization this tea ritual and the detective novel catherine my dear do you have to grasp that pot handle as if it were a meat axe but never mind its charming its really what we love you for peter and i we wouldnt love you if you were graceful as a duchess who wants a duchess nowadays catherine poured the tea and spilled it on the glass table top which she had never done before i did want to see you two together for once said toohey holding a delicate cup balanced nonchalantly perfectly silly of me isnt it theres really nothing to make an occasion of but then im silly and sentimental at times like all of us my compliments on your choice catherine i owe you an apology i never suspected you of such good taste you and peter make a wonderful couple youll do a great deal for him youll cook his cream of wheat launder his handkerchiefs and bear his children though of course the children will all have measles at one time or another which is a nuisance but after all you you do approve of it keating asked anxiously approve of it of what peter of our marriage eventually what a superfluous question peter of course i approve of it but how young you are thats the way of young people they make an issue where none exists you asked that as if the whole thing were important enough to disapprove of katie and i met seven years ago said keating defensively and it was love at first sight of course yes said keating and felt himself being ridiculous it must have been spring said toohey it usually is theres always a dark movie theater and two people lost to the world their hands clasped together but hands do perspire when held too long dont they still its beautiful to be in love the sweetest story ever told and the tritest dont turn away like that catherine we must never allow ourselves to lose our sense of humor he smiled the kindliness of his smile embraced them both the kindliness was so great that it made their love seem small and mean because only something contemptible could evoke such immensity of compassion he asked incidentally peter when do you intend to get married oh well weve never really set a definite date you know how its been all the things happening to me and now katie has this work of hers and and by the way he added sharply because that matter of katies work irritated him without reason when were married katie will have to give that up i dont approve of it but of course said toohey i dont approve of it either if catherine doesnt like it catherine was working as day nursery attendant at the clifford settlement house it had been her own idea she had visited the settlement often with her uncle who conducted classes in economics there and she had become interested in the work but i do like it she said with sudden excitement i dont see why you resent it peter there was a harsh little note in her voice defiant and unpleasant ive never enjoyed anything so much in my life helping people whore helpless and unhappy i went there this morning i didnt have to but i wanted to and then i rushed so on my way home i didnt have time to change my clothes but that doesnt matter who cares what i look like and the harsh note was gone she was speaking eagerly and very fast uncle ellsworth imagine little billy hansen had a sore throat you remember billy and the nurse wasnt there and i had to swab his throat with argyrol the poor thing he had the most awful white mucus patches down in his throat her voice seemed to shine as if she were speaking of great beauty she looked at her uncle for the first time keating saw the affection he had expected she went on speaking about her work the children the settlement toohey listened gravely he said nothing but the earnest attention in his eyes changed him his mocking gaiety vanished and he forgot his own advice he was being serious very serious indeed when he noticed that catherines plate was empty he offered her the sandwich tray with a simple gesture and made it somehow a gracious gesture of respect keating waited impatiently till she paused for an instant he wanted to change the subject he glanced about the room and saw the sunday papers this was a question he had wanted to ask for a long time he asked cautiously ellsworth what do you think of roark roark roark asked toohey who is roark the too innocent too trifling manner in which he repeated the name with the faint contemptuous question mark quite audible at the end made keating certain that toohey knew the name well one did not stress total ignorance of a subject if one were in total ignorance of it keating said howard roark you know the architect the one whos doing the enright house oh oh yes someones doing that enright house at last isnt he theres a picture of it in the chronicle today is there i did glance through the chronicle and what do you think of that building if it were important i should have remembered it of course keatings syllables danced as if his breath caught at each one in passing its an awful crazy thing like nothing you ever saw or want to see he felt a sense of deliverance it was as if he had spent his life believing that he carried a congenital disease and suddenly the words of the greatest specialist on earth had pronounced him healthy he wanted to laugh freely stupidly without dignity he wanted to talk howards a friend of mine he said happily a friend of yours you know him do i know him why we went to school together stanton you know why he lived at our house for three years i can tell you the color of his underwear and how he takes a shower ive seen him he lived at your house in stanton toohey repeated toohey spoke with a kind of cautious precision the sounds of his voice were small and dry and final like the cracks of matches being broken it was very peculiar thought keating toohey was asking him a great many questions about howard roark but the questions did not make sense they were not about buildings they were not about architecture at all they were pointless personal questions strange to ask about a man of whom he had never heard before does he laugh often very rarely does he seem unhappy never did he have many friends at stanton hes never had any friends anywhere the boys didnt like him nobody can like him why he makes you feel it would be an impertinence to like him did he go out drink have a good time never does he like money no does he like to be admired no does he believe in god no does he talk much very little does he listen if others discuss any ideas with him he listens it would be better if he didnt why it would be less insulting if you know what i mean when a man listens like that and you know it hasnt made the slightest bit of difference to him did he always want to be an architect he whats the matter peter nothing it just occurred to me how strange it is that ive never asked myself that about him before heres whats strange you cant ask that about him hes a maniac on the subject of architecture it seems to mean so damn much to him that hes lost all human perspective he just has no sense of humor about himself at all now theres a man without a sense of humor ellsworth you dont ask what hed do if he didnt want to be an architect no said toohey you ask what hed do if he couldnt be an architect hed walk over corpses any and all of them all of us but hed be an architect toohey folded his napkin a crisp little square of cloth on his knee he folded it accurately once across each way and he ran his fingernail along the edges to make a sharp crease do you remember our little youth group of architects peter he asked im making arrangements for a first meeting soon ive spoken to many of our future members and youd be flattered by what they said about you as our prospective chairman they talked pleasantly for another half hour when keating rose to go toohey declared oh yes i did speak to lois cook about you youll hear from her shortly thank you so much ellsworth by the way im reading clouds and shrouds and oh its tremendous you know ellsworth it it makes you think so differently about everything youve thought before yes said toohey doesnt it he stood at the window looking out at the last sunshine of a cold bright afternoon then he turned and said its a lovely day probably one of the last this year why dont you take catherine out for a little walk peter oh id love to said catherine eagerly well go ahead toohey smiled gaily whats the matter catherine do you have to wait for my permission when they walked out together when they were alone in the cold brilliance of streets flooded with late sunlight keating felt himself recapturing everything catherine had always meant to him the strange emotion that he could not keep in the presence of others he closed his hand over hers she withdrew her hand took off her glove and slipped her fingers into his and then he thought suddenly that hands did perspire when held too long and he walked faster in irritation he thought that they were walking there like mickey and minnie mouse and that they probably appeared ridiculous to the passersby to shake himself free of these thoughts he glanced down at her face she was looking straight ahead at the gold light he saw her delicate profile and the faint crease of a smile in the corner of her mouth a smile of quiet happiness but he noticed that the edge of her eyelid was pale and he began to wonder whether she was anemic lois cook sat on the floor in the middle of her living room her legs crossed turkish fashion showing large bare knees gray stockings rolled over tight garters and a piece of faded pink drawers peter keating sat on the edge of a violet satin chaise lounge never before had he felt uncomfortable at a first interview with a client lois cook was thirtyseven she had stated insistently in her publicity and in private conversation that she was sixtyfour it was repeated as a whimsical joke and it created about her name a vague impression of eternal youth she was tall dry narrowshouldered and broadhipped she had a long sallow face and eyes set close together her hair hung about her ears in greasy strands her fingernails were broken she looked offensively unkempt with studied slovenliness as careful as grooming and for the same purpose she talked incessantly rocking back and forth on her haunches yes on the bowery a private residence the shrine on the bowery i have the site i wanted it and i bought it as simple as that or my fool lawyer bought it for me you must meet my lawyer he has halitosis i dont know what youll cost me but its unessential money is commonplace cabbage is commonplace too it must have three stories and a living room with a tile floor miss cook ive read clouds and shrouds and it was a spiritual revelation to me allow me to include myself among the few who understand the courage and significance of what youre achieving singlehanded while oh can the crap said lois cook and winked at him but i mean it he snapped angrily i loved your book i she looked bored it is so commonplace she drawled to be understood by everybody but mr toohey said ah yes mr toohey her eyes were alert now insolently guilty like the eyes of a child who has just perpetrated some nasty little joke mr toohey im chairman of a little youth group of writers in which mr toohey is very interested you are he said happily it seemed to be the first direct communication between them isnt that interesting mr toohey is getting together a little youth group of architects too and hes kind enough to have me in mind for chairman oh she said and winked one of us of whom he did not know what he had done but he knew that he had disappointed her in some way she began to laugh she sat there looking up at him laughing deliberately in his face laughing ungraciously and not gaily what the he controlled himself whats the matter miss cook oh my she said youre such a sweet sweet boy and so pretty mr toohey is a great man he said angrily hes the most the noblest personality ive ever oh yes mr toohey is a wonderful man her voice was strange by omission it was flagrantly devoid of respect my best friend the most wonderful man on earth theres the earth and theres mr toohey a law of nature besides think how nicely you can rhyme it toohey gooey phooey hooey nevertheless hes a saint thats very rare as rare as genius im a genius i want a living room without windows no windows at all remember that when you draw up the plans no windows a tile floor and a black ceiling and no electricity i want no electricity in my house just kerosene lamps kerosene lamps with chimneys and candles to hell with thomas edison who was he anyway her words did not disturb him as much as her smile it was not a smile it was a permanent smirk raising the corners of her long mouth making her look like a sly vicious imp and keating i want the house to be ugly magnificently ugly i want it to be the ugliest house in new york the ugliest miss cook sweetheart the beautiful is so commonplace yes but but i well i dont see how i could permit myself to keating wheres your courage arent you capable of a sublime gesture on occasion they all work so hard and struggle and suffer trying to achieve beauty trying to surpass one another in beauty lets surpass them all lets throw their sweat in their face lets destroy them at one stroke lets be gods lets be ugly he accepted the commission after a few weeks he stopped feeling uneasy about it wherever he mentioned this new job he met a respectful curiosity it was an amused curiosity but it was respectful the name of lois cook was well known in the best drawing rooms he visited the titles of her books were flashed in conversation like the diamonds in the speakers intellectual crown there was always a note of challenge in the voices pronouncing them it sounded as if the speaker were being very brave it was a satisfying bravery it never aroused antagonism for an author who did not sell her name seemed strangely famous and honored she was the standardbearer of a vanguard of intellect and revolt only it was not quite clear to him just exactly what the revolt was against somehow he preferred not to know he designed the house as she wished it it was a threefloor edifice part marble part stucco adorned with gargoyles and carriage lanterns it looked like a structure from an amusement park his sketch of it was reproduced in more publications than any other drawing he had ever made with the exception of the cosmoslotnick building one commentator expressed the opinion that peter keating is showing a promise of being more than just a bright young man with a knack for pleasing stuffy moguls of big business he is venturing into the field of intellectual experimentation with a client such as lois cook toohey referred to the house as a cosmic joke but a peculiar sensation remained in keatings mind the feeling of an aftertaste he would experience a dim flash of it while working on some important structure he liked he would experience it in the moments when he felt proud of his work he could not identify the quality of the feeling but he knew that part of it was a sense of shame once he confessed it to ellsworth toohey toohey laughed thats good for you peter one must never allow oneself to acquire an exaggerated sense of ones own importance theres no necessity to burden oneself with absolutes dominique had returned to new york she returned without purpose merely because she could not stay in her country house longer than three days after her last visit to the quarry she had to be in the city it was a sudden necessity irresistible and senseless she expected nothing of the city but she wanted the feeling of the streets and the buildings holding her there in the morning when she awakened and heard the muffled roar of traffic far below the sound was a humiliation a reminder of where she was and why she stood at the window her arms spread wide holding on to each side of the frame it was as if she held a piece of the city all the streets and rooftops outlined on the glass between her two hands she went out alone for long walks she walked fast her hands in the pockets of an old coat its collar raised she had told herself that she was not hoping to meet him she was not looking for him but she had to be out in the streets blank purposeless for hours at a time she had always hated the streets of a city she saw the faces streaming past her the faces made alike by fear fear as a common denominator fear of themselves fear of all and of one another fear making them ready to pounce upon whatever was held sacred by any single one they met she could not define the nature or the reason of that fear but she had always felt its presence she had kept herself clean and free in a single passion to touch nothing she had liked facing them in the streets she had liked the impotence of their hatred because she offered them nothing to be hurt she was not free any longer each step through the streets hurt her now she was tied to him as he was tied to every part of the city he was a nameless worker doing some nameless job lost in these crowds dependent on them to be hurt by any one of them to be shared by her with the whole city she hated the thought of him on the sidewalks people had used she hated the thought of a clerk handing to him a package of cigarettes across a counter she hated the elbows touching his elbows in a subway train she came home after these walks shaking with fever she went out again the next day when the term of her vacation expired she went to the office of the banner in order to resign her work and her column did not seem amusing to her any longer she stopped alvah scarrets effusive greetings she said i just came back to tell you that im quitting alvah he looked at her stupidly he uttered only why it was the first sound from the outside world to reach her in a long time she had always acted on the impulse of the moment proud of the freedom to need no reasons for her actions now she had to face a why that carried an answer she could not escape she thought because of him because she was letting him change the course of her life it would be another violation she could see him smiling as he had smiled on the path in the woods she had no choice either course taken would be taken under compulsion she could leave her work because he had made her want to leave it or she could remain hating it in order to keep her life unchanged in defiance of him the last was harder she raised her head she said just a joke alvah just wanted to see what youd say im not quitting she had been back at work for a few days when ellsworth toohey walked into her office hello dominique he said just heard youre back hello ellsworth im glad you know ive always had the feeling that youll walk out on us some morning without any reason the feeling ellsworth or the hope he was looking at her his eyes as kindly his smile as charming as ever but there was a tinge of selfmockery in the charm as if he knew that she did not approve of it and a tinge of assurance as if he were showing that he would look kindly and charming just the same you know youre wrong there he said smiling peacefully youve always been wrong about that no i dont fit ellsworth do i i could of course ask into what but supposing i dont ask it supposing i just say that people who dont fit have their uses also as well as those who do would you like that better of course the simplest thing to say is that ive always been a great admirer of yours and always will be thats not a compliment somehow i dont think well ever be enemies dominique if thats what youd like no i dont think well ever be enemies ellsworth youre the most comforting person i know of course in the sense i mean in any sense you wish on the desk before her lay the rotogravure section of the sunday chronicle it was folded on the page that bore the drawing of the enright house she picked it up and held it out to him her eyes narrowed in a silent question he looked at the drawing then his glance moved to her face and returned to the drawing he let the paper drop back on the desk as independent as an insult isnt it he said you know ellsworth i think the man who designed this should have committed suicide a man who can conceive a thing as beautiful as this should never allow it to be erected he should not want to exist but he will let it be built so that women will hang out diapers on his terraces so that men will spit on his stairways and draw dirty pictures on his walls hes given it to them and hes made it part of them part of everything he shouldnt have offered it for men like you to look at for men like you to talk about hes defiled his own work by the first word youll utter about it hes made himself worse than you are youll be committing only a mean little indecency but hes committed a sacrilege a man who knows what he must have known to produce this should not have been able to remain alive going to write a piece about this he asked no that would be repeating his crime and talking to me about it she looked at him he was smiling pleasantly yes of course she said thats part of the same crime also lets have dinner together one of these days dominique he said you really dont let me see enough of you all right she said anytime you wish at his trial for the assault on ellsworth toohey steven mallory refused to disclose his motive he made no statement he seemed indifferent to any possible sentence but ellsworth toohey created a minor sensation when he appeared unsolicited in mallorys defense he pleaded with the judge for leniency he explained that he had no desire to see mallorys future and career destroyed everybody in the courtroom was touched except steven mallory steven mallory listened and looked as if he were enduring some special process of cruelty the judge gave him two years and suspended the sentence there was a great deal of comment on tooheys extraordinary generosity toohey dismissed all praise gaily and modestly my friends was his remark the one to appear in all the papers i refuse to be an accomplice in the manufacturing of martyrs at the first meeting of the proposed organization of young architects keating concluded that toohey had a wonderful ability for choosing people who fitted well together there was an air about the eighteen persons present which he could not define but which gave him a sense of comfort a security he had not experienced in solitude or in any other gathering and part of the comfort was the knowledge that all the others felt the same way for the same unaccountable reason it was a feeling of brotherhood but somehow not of a sainted or noble brotherhood yet this precisely was the comfort that one felt among them no necessity for being sainted or noble were it not for this kinship keating would have been disappointed in the gathering of the eighteen seated about tooheys living room none was an architect of distinction except himself and gordon l prescott who wore a beige turtleneck sweater and looked faintly patronizing but eager keating had never heard the names of the others most of them were beginners young poorly dressed and belligerent some were only draftsmen there was one woman architect who had built a few small private homes mainly for wealthy widows she had an aggressive manner a tight mouth and a fresh petunia in her hair there was a boy with pure innocent eyes there was an obscure contractor with a fat expressionless face there was a tall dry woman who was an interior decorator and another woman of no definite occupation at all keating could not understand what exactly was to be the purpose of the group though there was a great deal of talk none of the talk was too coherent but all of it seemed to have the same undercurrent he felt that the undercurrent was the one thing clear among all the vague generalities even though nobody would mention it it held him there as it held the others and he had no desire to define it the young men talked a great deal about injustice unfairness the cruelty of society toward youth and suggested that everyone should have his future commissions guaranteed when he left college the woman architect shrieked briefly something about the iniquity of the rich the contractor barked that it was a hard world and that fellows gotta help one another the boy with the innocent eyes pleaded that we could do so much good his voice had a note of desperate sincerity which seemed embarrassing and out of place gordon l prescott declared that the aga was a bunch of old fogies with no conception of social responsibility and not a drop of virile blood in the lot of them and that it was time to kick them in the pants anyway the woman of indefinite occupation spoke about ideals and causes though nobody could gather just what these were peter keating was elected chairman unanimously gordon l prescott was elected vicechairman and treasurer toohey declined all nominations he declared that he would act only as an unofficial advisor it was decided that the organization would be named the council of american builders it was decided that membership would not be restricted to architects but would be open to allied crafts and to all those holding the interests of the great profession of building at heart then toohey spoke he spoke at some length standing up leaning on the knuckles of one hand against a table his great voice was soft and persuasive it filled the room but it made his listeners realize that it could have filled a roman amphitheater there was something subtly flattering in this realization in the sound of the powerful voice being held in check for their benefit and thus my friends what the architectural profession lacks is an understanding of its own social importance this lack is due to a double cause to the antisocial nature of our entire society and to your own inherent modesty you have been conditioned to think of yourselves merely as breadwinners with no higher purpose than to earn your fees and the means of your own existence isnt it time my friends to pause and to redefine your position in society of all the crafts yours is the most important important not in the amount of money you might make not in the degree of artistic skill you might exhibit but in the service you render to your fellow men you are those who provide mankinds shelter remember this and then look at our cities at our slums to realize the gigantic task awaiting you but to meet this challenge you must be armed with a broader vision of yourselves and of your work you are not hired lackeys of the rich you are crusaders in the cause of the underprivileged and the unsheltered not by what we are shall we be judged but by those we serve let us stand united in this spirit let us in all matters be faithful to this new broader higher perspective let us organize well my friends shall i say a nobler dream keating listened avidly he had always thought of himself as a breadwinner bent upon earning his fees in a profession he had chosen because his mother had wanted him to choose it it was gratifying to discover that he was much more than this that his daily activity carried a nobler significance it was pleasant and it was drugging he knew that all the others in the room felt it also and when our system of society collapses the craft of builders will not be swept under it will be swept up to greater prominence and greater recognition the doorbell rang then tooheys valet appeared for an instant holding the door of the living room open to admit dominique francon by the manner in which toohey stopped on a halfuttered word keating knew that dominique had not been invited or expected she smiled at toohey shook her head and moved one hand in a gesture telling him to continue he managed a faint bow in her direction barely more than a movement of his eyebrows and went on with his speech it was a pleasant greeting and its informality included the guest in the intimate brotherhood of the occasion but it seemed to keating that it had come just one beat too late he had never before seen toohey miss the right moment dominique sat down in a corner behind the others keating forgot to listen for a while trying to attract her attention he had to wait until her eyes had traveled thoughtfully about the room from face to face and stopped on his he bowed and nodded vigorously with the smile of greeting a private possession she inclined her head he saw her lashes touching her cheeks for an instant as her eyes closed and then she looked at him again she sat looking at him for a long moment without smiling as if she were rediscovering something in his face he had not seen her since spring he thought that she looked a little tired and lovelier than his memory of her then he turned to ellsworth toohey once more and he listened the words he heard were as stirring as ever but his pleasure in them had an edge of uneasiness he looked at dominique she did not belong in this room at this meeting he could not say why but the certainty of it was enormous and oppressive it was not her beauty it was not her insolent elegance but something made her an outsider it was as if they had all been comfortably naked and a person had entered fully clothed suddenly making them selfconscious and indecent yet she did nothing she sat listening attentively once she leaned back crossing her legs and lighted a cigarette she shook the flame off the match with a brusque little jerk of her wrist and she dropped the match into an ash tray on a table beside her he saw her drop the match into the ash tray he felt as if that movement of her wrist had tossed the match into all their faces he thought that he was being preposterous but he noticed that ellsworth toohey never looked at her as he spoke when the meeting ended toohey rushed over to her dominique my dear he said brightly shall i consider myself flattered if you wish had i known that you were interested i would have sent you a very special invitation but you didnt think id be interested no frankly i that was a mistake ellsworth you discounted my newspaperwomans instinct never miss a scoop its not often that one has the chance to witness the birth of a felony just exactly what do you mean dominique asked keating his voice sharp she turned to him hello peter you know peter keating of course toohey smiled at her oh yes peter was in love with me once youre using the wrong tense dominique said keating you must never take seriously anything dominique chooses to say peter she does not intend us to take it seriously would you like to join our little group dominique your professional qualifications make you eminently eligible no ellsworth i wouldnt like to join your little group i really dont hate you enough to do that just why do you disapprove of it snapped keating why peter she drawled whatever gave you that idea i dont disapprove of it at all do i ellsworth i think its a proper undertaking in answer to an obvious necessity its just what we all need and deserve can we count on your presence at our next meeting toohey asked it is pleasant to have so understanding a listener who will not be in the way at all at our next meeting i mean no ellsworth thank you it was merely curiosity though you do have an interesting group of people here young builders by the way why didnt you invite that man who designed the enright house whats his name howard roark keating felt his jaw snap tight but she looked at them innocently she had said it lightly in the tone of a casual remark surely he thought she did not mean what he asked himself and added she did not mean whatever it was hed thought for a moment she meant whatever had terrified him in that moment i have never had the pleasure of meeting mr roark toohey answered gravely do you know him keating asked her no she answered ive merely seen a sketch of the enright house and keating insisted what do you think of it i dont think of it she answered when she turned to leave keating accompanied her he looked at her in the elevator on their way down he saw her hand in a tight black glove holding the flat corner of a pocketbook the limp carelessness of her fingers was insolent and inviting at once he felt himself surrendering to her again dominique why did you actually come here today oh i havent been anywhere for a long time and i decided to start in with that you know when i go swimming i dont like to torture myself getting into cold water by degrees i dive right in and its a nasty shock but after that the rest is not so hard to take what do you mean what do you really see thats so wrong with that meeting after all were not planning to do anything definite we dont have any actual program i dont even know what we were there for thats it peter you dont even know what you were there for its only a group for fellows to get together mostly to talk what harm is there in that peter im tired well did your appearance tonight mean at least that youre coming out of your seclusion yes just that my seclusion ive tried and tried to get in touch with you you know have you shall i begin to tell you how happy i am to see you again no lets consider that youve told me you know youve changed dominique i dont know exactly in what way but youve changed have i lets consider that ive told you how lovely you are because i cant find words to say it the streets were dark he called a cab sitting close to her he turned and looked at her directly his glance compelling like an open hint hoping to make the silence significant between them she did not turn away she sat studying his face she seemed to be wondering attentive to some thought of her own which he could not guess he reached over slowly and took her hand he felt an effort in her hand he could feel through her rigid fingers the effort of her whole arm not an effort to withdraw her hand but to let him hold it he raised the hand turned it over and pressed his lips to her wrist then he looked at her face he dropped her hand and it remained suspended in the air for an instant the fingers stiff half closed this was not the indifference he remembered this was revulsion so great that it became impersonal it could not offend him it seemed to include more than his person he was suddenly aware of her body not in desire or resentment but just aware of its presence close to him under her dress he whispered involuntarily dominique who was he she whirled to face him then he saw her eyes narrowing he saw her lips relaxing growing fuller softer her mouth lengthening slowly into a faint smile without opening she answered looking straight at him a workman in the granite quarry she succeeded he laughed aloud serves me right dominique i shouldnt suspect the impossible peter isnt it strange it was you that i thought i could make myself want at one time why is that strange only in thinking how little we know about ourselves some day youll know the truth about yourself too peter and it will be worse for you than for most of us but you dont have to think about it it wont come for a long time you did want me dominique i thought i could never want anything and you suited that so well i dont know what you mean i dont know what you ever think youre saying i know that ill always love you and i wont let you disappear again now that youre back now that im back peter i dont want to see you again oh ill have to see you when we run into each other as we will but dont call on me dont come to see me im not trying to offend you peter its not that youve done nothing to make me angry its something in myself that i dont want to face again im sorry to choose you as the example but you suit so well you peter youre everything i despise in the world and i dont want to remember how much i despise it if i let myself remember ill return to it this is not an insult to you peter try to understand that youre not the worst of the world youre its best thats whats frightening if i ever come back to you dont let me come im saying this now because i can but if i come back to you you wont be able to stop me and now is the only time when i can warn you i dont know he said in cold fury his lips stiff what youre talking about dont try to know it doesnt matter lets just stay away from each other shall we ill never give you up she shrugged all right peter this is the only time ive ever been kind to you or to anyone roger enright had started life as a coal miner in pennsylvania on his way to the millions he now owned no one had ever helped him that he explained is why no one has ever stood in my way a great many things and people had stood in his way however but he had never noticed them many incidents of his long career were not admired none was whispered about his career had been glaring and public like a billboard he made a poor subject for blackmailers or debunking biographers among the wealthy he was disliked for having become wealthy so crudely he hated bankers labor unions women evangelists and the stock exchange he had never bought a share of stock nor sold a share in any of his enterprises and he owned his fortune singlehanded as simply as if he carried all his cash in his pocket besides his oil business he owned a publishing house a restaurant a radio shop a garage a plant manufacturing electric refrigerators before each new venture he studied the field for a long time then proceeded to act as if he had never heard of it upsetting all precedent some of his ventures were successful others failed he continued running them all with ferocious energy he worked twelve hours a day when he decided to erect a building he spent six months looking for an architect then he hired roark at the end of their first interview which lasted half an hour later when the drawings were made he gave orders to proceed with construction at once when roark began to speak about the drawings enright interrupted him dont explain its no use explaining abstract ideals to me ive never had any ideals people say im completely immoral i go only by what i like but i do know what i like roark never mentioned the attempt he had made to reach enright nor his interview with the bored secretary enright learned of it somehow within five minutes the secretary was discharged and within ten minutes he was walking out of the office as ordered in the middle of a busy day a letter left half typed in his machine roark reopened his office the same big room on the top of an old building he enlarged it by the addition of an adjoining room for the draftsmen he hired in order to keep up with the planned lightning schedule of construction the draftsmen were young and without much experience he had never heard of them before and he did not ask for letters of recommendation he chose them from among many applicants merely by glancing at their drawings for a few minutes in the crowded tension of the days that followed he never spoke to them except of their work they felt entering the office in the morning that they had no private lives no significance and no reality save the overwhelming reality of the broad sheets of paper on their tables the place seemed cold and soulless like a factory until they looked at him then they thought that it was not a factory but a furnace fed on their bodies his own first there were times when he remained in the office all night they found him still working when they returned in the morning he did not seem tired once he stayed there for two days and two nights in succession on the afternoon of the third day he fell asleep half lying across his table he awakened in a few hours made no comment and walked from one table to another to see what had been done he made corrections his words sounding as if nothing had interrupted a thought begun some hours ago youre unbearable when youre working howard austen heller told him one evening even though he had not spoken of his work at all why he asked astonished its uncomfortable to be in the same room with you tension is contagious you know what tension i feel completely natural only when im working thats it youre completely natural only when youre one inch from bursting into pieces what in hell are you really made of howard after all its only a building its not the combination of holy sacrament indian torture and sexual ecstasy that you seem to make of it isnt it he did not think of dominique often but when he did the thought was not a sudden recollection it was the acknowledgment of a continuous presence that needed no acknowledgment he wanted her he knew where to find her he waited it amused him to wait because he knew that the waiting was unbearable to her he knew that his absence bound her to him in a manner more complete and humiliating than his presence could enforce he was giving her time to attempt an escape in order to let her know her own helplessness when he chose to see her again she would know that the attempt itself had been of his choice that it had been only another form of mastery then she would be ready either to kill him or to come to him of her own will the two acts would be equal in her mind he wanted her brought to this he waited the construction of the enright house was about to begin when roark was summoned to the office of joel sutton joel sutton a successful businessman was planning the erection of a huge office building joel sutton had based his success on the faculty of understanding nothing about people he loved everybody his love admitted no distinctions it was a great leveler it could hold no peaks and no hollows as the surface of a bowl of molasses could not hold them joe sutton met roark at a dinner given by enright joel sutton liked roark he admired roark he saw no difference between roark and anyone else when roark came to his office joel sutton declared now im not sure im not sure im not sure at all but i thought that i might consider you for that little building i have in mind your enright house is sort of peculiar but its attractive all buildings are attractive love buildings dont you and rog enright is a very smart man an exceedingly smart man he coins money where nobody elsed think it grew ill take a tip from rog enright any time whats good enough for rog enright is good enough for me roark waited for weeks after that first interview joel sutton never made up his mind in a hurry on an evening in december austen heller called on roark without warning and declared that he must accompany him next friday to a formal party given by mrs ralston holcombe hell no austen said roark listen howard just exactly why not oh i know you hate that sort of thing but thats not a good reason on the other hand i can give you many excellent ones for going the place is a kind of house of assignation for architects and of course youd sell anything there is to you for a building oh i know for your kind of building but still youd sell the soul you havent got so cant you stand a few hours of boredom for the sake of future possibilities certainly only i dont believe that this sort of thing ever leads to any possibilities will you go this time why particularly this time well in the first place that infernal pest kiki holcombe demands it she spent two hours yesterday demanding it and made me miss a luncheon date it spoils her reputation to have a building like the enright house going up in town and not be able to display its architect in her salon its a hobby she collects architects she insisted that i must bring you and i promised i would what for specifically shes going to have joel sutton there next friday try if it kills you to be nice to him hes practically decided to give you that building from what i hear a little personal contact might be all thats needed to set it hes got a lot of others after him theyll all be there i want you there i want you to get that building i dont want to hear anything about granite quarries for the next ten years i dont like granite quarries roark sat on a table his hands clasping the tables edge to keep himself still he was exhausted after fourteen hours spent in his office he thought he should be exhausted but he could not feel it he made his shoulders sag in an effort to achieve a relaxation that would not come his arms were tense drawn and one elbow shuddered in a thin continuous quiver his long legs were spread apart one bent and still with the knee resting on the table the other hanging down straight from the hip over the tables edge swinging impatiently it was so difficult these days to force himself to rest his new home was one large room in a small modern apartment house on a quiet street he had chosen the house because it had no cornices over the windows and no paneling on the walls inside his room contained a few pieces of simple furniture it looked clean vast and empty one expected to hear echoes from its corners why not go just once said heller it wont be too awful it might even amuse you youll see a lot of your old friends there john erik snyte peter keating guy francon and his daughter you should meet his daughter have you ever read her stuff ill go said roark abruptly youre unpredictable enough even to be sensible at times ill call for you at eightthirty friday black tie do you own a tux by the way enright made me get one enright is a very sensible man when heller left roark remained sitting on the table for a long time he had decided to go to the party because he knew that it would be the last of all places where dominique could wish to meet him again there is nothing as useless my dear kiki said ellsworth toohey as a rich woman who makes herself a profession of entertaining but then all useless things have charm like aristocracy for instance the most useless conception of all kiki holcombe wrinkled her nose in a cute little pout of reproach but she liked the comparison to aristocracy three crystal chandeliers blazed over her florentine ballroom and when she looked up at toohey the lights stood reflected in her eyes making them a moist collection of sparks between heavy beaded lashes you say disgusting things ellsworth i dont know why i keep on inviting you that is precisely why my dear i think i shall be invited here as often as i wish what can a mere woman do against that never start an argument with mr toohey said mrs gillespie a tall woman wearing a necklace of large diamonds the size of the teeth she bared when she smiled its no use were beaten in advance argument mrs gillespie he said is one of the things that has neither use nor charm leave it to the men of brains brains of course are a dangerous confession of weakness it has been said that men develop brains when they have failed in everything else now you dont mean that at all said mrs gillespie while her smile accepted it as a pleasant truth she took possession of him triumphantly and led him away as a prize stolen from mrs holcombe who had turned aside for a moment to greet new guests but you men of intellect are such children youre so sensitive one must pamper you i wouldnt do that mrs gillespie well take advantage of it and to display ones brain is so vulgar its even more vulgar than to display ones wealth oh dear you would get that in wouldnt you now of course ive heard that youre some sort of a radical but i wont take it seriously not one bit how do you like that i like it very much said toohey you cant kid me you cant make me think that youre one of the dangerous kind the dangerous kind are all dirty and use bad grammar and you have such a beautiful voice whatever made you think that i aspired to be dangerous mrs gillespie im merely well shall we say that mildest of all things a conscience your own conscience conveniently personified in the body of another person and attending to your concern for the less fortunate of this world thus leaving you free not to attend to well what a quaint idea i dont know whether its horrible or very wise indeed both mrs gillespie as all wisdom kiki holcombe surveyed her ballroom with satisfaction she looked up at the twilight of the ceiling left untouched above the chandeliers and she noted how far it was above the guests how dominant and undisturbed the huge crowd of guests did not dwarf her hall it stood over them like a square box of space grotesquely out of scale and it was this wasted expanse of air imprisoned above them that gave the occasion an aspect of regal luxury it was like the lid of a jewel case unnecessarily large over a flat bottom holding a single small gem the guests moved in two broad changing currents that drew them all sooner or later toward two whirlpools at the center of one stood ellsworth toohey of the other peter keating evening clothes were not becoming to ellsworth toohey the rectangle of white shirt front prolonged his face stretching him out into two dimensions the wings of his tie made his thin neck look like that of a plucked chicken pale bluish and ready to be twisted by a single movement of some strong fist but he wore his clothes better than any man present he wore them with the careless impertinence of utter ease in the unbecoming and the very grotesqueness of his appearance became a declaration of his superiority a superiority great enough to warrant disregard of so much ungainliness he was saying to a somber young female who wore glasses and a lowcut evening gown my dear you will never be more than a dilettante of the intellect unless you submerge yourself in some cause greater than yourself he was saying to an obese gentlemen with a face turning purple in the heat of an argument but my friend i might not like it either i merely said that such happens to be the inevitable course of history and who are you or i to oppose the course of history he was saying to an unhappy young architect no my boy what i have against you is not the bad building you designed but the bad taste you exhibited in whining about my criticism of it you should be careful someone might say that you can neither dish it out nor take it he was saying to a millionaires widow yes i do think it would be a good idea if you made a contribution to the workshop of social study it would be a way of taking part in the great human stream of cultural achievement without upsetting your routine or your digestion those around him were saying isnt he witty and such courage peter keating smiled radiantly he felt the attention and admiration flowing toward him from every part of the ballroom he looked at the people all these trim perfumed silkrustling people lacquered with light dripping with light as they had all been dripping with shower water a few hours ago getting ready to come here and stand in homage before a man named peter keating there were moments when he forgot that he was peter keating and he glanced at a mirror at his own figure he wanted to join in the general admiration for it once the current left him face to face with ellsworth toohey keating smiled like a boy emerging from a stream on a summer day glowing invigorated restless with energy toohey stood looking at him tooheys hands had slipped negligently into his trouser pockets making his jacket flare out over his thin hips he seemed to teeter faintly on his small feet his eyes were attentive in enigmatic appraisal now this ellsworth this isnt it a wonderful evening said keating like a child to a mother who would understand and a little like a drunk being happy peter youre quite the sensation tonight little peter seems to have crossed the line into a big celebrity it happens like this one can never tell exactly when or why theres someone here though who seems to be ignoring you quite flagrantly doesnt she keating winced he wondered when and how toohey had had the time to notice that oh well said toohey the exception proves the rule regrettable however ive always had the absurd idea that it would take a most unusual man to attract dominique francon so of course i thought of you just an idle thought still you know the man wholl get her will have something you wont be able to match hell beat you there no ones got her snapped keating no undoubtedly not not yet thats rather astonishing oh i suppose it will take an extraordinary kind of man look here what in hell are you doing you dont like dominique francon do you i never said i did a little later keating heard toohey saying solemnly in the midst of some earnest discussion happiness but that is so middleclass what is happiness there are so many things in life so much more important than happiness keating made his way slowly toward dominique she stood leaning back as if the air were a support solid enough for her thin naked shoulder blades her evening gown was the color of glass he had the feeling that he should be able to see the wall behind her through her body she seemed too fragile to exist and that very fragility spoke of some frightening strength which held her anchored to existence with a body insufficient for reality when he approached she made no effort to ignore him she turned to him she answered but the monotonous precision of her answers stopped him made him helpless made him leave her in a few moments when roark and heller entered kiki holcombe met them at the door heller presented roark to her and she spoke as she always did her voice like a shrill rocket sweeping all opposition aside by sheer speed oh mr roark ive been so eager to meet you weve all heard so much about you now i must warn you that my husband doesnt approve of you oh purely on artistic grounds you understand but dont let that worry you you have an ally in this household an enthusiastic ally its very kind mrs holcombe said roark and perhaps unnecessary oh i adore your enright house of course i cant say that it represents my own esthetic convictions but people of culture must keep their minds open to anything i mean to include any viewpoint in creative art we must be broadminded above all dont you think so i dont know said roark ive never been broadminded she was certain that he intended no insolence it was not in his voice nor his manner but insolence had been her first impression of him he wore evening clothes and they looked well on his tall thin figure but somehow it seemed that he did not belong in them the orange hair looked preposterous with formal dress besides she did not like his face that face suited a work gang or an army it had no place in her drawing room she said weve all been so interested in your work your first building my fifth oh indeed of course how interesting she clasped her hands and turned to greet a new arrival heller said whom do you want to meet first theres dominique francon looking at us come on roark turned he saw dominique standing alone across the room there was no expression on her face not even an effort to avoid expression it was strange to see a human face presenting a bone structure and an arrangement of muscles but no meaning a face as a simple anatomical feature like a shoulder or an arm not a mirror of sensate perception any longer she looked at them as they approached her feet stood posed oddly two small triangles pointed straight and parallel as if there were no floor around her but the few square inches under her soles and she were safe so long as she did not move or look down he felt a violent pleasure because she seemed too fragile to stand the brutality of what he was doing and because she stood it so well miss francon may i present howard roark said heller he had not raised his voice to pronounce the name he wondered why it had sounded so stressed then he thought that the silence had caught the name and held it still but there had been no silence roarks face was politely blank and dominique was saying correctly how do you do mr roark roark bowed how do you do miss francon she said the enright house she said it as if she had not wanted to pronounce these three words and as if they named not a house but many things beyond it roark said yes miss francon then she smiled the correct perfunctory smile with which one greets an introduction she said i know roger enright he is almost a friend of the family i havent had the pleasure of meeting many friends of mr enright i remember once father invited him to dinner it was a miserable dinner father is called a brilliant conversationalist but he couldnt bring a sound out of mr enright roger just sat there one must know father to realize what a defeat it was for him i have worked for your father her hand had been moving and it stopped in midair a few years ago as a draftsman her hand dropped then you can see that father couldnt possibly get along with roger enright no he couldnt i think roger almost liked me though but hes never forgiven me for working on a wynand paper standing between them heller thought that he had been mistaken there was nothing strange in this meeting in fact there simply was nothing he felt annoyed that dominique did not speak of architecture as one would have expected her to do he concluded regretfully that she disliked this man as she disliked most people she met then mrs gillespie caught hold of heller and led him away roark and dominique were left alone roark said mr enright reads every paper in town they are all brought to his office with the editorial pages cut out hes always done that roger missed his real vocation he should have been a scientist he has such a love for facts and such contempt for commentaries on the other hand do you know mr fleming he asked no hes a friend of hellers mr fleming never reads anything but editorial pages people like to hear him talk she watched him he was looking straight at her very politely as any man would have looked meeting her for the first time she wished she could find some hint in his face if only a hint of his old derisive smile even mockery would be an acknowledgment and a tie she found nothing he spoke as a stranger he allowed no reality but that of a man introduced to her in a drawing room flawlessly obedient to every convention of deference she faced this respectful formality thinking that her dress had nothing to hide from him that he had used her for a need more intimate than the use of the food he ate while he stood now at a distance of a few feet from her like a man who could not possibly permit himself to come closer she thought that this was his form of mockery after what he had not forgotten and would not acknowledge she thought that he wanted her to be first to name it he would bring her to the humiliation of accepting the past by being first to utter the word recalling it to reality because he knew that she could not leave it unrecalled and what does mr fleming do for a living she asked hes a manufacturer of pencil sharpeners really a friend of austens austen knows many people he says thats his business is he successful who miss francon im not sure about austen but mr fleming is very successful he has branch factories in new jersey connecticut and rhode island youre wrong about austen mr roark hes very successful in his profession and mine youre successful if it leaves you untouched how does one achieve that in one of two ways by not looking at people at all or by looking at everything about them which is preferable miss francon whichever is hardest but a desire to choose the hardest might be a confession of weakness in itself of course mr roark but its the least offensive form of confession if the weakness is there to be confessed at all then someone came flying through the crowd and an arm fell about roarks shoulders it was john erik snyte roark well of all people to see here he cried so glad so glad ages hasnt it been listen i want to talk to you let me have him for a moment dominique roark bowed to her his arms at his sides a strand of hair falling forward so that she did not see his face but only the orange head bowed courteously for a moment and he followed snyte into the crowd snyte was saying god how youve come up these last few years listen do you know whether enrights planning to go into real estate in a big way i mean any other buildings up his sleeve it was heller who forced snyte away and brought roark to joel sutton joel sutton was delighted he felt that roarks presence here removed the last of his doubts it was a stamp of safety on roarks person joel suttons hand closed about roarks elbow five pink stubby fingers on the black sleeve joel sutton gulped confidentially listen kid its all settled youre it now dont squeeze the last pennies out of me all you architects are cutthroats and highway robbers but ill take a chance on you youre a smart boy snared old rog didnt you so here youve got me swindled too just about almost that is ill give you a ring in a few days and well have a dogfight over the contract heller looked at them and thought that it was almost indecent to see them together roarks tall ascetic figure with that proud cleanliness peculiar to longlined bodies and beside him the smiling ball of meat whose decision could mean so much then roark began to speak about the future building but joel sutton looked up at him astonished and hurt joel sutton had not come here to talk about buildings parties were given for the purpose of enjoying oneself and what greater joy could there be but to forget the important things of ones life so joel sutton talked about badminton that was his hobby it was a patrician hobby he explained he was not being common like other men who wasted time on golf roark listened politely he had nothing to say you do play badminton dont you joel sutton asked suddenly no said roark you dont gulped joel sutton you dont well what a pity oh what a rotten pity i thought sure you did with that lanky frame of yours youd be good youd be a wow i thought sure wed beat the pants off of old tompkins anytime while that buildings being put up while that buildings being put up mr sutton i wouldnt have the time to play anyway what dyou mean wouldnt have the time whatve you got draftsmen for hire a couple extra let them worry ill be paying you enough wont i but then you dont play what a rotten shame i thought sure the architect who did my building down on canal street was a whiz at badminton but he died last year got himself cracked up in an auto accident damn him was a fine architect too and here you dont play mr sutton youre not really upset about it are you im very seriously disappointed my boy but what are you actually hiring me for what am i what hiring me for why to do a building of course do you really think it would be a better building if i played badminton well theres business and theres fun theres the practical and theres the human end of it oh i dont mind still i thought with a skinny frame like yours youd surely but all right all right we cant have everything when joel sutton left him roark heard a bright voice saying congratulations howard and turned to find peter keating smiling at him radiantly and derisively hello peter what did you say i said congratulations on landing joel sutton only you know you didnt handle that very well what old joel oh of course i heard most of it why shouldnt i it was very entertaining thats no way to go about it howard you know what i would have done id have sworn id played badminton since i was two years old and how its the game of kings and earls and it takes a soul of rare distinction to appreciate it and by the time hed put me to the test id have made it my business to play like an earl too what would it cost you i didnt think of it its a secret howard a rare one ill give it to you free of charge with my compliments always be what people want you to be then youve got them where you want them im giving it free because youll never make use of it youll never know how youre brilliant in some respects howard ive always said that and terribly stupid in others possibly you ought to try and learn a few things if youre going in for playing the game through the kiki holcombe salon are you growing up howard though it did give me a shock to see you here of all places oh and yes congratulations on the enright job beautiful job as usual where have you been all summer remind me to give you a lesson on how to wear a tux god but it looks silly on you thats what i like i like to see you looking silly were old friends arent we howard youre drunk peter of course i am but i havent touched a drop tonight not a drop what im drunk on youll never learn never its not for you and thats also part of what im drunk on that its not for you you know howard i love you i really do i do tonight yes peter you always will you know roark was introduced to many people and many people spoke to him they smiled and seemed sincere in their efforts to approach him as a friend to express appreciation to display good will and cordial interest but what he heard was the enright house is magnificent its almost as good as the cosmoslotnick building im sure you have a great future mr roark believe me i know the signs youll be another ralston holcombe he was accustomed to hostility this kind of benevolence was more offensive than hostility he shrugged he thought that he would be out of here soon and back in the simple clean reality of his own office he did not look at dominique again for the rest of the evening she watched him in the crowd she watched those who stopped him and spoke to him she watched his shoulders stooped courteously as he listened she thought that this too was his manner of laughing at her he let her see him being delivered to the crowd before her eyes being surrendered to any person who wished to own him for a few moments he knew that this was harder for her to watch than the sun and the drill in the quarry she stood obediently watching she did not expect him to notice her again she had to remain there as long as he was in this room there was another person that night abnormally aware of roarks presence aware from the moment roark had entered the room ellsworth toohey had seen him enter toohey had never set eyes on him before and did not know him but toohey stood looking at him for a long time then toohey moved through the crowd and smiled at his friends but between smiles and sentences his eyes went back to the man with the orange hair he looked at the man as he looked occasionally at the pavement from a window on the thirtieth floor wondering about his own body were it to be hurled down and what would happen when he struck against that pavement he did not know the mans name his profession or his past he had no need to know it was not a man to him but only a force toohey never saw men perhaps it was the fascination of seeing that particular force so explicitly personified in a human body after a while he asked john erik snyte pointing who is that man that said snyte howard roark you know the enright house oh said toohey what of course it would be want to meet him no said toohey no i dont want to meet him for the rest of the evening whenever some figure obstructed tooheys view of the hall his head would jerk impatiently to find roark again he did not want to look at roark he had to look just as he always had to look down at that distant pavement dreading the sight that evening ellsworth toohey was conscious of no one but roark roark did not know that toohey existed in the room when roark left dominique stood counting the minutes to be certain that he would be lost to sight in the streets before she could trust herself to go out then she moved to leave kiki holcombes thin moist fingers clasped her hand in parting clasped it vaguely and slipped up to hold her wrist for a moment and my dear asked kiki holcombe what did you think of that new one you know i saw you talking to him that howard roark i think said dominique firmly that he is the most revolting person ive ever met oh now really do you care for that sort of unbridled arrogance i dont know what one could say for him unless its that hes terribly goodlooking if that matters goodlooking are you being funny dominique kiki holcombe saw dominique being stupidly puzzled for once and dominique realized that what she saw in his face what made it the face of a god to her was not seen by others that it could leave them indifferent that what she had thought to be the most obvious inconsequential remark was instead a confession of something within her some quality not shared by others why my dear said kiki hes not goodlooking at all but extremely masculine dont let it astonish you dominique said a voice behind her kikis esthetic judgment is not yours nor mine dominique turned ellsworth toohey stood there smiling watching her face attentively you she began and stopped of course said toohey bowing faintly in understanding affirmative of what she had not said do give me credit for discernment dominique somewhat equal to yours though not for esthetic enjoyment ill leave that part of it to you but we do see things at times which are not obvious dont we you and i what things my dear what a long philosophical discussion that would take and how involved and how unnecessary ive always told you that we should be good friends we have so much in common intellectually we start from opposite poles but that makes no difference because you see we meet in the same point it was a very interesting evening dominique what are you driving at for instance it was interesting to discover what sort of thing appears goodlooking to you its nice to have you classified firmly concretely without words just with the aid of a certain face if if you can see what youre talking about you cant be what you are no my dear i must be what i am precisely because of what i see you know ellsworth i think youre much worse than i thought you were and perhaps much worse than youre thinking now but useful were all useful to one another as you will be to me as i think you will want to be what are you talking about thats bad dominique very bad so pointless if you dont know what im talking about i couldnt possibly explain it if you do i have you already without saying anything further what kind of a conversation is this asked kiki bewildered just our way of kidding each other said toohey brightly dont let it bother you kiki dominique and i are always kidding each other not very well though because you see we cant some day ellsworth said dominique youll make a mistake quite possible and you my dear have made yours already good night ellsworth good night dominique kiki turned to him when dominique had gone whats the matter with both of you ellsworth why such talk over nothing at all peoples faces and first impressions dont mean a thing that my dear kiki he answered his voice soft and distant as if he were giving an answer not to her but to a thought of his own is one of our greatest common fallacies theres nothing as significant as a human face nor as eloquent we can never really know another person except by our first glance at him because in that glance we know everything even though were not always wise enough to unravel the knowledge have you ever thought about the style of a soul kiki the what the style of a soul do you remember the famous philosopher who spoke of the style of a civilization he called it style he said it was the nearest word he could find for it he said that every civilization has its one basic principle one single supreme determining conception and every endeavor of men within that civilization is true unconsciously and irrevocably to that one principle i think kiki that every human soul has a style of its own also its one basic theme youll see it reflected in every thought every act every wish of that person the one absolute the one imperative in that living creature years of studying a man wont show it to you his face will youd have to write volumes to describe a person think of his face you need nothing else that sounds fantastic ellsworth and unfair if true it would leave people naked before you its worse than that it also leaves you naked before them you betray yourself by the manner in which you react to a certain face to a certain kind of face the style of your soul theres nothing important on earth except human beings theres nothing as important about human beings as their relations to one another well what do you see in my face he looked at her as if he had just noticed her presence what did you say i said what do you see in my face oh yes well tell me the movie stars you like and ill tell you what you are you know i just love to be analyzed now lets see my greatest favorite has always been but he was not listening he had turned his back on her he was walking away without apology he looked tired she had never seen him being rude before except by intention a little later from among a group of friends she heard his rich vibrant voice saying and therefore the noblest conception on earth is that of mens absolute equality and there it will stand as a monument to nothing but the egotism of mr enright and of mr roark it will stand between a row of brownstone tenements on one side and the tanks of a gashouse on the other this perhaps is not an accident but a testimonial to fates sense of fitness no other setting could bring out so eloquently the essential insolence of this building it will rise as a mockery to all the structures of the city and to the men who built them our structures are meaningless and false this building will make them more so but the contrast will not be to its advantage by creating the contrast it will have made itself a part of the great ineptitude its most ludicrous part if a ray of light falls into a pigsty it is the ray that shows us the muck and it is the ray that is offensive our structures have the great advantage of obscurity and timidity besides they suit us the enright house is bright and bold so is a feather boa it will attract attention but only to the immense audacity of mr roarks conceit when this building is erected it will be a wound on the face of our city a wound too is colorful this appeared in the column your house by dominique francon a week after the party at the home of kiki holcombe on the morning of its appearance ellsworth toohey walked into dominiques office he held a copy of the banner with the page bearing her column turned toward her he stood silently rocking a little on his small feet it seemed as if the expression of his eyes had to be heard not seen it was a visual roar of laughter his lips were folded primly innocently well she asked where did you meet roark before that party she sat looking at him one arm flung over the back of her chair a pencil dangling precariously between the tips of her fingers she seemed to be smiling she said i had never met roark before that party my mistake i was just wondering about he made the paper rustle the change of sentiment oh that well i didnt like him when i met him at the party so i noticed sit down ellsworth you dont look your best standing up do you mind not busy not particularly he sat down on the corner of her desk he sat thoughtfully tapping his knee with the folded paper you know dominique he said its not well done not well at all why dont you see what can be read between the lines of course not many will notice that he will i do its not written for him or for you but for the others for the others then its a rotten trick on him and me you see i thought it was well done well everyone to his own methods what are you going to write about it about what about the enright house nothing nothing nothing he threw the paper down on the desk without moving just flicking his wrist forward he said speaking of architecture dominique why havent you ever written anything about the cosmoslotnick building is it worth writing about oh decidedly there are people whom it would annoy very much and are those people worth annoying so it seems what people oh i dont know how can we know who reads our stuff thats what makes it so interesting all those strangers weve never seen before have never spoken to or cant speak to and heres this paper where they can read our answer if we want to give an answer i really think you should dash off a few nice things about the cosmoslotnick building you do seem to like peter keating very much i im awfully fond of peter you will be too eventually when you know him better peter is a useful person to know why dont you take time one of these days to get him to tell you the story of his life youll learn many interesting things for instance for instance that he went to stanton i know that you dont think its interesting i do wonderful place stanton remarkable example of gothic architecture the stainedglass window in the chapel is really one of the finest in this country and then think so many young students all so different some graduating with high honors others being expelled well did you know that peter keating is an old friend of howard roark no is he he is peter keating is an old friend of everybody quite true a remarkable boy but this is different you didnt know that roark went to stanton no you dont seem to know very much about mr roark i dont know anything about mr roark we werent discussing mr roark werent we no of course we were discussing peter keating well you see one can make ones point best by contrast by comparison as you did in your pretty little article today to appreciate peter as he should be appreciated lets follow up a comparison lets take two parallel lines im inclined to agree with euclid i dont think these two parallels will ever meet well they both went to stanton peters mother ran a sort of boardinghouse and roark lived with them for three years this doesnt really matter except that it makes the contrast more eloquent and well more personal later on peter graduated with high honors the highest of his class roark was expelled dont look like that i dont have to explain why he was expelled we understand you and i peter went to work for your father and hes a partner now roark worked for your father and got kicked out yes he did isnt that funny by the way he did without any help from you at all that time peter has the cosmoslotnick building to his credit and roark has a hotdog stand in connecticut peter signs autographs and roark is not known even to all the bathroom fixtures manufacturers now roarks got an apartment house to do and its precious to him like an only son while peter wouldnt even have noticed it had he got the enright house he gets them every day now i dont think that roark thinks very much of peters work he never has and he never will no matter what happens follow this a step further no man likes to be beaten but to be beaten by the man who has always stood as the particular example of mediocrity in his eyes to start by the side of this mediocrity and to watch it shoot up while he struggles and gets nothing but a boot in his face to see the mediocrity snatch from him one after another the chances hed give his life for to see the mediocrity worshipped to miss the place he wants and to see the mediocrity enshrined upon it to lose to be sacrificed to be ignored to be beaten beaten beaten not by a greater genius not by a god but by a peter keating well my little amateur do you think the spanish inquisition ever thought of a torture to equal this ellsworth she screamed get out of here she had shot to her feet she stood straight for a moment then she slumped forward her two palms flat on the desk and she stood bent over he saw her smooth mass of hair swinging heavily then hanging still hiding her face but dominique he said pleasantly i was only telling you why peter keating is such an interesting person her hair flew back like a mop and her face followed she dropped down on her chair looking at him her mouth loose and very ugly dominique he said softly youre obvious much too obvious get out of here well ive always said that you underestimated me call on me next time you need some help at the door he turned to add of course personally i think peter keating is the greatest architect weve got that evening when she came home the telephone rang dominique my dear a voice gulped anxiously over the wire did you really mean all that who is this joel sutton i hello joel did i mean what hello dear how are you how is your charming father i mean did you mean all that about the enright house and that fellow roark i mean what you said in your column today im quite a bit upset quite a bit you know about my building well were all ready to go ahead and its such a bit of money i thought i was very careful about deciding but i trust you of all people ive always trusted you youre a smart kid plenty smart if you work for a fellow like wynand i guess you know your stuff wynand knows buildings why that mans made more in real estate than on all his papers you bet he did its not supposed to be known but i know it and you working for him and now i dont know what to think because you see i had decided yes i had absolutely and definitely decided almost to have this fellow roark in fact i told him so in fact hes coming over tomorrow afternoon to sign the contract and now do you really think it will look like a feather boa listen joel she said her teeth set tight together can you have lunch with me tomorrow she met joel sutton in the vast deserted dining room of a distinguished hotel there were few solitary guests among the white tables so that each stood out the empty tables serving as an elegant setting that proclaimed the guests exclusiveness joel sutton smiled broadly he had never escorted a woman as decorative as dominique you know joel she said facing him across a table her voice quiet set unsmiling it was a brilliant idea your choosing roark oh do you think so i think so youll have a building that will be beautiful like an anthem a building that will take your breath away also your tenants a hundred years from now they will write about you in history and search for your grave in potters field good heavens dominique what are you talking about about your building about the kind of building that roark will design for you it will be a great building joel you mean good i dont mean good i mean great its not the same thing no joel no its not the same thing i dont like this great stuff no you dont i didnt think you would then what do you want with roark you want a building that wont shock anybody a building that will be folksy and comfortable and safe like the old parlor back home that smells of clam chowder a building that everybody will like everybody and anybody its very uncomfortable to be a hero joel and you dont have the figure for it well of course i want a building that people will like what do you think im putting it up for for my health no joel nor for your soul you mean roarks no good she sat straight and stiff as if all her muscles were drawn tight against pain but her eyes were heavy half closed as if a hand were caressing her body she said do you see many buildings that hes done do you see many people hiring him there are six million people in the city of new york six million people cant be wrong can they of course not of course but i thought enright youre not enright joel for one thing he doesnt smile so much then you see enright wouldnt have asked my opinion you did thats what i like you for do you really like me dominique didnt you know that youve always been one of my great favorites i ive always trusted you ill take your word anytime what do you really think i should do its simple you want the best that money can buy of what money can buy you want a building that will be what it deserves to be you want an architect whom other people have employed so that you can show them that youre just as good as they are thats right thats exactly right look dominique youve hardly touched your food im not hungry well what architect would you recommend think joel who is there at the moment that everybodys talking about who gets the pick of all commissions who makes the most money for himself and his clients whos young and famous and safe and popular why i guess i guess peter keating yes joel peter keating im so sorry mr roark so terribly sorry believe me but after all im not in business for my health not for my health nor for my soul that is i mean well im sure you can understand my position and its not that i have anything against you quite the contrary i think youre a great architect you see thats just the trouble greatness is fine but its not practical thats the trouble mr roark not practical and after all you must admit that mr keating has much the better name and hes got that that popular touch which you havent been able to achieve it disturbed mr sutton that roark did not protest he wished roark would try to argue then he could bring forth the unanswerable justifications which dominique had taught him a few hours ago but roark said nothing he had merely inclined his head when he heard the decision mr sutton wanted desperately to utter the justifications but it seemed pointless to try to convince a man who seemed convinced still mr sutton loved people and did not want to hurt anyone as a matter of fact mr roark im not alone in this decision as a matter of fact i did want you i had decided on you honestly i had but it was miss dominique francon whose judgment i value most highly who convinced me that you were not the right choice for this commission and she was fair enough to allow me to tell you that she did he saw roark looking at him suddenly then he saw the hollows of roarks cheeks twisted as if drawn in deeper and his mouth open he was laughing without sound but for one sharp intake of breath what on earth are you laughing at mr roark so miss francon wanted you to tell me this she didnt want me to why should she she merely said that i could tell you if i wished yes of course which only shows her honesty and that she had good reasons for her convictions and will stand by them openly yes well whats the matter nothing mr sutton look its not decent to laugh like that no his room was half dark around him a sketch of the heller house was tacked unframed on a long blank wall it made the room seem emptier and the wall longer he did not feel the minutes passing but he felt time as a solid thing enclosed and kept apart within the room time clear of all meaning save the unmoving reality of his body when he heard the knock at the door he said come in without rising dominique came in she entered as if she had entered this room before she wore a black suit of heavy cloth simple like a childs garment worn as mere protection not as ornament she had a high masculine collar raised to her cheeks and a hat cutting half her face out of sight he sat looking at her she waited to see the derisive smile but it did not come the smile seemed implicit in the room itself in her standing there halfway across that room she took her hat off like a man entering a house she pulled it off by the brim with the tips of stiff fingers and held it hanging down at the end of her arm she waited her face stern and cold but her smooth pale hair looked defenseless and humble she said you are not surprised to see me i expected you tonight she raised her hand bending her elbow with a tight economy of motion the bare minimum needed and flung her hat across to a table the hats long flight showed the violence in that controlled jerk of her wrist he asked what do you want she answered you know what i want her voice heavy and flat yes but i want to hear you say it all of it if you wish her voice had the sound of efficiency obeying an order with metallic precision i want to sleep with you now tonight and at any time you may care to call me i want your naked body your skin your mouth your hands i want you like this not hysterical with desire but coldly and consciously without dignity and without regrets i want you i have no selfrespect to bargain with me and divide me i want you i want you like an animal or a cat on a fence or a whore she spoke on a single level tone as if she were reciting an austere catechism of faith she stood without moving her feet in flat shoes planted apart her shoulders thrown back her arms hanging straight at her sides she looked impersonal untouched by the words she pronounced chaste like a young boy you know that i hate you roark i hate you for what you are for wanting you for having to want you im going to fight you and im going to destroy you and i tell you this as calmly as i told you mat im a begging animal im going to pray that you cant be destroyed i tell you this too even though i believe in nothing and have nothing to pray to but i will fight to block every step you take i will fight to tear every chance you want away from you i will hurt you through the only thing that can hurt you through your work i will fight to starve you to strangle you on the things you wont be able to reach i have done it to you today and that is why i shall sleep with you tonight he sat deep in his chair stretched out his body relaxed and taut in relaxation a stillness being filled slowly with the violence of future motion i have hurt you today ill do it again ill come to you whenever i have beaten you whenever i know that i have hurt you and ill let you own me i want to be owned not by a lover but by an adversary who will destroy my victory over him not with honorable blows but with the touch of his body on mine that is what i want of you roark that is what i am you wanted to hear it all youve heard it what do you wish to say now take your clothes off she stood still for a moment two hard spots swelled and grew white under the corners of her mouth then she saw a movement in the cloth of his shirt one jolt of controlled breath and she smiled in her turn derisively as he had always smiled at her she lifted her two hands to her collar and unfastened the buttons of her jacket simply precisely one after another she threw the jacket down on the floor she took off a thin white blouse and she noticed the tight black gloves on the wrists of her naked arms she took the gloves off pulling at each finger in turn she undressed indifferently as if she were alone in her own bedroom then she looked at him she stood naked waiting feeling the space between them like a pressure against her stomach knowing that it was torture for him also and that it was as they both wanted it then he got up he walked to her and when he held her her arms rose willingly and she felt the shape of his body imprinted into the skin on the inside of her arm as it encircled him his ribs his armpit his back his shoulder blade under her fingers her mouth on his in a surrender more violent than her struggle had been afterward she lay in bed by his side under his blanket looking at his room and she asked roark why were you working in that quarry you know it yes anyone else would have taken a job in an architects office and then youd have no desire at all to destroy me you understand that yes keep still it doesnt matter now do you know that the enright house is the most beautiful building in new york i know that you know it roark you worked in that quarry when you had the enright house in you and many other enright houses and you were drilling granite like a youre going to weaken in a moment dominique and then youll regret it tomorrow yes youre very lovely dominique dont youre lovely roark i ill still want to destroy you do you think i would want you if you didnt roark you want to hear that again part of it i want you dominique i want you i want you i she stopped the word on which she stopped almost audible in her breath no he said not yet you wont say that yet go to sleep here with you here with me ill fix breakfast for you in the morning did you know that i fix my own breakfast youll like seeing that like the work in the quarry then youll go home and think about destroying me good night dominique the blinds raised over the windows of her living room the lights of the city rising to a black horizon halfway up the glass panes dominique sat at her desk correcting the last sheets of an article when she heard the doorbell guests did not disturb her without warning and she looked up the pencil held in midair angry and curious she heard the steps of the maid in the hall then the maid came in saying a gentleman to see you madam a faint hostility in her voice explaining that the gentleman had refused to give his name a man with orange hair dominique wanted to ask but didnt the pencil jerked stiffly and she said have him come then the door opened against the light of the hall she saw a long neck and sloping shoulders like the silhouette of a bottle a rich creamy voice said good evening dominique and she recognized ellsworth toohey whom she had never asked to her house she smiled she said good evening ellsworth i havent seen you for such a long time you should have expected me now dont you think so he turned to the maid cointreau please if you have it and im sure you do the maid glanced at dominique wideeyed dominique nodded silently and the maid went out closing the door busy of course said toohey glancing at the littered desk very becoming dominique gets results too youve been writing much better lately she let the pencil fall and threw an arm over the back of her chair half turning to him watching him placidly what do you want ellsworth he did not sit down but stood examining the place with the unhurried curiosity of an expert not bad dominique just about as id expect you to have it a little cold you know i wouldnt have that iceblue chair over there too obvious fits in too well just what people would expect in just that spot id have it carrot red an ugly glaring outrageous red like mr howard roarks hair thats quite en passant merely a convenient figure of speech nothing personal at all just one touch of the wrong color would make the whole room the sort of thing that gives a place elegance your flower arrangements are nice the pictures too not bad all right ellsworth all right what is it but dont you know that ive never been here before somehow youve never asked me i dont know why he sat down comfortably resting an ankle on a knee one thin leg stretched horizontally across the other the full length of a tight gunmetal sock exposed under the trouser cuff and a patch of skin showing above the sock bluishwhite with a few black hairs but then youve been so unsociable the past tense my dear the past tense did you say that we havent seen each other for a long time thats true youve been so busy in such an unusual way visits dinners speakeasies and giving tea parties havent you i have tea parties i thought that was tops this is a good room for parties large plenty of space to stuff people into particularly if youre not particular whom you stuff it with and youre not not now what do you serve them anchovy paste and minced egg cut out like hearts caviar and minced onion cut out like stars what about the old ladies cream cheese and chopped walnuts in spirals id like to have seen you taking care of things like that its wonderful how thoughtful youve become of old ladies particularly the filthy rich with sonsinlaw in real estate though i dont think thats as bad as going to see knock me flat with commodore higbee who has false teeth and a nice vacant lot on the corner of broadway and chambers the maid came in with the tray toohey took a glass and held it delicately inhaling while the maid went out will you tell me why the secret service department i wont ask who and why the detailed reports on ray activities dominique said indifferently you can ask who anyone and everyone dont you suppose people are talking about miss dominique francon in the role of a famous hostess so suddenly miss dominique francon as a sort of second kiki holcombe but much better oh much much subtler much abler and then just think how much more beautiful its about time you made some use of that superlative appearance of yours that any woman would cut your throat for its still being wasted of course if one thinks of form in relation to its proper function but at least some people are getting some good out of it your father for instance im sure hes delighted with this new life of yours little dominique being friendly to people little dominique whos become normal at last hes wrong of course but its nice to make him happy a few others too me for instance though youd never do anything just to make me happy but then you see thats my lucky faculty to extract joy from what was not intended for me at all in a purely selfless way youre not answering my question but i am you asked why the interest in your activities and i answer because they make me happy besides look one could be astonished though shortsightedly if i were gathering information on the activities of my enemies but not to be informed about the actions of my own side really you know you didnt think id be so unskilled a general and whatever else you might think of me youve never thought me unskilled your side ellsworth look dominique thats the trouble with your written and spoken style you use too many question marks bad in any case particularly bad when unnecessary lets drop the quiz technique and just talk since we both understand and there arent any questions to be asked between us if there were youd have thrown me out instead you gave me a very expensive liqueur he held the rim of the glass under his nose and inhaled with a loose kind of sensual relish which at a dinner table would have been equivalent to a loud lipsmacking vulgar there superlatively elegant here over a cutcrystal edge pressed to a neat little mustache all right she said talk thats what ive been doing which is considerate of me since youre not ready to talk not yet for a while well lets talk in a purely contemplative manner about how interesting it is to see people welcoming you into their midst so eagerly accepting you flocking to you why is it do you suppose they do plenty of snubbing on their own but just let someone whos snubbed them all her life suddenly break down and turn gregarious and they all come rolling on their backs with their paws folded for you to rub their bellies why there could be two explanations i think the nice one would be that they are generous and wish to honor you with their friendship only the nice explanations are never the true ones the other one is that they know youre degrading yourself by needing them youre coming down off a pinnacle every loneliness is a pinnacle and theyre delighted to drag you down through their friendship though of course none of them knows it consciously except yourself thats why you go through agonies doing it and youd never do it for a noble cause youd never do it except for the end youve chosen an end viler than the means and making the means endurable you know ellsworth youve said a sentence there that youd never use in your column did i undoubtedly i can say a great many things to you that id never use in my column which one every loneliness is a pinnacle that yes quite right i wouldnt youre welcome to it though its not too good fairly crude ill give you better ones some day if you wish sorry however that thats all you picked out of my little speech what did you want me to pick well my two explanations for instance theres an interesting question there what is kinder to believe the best of people and burden them with a nobility beyond their endurance or to see them as they are and accept it because it makes them comfortable kindness being more important than justice of course i dont give a damn ellsworth not in a mood for abstract speculation interested only in concrete results all right how many commissions have you landed for peter keating in the last three months she rose walked to the tray which the maid had left poured herself a drink and said four raising the glass to her mouth then she turned to look at him standing glass in hand and added and that was the famous toohey technique never place your punch at the beginning of a column nor at the end sneak it in where its least expected fill a whole column with drivel just to get in that one important line he bowed courteously quite thats why i like to talk to you its such a waste to be subtle and vicious with people who dont even know that youre being subtle and vicious but the drivel is never accidental dominique also i didnt know that the technique of my column was becoming obvious i will have to think of a new one dont bother they love it of course theyll love anything i write so its four i missed one i counted three i cant understand why you had to come here if thats all you wanted to know youre so fond of peter keating and im helping him along beautifully better than you could so if you wanted to give me a pep talk about petey it wasnt necessary was it youre wrong there twice in one sentence dominique one honest error and one lie the honest error is the assumption that i wish to help petey keating and incidentally i can help him much better than you can and i have and will but thats longrange contemplation the lie is that i came here to talk about peter keating you knew what i came here to talk about when you saw me enter and oh my youd allow someone more obnoxious than myself to barge in on you just to talk about that subject though i dont know who could be more obnoxious to you than myself at the moment peter keating she said he made a grimace wrinkling his nose oh no hes not big enough for that but lets talk about peter keating its such a convenient coincidence that he happens to be your fathers partner youre merely working your head off to procure commissions for your father like a dutiful daughter nothing more natural youve done wonders for the firm of francon keating in these last three months just by smiling at a few dowagers and wearing stunning models at some of our better gatherings wonder what youd accomplish if you decided to go all the way and sell your matchless body for purposes other than esthetic contemplation in exchange for commissions for peter keating he paused she said nothing and he added my compliments dominique youve lived up to my best opinion of you by not being shocked at this what was that intended for ellsworth shock value or hint value oh it could have been a number of things a preliminary feeler for instance but as a matter of fact it was nothing at all just a touch of vulgarity also the toohey technique you know i always advise the wrong touch at the right time i am essentially such an earnest singletoned puritan that i must allow myself another color occasionally to relieve the monotony are you ellsworth i wonder what you are essentially i dont know i dare say nobody does he said pleasantly although really theres no mystery about it at all its very simple all things are simple when you reduce them to fundamentals youd be surprised if you knew how few fundamentals there are only two perhaps to explain all of us its the untangling the reducing thats difficult thats why people dont like to bother i dont think theyd like the results either i dont mind i know what i am go ahead and say it im just a bitch dont fool yourself my dear youre much worse than a bitch youre a saint which shows why saints are dangerous and undesirable and you as a matter of fact i know exactly what i am that alone can explain a great deal about me im giving you a helpful hint if you care to use it you dont of course you might though in the future why should i you need me dominique you might as well understand me a little you see im not afraid of being understood not by you i need you oh come on show a little courage too she sat up and waited coldly silently he smiled obviously with pleasure making no effort to hide the pleasure lets see he said studying the ceiling with casual attention those commissions you got for peter keating the cryon office building was mere nuisance value howard roark never had a chance at that the lindsay home was better roark was definitely considered i think he would have got it but for you the stonebrook clubhouse also he had a chance at that which you ruined he looked at her and chuckled softly no comments on techniques and punches dominique the smile was like cold grease floating over the fluid sounds of his voice you slipped up on the norris country house he got that last week you know well you cant be a hundred per cent successful after all the enright house is a big job its creating a lot of talk and quite a few people are beginning to show interest in mr howard roark but youve done remarkably well my congratulations now dont you think im being nice to you every artist needs appreciation and theres nobody to compliment you since nobody knows what youre doing but roark and me and he wont thank you on second thought i dont think roark knows what youre doing and that spoils the fun doesnt it she asked how do you know what im doing her voice tired my dear surely you havent forgotten that it was i who gave you the idea in the first place oh yes she said absently yes and now you know why i came here now you know what i meant when i spoke about my side yes she said of course this is a pact my dear an alliance allies never trust each other but that doesnt spoil their effectiveness our motives might be quite opposite in fact they are but it doesnt matter the result will be the same it is not necessary to have a noble aim in common it is necessary only to have a common enemy we have yes thats why you need me ive been helpful once yes i can hurt your mr roark much better than any tea party youll ever give what for omit the whatfors i dont inquire into yours all right then its to be understood between us were allies in this she looked at him she slouched forward attentive her face empty then she said were allies fine my dear now listen stop mentioning him in your column every other day or so i know you take vicious cracks at him each time but its too much youre keeping his name in print and you dont want to do that further youd better invite me to those parties of yours there are things i can do which you cant another tip mr gilbert colton you know the california pottery coltons is planning a branch factory in the east hes thinking of a good modernist in fact hes thinking of mr roark dont let roark get it its a huge job with lots of publicity go and invent a new tea sandwich for mrs colton do anything you wish but dont let roark get it she got up dragged her feet to a table her arms swinging loosely and took a cigarette she lighted it turned to him and said indifferently you can talk very briefly and to the point when you want to when i find it necessary she stood at the window looking out over the city she said youve never actually done anything against roark i didnt know you cared quite so much oh my dear havent i youve never mentioned him in print that my dear is what ive done against mr roark so far when did you first hear of him when i saw drawings of the heller house you didnt think id miss that did you and you when i saw drawings of the enright house not before not before she smoked in silence then she said without turning to him ellsworth if one of us tried to repeat what we said here tonight the other would deny it and it could never be proved so it doesnt matter if were sincere with each other does it its quite safe why do you hate him i never said i hated him she shrugged as for the rest he added i think you can answer that yourself she nodded slowly to the bright little point of her cigarettes reflection on the glass plane he got up walked over to her and stood looking at the lights of the city below them at the angular shapes of buildings at the dark walls made translucent by the glow of the windows as if the walls were only a checkered veil of thin black gauze over a solid mass of radiance and ellsworth toohey said softly look at it a sublime achievement isnt it a heroic achievement think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the millions who profit by it and it is said that but for the spirit of a dozen men here and there down the ages but for a dozen men less perhaps none of this would have been possible and that might be true if so there are again two possible attitudes to take we can say that these twelve were great benefactors that we are all fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit and that we are glad to accept it in gratitude and brotherhood or we can say that by the splendor of their achievement which we can neither equal nor keep these twelve have shown us what we are that we do not want the free gifts of their grandeur that a cave by an oozing swamp and a fire of sticks rubbed together are preferable to skyscrapers and neon lights if the cave and the sticks are the limit of your own creative capacities of the two attitudes dominique which would you call the truly humanitarian one because you see im a humanitarian after a while dominique found it easier to associate with people she learned to accept selftorture as an endurance test urged on by the curiosity to discover how much she could endure she moved through formal receptions theater parties dinners dances gracious and smiling a smile that made her face brighter and colder like the sun on a winter day she listened emptily to empty words uttered as if the speaker would be insulted by any sign of enthusiastic interest from his listener as if only boredom were the only bond possible between people the only preservative of their precarious dignity she nodded to everything and accepted everything yes mr holt i think peter keating is the man of the century our century no mr inskip not howard roark you dont want howard roark a phony of course hes a phony it takes your sensitive honesty to evaluate the integrity of a man nothing much no mr inskip of course howard roark is nothing much its all a matter of size and distance and distance no i dont think very much mr inskip im glad you like my eyes yes they always look like that when im enjoying myself and it made me so happy to hear you say that howard roark is nothing much youve met mr roark mrs jones and you didnt like him oh hes the type of man for whom one can feel no compassion how true compassion is a wonderful thing its what one feels when one looks at a squashed caterpillar an elevating experience one can let oneself go and spread you know like taking a girdle off you dont have to hold your stomach your heart or your spirit up when you feel compassion all you have to do is look down its much easier when you look up you get a pain in the neck compassion is the greatest virtue it justifies suffering theres got to be suffering in the world else how would we be virtuous and feel compassion oh it has an antithesis but such a hard demanding one admiration mrs jones admiration but that takes more than a girdle so i say that anyone for whom we cant feel sorry is a vicious person like howard roark late at night often she came to roarks room she came unannounced certain of finding him there and alone in his room there was no necessity to spare lie agree and erase herself out of being here she was free to resist to see her resistance welcomed by an adversary too strong to fear a contest strong enough to need it she found a will granting her the recognition of her own entity untouched and not to be touched except in clean battle to win or to be defeated but to be preserved in victory or defeat not ground into the meaningless pulp of the impersonal when they lay in bed together it was as it had to be as the nature of the act demanded an act of violence it was surrender made the more complete by the force of their resistance it was an act of tension as the great things on earth are things of tension it was tense as electricity the force fed on resistance rushing through wires of metal stretched tight it was tense as water made into power by the restraining violence of a dam the touch of his skin against hers was not a caress but a wave of pain it became pain by being wanted too much by releasing in fulfillment all the past hours of desire and denial it was an act of clenched teeth and hatred it was the unendurable the agony an act of passion the word born to mean suffering it was the moment made of hatred tension pain the moment that broke its own elements inverted them triumphed swept into a denial of all suffering into its antithesis into ecstasy she came to his room from a party wearing an evening gown expensive and fragile like a coating of ice over her body and she leaned against the wall feeling the rough plaster under her skin glancing slowly at every object around her at the crude kitchen table loaded with sheets of paper at the steel rulers at the towels smudged by the black prints of five fingers at the bare boards of the floor and she let her glance slide down the length of her shining satin down to the small triangle of a silver sandal thinking of how she would be undressed here she liked to wander about the room to throw her gloves down among a litter of pencils rubber erasers and rags to put her small silver bag on a stained discarded shirt to snap open the catch of a diamond bracelet and drop it on a plate with the remnant of a sandwich by an unfinished drawing roark she said standing behind his chair her arms over his shoulders her hand under his shirt fingers spread and pressed flat against his chest i made mr symons promise his job to peter keating today thirtyfive floors and anything hell wish to make it cost money no objective just art free art she heard the sound of his soft chuckle but he did not turn to look at her only his fingers closed over her wrist and he pushed her hand farther down under his shirt pressing it hard against his skin then she pulled his head back and she bent down to cover his mouth with hers she came in and found a copy of the banner spread out on his table open at the page bearing your house by dominique francon her column contained the line howard roark is the marquis de sade of architecture hes in love with his buildings and look at them she knew that he disliked the banner that he put it there only for her sake that he watched her noticing it with the halfsmile she dreaded on his face she was angry she wanted him to read everything she wrote yet she would have preferred to think that it hurt him enough to make him avoid it later lying across the bed with his mouth on her breast she looked past the orange tangle of his head at that sheet of newspaper on the table and he felt her trembling with pleasure she sat on the floor at his feet her head pressed to his knees holding his hand closing her fist in turn over each of his fingers closing it tight and letting it slide slowly down the length of his finger feeling the hard small stops at the joints and she asked softly roark you wanted to get the colton factory you wanted it very badly yes very badly he answered without smiling and without pain then she raised his hand to her lips and held it there for a long time she got out of bed in the darkness and walked naked across his room to take a cigarette from the table she bent to the light of a match her flat stomach rounded faintly in the movement he said light one for me and she put a cigarette between his lips then she wandered through the dark room smoking while he lay in bed propped up on his elbow watching her once she came in and found him working at his table he said ive got to finish this sit down wait he did not look at her again she waited silently huddled in a chair at the farthest end of the room she watched the straight lines of his eyebrows drawn in concentration the set of his mouth the vein beating under the tight skin of his neck the sharp surgical assurance of his hand he did not look like an artist he looked like the quarry worker like a wrecker demolishing walls and like a monk then she did not want him to stop or glance at her because she wanted to watch the ascetic purity of his person the absence of all sensuality to watch that and to think of what she remembered there were nights when he came to her apartment as she came to his without warning if she had guests he said get rid of them and walked into the bedroom while she obeyed they had a silent agreement understood without mention never to be seen together her bedroom was an exquisite place of glass and pale icegreen he liked to come in wearing clothes stained by a day spent on the construction site he liked to throw back the covers of her bed then to sit talking quietly for an hour or two not looking at the bed not mentioning her writing or buildings or the latest commission she had obtained for peter keating the simplicity of being at ease here like this making the hours more sensual than the moments they delayed there were evenings when they sat together in her living room at the huge window high over the city she liked to see him at that window he would stand half turned to her smoking looking at the city below she would move away from him and sit down on the floor in the middle of the room and watch him once when he got out of bed she switched the light on and saw him standing there naked she looked at him then she said her voice quiet and desperate with the simple despair of complete sincerity roark everything ive done all my life is because its the kind of a world that made you work in a quarry last summer i know that he sat down at the foot of the bed she moved over she pressed her face against his thigh curled up her feet on the pillow her arm hanging down letting her palm move slowly up the length of his leg from the ankle to the knee and back again she said but of course if it had been up to me last spring when you were broke and jobless i would have sent you precisely to that kind of a job in that particular quarry i know that too but maybe you wouldnt have maybe youd have had me as washroom attendant in the clubhouse of the aga yes possibly put your hand on my back roark just hold it there like that she lay still her face buried against his knees her arm hanging down over the side of the bed not moving as if nothing in her were alive but the skin between her shoulder blades under his hand in the drawing rooms she visited in the restaurants in the offices of the aga people talked about the dislike of miss dominique francon of the banner for howard roark that architectural freak of roger enrights it gave him a sort of scandalous fame it was said roark you know the guy dominique francon cant stand the guts of the francon girl knows her architecture all right and if she says hes no good he must be worse than i thought he was god but these two must hate each other though i understand they havent even met she liked to hear these things it pleased her when athelstan beasely wrote in his column in the aga bulletin discussing the architecture of medieval castles to understand the grim ferocity of these structures we must remember that the wars between feudal lords were a savage business something like the feud between miss dominique francon and mr howard roark austen heller who had been her friend spoke to her about it he was angrier than she had ever seen him his face lost all the charm of his usual sarcastic poise what in hell do you think youre doing dominique he snapped this is the greatest exhibition of journalistic hooliganism ive ever seen swilled out in public print why dont you leave that sort of thing to ellsworth toohey ellsworth is good isnt he she said at least hes had the decency to keep his unsanitary trap shut about roark though of course that too is an indecency but whats happened to you do you realize who and what youre talking about it was all right when you amused yourself by praising some horrible abortion of grandpaw holcombes or panning the pants off your own father and that pretty butcherscalendar boy that hes got himself for a partner it didnt matter one way or another but to bring that same intellectual manner to the appraisal of someone like roark you know i really thought you had integrity and judgment if ever given a chance to exercise them in fact i thought you were behaving like a tramp only to emphasize the mediocrity of the saps whose works you had to write about i didnt think that you were just an irresponsible bitch you were wrong she said roger enright entered her office one morning and said without greeting get your hat youre coming to see it with me good morning roger she said to see what the enright house as much of it as weve got put up why certainly roger she smiled rising id love to see the enright house on their way she asked whats the matter roger trying to bribe me he sat stiffly on the vast gray cushions of his limousine not looking at her he answered i can understand stupid malice i can understand ignorant malice i cant understand deliberate rottenness you are free of course to write anything you wish afterward but it wont be stupidity and it wont be ignorance you overestimate me roger she shrugged and said nothing else for the rest of the ride they walked together past the wooden fence into the jungle of naked steel and planks that was to be the enright house her high heels stepped lightly over limespattered boards and she walked leaning back in careless insolent elegance she stopped and looked at the sky held in a frame of steel the sky that seemed more distant than usual thrust back by the sweeping length of beams she looked at the steel cages of future projections at the insolent angles at the incredible complexity of this shape coming to life as a simple logical whole a naked skeleton with planes of air to form the walls a naked skeleton on a cold winter day with a sense of birth and promise like a bare tree with a first touch of green oh roger he looked at her and saw the kind of face one should expect to see in church at easter i didnt underestimate either one he said dryly neither you nor the building good morning said a low hard voice beside them she was not shocked to see roark she had not heard him approaching but it would have been unnatural to think of this building without him she felt that he simply was there that he had been there from the moment she crossed the outside fence that this structure was he in a manner more personal than his body he stood before them his hand thrust into the pockets of a loose coat his hair hatless in the cold miss francon mr roark said enright we have met once she said at the holcombes if mr roark remembers of course miss francon said roark i wanted miss francon to see it said enright shall i show you around roark asked him yes do please she answered first the three of them walked together through the structure and the workers stared curiously at dominique roark explained the layout of future rooms the system of elevators the heating plant the arrangement of windows as he would have explained it to a contractors assistant she asked questions and he answered how many cubic feet of space mr roark how many tons of steel be careful of these pipes miss francon step this way enright walked along his eyes on the ground looking at nothing but then he asked hows it going howard and roark smiled answering two days ahead of schedule and they stood talking about the job like brothers forgetting her for a moment the clanging roar of machines around them drowning out their words she thought standing here in the heart of the building that if she had nothing of him nothing but his body here it was offered to her the rest of him to be seen and touched open to all the girders and the conduits and the sweeping reaches of space were his and could not have been anyone elses in the world his as his face as his soul here was the shape he had made and the thing within him which had caused him to make it the end and the cause together the motive power eloquent in every line of steel a mans self hers for this moment hers by grace of her seeing it and understanding are you tired miss francon asked roark looking at her face no she said no not at all i have been thinking what kind of plumbing fixtures are you going to use here mr roark a few days later in his room sitting on the edge of his drafting table she looked at a newspaper at her column and the lines i have visited the enright construction site i wish that in some future air raid a bomb would blast this house out of existence it would be a worthy ending so much better than to see it growing old and sootstained degraded by the family photographs the dirty socks the cocktail shakers and the grapefruit rinds of its inhabitants there is not a person in new york city who should be allowed to live in this building roark came to stand beside her his legs pressed to her knees and he looked down at the paper smiling you have roger completely bewildered by this he said has he read it i was in his office this morning when he read it at first he called you some names id never heard before then he said wait a minute and he read it again he looked up very puzzled but not angry at all and he said if you read it one way but on the other hand what did you say nothing you know dominique im very grateful but when are you going to stop handing me all that extravagant praise someone else might see it and you wont like that someone else you know that i got it from that first article of yours about the enright house you wanted me to get it but dont you think someone else might understand your way of doing things oh yes but the effect for you will be worse than if they didnt theyll like you the less for it however i dont know wholl even bother to understand unless its roark what do you think of ellsworth toohey good god why should anyone think of ellsworth toohey she liked the rare occasions when she met roark at some gathering where heller or enright had brought him she liked the polite impersonal miss francon pronounced by his voice she enjoyed the nervous concern of the hostess and her efforts not to let them come together she knew that the people around them expected some explosion some shocking sign of hostility which never came she did not seek roark out and she did not avoid him they spoke to each other if they happened to be included in the same group as they would have spoken to anyone else it required no effort it was real and right it made everything right even this gathering she found a deep sense of fitness in the fact that here among people they should be strangers strangers and enemies she thought these people can think of many things he and i are to each other except what we are it made the moments she remembered greater the moments not touched by the sight of others by the words of others not even by their knowledge she thought it has no existence here except in me and in him she felt a sense of possession such as she could feel nowhere else she could never own him as she owned him in a room among strangers when she seldom looked in his direction if she glanced at him across the room and saw him in conversation with blank indifferent faces she turned away unconcerned if the faces were hostile she watched for a second pleased she was angry when she saw a smile a sign of warmth or approval on a face turned to him it was not jealousy she did not care whether the face was a mans or a womans she resented the approval as an impertinence she was tortured by peculiar things by the street where he lived by the doorstep of his house by the cars that turned the corner of his block she resented the cars in particular she wished she could make them drive on to the next street she looked at the garbage pail by the stoop next door and she wondered whether it had stood there when he passed by on his way to his office this morning whether he had looked at that crumpled cigarette package on top once in the lobby of his house she saw a man stepping out of the elevator she was shocked for a second she had always felt as if he were the only inhabitant of that house when she rode up in the small selfoperating elevator she stood leaning against the wall her arms crossed over her breast her hands hugging her shoulders feeling huddled and intimate as in a stall under a warm shower she thought of that while some gentleman was telling her about the latest show on broadway while roark was sipping a cocktail at the other end of the room while she heard the hostess whispering to somebody my lord i didnt think gordon would bring dominique i know austen will be furious at me because of his friend roark being here you know later lying across his bed her eyes closed her cheeks flushed her lips wet losing the sense of the rules she herself had imposed losing the sense of her words she whispered roark there was a man talking to you out there today and he was smiling at you the fool the terrible fool last week he was looking at a pair of movie comedians and loving them i wanted to tell that man dont look at him youll have no right to want to look at anything else dont like him youll have to hate the rest of the world its like that you damn fool one or the other not together not with the same eyes dont look at him dont like him dont approve thats what i wanted to tell him not you and the rest of it i cant bear to see that i cant stand it anything to take you away from it from their world from all of them anything roark she did not hear herself saying it she did not see him smiling she did not recognize the full understanding in his face she saw only his face close over hers and she had nothing to hide from him nothing to keep unstated everything was granted answered found peter keating was bewildered dominiques sudden devotion to his career seemed dazzling flattering enormously profitable everybody told him so but there were moments when he did not feel dazzled or flattered he felt uneasy he tried to avoid guy francon how did you do it peter how did you do it francon would ask she must be crazy about you whod every think that dominique of all people would and whod think she could shed have made me a millionaire if shed done her stuff five years ago but then of course a father is not the same inspiration as a he caught an ominous look on keatings face and changed the end of his sentence to as her man shall we say listen guy keating began and stopped sighing and muttered please guy we mustnt i know i know i know we mustnt be premature but hell peter entre nous isnt it all as public as an engagement more so and louder then the smile vanished and francons face looked earnest peaceful frankly aged in one of his rare flashes of genuine dignity and im glad peter he said simply thats what i wanted to happen i guess i always did love dominique after all it makes me happy i know ill be leaving her in good hands her and everything else eventually look old man will you forgive me im so terribly rushed had two hours sleep last night the colton factory you know jesus what a job thanks to dominique its a killer but wait till you see it wait till you see the check too isnt she wonderful will you tell me why is she doing it ive asked her and i cant make head or tail of what she says she gives me the craziest gibberish you know how she talks oh well we should worry so long as shes doing it he could not tell francon that he had no answer he couldnt admit that he had not seen dominique alone for months that she refused to see him he remembered his last private conversation with her in the cab on their way from tooheys meeting he remembered the indifferent calm of her insults to him the utter contempt of insults delivered without anger he could have expected anything after that except to see her turn into his champion his press agent almost his pimp thats whats wrong he thought that i can think of words like that when i think about it he had seen her often since she started on her unrequested campaign he had been invited to her parties and introduced to his future clients he had never been allowed a moment alone with her he had tried to thank her and to question her but he could not force a conversation she did not want continued with a curious mob of guests pressing all around them so he went on smiling blandly her hand resting casually on the black sleeve of his dinner jacket her thigh against his as she stood beside him her pose possessive and intimate made flagrantly intimate by her air of not noticing it while she told an admiring circle what she thought of the cosmoslotnick building he heard envious comments from all his friends he was he thought bitterly the only man in new york city who did not think that dominique francon was in love with him but he knew the dangerous instability of her whims and this was too valuable a whim to disturb he stayed away from her and sent her flowers he rode along and tried not to think of it the little edge remained a thin edge of uneasiness one day he met her by chance in a restaurant he saw her lunching alone and grasped the opportunity he walked straight to her table determined to act like an old friend who remembered nothing but her incredible benevolence after many bright comments on his luck he asked dominique why have you been refusing to see me what should i have wanted to see you for but good lord almighty that came out involuntarily with too sharp a sound of longsuppressed anger and he corrected it hastily smiling well dont you think you owed me a chance to thank you youve thanked me many times yes but didnt you think we really had to meet alone didnt you think that id be a little bewildered i havent thought of it yes i suppose you could be well well what what is it all about about fifty thousand dollars by now i think youre being nasty want me to stop oh no that is not not the commissions fine i wont stop them you see what was there for us to talk about im doing things for you and youre glad to have me do them so were in perfect agreement you do say the funniest things in perfect agreement thats sort of a redundancy and an understatement at the same time isnt it what else could we be under the circumstances you wouldnt expect me to object to what youre doing would you no i wouldnt but agreeing is not the word for what i feel im so terribly grateful to you that im simply dizzy i was bowled over dont let me get silly now i know you dont like that but im so grateful i dont know what to do with myself fine peter now youve thanked me you see ive never flattered myself by thinking that you thought very much of my work or cared or took any notice and then you thats what makes me so happy and dominique he asked and his voice jerked a little because the question was like a nook pulling at a line long and hidden and he knew that this was the core of his uneasiness do you really think that im a great architect she smiled slowly she said peter if people heard you asking that theyd laugh particularly asking that of me yes i know but but do you really mean them all those things you say about me they work yes but is that why you picked me because you think im good you sell like hot cakes isnt that proof yes no i mean in a different way i mean dominique id like to hear you say once just once that i listen peter ill have to run along in a moment but before i go i must tell you that youll probably hear from mrs lonsdale tomorrow or the next day now remember that shes a prohibitionist loves dogs hates women who smoke and believes in reincarnation she wants her house to be better than mrs purdees holcombe did purdees so if you tell her that mrs purdees house looks ostentatious and that true simplicity costs much more money youll get along fine you might discuss petit point too thats her hobby he went away thinking happily about mrs lonsdales house and he forgot his question later he remembered it resentfully and shrugged and told himself that the best part of dominiques help was her desire not to see him as a compensation he found pleasure in attending the meetings of tooheys council of american builders he did not know why he should think of it as compensation but he did and it was comforting he listened attentively when gordon l prescott made a speech on the meaning of architecture and thus the intrinsic significance of our craft lies in the philosophical fact that we deal in nothing we create emptiness through which certain physical bodies are to move we shall designate them for convenience as humans by emptiness i mean what is commonly known as rooms thus it is only the crass layman who thinks that we put up stone walls we do nothing of the kind we put up emptiness as i have proved this leads us to a corollary of astronomical importance to the unconditional acceptance of the premise that absence is superior to presence that is to the acceptance of nonacceptance i shall state this in simpler terms for the sake of clarity nothing is superior to something thus it is clear that the architect is more than a bricklayer since the fact of bricks is a secondary illusion anyway the architect is a metaphysical priest dealing in basic essentials who has the courage to face the primal conception of reality as nonreality since there is nothing and he creates nothingness if this sounds like a contradiction it is not a proof of bad logic but of a higher logic the dialectics of all life and art should you wish to make the inevitable deductions from this basic conception you may come to conclusions of vast sociological importance you may see that a beautiful woman is inferior to a nonbeautiful one that the literate is inferior to the illiterate that the rich is inferior to the poor and the able to the incompetent the architect is the concrete illustration of a cosmic paradox let us be modest in the vast pride of this realization everything else is twaddle one could not worry about ones value or greatness when listening to this it made selfrespect unnecessary keating listened in thick contentment he glanced at the others there was an attentive silence in the audience they all liked it as he liked it he saw a boy chewing gum a man cleaning his fingernails with the corner of a match folder a youth stretched out loutishly that too pleased keating it was as if they said we are glad to listen to the sublime but its not necessary to be too damn reverent about the sublime the council of american builders met once a month and engaged in no tangible activity beyond listening to speeches and sipping an inferior brand of root beer its membership did not grow fast either in quantity or in quality there were no concrete results achieved the meetings of the council were held in a huge empty room over a garage on the west side a long narrow unventilated stairway led to a door bearing the councils name there were folding chairs inside a table for the chairman and a wastebasket the aga considered the council of american builders a silly joke why do you want to waste time on those cranks for francon asked keating in the roselit satinstuffed rooms of the aga wrinkling his nose with fastidious amusement damned if i know keating answered gaily i like them ellsworth toohey attended every meeting of the council but did not speak he sat in a corner and listened one night keating and toohey walked home together after the meeting down the dark shabby streets of the west side and stopped for a cup of coffee at a seedy drugstore why not a drugstore toohey laughed when keating reminded him of the distinguished restaurants made famous by tooheys patronage at least no one will recognize us here and bother us he sent a jet of smoke from his egyptian cigarette at a faded cocacola sign over their booth he ordered a sandwich he nibbled daintily a slice of pickle which was not flyspecked but looked it and he talked to keating he talked at random what he said did not matter at first it was his voice the matchless voice of ellsworth toohey keating felt as if he were standing in the middle of a vast plain under the stars held and owned in assurance in security kindness peter said the voice softly kindness that is the first commandment perhaps the only one that is why i had to pan that new play in my column yesterday that play lacked essential kindness we must be kind peter to everybody around us we must accept and forgive there is so much to be forgiven in each one of us if you learn to love everything the humblest the least the meanest then the meanest in you will be loved then well find the sense of universal equality the great peace of brotherhood a new world peter a beautiful new world ellsworth monkton toohey was seven years old when he turned the hose upon johnny stokes as johnny was passing by the toohey lawn dressed in his best sunday suit johnny had waited for that suit a year and a half his mother being very poor ellsworth did not sneak or hide but committed his act openly with systematic deliberation he walked to the tap turned it on stood in the middle of the lawn and directed the hose at johnny his aim faultless with johnnys mother just a few steps behind him down the street with his own mother and father and the visiting minister in full view on the toohey porch johnny stokes was a bright kid with dimples and golden curls people always turned to look at johnny stokes nobody had ever turned to look at ellsworth toohey the shock and amazement of the grownups present were such that nobody rushed to stop ellsworth for a long moment he stood bracing his thin little body against the violence of the nozzle jerking in his hands never allowing it to leave its objective until he felt satisfied then he let it drop the water hissing through the grass and made two steps toward the porch and stopped waiting his head high delivering himself for punishment the punishment would have come from johnny if mrs stokes had not seized her boy and held him ellsworth did not turn to the stokeses behind him but said slowly distinctly looking at his mother and the minister johnny is a dirty bully he beats up all the boys in school this was true the question of punishment became an ethical problem it was difficult to punish ellsworth under any circumstances because of his fragile body and delicate health besides it seemed wrong to chastise a boy who had sacrificed himself to avenge injustice and done it bravely in the open ignoring his own physical weakness somehow he looked like a martyr ellsworth did not say so he said nothing further but his mother said it the minister was inclined to agree with her ellsworth was sent to his room without supper he did not complain he remained there meekly and refused the food his mother sneaked up to him late at night disobeying her husband mr toohey insisted on paying mrs stokes for johnnys suit mrs toohey let him do it sullenly she did not like mrs stokes ellsworths father managed the boston branch of a national chain of shoe stores he earned a modest comfortable salary and owned a modest comfortable home in an undistinguished suburb of boston the secret sorrow of his life was that he did not head a business of his own but he was a quiet conscientious unimaginative man and an early marriage had ended all his ambition ellsworths mother was a thin restless woman who adopted and discarded five religions in nine years she had delicate features the kind that made her look beautiful for a few years of her life at the one period of full flower never before and never afterward ellsworth was her idol his sister helen five years older was a goodnatured unremarkable girl not beautiful but pretty and healthy she presented no problem ellsworth however had been born puny in health his mother adored him from the moment the doctor pronounced him unfit to survive it made her grow in spiritual stature to know the extent of her own magnanimity in her love for so uninspiring an object the bluer and uglier baby ellsworth looked the more passionate grew her love for him she was almost disappointed when he survived without becoming an actual cripple she took little interest in helen there was no martyrdom in loving helen the girl was so obviously more deserving of love that it seemed just to deny it to her mr toohey for reasons which he could not explain was not too fond of his son ellsworth however was the ruler of the household by a tacit voluntary submission of both parents though his father could never understand the cause of his own share in that submission in the evenings under the lamp of the family sitting room mrs toohey would begin in a tense challenging voice angry and defeated in advance horace i want a bicycle a bicycle for ellsworth all the boys his age have them willie lovett just got a new one the other day horace horace i want a bicycle for ellsworth not right now mary mr toohey would answer wearily maybe next summer just now we cant afford mrs toohey would argue her voice rising in jerks toward a shriek mother what for said ellsworth his voice soft rich and clear lower than the voices of his parents yet cutting across them commanding strangely persuasive theres many things we need more than a bicycle what do you care about willie lovett i dont like willie willies a dumbbell willie can afford it because his pas got his own drygoods store his pas a showoff i dont want a bicycle every word of this was true and ellsworth did not want a bicycle but mr toohey looked at him strangely wondering what had made him say that he saw his sons eyes looking at him blankly from behind the small glasses the eyes were not ostentatiously sweet not reproachful not malicious just blank mr toohey felt that he should be grateful for his sons understanding and wished to hell the boy had not mentioned that part about the private store ellsworth did not get the bicycle but he got a polite attention in the house a respectful solicitude tender and guilty from his mother uneasy and suspicious from his father mr toohey would do anything rather than be forced into a conversation with ellsworth feeling at the same time foolish and angry at himself for his fear horace i want a new suit a new suit for ellsworth i saw one in a window today and ive mother ive got four suits what do i need another one for i dont want to look silly like pat noonan who changes them every day thats because his pas got his own icecream parlor pats stuck up like a girl about his clothes i dont want to be a sissy ellsworth thought mrs toohey at times happy and frightened is going to be a saint he doesnt care about material things at all not one bit this was true ellsworth did not care about material things he was a thin pale boy with a bad stomach and his mother had to watch his diet as well as his tendency to frequent colds in the head his sonorous voice was astonishing in his puny frame he sang in the choir where he had no rivals at school he was a model pupil he always knew his lessons had the neatest copybooks the cleanest fingernails loved sunday school and preferred reading to athletic games in which he had no chance he was not too good at mathematics which he disliked but excellent at history english civics and penmanship later at psychology and sociology he studied conscientiously and hard he was not like johnny stokes who never listened in class seldom opened a book at home yet knew everything almost before the teacher had explained it learning came to johnny automatically as did all things his able little fists his healthy body his startling good looks his overexuberant vitality but johnny did the shocking and the unexpected ellsworth did the expected better than anyone had ever seen it done when they came to compositions johnny would stun the class by some brilliant display of rebellion given the theme of school days the golden age johnny came through with a masterly essay on how he hated school and why ellsworth delivered a prose poem on the glory of school days which was reprinted in a local newspaper besides ellsworth had johnny beaten hollow when it came to names and dates ellsworths memory was like a spread of liquid cement it held anything that fell upon it johnny was a shooting geyser ellsworth was a sponge the children called him elsie toohey they usually let him have his way and avoided him when possible but not openly they could not figure him out he was helpful and dependable when they needed assistance with their lessons he had a sharp wit and could ruin any child by the apt nickname he coined the kind that hurt he drew devastating cartoons on fences he had all the earmarks of a sissy but somehow he could not be classified as one he had too much selfassurance and quiet disturbingly wise contempt for everybody he was afraid of nothing he would march right up to the strongest boys in the middle of the street and state not yell in a clear voice that carried for blocks state without anger no one had ever seen ellsworth toohey angry johnny stokess got a patch on his ass johnny stokes lives in a rented flat willie lovett is a dunce pat noonan is a fish eater johnny never gave him a beating and neither did the other boys because ellsworth wore glasses he could not take part in ball games and was the only child who boasted about it instead of feeling frustrated or ashamed like the other boys with substandard bodies he considered athletics vulgar and said so the brain he said was mightier than the brawn he meant it he had no close personal friends he was considered impartial and incorruptible there were two incidents in his childhood of which his mother was very proud it happened that the wealthy popular willie lovett gave a birthday party on the same day as drippy munn son of a widowed seamstress a whining boy whose nose was always running nobody accepted drippys invitation except the children who were never invited anywhere of those asked for both occasions ellsworth toohey was the only one who snubbed willie lovett and went to drippy munns party a miserable affair from which he expected and received no pleasure willie lovetts enemies howled and taunted willie for months afterward about being passed up in favor of drippy munn it happened that pat noonan offered ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a surreptitious peek at his test paper ellsworth took the jelly beans and allowed pat to copy his test a week later ellsworth marched up to the teacher laid the jelly beans untouched upon her desk and confessed his crime without naming the other culprit all her efforts to extract that name could not budge him ellsworth remained silent he explained only that the guilty boy was one of the best students and he could not sacrifice the boys record to the demands of his own conscience he was the only one punished kept after school for two hours then the teacher had to drop the matter and let the test marks remain as they were but it threw suspicion on the grades of johnny stokes pat noonan and all the best pupils of the class except ellsworth toohey ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother died aunt adeline his fathers maiden sister came to live with them and run the toohey household aunt adeline was a tall capable woman to whom the word horse clung in conjunction with the words sense and face the secret sorrow of her life was that she had never inspired romance helen became her immediate favorite she considered ellsworth an imp out of hell but ellsworth never wavered in his manner of grave courtesy toward aunt adeline he leaped to pick up her handkerchief to move her chair when they had company particularly masculine company he sent her beautiful valentines on the appropriate day with paper lace rosebuds and love poems he sang sweet adeline at the top of his town criers voice youre a maggot elsie she told him once you feed on sores then ill never starve he answered after a while they reached a state of armed neutrality ellsworth was left to grow up as he pleased in high school ellsworth became a local celebrity the star orator for years the school did not refer to a promising boy as a good speaker but as a toohey he won every contest afterward members of the audience spoke about that beautiful boy they did not remember the sorry little figure with the sunken chest inadequate legs and glasses they remembered the voice he won every debate he could prove anything once after beating willie lovett with the affirmative of the pen is mightier than the sword he challenged willie to reverse their positions took the negative and won again until the age of sixteen ellsworth felt himself drawn to the career of a minister he thought a great deal about religion he talked about god and the spirit he read extensively on the subject he read more books on the history of the church than on the substance of faith he brought his audience to tears in one of his greatest oratorical triumphs with the theme of the meek shall inherit the earth at this period he began to acquire friends he liked to speak of faith and he found those who liked to listen only he discovered that the bright the strong the able boys of his class felt no need of listening felt no need of him at all but the suffering and illendowed came to him drippy munn began to follow him about with the silent devotion of a dog billy wilson lost his mother and came wandering to the toohey house in the evenings to sit with ellsworth on the porch listening shivering once in a while saying nothing his eyes wide dry and pleading skinny dix got infantile paralysis and would lie in bed watching the street corner beyond the window waiting for ellsworth rusty hazelton failed to pass in his grades and sat for many hours crying with ellsworths cold steady hand on his shoulder it was never clear whether they all discovered ellsworth or ellsworth discovered them it seemed to work more like a law of nature as nature allows no vacuum so pain and ellsworth toohey drew each other his rich beautiful voice said to them its good to suffer dont complain bear bow accept and be grateful that god has made you suffer for this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy if you dont understand this dont try to understand everything bad comes from the mind because the mind asks too many questions it is blessed to believe not to understand so if you didnt get passing grades be glad of it it means that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily people said it was touching the way ellsworths friends clung to him after they had taken him for a while they could not do without him it was like a drug habit ellsworth was fifteen when he astonished the bibleclass teacher by an odd question the teacher had been elaborating upon the text what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul ellsworth asked then in order to be truly wealthy a man should collect souls the teacher was about to ask him what the hell did he mean but controlled himself and asked what did he mean ellsworth would not elucidate at the age of sixteen ellsworth lost interest in religion he discovered socialism his transition shocked aunt adeline in the first place it is blasphemous and drivel she said in the second place it doesnt make sense im surprised at you elsie the poor in spirit that was fine but just the poor that doesnt sound respectable at all besides its not like you youre not cut out to make big trouble only little trouble somethings crazy somewhere elsie it just dont fit its not like you at all in the first place my dear aunt he answered dont call me elsie in the second place youre wrong the change seemed good for ellsworth he did not become an aggressive zealot he became gentler quieter milder he became more attentively considerate of people it was as if something had taken the nervous edges off his personality and given him new confidence those around him began to like him aunt adeline stopped worrying nothing actual seemed to come of his preoccupation with revolutionary theories he joined no political party he read a great deal and he attended a few dubious meetings where he spoke once or twice not too well but mostly sat in a corner listening watching thinking ellsworth went to harvard his mother had willed her life insurance for that specific purpose at harvard his scholastic record was superlative he majored in history aunt adeline had expected to see him go in for economics and sociology she half feared that he would end up as a social worker he didnt he became absorbed in literature and the fine arts it baffled her a little it was a new trait in him he had never shown any particular tendency in that direction youre not the arty kind elsie she stated it dont fit youre wrong auntie he said ellsworths relations with his fellow students were the most unusual of his achievements at harvard he made himself accepted among the proud young descendants of proud old names he did not hide the fact of his humble background he exaggerated it he did not tell them that his father was the manager of a shoe store he said that his father was a shoe cobbler he said it without defiance bitterness or proletarian arrogance he said it as if it were a joke on him and if one looked closely into his smile on them he acted like a snob not a flagrant snob but a natural innocent one who tries very hard not to be snobbish he was polite not in the manner of one seeking favor but in the manner of one granting it his attitude was contagious people did not question the reasons of his superiority they took it for granted that such reasons existed it became amusing at first to accept monk toohey then it became distinctive and progressive if this was a victory ellsworth did not seem conscious of it as such he did not seem to care he moved among all these unformed youths with the assurance of a man who has a plan a longrange plan set in every detail and who can spare nothing but amusement for the small incidentals on his way his smile had a secret closed quality the smile of a shopkeeper counting profits even though nothing in particular seemed to be happening he did not talk about god and the nobility of suffering he talked about the masses he proved to a rapt audience at bull sessions lasting till dawn that religion bred selfishness because he stated religion overemphasized the importance of the individual spirit religion preached nothing but a single concern the salvation of ones own soul to achieve virtue in the absolute sense said ellsworth toohey a man must be willing to take the foulest crimes upon his soul for the sake of his brothers to mortify the flesh is nothing to mortify the soul is the only act of virtue so you think you love the broad mass of mankind you know nothing of love you give two bucks to a strike fund and you think youve done your duty you poor fools no gift is worth a damn unless its the most precious thing youve got give your soul to a lie yes if others believe it to deceit yes if others need it to treachery knavery crime yes to whatever it is that seems lowest and vilest in your eyes only when you can feel contempt for your own priceless little ego only then can you achieve the true broad peace of selflessness the merging of your spirit with the vast collective spirit of mankind there is no room for the love of others within the tight crowded misers hole of a private ego be empty in order to be filled he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal the opium peddlers of the church had something there but they didnt know what they had selfabnegation yes my friends by all means but one doesnt abnegate by keeping ones self pure and proud of its own purity the sacrifice that includes the destruction of ones soul ah but what am i talking about this is only for heroes to grasp and to achieve he did not have much success among the poor boys working their way through college he acquired a sizable following among the young heirs the second and third generation millionaires he offered them an achievement of which they felt capable he graduated with high honors when he came to new york he was preceded by a small private fame a few trickles of rumor had seeped down from harvard about an unusual person named ellsworth toohey a few people among the extreme intellectuals and the extremely wealthy heard these rumors and promptly forgot what they heard but remembered the name it remained in their minds with a vague connotation of such things as brilliance courage idealism people began to ooze toward ellsworth toohey the right kind of people those who soon found him to be a spiritual necessity the other kind did not come there seemed to be an instinct about it when someone commented on the loyalty of tooheys following he had no title program or organization but somehow his circle was called a following from the first an envious rival remarked toohey draws the sticky kind you know the two things that stick best mud and glue toohey overheard it and shrugged smiling and said oh come come come there are many more adhesive plaster leeches taffy wet socks rubber girdles chewing gum and tapioca pudding moving away he added over his shoulder without smiling and cement he took his masters degree from a new york university and wrote a thesis on collective patterns in the city architecture of the xlvth century he earned his living in a busy varied scattered way no one could keep track of all his activities he held the post of vocational adviser at the university he reviewed books plays art exhibitions he wrote articles gave a few lectures to small obscure audiences certain tendencies were apparent in his work when reviewing books he leaned toward novels about the soil rather than the city about the average rather than the gifted about the sick rather than the healthy there was a special glow in his writing when he referred to stories about little people human was his favorite adjective he preferred character study to action and description to character study he preferred novels without a plot and above all novels without a hero he was considered outstanding as a vocational adviser his tiny office at the university became an informal confessional where students brought all their problems academic as well as personal he was willing to discuss with the same gentle earnest concentration the choice of classes or love affairs or most particularly the selection of a future career when consulted on love affairs toohey counseled surrender if it concerned a romance with a charming little pushover good for a few drunken parties let us be modern and renunciation if it concerned a deep emotional passion let us be grownup when a boy came to confess a feeling of shame after some unsavory sexual experience toohey told him to snap out of it it was damn good for you there are two things we must get rid of early in life a feeling of personal superiority and an exaggerated reverence for the sexual act people noticed that ellsworth toohey seldom let a boy pursue the career he had chosen no i wouldnt go in for law if i were you youre much too tense and passionate about it a hysterical devotion to ones career does not make for happiness or success it is wiser to select a profession about which you can be calm sane and matteroffact yes even if you hate it it makes for downtoearthness no i wouldnt advise you to continue with your music the fact that it comes to you so easily is a sure sign that your talent is only a superficial one thats just the trouble that you love it dont you think that sounds like a childish reason give it up yes even if it hurts like hell no im sorry i would like so much to say that i approve but i dont when you thought of architecture it was a purely selfish choice wasnt it have you considered anything but your own egotistical satisfaction yet a mans career concerns all society the question of where you could be most useful to your fellow men comes first its not what you can get out of society its what you can give and where opportunities for service are concerned theres no endeavor comparable to that of a surgeon think it over after leaving college some of his protégés did quite well others failed only one committed suicide it was said that ellsworth toohey had exercised a beneficent influence upon them for they never forgot him they came to consult him on many things years later they wrote him they clung to him they were like machines without a selfstarter that had to be cranked up by an outside hand he was never too busy to give them his full attention his life was crowded public and impersonal as a city square the friend of humanity had no single private friend people came to him he came close to no one he accepted all his affection was golden smooth and even like a great expanse of sand there was no wind of discrimination to raise dunes the sands lay still and the sun stood high out of his meager income he donated money to many organizations he was never known to have loaned a dollar to an individual he never asked his rich friends to assist a person in need but he obtained from them large sums and endowments for charitable institutions for settlement houses recreation centers homes for fallen girls schools for defective children he served on the boards of all these institutions without salary a great many philanthropic undertakings and radical publications run by all sorts of people had a single connecting link among them one common denominator the name of ellsworth m toohey on their stationery he was a sort of oneman holding company of altruism women played no part in his life sex had never interested him his furtive infrequent urges drew him to the young slim fullbosomed brainless girls the giggling little waitresses the lisping manicurists the less efficient stenographers the kind who wore pink or orchid dresses and little hats on the back of their heads with gobs of blond curls in front he was indifferent to women of intellect he contended that the family was a bourgeois institution but he made no issue of it and did not crusade for free love the subject of sex bored him there was he felt too much fuss made over the damn thing it was of no importance there were too many weightier problems in the world the years passed with each busy day of his life like a small neat coin dropped patiently into a gigantic slot machine without a glance at the combination of symbols without return gradually one of his many activities began to stand out among the others he became known as an eminent critic of architecture he wrote about buildings for three successive magazines that limped on noisily for a few years and failed one after the other new voices new pathways new horizons the fourth new frontiers survived ellsworth toohey was the only thing salvaged from the successive wrecks architectural criticism seemed to be a neglected field of endeavor few people bothered to write about buildings fewer to read toohey acquired a reputation and an unofficial monopoly the better magazines began calling upon him whenever they needed anything connected with architecture in the year a small change occurred in tooheys private life his niece catherine halsey the daughter of his sister helen came to live with him his father had long since died and aunt adeline had vanished into the obscure poverty of some small town at the death of catherines parents there was no one else to take care of her toohey had not intended to keep her in his own home but when she stepped off the train in new york her plain little face looked beautiful for a moment as if the future were opening before her and its glow were already upon her forehead as if she were eager and proud and ready to meet it it was one of those rare moments when the humblest person knows suddenly what it means to feel as the center of the universe and is made beautiful by the knowledge and the world in the eyes of witnesses looks like a better place for having such a center ellsworth toohey saw this and decided that catherine would remain with him in the year came sermons in stone and fame ellsworth toohey became a fashion intellectual hostesses fought over him some people disliked him and laughed at him but there was little satisfaction in laughing at ellsworth toohey because he was always first to make the most outrageous remarks about himself once at a party a smug boorish businessman listened to tooheys earnest social theories for a while and said complacently well i wouldnt know much about all that intellectual stuff i play the stock market i said toohey play the stock market of the spirit and i sell short the most important consequence of sermons in stone was tooheys contract to write a daily column for gail wynands new york banner the contract came as a surprise to the followers of both sides involved and at first it made everybody angry toohey had referred to wynand frequently and not respectfully the wynand papers had called toohey every name fit to print but the wynand papers had no policy save that of reflecting the greatest prejudices of the greatest number and this made for an erratic direction but a recognizable direction nevertheless toward the inconsistent the irresponsible the trite and the maudlin the wynand papers stood against privilege and for the common man but in a respectable manner that could shock nobody they exposed monopolies when they wished they supported strikes when they wished and vice versa they denounced wall street and they denounced socialism and they hollered for clean movies all with the same gusto they were strident and blatant and in essence lifelessly mild ellsworth toohey was a phenomenon much too extreme to fit behind the front page of the banner but the staff of the banner was as unfastidious as its policy it included everybody who could please the public or any large section thereof it was said gail wynand is not a pig hell eat anything ellsworth toohey was a great success and the public was suddenly interested in architecture the banner had no authority on architecture the banner would get ellsworth toohey it was a simple syllogism thus one small voice came into existence the banner explained its appearance by announcing on monday the banner will present to you a new friend ellsworth m toohey whose scintillating book sermons in stone you have all read and loved the name of mr toohey stands for the great profession of architecture he will help you to understand everything you want to know about the wonders of modern building watch for one small voice on monday to appear exclusively in the banner in new york city the rest of what mr toohey stood for was ignored ellsworth toohey made no announcement or explanation to anyone he disregarded the friends who cried that he had sold himself he simply went to work he devoted one small voice to architecture once a month the rest of the time it was the voice of ellsworth toohey saying what he wished said to syndicated millions toohey was the only wynand employee who had a contract permitting him to write anything he pleased he had insisted upon it it was considered a great victory by everybody except ellsworth toohey he realized that it could mean one of two things either wynand had surrendered respectfully to the prestige of his name or wynand considered him too contemptible to be worth restraining one small voice never seemed to say anything dangerously revolutionary and seldom anything political it merely preached sentiments with which most people felt in agreement unselfishness brotherhood equality id rather be kind than right mercy is superior to justice the shallowhearted to the contrary notwithstanding speaking anatomically and perhaps otherwise the heart is our most valuable organ the brain is a superstition in spiritual matters there is a simple infallible test everything that proceeds from the ego is evil everything that proceeds from love for others is good service is the only badge of nobility i see nothing offensive in the conception of fertilizer as the highest symbol of mans destiny it is fertilizer that produces wheat and roses the worst folk song is superior to the best symphony a man braver than his brothers insults them by implication let us aspire to no virtue which cannot be shared i have yet to see a genius or a hero who if stuck with a burning match would feel less pain than his undistinguished average brother genius is an exaggeration of dimension so is elephantiasis both may be only a disease we are all brothers under the skin and i for one would be willing to skin humanity to prove it in the offices of the banner ellsworth toohey was treated respectfully and left alone it was whispered that gail wynand did not like him because wynand was always polite to him alvah scarret unbent to the point of cordiality but kept a wary distance there was a silent watchful equilibrium between toohey and scarret they understood each other toohey made no attempt to approach wynand in any way toohey seemed indifferent to all the men who counted on the banner he concentrated on the others instead he organized a club of wynand employees it was not a labor union it was just a club it met once a month in the library of the banner it did not concern itself with wages hours or working conditions it had no concrete program at all people got acquainted talked and listened to speeches ellsworth toohey made most of the speeches he spoke about new horizons and the press as the voice of the masses gail wynand appeared at a meeting once entering unexpectedly in the middle of a session toohey smiled and invited him to join the club declaring that he was eligible wynand did not join he sat listening for half an hour yawned got up and left before the meeting was over alvah scarret appreciated the fact that toohey did not try to reach into his field into the important matters of policy as a kind of return courtesy scarret let toohey recommend new employees when there was a vacancy to fill particularly if the position was not an important one as a rule scarret did not care while toohey always cared even when it was only the post of copy boy tooheys selections got the jobs most of them were young brash competent shiftyeyed and shook hands limply they had other things in common but these were not so apparent there were several monthly meetings which toohey attended regularly the meetings of the council of american builders the council of american writers the council of american artists he had organized them all lois cook was chairman of the council of american writers it met in the drawing room of her home on the bowery she was the only famous member the rest included a woman who never used capitals in her books and a man who never used commas a youth who had written a thousandpage novel without a single letter o and another who wrote poems that neither rhymed nor scanned a man with a beard who was sophisticated and proved it by using every unprintable fourletter word in every ten pages of his manuscript a woman who imitated lois cook except that her style was less clear when asked for explanations she stated that this was the way life sounded to her when broken by the prism of her subconscious you know what a prism does to a ray of light dont you she said there was also a fierce young man known simply as ike the genius though nobody knew just what he had done except that he talked about loving all of life the council signed a declaration which stated that writers were servants of the proletariat but the statement did not sound as simple as that it was more involved and much longer the declaration was sent to every newspaper in the country it was never published anywhere except on page of new frontiers the council of american artists had as chairman a cadaverous youth who painted what he saw in his nightly dreams there was a boy who used no canvas but did something with bird cages and metronomes and another who discovered a new technique of painting he blackened a sheet of paper and then painted with a rubber eraser there was a stout middleaged lady who drew subconsciously claiming that she never looked at her hand and had no idea of what the hand was doing her hand she said was guided by the spirit of the departed lover whom she had never met on earth here they did not talk so much about the proletariat but merely rebelled against the tyranny of reality and of the objective a few friends pointed out to ellsworth toohey that he seemed guilty of inconsistency he was so deeply opposed to individualism they said and here were all these writers and artists of his and every one of them was a rabid individualist do you really think so said toohey smiling blandly nobody took these councils seriously people talked about them because they thought it made good conversation it was such a huge joke they said certainly there was no harm in any of it do you really think so said toohey ellsworth toohey was now fortyone years old he lived in a distinguished apartment that seemed modest when compared to the size of the income he could have commanded if he wished he liked to apply the adjective conservative to himself in one respect only in his conservative good taste for clothes no one had ever seen him lose his temper his manner was immutable it was the same in a drawing room at a labor meeting on a lecture platform in the bathroom or during sexual intercourse cool selfpossessed amused faintly patronizing people admired his sense of humor he was they said a man who could laugh at himself im a dangerous person somebody ought to warn you against me he said to people in the tone of uttering the most preposterous thing in the world of all the many titles bestowed upon him he preferred one ellsworth toohey the humanitarian the enright house was opened in june of there was no formal ceremony but roger enright wanted to mark the moment for his own satisfaction he invited a few people he liked and he unlocked the great glass entrance door throwing it open to the sunfilled air some press photographers had arrived because the story concerned roger enright and because roger enright did not want to have them there he ignored them he stood in the middle of the street looking at the building then he walked through the lobby stopping short without reason and resuming his pacing he said nothing he frowned fiercely as if he were about to scream with rage his friends knew that roger enright was happy the building stood on the shore of the east river a structure rapt as raised arms the rock crystal forms mounted in such eloquent steps that the building did not seem stationary but moving upward in a continuous flow until one realized that it was only the movement of ones glance and that ones glance was forced to move in that particular rhythm the walls of pale gray limestone looked silver against the sky with the clean dulled luster of metal but a metal that had become a warm living substance carved by the most cutting of all instruments a purposeful human will it made the house alive in a strange personal way of its own so that in the minds of spectators five words ran dimly without object or clear connection in his image and likeness a young photographer from the banner noticed howard roark standing alone across the street at the parapet of the river he was leaning back his hands closed over the parapet hatless looking up at the building it was an accidental unconscious moment the young photographer glanced at roarks face and thought of something that had puzzled him for a long time he had always wondered why the sensations one felt in dreams were so much more intense than anything one could experience in waking reality why the horror was so total and the ecstasy so complete and what was that extra quality which could never be recaptured afterward the quality of what he felt when he walked down a path through tangled green leaves in a dream in an air full of expectation of causeless utter rapture and when he awakened he could not explain it it had been just a path through some woods he thought of that because he saw that extra quality for the first time in waking existence he saw it in roarks face lifted to the building the photographer was a young boy new to his job he did not know much about it but he loved his work he had been an amateur photographer since childhood so he snapped a picture of roark in that one moment later the art editor of the banner saw the picture and barked what the hells that howard roark said the photographer whos howard roark the architect who the hell wants a picture of the architect well i only thought besides its crazy whats the matter with the man so the picture was thrown into the morgue the enright house rented promptly the tenants who moved in were people who wanted to live in sane comfort and cared about nothing else they did not discuss the value of the building they merely liked living there they were the sort who lead useful active private lives in public silence but others talked a great deal of the enright house for about three weeks they said that it was preposterous exhibitionist and phony they said my dear imagine inviting mrs moreland if you lived in a place like that and her home is in such good taste a few were beginning to appear who said you know i rather like modern architecture there are some mighty interesting things being done that way nowadays theres quite a school of it in germany thats rather remarkable but this is not like it at all this is a freak ellsworth toohey never mentioned the enright house in his column a reader of the banner wrote to him dear mr toohey what do you think of this place they call the enright house i have a friend who is an interior decorator and he talks a lot about it and he says its lousy architecture and such various arts being my hobby i dont know what to think will you tell us in your column ellsworth toohey answered in a private letter dear friend there are so many important buildings and great events going on in the world today that i cannot devote my column to trivialities but people came to roark the few he wanted that winter he had received a commission to build the norris house a modest country home in may he signed another contract for his first office building a fiftystory skyscraper in the center of manhattan anthony cord the owner had come from nowhere and made a fortune in wall street within a few brilliant violent years he wanted a building of his own and he went to roark roarks office had grown to four rooms his staff loved him they did not realize it and would have been shocked to apply such a term as love to their cold unapproachable inhuman boss these were the words they used to describe roark these were the words they had been trained to use by all the standards and conceptions of their past only working with him they knew that he was none of these things but they could not explain neither what he was nor what they felt for him he did not smile at his employees he did not take them out for drinks he never inquired about their families their love lives or their church attendance he responded only to the essence of a man to his creative capacity in this office one had to be competent there were no alternatives no mitigating considerations but if a man worked well he needed nothing else to win his employers benevolence it was granted not as a gift but as a debt it was granted not as affection but as recognition it bred an immense feeling of selfrespect within every man in that office oh but thats not human said somebody when one of roarks draftsmen tried to explain this at home such a cold intellectual approach one boy a younger sort of peter keating tried to introduce the human in preference to the intellectual in roarks office he did not last two weeks roark made mistakes in choosing his employees occasionally not often those whom he kept for a month became his friends for life they did not call themselves friends they did not praise him to outsiders they did not talk about him they knew only in a dim way that it was not loyalty to him but to the best within themselves dominique remained in the city all summer she remembered with bitter pleasure her custom to travel it made her angry to think that she could not go could not want to go she enjoyed the anger it drove her to his room on the nights which she did not spend with him she walked through the streets of the city she walked to the enright house or to the fargo store and stood looking at the building for a long time she drove alone out of town to see the heller house the sanborn house the gowan service station she never spoke to him about that once she took the staten island ferry at two oclock in the morning she rode to the island standing alone at the rail of an empty deck she watched the city moving away from her in the vast emptiness of sky and ocean the city was only a small jagged solid it seemed condensed pressed tight together not a place of streets and separate buildings but a single sculptured form a form of irregular steps that rose and dropped without ordered continuity long ascensions and sudden drops like the graph of a stubborn struggle but it went on mounting toward a few points toward the triumphant masts of skyscrapers raised out of the struggle the boat went past the statue of liberty a figure in a green light with an arm raised like the skyscrapers behind it she stood at the rail while the city diminished and she felt the motion of growing distance as a growing tightness within her the pull of a living cord that could not be stretched too far she stood in quiet excitement when the boat sailed back and she saw the city growing again to meet her she stretched her arms wide the city expanded to her elbows to her wrists beyond her fingertips then the skyscrapers rose over her head and she was back she came ashore she knew where she had to go and wanted to get there fast but felt she must get there herself like this on her own feet so she walked half the length of manhattan through long empty echoing streets it was fourthirty when she knocked at his door he had been asleep she shook her head no she said go back to sleep i just want to be here she did not touch him she took off her hat and shoes huddled into an armchair and fell asleep her arm hanging over the chairs side her head on her arm in the morning he asked no questions they fixed breakfast together then he hurried away to his office before leaving he took her in his arms and kissed her he walked out and she stood for a few moments then left they had not exchanged twenty words there were week ends when they left the city together and drove in her car to some obscure point on the coast they stretched out in the sun on the sand of a deserted beach they swam in the ocean she liked to watch his body in the water she would remain behind and stand the waves hitting her knees and watch him cutting a straight line through the breakers she liked to lie with him at the edge of the water she would lie on her stomach a few feet away from him facing the shore her toes stretched to the waves she would not touch him but she would feel the waves coming up behind them breaking against their bodies and she would see the backwash running in mingled streams off her body and his they spent the nights at some country inn taking a single room they never spoke of the things left behind them in the city but it was the unstated that gave meaning to the relaxed simplicity of these hours their eyes laughed silently at the preposterous contract whenever they looked at each other she tried to demonstrate her power over him she stayed away from his house she waited for him to come to her he spoiled it by coming too soon by refusing her the satisfaction of knowing that he waited and struggled against his desire by surrendering at once she would say kiss my hand roark he would kneel and kiss her ankle he defeated her by admitting her power she could not have the gratification of enforcing it he would lie at her feet he would say of course i need you i go insane when i see you you can do almost anything you wish with me is that what you want to hear almost dominique and the things you couldnt make me do you could put me through hell if you demanded them and i had to refuse you as i would through utter hell dominique does that please you why do you want to know whether you own me its so simple of course you do all of me that can be owned youll never demand anything else but you want to know whether you could make me suffer you could what of it the words did not sound like surrender because they were not torn out of him but admitted simply and willingly she felt no thrill of conquest she felt herself owned more than ever by a man who could say these things know of them to be true and still remain controlled and controlling as she wanted him to remain late in june a man named kent lansing came to see roark he was forty years old he was dressed like a fashion plate and looked like a prize fighter though he was not burly muscular or tough he was thin and angular he merely made one think of a boxer and of other things that did not fit his appearance of a battering ram of a tank of a submarine torpedo he was a member of a corporation formed for the purpose of erecting a luxurious hotel on central park south there were many wealthy men involved and the corporation was ruled by a numerous board they had purchased their site they had not decided on an architect but kent lansing had made up his mind that it would be roark i wont try to tell you how much id like to do it roark said to him at the end of their first interview but theres not a chance of my getting it i can get along with people when theyre alone i can do nothing with them in groups no board has ever hired me and i dont think one ever will kent lansing smiled have you ever known a board to do anything what do you mean just that have you ever known a board to do anything at all well they seem to exist and function do they you know there was a time when everyone thought it selfevident that the earth was flat it would be entertaining to speculate upon the nature and causes of humanitys illusions ill write a book about it some day it wont be popular ill have a chapter on boards of directors you see they dont exist id like to believe you but whats the gag no you wouldnt like to believe me the causes of illusions are not pretty to discover theyre either vicious or tragic this one is both mainly vicious and its not a gag but we wont go into that now all i mean is that a board of directors is one or two ambitious men and a lot of ballast i mean that groups of men are vacuums great big empty nothings they say we cant visualize a total nothing hell sit at any committee meeting the point is only who chooses to fill that nothing its a tough battle the toughest its simple enough to fight any enemy so long as hes there to be fought but when he isnt dont look at me like that as if i were crazy you ought to know youve fought a vacuum all your life im looking at you like that because i like you of course you like me as i knew id like you men are brothers you know and they have a great instinct for brotherhood except in boards unions corporations and other chain gangs but i talk too much thats why im a good salesman however i have nothing to sell you you know so well just say that youre going to build the aquitania thats the name of our hotel and well let it go at that if the violence of the battles which people never hear about could be measured in material statistics the battle of kent lansing against the board of directors of the aquitania corporation would have been listed among the greatest carnages of history but the things he fought were not solid enough to leave anything as substantial as corpses on the battlefield he had to fight phenomena such as listen palmer lansings talking about somebody named roark howre you going to vote do the big boys approve of him or not im not going to decide till i know whos voted for or against lansing says but on the other hand thorpe tells me talbots putting up a swank hotel on fifth up in the sixties and hes got francon keating harper swears by this young fellow gordon prescott listen betsy says were crazy i dont like roarks face he doesnt look cooperative i know i feel it roarks the kind that dont fit in hes not a regular fellow whats a regular fellow aw hell you know very well what i mean regular thompson says that mrs pritchett says that she knows for certain because mr macy told her that if well boys i dont give a damn what anybody says i make up my own mind and im here to tell you that i think this roark is lousy i dont like the enright house why i dont know why i just dont like it and thats that havent i got a right to an opinion of my own the battle lasted for weeks everybody had his say except roark lansing told him its all right lay off dont do anything let me do the talking theres nothing you can do when facing society the man most concerned the man who is to do the most and contribute the most has the least say its taken for granted that he has no voice and the reasons he could offer are rejected in advance as prejudiced since no speech is ever considered but only the speaker its so much easier to pass judgment on a man than on an idea though how in hell one passes judgment on a man without considering the content of his brain is more than ill ever understand however thats how its done you see reasons require scales to weigh them and scales are not made of cotton and cotton is what the human spirit is made of you know the stuff that keeps no shape and offers no resistance and can be twisted forward and backward and into a pretzel you could tell them why they should hire you so very much better than i could but they wont listen to you and theyll listen to me because im the middleman the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line its a middleman and the more middlemen the shorter such is the psychology of a pretzel why are you fighting for me like that roark asked why are you a good architect because you have certain standards of what is good and theyre your own and you stand by them i want a good hotel and i have certain standards of what is good and theyre my own and youre the one who can give me what i want and when i fight for you im doing on my side of it just what youre doing when you design a building do you think integrity is the monopoly of the artist and what incidentally do you think integrity is the ability not to pick a watch out of your neighbors pocket no its not as easy as that if that were all id say ninetyfive percent of humanity were honest upright men only as you can see they arent integrity is the ability to stand by an idea that presupposes the ability to think thinking is something one doesnt borrow or pawn and yet if i were asked to choose a symbol for humanity as we know it i wouldnt choose a cross nor an eagle nor a lion and unicorn id choose three gilded balls and as roark looked at him he added dont worry theyre all against me but i have one advantage they dont know what they want i do at the end of july roark signed a contract to build the aquitania ellsworth toohey sat in his office looking at a newspaper spread out on his desk at the item announcing the aquitania contract he smoked holding a cigarette propped in the corner of his mouth supported by two straight fingers one finger tapped against the cigarette slowly rhythmically for a long time he heard the sound of his door thrown open and he glanced up to see dominique standing there leaning against the doorjamb her arms crossed on her chest her face looked interested nothing more but it was alarming to see an expression of actual interest on her face my dear he said rising this is the first time youve taken the trouble to enter my office in the four years that weve worked in the same building this is really an occasion she said nothing but smiled gently which was still more alarming he added his voice pleasant my little speech of course was the equivalent of a question or dont we understand each other any longer i suppose we dont if you find it necessary to ask what brought me here but you know it ellsworth you know it there it is on your desk she walked to the desk and flipped a comer of the newspaper she laughed do you wish you had it hidden somewhere of course you didnt expect me to come not that it makes any difference but i just like to see you being obvious for once right on your desk like that open at the realestate page too you sound as if that little piece of news had made you happy it did ellsworth it does i thought you had worked hard to prevent that contract i had if you think this is an act youre putting on right now dominique youre fooling yourself this isnt an act no ellsworth this isnt youre happy that roark got it im so happy i could sleep with this kent lansing whoever he is if i ever met him and if he asked me then the pact is off by no means i shall try to stop any job that comes his way i shall continue trying its not going to be so easy as it was though the enright house the cord building and this not so easy for me and for you hes beating you ellsworth ellsworth what if we were wrong about the world you and i youve always been my dear do forgive me i should have known better than to be astonished it would make you happy of course that he got it i dont even mind admitting that it doesnt make me happy at all there you see now your visit to my office has been a complete success so we shall just write the aquitania off as a major defeat forget all about it and continue as we were certainly ellsworth just as we were im cinching a beautiful new hospital for peter keating at a dinner party tonight ellsworth toohey went home and spent the evening thinking about hopton stoddard hopton stoddard was a little man worth twenty million dollars three inheritances had contributed to that sum and seventytwo years of a busy life devoted to the purpose of making money hopton stoddard had a genius for investment he invested in everything houses of ill fame broadway spectacles on the grand scale preferably of a religious nature factories farm mortgages and contraceptives he was small and bent his face was not disfigured people merely thought it was because it had a single expression he smiled his little mouth was shaped like a v in eternal good cheer his eyebrows were tiny vs inverted over round blue eyes his hair rich white and waved looked like a wig but was real toohey had known hopton stoddard for many years and exercised a strong influence upon him hopton stoddard had never married had no relatives and no friends he distrusted people believing that they were always after his money but he felt a tremendous respect for ellsworth toohey because toohey represented the exact opposite of his own life toohey had no concern whatever for worldly wealth by the mere fact of this contrast he considered toohey the personification of virtue what this estimate implied in regard to his own life never quite occurred to him he was not easy in his mind about his life and the uneasiness grew with the years with the certainty of an approaching end he found relief in religion in the form of a bribe he experimented with several different creeds attended services donated large sums and switched to another faith as the years passed the tempo of his quest accelerated it had the tone of panic tooheys indifference to religion was the only flaw that disturbed him in the person of his friend and mentor but everything toohey preached seemed in line with gods law charity sacrifice help to the poor hopton stoddard felt safe whenever he followed tooheys advice he donated handsomely to the institutions recommended by toohey without much prompting in matters of the spirit he regarded toohey upon earth somewhat as he expected to regard god in heaven but this summer toohey met defeat with hopton stoddard for the first time hopton stoddard decided to realize a dream which he had been planning slyly and cautiously like all his other investments for several years he decided to build a temple it was not to be the temple of any particular creed but an interdenominational nonsectarian monument to religion a cathedral of faith open to all hopton stoddard wanted to play safe he felt crushed when ellsworth toohey advised him against the project toohey wanted a building to house a new home for subnormal children he had an organization set up a distinguished committee of sponsors an endowment for operating expenses but no building and no funds to erect one if hopton stoddard wished a worthy memorial to his name a grand climax of his generosity to what nobler purpose could he dedicate his money than to the hopton stoddard home for subnormal children toohey pointed out to him emphatically to the poor little blighted ones for whom nobody cared but hopton stoddard could not be aroused to any enthusiasm for a home nor for any mundane institution it had to be the hopton stoddard temple of the human spirit he could offer no arguments against tooheys brilliant array he could say nothing except no ellsworth no its not right not right the matter was left unsettled hopton stoddard would not budge but tooheys disapproval made him uncomfortable and he postponed his decision from day to day he knew only that he would have to decide by the end of summer because in the fall he was to depart on a long journey a world tour of the holy shrines of all faiths from lourdes to jerusalem to mecca to benares a few days after the announcement of the aquitania contract toohey came to see hopton stoddard in the evening in the privacy of stoddards vast overstuffed apartment on riverside drive hopton he said cheerfully i was wrong you were right about that temple no said hopton stoddard aghast yes said toohey you were right nothing else would be quite fitting you must build a temple a temple of the human spirit hopton stoddard swallowed and his blue eyes became moist he felt that he must have progressed far upon the path of righteousness if he had been able to teach a point of virtue to his teacher after that nothing else mattered he sat like a meek wrinkled baby listening to ellsworth toohey nodding agreeing to everything its an ambitious undertaking hopton and if you do it you must do it right its a little presumptuous you know offering a present to god and unless you do it in the best way possible it will be offensive not reverent yes of course it must be right it must be right it must be the best youll help me wont you ellsworth you know all about buildings and art and everything it must be right ill be glad to help you if you really want me to if i want you to what do you mean if i want goodness gracious what would i do without you i dont know anything about about anything like that and it must be right if you want it right will you do exactly as i say yes yes yes of course first of all the architect thats very important yes indeed you dont want one of those satinlined commercial boys with the dollar sign all over them you want a man who believes in his work as as you believe in god thats right thats absolutely right you must take the one i name certainly whos that howard roark huh hopton stoddard looked blank whos he hes the man whos going to build the temple of the human spirit is he any good ellsworth toohey turned and looked straight into his eyes by my immortal soul hopton he said slowly hes the best there is oh but hes difficult to get he doesnt work except on certain conditions you must observe them scrupulously you must give him complete freedom tell him what you want and how much you want to spend and leave the rest up to him let him design it and build it as he wishes he wont work otherwise just tell him frankly that you know nothing about architecture and that you chose him because you felt he was the only one who could be trusted to do it right without advice or interference okay if you vouch for him i vouch for him thats fine and i dont care how much it costs me but you must be careful about approaching him i think he will refuse to do it at first he will tell you that he doesnt believe in god what dont believe him hes a profoundly religious man in his own way you can see that in his buildings oh but he doesnt belong to any established church so you wont appear partial you wont offend anyone thats good now when you deal in matters of faith you must be the first one to have faith is that right thats right dont wait to see his drawings they will take some time and you mustnt delay your trip just hire him dont sign a contract its not necessary make arrangements for your bank to take care of the financial end and let him do the rest you dont have to pay him his fee until you return in a year or so when you come back after seeing all those great temples youll have a better one of your own waiting here for you thats just what i wanted but you must think of the proper unveiling to the public the proper dedication the right publicity of course that is publicity certainly do you know of any great event thats not accompanied by a good publicity campaign one that isnt cant be much if you skimp on that it will be downright disrespectful thats true now if you want the proper publicity you must plan it carefully well in advance what you want when you unveil it is one grand fanfare like an opera overture like a blast on gabriels horn thats beautiful the way you put it well to do that you mustnt allow a lot of newspaper punks to dissipate your effect by dribbling out premature stories dont release the drawings of the temple keep them secret tell roark that you want them kept secret he wont object to that have the contractor put up a solid fence all around the site while its being built no ones to know what its like until you come back and preside at the unveiling in person then pictures in every damn paper in the country ellsworth i beg your pardon the ideas right thats how we put over the legend of the virgin ten years ago that was with a cast of ninetyseven yes but in the meantime keep the public interested get yourself a good press agent and tell him how you want it handled ill give you the name of an excellent one see to it that theres something about the mysterious stoddard temple in the papers every other week or so keep em guessing keep em waiting theyll be good and ready when the time comes right but above all dont let roark know that i recommended him dont breathe a word to anyone about my having anything to do with it not to a soul swear it but why because i have too many friends who are architects and its such an important commission and i dont want to hurt anybodys feelings yes thats true swear it oh ellsworth swear it by the salvation of your soul i swear it by that all right now youve never dealt with architects and hes an unusual kind of architect and you dont want to muff it so ill tell you exactly what youre to say to him on the following day toohey walked into dominiques office he stood at her desk smiled and said his voice unsmiling do you remember hopton stoddard and that temple of all faith that hes been talking about for six years vaguely hes going to build it is he hes giving the job to howard roark not really really well of all the incredible not hopton hopton oh all right ill go to work on him no you lay off i told him to give it to roark she sat still exactly as the words caught her the amusement gone from her face he added i wanted you to know that i did it so there wont be any tactical contradictions no one else knows it or is to know it i trust you to remember that she asked her lips moving tightly what are you after he smiled he said im going to make him famous roark sat in hopton stoddards office and listened stupefied hopton stoddard spoke slowly it sounded earnest and impressive but was due to the fact that he had memorized his speeches almost verbatim his baby eyes looked at roark with an ingratiating plea for once roark almost forgot architecture and placed the human element first he wanted to get up and get out of the office he could not stand the man but the words he heard held him the words did not match the mans face or voice so you see mr roark though it is to be a religious edifice it is also more than that you notice that we call it the temple of the human spirit we want to capture in stone as others capture in music not some narrow creed but the essence of all religion and what is the essence of religion the great aspiration of the human spirit toward the highest the noblest the best the human spirit as the creator and the conqueror of the ideal the great lifegiving force of the universe the heroic human spirit that is your assignment mr roark roark rubbed the back of his hand against his eyes helplessly it was not possible it simply was not possible that could not be what the man wanted not that man it seemed horrible to hear him say that mr stoddard im afraid youve made a mistake he said his voice slow and tired i dont think im the man you want i dont think it would be right for me to undertake it i dont believe in god he was astonished to see hopton stoddards expression of delight and triumph hopton stoddard glowed in appreciation in appreciation of the clairvoyant wisdom of ellsworth toohey who was always right he drew himself up with new confidence and he said firmly for the first time in the tone of an old man addressing a youth wise and gently patronizing that doesnt matter youre a profoundly religious man mr roark in your own way i can see that in your buildings he wondered why roark stared at him like that without moving for such a long time thats true said roark it was almost a whisper that he should learn something about himself about his buildings from this man who had seen it and known it before he knew it that this man should say it with that air of tolerant confidence implying full understanding removed roarks doubts he told himself that he did not really understand people that an impression could be deceptive that hopton stoddard would be far on another continent away that nothing mattered in the face of such an assignment that nothing could matter when a human voice even hopton stoddards was going on saying i wish to call it god you may choose any other name but what i want in that building is your spirit your spirit mr roark give me the best of that and you will have done your job as i shall have done mine do not worry about the meaning i wish conveyed let it be your spirit in the shape of a building and it will have that meaning whether you know it or not and so roark agreed to build the stoddard temple of the human spirit in december the cosmoslotnick building was opened with great ceremony there were celebrities flower horseshoes newsreel cameras revolving searchlights and three hours of speeches all alike i should be happy peter keating told himself and wasnt he watched from a window the solid spread of faces filling broadway from curb to curb he tried to talk himself into joy he felt nothing he had to admit that he was bored but he smiled and shook hands and let himself be photographed the cosmoslotnick building rose ponderously over the street like a big white bromide after the ceremonies ellsworth toohey took keating away to the retreat of a paleorchid booth in a quiet expensive restaurant many brilliant parties were being given in honor of the opening but keating grasped tooheys offer and declined all the other invitations toohey watched him as he seized his drink and slumped in his seat wasnt it grand said toohey that peter is the climax of what you can expect from life he lifted his glass delicately heres to the hope that you shall have many triumphs such as this such as tonight thanks said keating and reached for his glass hastily without looking and lifted it to find it empty dont you feel proud peter yes yes of course thats good thats how i like to see you you looked extremely handsome tonight youll be splendid in those newsreels a flicker of interest snapped in keatings eyes well i sure hope so its too bad youre not married peter a wife would have been most decorative tonight goes well with the public with the movie audiences too katie doesnt photograph well oh thats right youre engaged to katie so stupid of me i keep forgetting it no katie doesnt photograph well at all also for the life of me i cant imagine katie being very effective at a social function there are a great many nice adjectives one could use about katie but poised and distinguished are not among them you must forgive me peter i let my imagination run away with me dealing with art as much as i do im inclined to see things purely from the viewpoint of artistic fitness and looking at you tonight i couldnt help thinking of the woman who would have made such a perfect picture by your side who oh dont pay attention to me its only an esthetic fancy life is never as perfect as that people have too much to envy you for you couldnt add that to your other achievements who drop it peter you cant get her nobody can get her youre good but youre not good enough for that who dominique francon of course keating sat up straight and toohey saw wariness in his eyes rebellion actual hostility toohey held his glance calmly it was keating who gave in he slumped again and he said pleading oh god ellsworth i dont love her i never thought you did but i do keep forgetting the exaggerated importance which the average man attaches to love sexual love im not an average man said keating wearily it was an automatic protest without fire sit up peter you dont look like a hero slumped that way keating jerked himself up anxious and angry he said ive always felt that you wanted me to marry dominique why whats it to you youve answered your own question peter what could it possibly be to me but we were speaking of love sexual love peter is a profoundly selfish emotion and selfish emotions are not the ones that lead to happiness are they take tonight for instance that was an evening to swell an egotists heart were you happy peter dont bother my dear no answer is required the point i wish to make is only that one must mistrust ones most personal impulses what one desires is actually of so little importance one cant expect to find happiness until one realizes this completely think of tonight for a moment you my dear peter were the least important person there which is as it should be it is not the doer that counts but those for whom things are done but you were not able to accept that and so you didnt feel the great elation that should have been yours thats true whispered keating he would not have admitted it to anyone else you missed the beautiful pride of utter selflessness only when you learn to deny your ego completely only when you learn to be amused by such piddling sentimentalities as your little sex urges only then will you achieve the greatness which i have always expected of you you you believe that about me ellsworth you really do i wouldnt be sitting here if i didnt but to come back to love personal love peter is a great evil as everything personal and it always leads to misery dont you see why personal love is an act of discrimination of preference it is an act of injustice to every human being on earth whom you rob of the affection arbitrarily granted to one you must love all men equally but you cannot achieve so noble an emotion if you dont kill your selfish little choices they are vicious and futile since they contradict the first cosmic law the basic equality of all men you mean said keating suddenly interested that in a in a philosophical way deep down i mean were all equal all of us of course said toohey keating wondered why the thought was so warmly pleasant to him he did not mind that this made him the equal of every pickpocket in the crowd gathered to celebrate his building tonight it occurred to him dimly and left him undisturbed even though it contradicted the passionate quest for superiority that had driven him all his life the contradiction did not matter he was not thinking of tonight nor of the crowd he was thinking of a man who had not been there tonight you know ellsworth he said leaning forward happy in an uneasy kind of way i id rather talk to you than do anything else anything at all i had so many places to go tonight and im so much happier just sitting here with you sometimes i wonder how id ever go on without you that said toohey is as it should be or else what are friends for that winter the annual costume arts ball was an event of greater brilliance and originality than usual athelstan beasely the leading spirit of its organization had had what he called a stroke of genius all the architects were invited to come dressed as their best buildings it was a huge success peter keating was the star of the evening he looked wonderful as the cosmoslotnick building an exact papiermâché replica of his famous structure covered him from head to knees one could not see his face but his bright eyes peered from behind the windows of the top floor and the crowning pyramid of the roof rose over his head the colonnade hit him somewhere about the diaphragm and he wagged a finger through the portals of the great entrance door his legs were free to move with his usual elegance in faultless dress trousers and patentleather pumps guy francon was very impressive as the frink national bank building although the structure looked a little squatter than in the original in order to allow for francons stomach the hadrian torch over his head had a real electric bulb lit by a miniature battery ralston holcombe was magnificent as a state capitol and gordon l prescott was very masculine as a grain elevator eugene pettingill waddled about on his skinny ancient legs small and bent an imposing park avenue hotel with hornrimmed spectacles peering from under the majestic tower two wits engaged in a duel butting each other in the belly with famous spires great landmarks of the city that greet the ships approaching from across the ocean everybody had lots of fun many of the architects athelstan beasely in particular commented resentfully on howard roark who had been invited and did not come they had expected to see him dressed as the enright house dominique stopped in the hall and stood looking at the door at the inscription howard roark architect she had never seen his office she had fought against coming here for a long time but she had to see the place where he worked the secretary in the reception room was startled when dominique gave her name but announced the visitor to roark go right in miss francon she said roark smiled when she entered his office a faint smile without surprise i knew youd come here some day he said want me to show you the place whats that she asked his hands were smeared with clay on a long table among a litter of unfinished sketches stood the clay model of a building a rough study of angles and terraces the aquitania she asked he nodded do you always do that no not always sometimes theres a hard problem here i like to play with it for a while it will probably be my favorite building its so difficult go ahead i want to watch you doing that do you mind not at all in a moment he had forgotten her presence she sat in a corner and watched his hands she saw them molding walls she saw them smash a part of the structure and begin again slowly patiently with a strange certainty even in his hesitation she saw the palm of his hand smooth a long straight plane she saw an angle jerked across the space in the motion of his hand before she saw it in clay she rose and walked to the window the buildings of the city far below looked no bigger than the model on his table it seemed to her that she could see his hands shaping the setbacks the corners the roofs of all the structures below smashing and molding again her hand moved absently following the form of a distant building in rising steps feeling a physical sense of possession feeling it for him she turned back to the table a strand of hair hung down over his face bent attentively to the model he was not looking at her he was looking at the shape under his fingers it was almost as if she were watching his hands moving over the body of another woman she leaned against the wall weak with a feeling of violent physical pleasure at the beginning of january while the first steel columns rose from the excavations that were to become the cord building and the aquitania hotel roark worked on the drawings for the temple when the first sketches were finished he said to his secretary get me steve mallory mallory mr roark who oh yes the shooting sculptor the what he took a shot at ellsworth toohey didnt he did he yes thats right is that the one you want mr roark thats the one for two days the secretary telephoned art dealers galleries architects newspapers no one could tell her what had become of steven mallory or where he could be found on the third day she reported to roark ive found an address in the village which im told might be his theres no telephone roark dictated a letter asking mallory to telephone his office the letter was not returned but a week passed without answer then steven mallory telephoned hello said roark when the secretary switched the call to him steven mallory speaking said a young hard voice in a way that left an impatient belligerent silence after the words i should like to see you mr mallory can we make an appointment for you to come to my office what do you want to see me about about a commission of course i want you to do some work for a building of mine there was a long silence all right said mallory his voice sounded dead he added which building the stoddard temple you may have heard yeah i heard youre doing it who hasnt heard will you pay me as much as youre paying your press agent im not paying the press agent ill pay you whatever you wish to ask you know that cant be much what time would it be convenient for you to come here oh hell you name it you know im not busy two oclock tomorrow afternoon all right he added i dont like your voice roark laughed i like yours cut it out and be here tomorrow at two okay mallory hung up roark dropped the receiver grinning but the grin vanished suddenly and he sat looking at the telephone his face grave mallory did not keep the appointment three days passed without a word from him then roark went to find him in person the rooming house where mallory lived was a dilapidated brownstone in an unlighted street that smelled of a fish market there was a laundry and a cobbler on the ground floor at either side of a narrow entrance a slatternly landlady said mallory fifth floor rear and shuffled away indifferently roark climbed sagging wooden stairs lighted by bulbs stuck in a web of pipes he knocked at a grimy door the door opened a gaunt young man stood on the threshold he had disheveled hair a strong mouth with a square lower lip and the most expressive eyes that roark had ever seen what do you want he snapped mr mallory yeah im howard roark mallory laughed leaning against the doorjamb one arm stretched across the opening with no intention of stepping aside he was obviously drunk well well he said in person may i come in what for roark sat down on the stair banister why didnt you keep your appointment oh the appointment oh yes well ill tell you mallory said gravely it was like this i really intended to keep it i really did and i started out for your office but on my way there i passed a movie theater that was showing two heads on a pillow so i went in i just had to see two heads on a pillow he grinned sagging against his stretched arm youd better let me come in said roark quietly oh what the hell come in the room was a narrow hole there was an unmade bed in a corner a litter of newspapers and old clothes a gas ring a framed landscape from the fiveandten representing some sort of sick brown meadows with sheep there were no drawings or figures no hints of the occupants profession roark pushed some books and a skillet off the only chair and sat down mallory stood before him grinning swaying a little youre doing it all wrong said mallory thats not the way its done you must be pretty hard up to come running after a sculptor the way its done is like this you make me come to your office and the first time i come you mustnt be there the second time you must keep me waiting for an hour and a half then come out into the reception room and shake hands and ask me whether i know the wilsons of podunk and say how nice that we have mutual friends but youre in an awful hurry today and youll call me up for lunch soon and then well talk business then you keep this up for two months then you give me the commission then you tell me that im no good and wasnt any good in the first place and you throw the thing into the ash can then you hire valerian bronson and he does the job thats the way its done only not this time but his eyes were studying roark intently and his eyes had the certainty of a professional as he spoke his voice kept losing its swaggering gaiety and it slipped to a dead flatness on the last sentences no said roark not this time the boy stood looking at him silently youre howard roark he asked i like your buildings thats why i didnt want to meet you so i wouldnt have to be sick every time i looked at them i wanted to go on thinking that they had to be done by somebody who matched them what if i do that doesnt happen but he sat down on the edge of the crumpled bed and slumped forward his glance like a sensitive scale weighing roarks features impertinent in its open action of appraisal listen said roark speaking clearly and very carefully i want you to do a statue for the stoddard temple give me a piece of paper and ill write you a contract right now stating that i will owe you a million dollars damages if i hire another sculptor or if your work is not used you can speak normal im not drunk not all the way i understand well why did you pick me because youre a good sculptor thats not true that youre good no that its your reason who asked you to hire me nobody some woman i laid i dont know any women you laid stuck on your building budget no the budgets unlimited feel sorry for me no why should i want to get publicity out of that shooting toohey business good god no well what then why did you fish for all that nonsense instead of the simplest reason which that i like your work sure thats what they all say thats what were all supposed to say and to believe imagine what would happen if somebody blew the lid off that one so all right you like my work whats the real reason i like your work mallory spoke earnestly his voice sober you mean you saw the things ive done and you like them you yourself alone without anyone telling you that you should like them or why you should like them and you decided that you wanted me for that reason only for that reason without knowing anything about me or giving a damn only because of the things ive done and and what you saw in them only because of that you decided to hire me and you went to the bother of finding me and coming here and being insulted only because you saw and what you saw made me important to you made you want me is that what you mean just that said roark the things that pulled mallorys eyes wide were frightening to see then he shook his head and said very simply in the tone of soothing himself no he leaned forward his voice sounded dead and pleading listen mr roark i wont be mad at you i just want to know all right i see that youre set on having me work for you and you know you can get me for anything you say you dont have to sign any milliondollar contract look at this room you know youve got me so why shouldnt you tell me the truth it wont make any difference to you and its very important to me whats very important to you not to not to look i didnt think anybodyd ever want me again but you do all right ill go through it again only i dont want to think again that im working for somebody who who likes my work that i couldnt go through any more ill feel better if you tell me ill ill feel calmer why should you put on an act for me im nothing i wont think less of you if thats what youre afraid of dont you see its much more decent to tell me the truth then it will be simple and honest ill respect you more really i will whats the matter with you kid what have they done to you why do you want to say things like that because mallory roared suddenly and then his voice broke and his head dropped and he finished in a flat whisper because ive spent two years his hand circled limply indicating the room thats how ive spent them trying to get used to the fact that what youre trying to tell me doesnt exist roark walked over to him lifted his chin knocking it upward and said youre a goddamn fool you have no right to care what i think of your work what i am or why im here youre too good for that but if you want to know it i think youre the best sculptor weve got i think it because your figures are not what men are but what men could be and should be because youve gone beyond the probable and made us see what is possible but possible only through you because your figures are more devoid of contempt for humanity than any work ive ever seen because you have a magnificent respect for the human being because your figures are the heroic in man and so i didnt come here to do you a favor or because i felt sorry for you or because you need a job pretty badly i came for a simple selfish reason the same reason that makes a man choose the cleanest food he can find its a law of survival isnt it to seek the best i didnt come for your sake i came for mine mallory jerked himself away from him and dropped face down on the bed his two arms stretched out one on each side of his head hands closed into fists the thin trembling of the shirt cloth on his back showed that he was sobbing the shirt cloth and the fists that twisted slowly digging into the pillow roark knew that he was looking at a man who had never cried before he sat down on the side of the bed and could not take his eyes off the twisting wrists even though the sight was hard to bear after a while mallory sat up he looked at roark and saw the calmest kindest face a face without a hint of pity it did not look like the countenance of men who watch the agony of another with a secret pleasure uplifted by the sight of a beggar who needs their compassion it did not bear the cast of the hungry soul that feeds upon anothers humiliation roarks face seemed tired drawn at the temples as if he had just taken a beating but his eyes were serene and they looked at mallory quietly a hard clean glance of understanding and respect lie down now said roar lie still for a while how did they ever let you survive lie down rest well talk afterward mallory got up roark took him by the shoulders forced him down lifted his legs off the floor lowered his head on the pillow the boy did not resist stepping back roark brushed against a table loaded with junk something clattered to the floor mallory jerked forward trying to reach it first roark pushed his arm aside and picked up the object it was a small plaster plaque the kind sold in cheap gift shops it represented a baby sprawled on its stomach dimpled rear forward peeking coyly over its shoulder a few lines the structure of a few muscles showed a magnificent talent that could not be hidden that broke fiercely through the rest the rest was a deliberate attempt to be obvious vulgar and trite a clumsy effort unconvincing and tortured it was an object that belonged in a chamber of horrors mallory saw roarks hand begin to shake then roarks arm went back and up over his head slowly as if gathering the weight of air in the crook of his elbow it was only a flash but it seemed to last for minutes the arm stood lifted and still then it slashed forward the plaque shot across the room and burst to pieces against the wall it was the only time anyone had ever seen roark murderously angry roark yes roark i wish id met you before you had a job to give me he spoke without expression his head lying back on the pillow his eyes closed so that there would be no other reason mixed in because you see im very grateful to you not for giving me a job not for coming here not for anything youll ever do for me just for what you are then he lay without moving straight and limp like a man long past the stage of suffering roark stood at the window looking at the wrenched room and at the boy on the bed he wondered why he felt as if he were waiting he was waiting for an explosion over their heads it seemed senseless then he understood he thought this is how men feel trapped in a shell hole this room is not an accident of poverty its the footprint of a war its the devastation torn by explosives more vicious than any stored in the arsenals of the world a war against the enemy had no name and no face but this boy was a comradeinarms hurt in battle and roark stood over him feeling a strange new thing a desire to lift him in his arms and carry him to safety only the hell and the safety had no known designations he kept thinking of kent lansing trying to remember something kent lansing had said then mallory opened his eyes and lifted himself up on one elbow roark pulled the chair over to the bed and sat down now he said talk talk about the things you really want said dont tell me about your family your childhood your friends or your feelings tell me about the things you think mallory looked at him incredulously and whispered how did you know that roark smiled and said nothing how did you know whats been killing me slowly for years driving me to hate people when i dont want to hate have you felt it too have you seen how your best friends love everything about you except the things that count and your most important is nothing to them nothing not even a sound they can recognize you mean you want to hear you want to know what i do and why i do it you want to know what i think its not boring to you its important go ahead said roark then he sat for hours listening while mallory spoke of his work of the thoughts behind his work of the thoughts that shaped his life spoke gluttonously like a drowning man flung out to shore getting drunk on huge clean snatches of air mallory came to roarks office on the following morning and roark showed him the sketches of the temple when he stood at a drafting table with a problem to consider mallory changed there was no uncertainty in him no remembrance of pain the gesture of his hand taking the drawing was sharp and sure like that of a soldier on duty the gesture said that nothing ever done to him could alter the function of the thing within him that was now called into action he had an unyielding impersonal confidence he faced roark as an equal he studied the drawings for a long time then raised his head everything about his face was controlled except his eyes like it roark asked dont use stupid words he held one of the drawings walked to the window stood looking down the sketch to the street to roarks face and back again it doesnt seem possible he said not this and that he waved the sketch at the street there was a poolroom on the corner of the street below a rooming house with a corinthian portico a billboard advertising a broadway musical a line of pinkgray underwear fluttering on a roof not in the same city not on the same earth said mallory but you made it happen its possible ill never be afraid again of what mallory put the sketch down on the table cautiously he answered you said something yesterday about a first law a law demanding that man seek the best it was funny the unrecognized genius thats an old story have you ever thought of a much worse one the genius recognized too well that a great many men are poor fools who cant see the best thats nothing one cant get angry at that but do you understand about the men who see it and dont want it no no you wouldnt i spent all night thinking about you i didnt sleep at all do you know what your secret is its your terrible innocence roark laughed aloud looking at the boyish face no said mallory its not funny i know what im talking about and you dont you cant know its because of that absolute health of yours youre so healthy that you cant conceive of disease you know of it but you dont really believe it i do im wiser than you are about some things because im weaker i understand the other side thats what did it to me what you saw yesterday thats over probably but not quite im not afraid any more but i know that the terror exists i know the kind of terror it is you cant conceive of that kind listen whats the most horrible experience you can imagine to me its being left unarmed in a sealed cell with a drooling beast of prey or a maniac whos had some disease thats eaten his brain out youd have nothing then but your voice your voice and your thought youd scream to that creature why it should not touch you youd have the most eloquent words the unanswerable words youd become the vessel of the absolute truth and youd see living eyes watching you and youd know that the thing cant hear you that it cant be reached not reached not in any way yet its breathing and moving there before you with a purpose of its own thats horror well thats whats hanging over the world prowling somewhere through mankind that same thing something closed mindless utterly wanton but something with an aim and a cunning of its own i dont think im a coward but im afraid of it and thats all i know only that it exists i dont know its purpose i dont know its nature the principle behind the dean said roark what its something i wonder about once in a while mallory why did you try to shoot ellsworth toohey he saw the boys eyes and he added you dont have to tell me if you dont like to talk about it i dont like to talk about it said mallory his voice tight but it was the right question to ask sit down said roark well talk about your commission then mallory listened attentively while roark spoke of the building and of what he wanted from the sculptor he concluded just one figure it will stand here he pointed to a sketch the place is built around it the statue of a naked woman if you understand the building you understand what the figure must be the human spirit the heroic in man the aspiration and the fulfillment both uplifted in its quest and uplifting by its own essence seeking god and finding itself showing that there is no higher reach beyond its own form youre the only one who can do it for me yes youll work as i work for my clients you know what i want the rest is up to you do it any way you wish id like to suggest the model but if she doesnt fit your purpose choose anyone you prefer whos your choice dominique francon oh god know her ive seen her if i could have her christ theres no other woman so right for this she he stopped he added deflated she wont pose certainly not for you she will guy francon tried to object when he heard of it listen dominique he said angrily there is a limit there really is a limit even for you why are you doing it why for a building of roarks of all things after everything youve said and done against him do you wonder people are talking nobodyd care or notice if it were anyone else but you and roark i cant go anywhere without having somebody ask me about it what am i to do order yourself a reproduction of the statue father its going to be beautiful peter keating refused to discuss it but he met dominique at a party and he asked having intended not to ask it is it true that youre posing for a statue for roarks temple yes dominique i dont like it no oh im sorry i know i have no right its only its only that of all people i dont want to see you being friendly with roark not roark anybody but roark she looked interested why i dont know her glance of curious study worried him maybe he muttered maybe its because it has never seemed right that you should have such contempt for his work it made me very happy that you had but but it never seemed right for you it didnt peter no but you dont like him as a person do you no i dont like him as a person ellsworth toohey was displeased it was most unwise of you dominique he said in the privacy of her office his voice did not sound smooth i know it was cant you change your mind and refuse i wont change my mind ellsworth he sat down and shrugged after a while he smiled all right my dear have it your own way she ran a pencil through a line of copy and said nothing toohey lighted a cigarette so hes chosen steven mallory for the job he said yes a funny coincidence wasnt it its no coincidence at all my dear things like that are never a coincidence theres a basic law behind it though im sure he doesnt know it and nobody helped him to choose i believe you approve wholeheartedly it makes everything just right better than ever ellsworth why did mallory try to kill you i havent the faintest idea i dont know i think mr roark does or should incidentally who selected you to pose for that statue roark or mallory thats none of your business ellsworth i see roark incidentally ive told roark that it was you who made hopton stoddard hire him he stopped his cigarette in midair then moved again and placed it in his mouth you did why i saw the drawings of the temple that good better ellsworth what did he say when you told him nothing he laughed he did nice of him i daresay many people will join him after a while through the months of that winter roark seldom slept more than three hours a night there was a swinging sharpness in his movements as if his body fed energy to all those around him the energy ran through the walls of his office to three points of the city to the cord building in the center of manhattan a tower of copper and glass to the aquitania hotel on central park south and to the temple on a rock over the hudson far north on riverside drive when they had time to meet austen heller watched him amused and pleased when these three are finished howard he said nobody will be able to stop you not ever again i speculate occasionally upon how far youll go you see ive always had a weakness for astronomy on an evening in march roark stood within the tall enclosure that had been erected around the site of the temple according to stoddards orders the first blocks of stone the base of future walls rose above the ground it was late and the workers had left the place lay deserted cut off from the world dissolved in darkness but the sky glowed too luminous for the night below as if the light had remained past the normal hour in announcement of the coming spring a ships siren cried out once somewhere on the river and the sound seemed to come from a distant countryside through miles of silence a light still burned in the wooden shack built as a studio for steven mallory where dominique posed for him the temple was to be a small building of gray limestone its lines were horizontal not the lines reaching to heaven but the lines of the earth it seemed to spread over the ground like arms outstretched at shoulderheight palms down in great silent acceptance it did not cling to the soil and it did not crouch under the sky it seemed to lift the earth and its few vertical shafts pulled the sky down it was scaled to human height in such a manner that it did not dwarf man but stood as a setting that made his figure the only absolute the gauge of perfection by which all dimensions were to be judged when a man entered this temple he would feel space molded around him for him as if it had waited for his entrance to be completed it was a joyous place with the joy of exaltation that must be quiet it was a place where one would come to feel sinless and strong to find the peace of spirit never granted save by ones own glory there was no ornamentation inside except the graded projections of the walls and the vast windows the place was not sealed under vaults but thrown open to the earth around it to the trees the river the sun and to the skyline of the city in the distance the skyscrapers the shapes of mans achievement on earth at the end of the room facing the entrance with the city as background stood the figure of a naked human body there was nothing before him now in the darkness except the first stones but roark thought of the finished building feeling it in the joints of his fingers still remembering the movements of his pencil that had drawn it he stood thinking of it then he walked across the rough torn earth to the studio shack just a moment said mallorys voice when he knocked inside the shack dominique stepped down from the stand and pulled a robe on then mallory opened the door oh its you he said we thought it was the watchman what are you doing here so late good evening miss francon said roark and she nodded curtly sorry to interrupt steve its all right we havent been doing so well dominique cant get quite what i want tonight sit down howard what the hell time is it ninethirty if youre going to stay longer want me to have some dinner sent up i dont know lets have a cigarette the place had an unpainted wooden floor bare wooden rafters a castiron stove glowing in a corner mallory moved about like a feudal host with smudges of clay on his forehead he smoked nervously pacing up and down want to get dressed dominique he asked i dont think well do much more tonight she didnt answer she stood looking at roark mallory reached the end of the room whirled around smiled at roark why havent you ever come in before howard of course if id been really busy id have thrown you out what by the way are you doing here at this hour i just wanted to see the place tonight couldnt get here earlier is this what you want steve dominique asked suddenly she took her robe off and walked naked to the stand mallory looked from her to roark and back again then he saw what he had been struggling to see all day he saw her body standing before him straight and tense her head thrown back her arms at her sides palms out as she stood for many days but now her body was alive so still that it seemed to tremble saying what he had wanted to hear a proud reverent enraptured surrender to a vision of her own the right moment the moment before the figure would sway and break the moment touched by the reflection of what she saw mallorys cigarette went flying across the room hold it dominique he cried hold it hold it he was at his stand before the cigarette hit the ground he worked and dominique stood without moving and roark stood facing her leaning against the wall in april the walls of the temple rose in broken lines over the ground on moonlit nights they had a soft smeared underwater glow the tall fence stood on guard around them after the days work four people would often remain at the site roark mallory dominique and mike donnigan mike had not missed employment on a single building of roarks the four of them sat together in mallorys shack after all the others had left a wet cloth covered the unfinished statue the door of the shack stood open to the first warmth of a spring night a tree branch hung outside with three new leaves against the black sky stars trembling like drops of water on the edges of the leaves there were no chairs in the shack mallory stood at the castiron stove fixing hot dogs and coffee mike sat on the models stand smoking a pipe roark lay stretched out on the floor propped up on his elbows dominique sat on a kitchen stool a thin silk robe wrapped about her her bare feet on the planks of the floor they did not speak about their work mallory told outrageous stories and dominique laughed like a child they talked about nothing in particular sentences that had meaning only in the sound of the voices in the warm gaiety in the ease of complete relaxation they were simply four people who liked being there together the walls rising in the darkness beyond the open door gave sanction to their rest gave them the right to lightness the building on which they had all worked together the building that was like a low audible harmony to the sound of their voices roark laughed as dominique had never seen him laugh anywhere else his mouth loose and young they stayed there late into the night mallory poured coffee into a mongrel assortment of cracked cups the odor of coffee met the odor of the new leaves outside in may work was stopped on the construction of the aquitania hotel two of the owners had been cleaned out in the stock market a third got his funds attached by a lawsuit over an inheritance disputed by someone a fourth embezzled somebody elses shares the corporation blew up in a tangle of court cases that were to require years of untangling the building had to wait unfinished ill straighten it out if i have to murder a few of them kent lansing told roark ill get it out of their hands well finish it some day you and i but it will take time probably a long time i wont tell you to be patient men like you and me would not survive beyond their first fifteen years if they did not acquire the patience of a chinese executioner and the hide of a battleship ellsworth toohey laughed sitting on the edge of dominiques desk the unfinished symphony thank god he said dominique used that in her column the unfinished symphony on central park south she wrote she did not say thank god the nickname was repeated strangers noticed the odd sight of an expensive structure on an important street left gaping with empty windows halfcovered walls naked beams when they asked what it was people who had never heard of roark or of the story behind the building snickered and answered oh thats the unfinished symphony late at night roark would stand across the street under the trees of the park and look at the black dead shape among the glowing structures of the citys skyline his hands would move as they had moved over the clay model at that distance a broken projection could be covered by the palm of his hand but the instinctive completing motion met nothing but air he forced himself sometimes to walk through the building he walked on shivering planks hung over emptiness through rooms without ceilings and rooms without floors to the open edges where girders stuck out like bones through a broken skin an old watchman lived in a cubbyhole at the back of the ground floor he knew roark and let him wander around once he stopped roark on the way out and said suddenly i had a son once almost he was born dead something had made him say that and he looked at roark not quite certain of what he had wanted to say but roark smiled his eyes closed and his hand covered the old mans shoulder like a handshake and then he walked away it was only the first few weeks then he made himself forget the aquitania on an evening in october roark and dominique walked together through the completed temple it was to be opened publicly in a week the day after stoddards return no one had seen it except those who had worked on its construction it was a clear quiet evening the site of the temple lay empty and silent the red of the sunset on the limestone walls was like the first light of morning they stood looking at the temple and then stood inside before the marble figure saying nothing to each other the shadows in the molded space around them seemed shaped by the same hand that had shaped the walls the ebbing motion of light flowed in controlled discipline like the sentences of a speech giving voice to the changing facets of the walls roark yes my dearest no nothing they walked back to the car together his hand clasping her wrist the opening of the stoddard temple was announced for the afternoon of november first the press agent had done a good job people talked about the event about howard roark about the architectural masterpiece which the city was to expect on the morning of october hopton stoddard returned from his journey around the world ellsworth toohey met him at the pier on the morning of november hopton stoddard issued a brief statement announcing that there would be no opening no explanation was given on the morning of november the new york banner came out with the column one small voice by ellsworth m toohey subtitled sacrilege it read as follows the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of ships and shoes and howard roark and cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether roark has wings it is not our function paraphrasing a philosopher whom we do not like to be a fly swatter but when a fly acquires delusions of grandeur the best of us must stoop to do a little job of extermination there has been a great deal of talk lately about somebody named howard roark since freedom of speech is our sacred heritage and includes the freedom to waste ones time there would have been no harm in such talk beyond the fact that one could find so many endeavors more profitable than discussions of a man who seems to have nothing to his credit except a building that was begun and could not be completed there would have been no harm if the ludicrous had not become the tragic and the fraudulent howard roark as most of you have not heard and are not likely to hear again is an architect a year ago he was entrusted with an assignment of extraordinary responsibility he was commissioned to erect a great monument in the absence of the owner who believed in him and gave him complete freedom of action if the terminology of our criminal law could be applied to the realm of art we would have to say that what mr roark delivered constitutes the equivalent of spiritual embezzlement mr hopton stoddard the noted philanthropist had intended to present the city of new york with a temple of religion a nonsectarian cathedral symbolizing the spirit of human faith what mr roark has built for him might be a warehouse though it does not seem practical it might be a brothel which is more likely if we consider some of its sculptural ornamentation it is certainly not a temple it seems as if a deliberate malice had reversed in this building every conception proper to a religious structure instead of being austerely enclosed this alleged temple is wide open like a western saloon instead of a mood of deferential sorrow befitting a place where one contemplates eternity and realizes the insignificance of man this building has a quality of loose orgiastic elation instead of the soaring lines reaching for heaven demanded by the very nature of a temple as a symbol of mans quest for something higher than his little ego this building is flauntingly horizontal its belly in the mud thus declaring its allegiance to the carnal glorifying the gross pleasures of the flesh above those of the spirit the statue of a nude female in a place where men come to be uplifted speaks for itself and requires no further comment a person entering a temple seeks release from himself he wishes to humble his pride to confess his unworthiness to beg forgiveness he finds fulfillment in a sense of abject humility mans proper posture in a house of god is on his knees nobody in his right mind would kneel within mr roarks temple the place forbids it the emotions it suggests are of a different nature arrogance audacity defiance selfexaltation it is not a house of god but the cell of a megalomaniac it is not a temple but its perfect antithesis an insolent mockery of all religion we would call it pagan but for the fact that the pagans were notoriously good architects this column is not the supporter of any particular creed but simple decency demands that we respect the religious convictions of our fellow men we felt we must explain to the public the nature of this deliberate attack on religion we cannot condone an outrageous sacrilege if we seem to have forgotten our function as a critic of purely architectural values we can say only that the occasion does not call for it it is a mistake to glorify mediocrity by an effort at serious criticism we seem to recall something or other that this howard roark has built before and it had the same ineptitude the same pedestrian quality of an overambitious amateur all gods chillun may have wings but unfortunately this is not true of all gods geniuses and that my friends is that we are glad todays chore is over we really do not enjoy writing obituaries on november hopton stoddard filed suit against howard roark for breach of contract and malpractice asking damages he asked a sum sufficient to have the temple altered by another architect it had been easy to persuade hopton stoddard he had returned from his journey crushed by the universal spectacle of religion most particularly by the various forms in which the promise of hell confronted him all over the earth he had been driven to the conclusion that his life qualified him for the worst possible hereafter under any system of faith it had shaken what remained of his mind the ship stewards on his return trip had felt certain that the old gentleman was senile on the afternoon of his return ellsworth toohey took him to see the temple toohey said nothing hopton stoddard stared and toohey heard stoddards false teeth clicking spasmodically the place did not resemble anything stoddard had seen anywhere in the world nor anything he had expected he did not know what to think when he turned a glance of desperate appeal upon toohey stoddards eyes looked like jello he waited in that moment toohey could have convinced him of anything toohey spoke and said what he said later in his column but you told me this roark was good stoddard moaned in panic i had expected him to be good toohey answered coldly but then why i dont know said toohey and his accusing glance gave stoddard to understand that there was an ominous guilt behind it all and that the guilt was stoddards toohey said nothing in the limousine on their way back to stoddards apartment while stoddard begged him to speak he would not answer the silence drove stoddard to terror in the apartment toohey led him to an armchair and stood before him somber as a judge hopton i know why it happened oh why can you think of any reason why i should have lied to you no of course not youre the greatest expert and the most honest man living and i dont understand i just simply dont understand at all i do when i recommended roark i had every reason to expect to the best of my honest judgment that he would give you a masterpiece but he didnt hopton do you know what power can upset all the calculations of men wwhat power god has chosen this way to reject your offering he did not consider you worthy of presenting him with a shrine i guess you can fool me hopton and all men but you cant fool god he knows that your record is blacker than anything i suspected he went on speaking for a long time calmly severely to a silent huddle of terror at the end he said it seems obvious hopton that you cannot buy forgiveness by starting at the top only the pure in heart can erect a shrine you must go through many humbler steps of expiation before you reach that stage you must atone to your fellow men before you can atone to god this building was not meant to be a temple but an institution of human charity such as a home for subnormal children hopton stoddard would not commit himself to that afterward ellsworth afterward he moaned give me time he agreed to sue roark as toohey suggested for recovery of the costs of alterations and later to decide what these alterations would be dont be shocked by anything i will say or write about this toohey told him in parting i shall be forced to stage a few things which are not quite true i must protect my own reputation from a disgrace which is your fault not mine just remember that you have sworn never to reveal who advised you to hire roark on the following day sacrilege appeared in the banner and set the fuse the announcement of stoddards suit lighted it nobody would have felt an urge to crusade about a building but religion had been attacked the press agent had prepared the ground too well the spring of public attention was wound a great many people could make use of it the clamor of indignation that rose against howard roark and his temple astonished everyone except ellsworth toohey ministers damned the building in sermons womens clubs passed resolutions of protest a committee of mothers made page eight of the newspapers with a petition that shrieked something about the protection of their children a famous actress wrote an article on the essential unity of all the arts explained that the stoddard temple had no sense of structural diction and spoke of the time when she had played mary magdalene in a great biblical drama a society woman wrote an article on the exotic shrines she had seen in her dangerous jungle travels praised the touching faith of the savages and reproached modern man for cynicism the stoddard temple she said was a symptom of softness and decadence the illustration showed her in breeches one slim foot on the neck of a dead lion a college professor wrote a letter to the editor about his spiritual experiences and stated that he could not have experienced them in a place like the stoddard temple kiki holcombe wrote a letter to the editor about her views on life and death the aga issued a dignified statement denouncing the stoddard temple as a spiritual and artistic fraud similar statements with less dignity and more slang were issued by the councils of american builders writers and artists nobody had ever heard of them but they were councils and this gave weight to their voice one man would say to another do you know that the council of american builders has said this temple is a piece of architectural tripe in a tone suggesting intimacy with the best of the art world the other wouldnt want to reply that he had not heard of such a group but would answer i expected them to say it didnt you hopton stoddard received so many letters of sympathy that he began to feel quite happy he had never been popular before ellsworth he thought was right his brother men were forgiving him ellsworth was always right the better newspapers dropped the story after a while but the banner kept it going it had been a boon to the banner gail wynand was away sailing his yacht through the indian ocean and alvah scarret was stuck for a crusade this suited him ellsworth toohey needed to make no suggestions scarret rose to the occasion all by himself he wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of the simple faith he sponsored an essay contest for highschool students on why i go to church he ran a series of illustrated articles on the churches of our childhood he ran photographs of religious sculpture through the ages the sphinx gargoyles totem poles and gave great prominence to pictures of dominiques statue with proper captions of indignation but omitting the models name he ran cartoons of roark as a barbarian with bearskin and club he wrote many clever things about the tower of babel that could not reach heaven and about icarus who flopped on his wax wings ellsworth toohey sat back and watched he made two minor suggestions he found in the banners morgue the photograph of roark at the opening of the enright house the photograph of a mans face in a moment of exaltation and he had it printed in the banner over the caption are you happy mr superman he made stoddard open the temple to the public while awaiting the trial of his suit the temple attracted crowds of people who left obscene drawings and inscriptions on the pedestal of dominiques statue there were a few who came and saw and admired the building in silence but they were the kind who do not take part in public issues austen heller wrote a furious article in defense of roark and of the temple but he was not an authority on architecture or religion and the article was drowned in the storm howard roark did nothing he was asked for a statement and he received a group of reporters in his office he spoke without anger he said i cant tell anyone anything about my building if i prepared a hash of words to stuff into other peoples brains it would be an insult to them and to me but i am glad you came here i do have something to say i want to ask every man who is interested in this to go and see the building to look at it and then to use the words of his own mind if he cares to speak the banner printed the interview as follows mr roark who seems to be a publicity hound received reporters with an air of swaggering insolence and stated that the public mind was hash he did not choose to talk but he seemed well aware of the advertising angles in the situation all he cared about he explained was to have his building seen by as many people as possible roark refused to hire an attorney to represent him at the coming trial he said he would handle his own defense and refused to explain how he intended to handle it in spite of austen hellers angry protests austen there are some rules im perfectly willing to obey im willing to wear the kind of clothes everybody wears to eat the same food and use the same subways but there are some things which i cant do their way and this is one of them what do you know about courtrooms and law hes going to win to win what his case is the case of any importance theres nothing i can do to stop him from touching the building he owns it he can blast it off the face of the earth or make a glue factory out of it he can do it whether i win that suit or lose it but hell take your money to do it with yes he might take my money steven mallory made no comment on anything but his face looked as it had looked on the night roark met him for the first time steve talk about it if it will make it easier for you roark said to him one evening theres nothing to talk about mallory answered indifferently i told you i didnt think theyd let you survive rubbish you have no right to be afraid for me im not afraid for you what would be the use its something else days later sitting on the window sill in roarks room looking out at the street mallory said suddenly howard do you remember what i told you about the beast im afraid of i know nothing about ellsworth toohey i had never seen him before i shot at him i had only read what he writes howard i shot at him because i think he knows everything about that beast dominique came to roarks room on the evening when stoddard announced his lawsuit she said nothing she put her bag down on a table and stood removing her gloves slowly as if she wished to prolong the intimacy of performing a routine gesture here in his room she looked down at her fingers then she raised her head her face looked as if she knew his worst suffering and it was hers and she wished to bear it like this coldly asking no words of mitigation youre wrong he said they could always speak like this to each other continuing a conversation they had not begun his voice was gentle i dont feel that i dont want to know i want you to know what youre thinking is much worse than the truth i dont believe it matters to me that theyre going to destroy it maybe it hurts so much that i dont even know im hurt but i dont think so if you want to carry it for my sake dont carry more than i do im not capable of suffering completely i never have it goes only down to a certain point and then it stops as long as there is that untouched point its not really pain you mustnt look like that where does it stop where i can think of nothing and feel nothing except that i designed that temple i built it nothing else can seem very important you shouldnt have built it you shouldnt have delivered it to the sort of thing theyre doing that doesnt matter not even that theyll destroy it only that it had existed she shook her head do you see what i was saving you from when i took commissions away from you to give them no right to do this to you no right to live in a building of yours no right to touch you not in any way when dominique walked into tooheys office he smiled an eager smile of welcome unexpectedly sincere he forgot to control it while his eyebrows moved into a frown of disappointment the frown and the smile remained ludicrously together for a moment he was disappointed because it was not her usual dramatic entrance he saw no anger no mockery she entered like a bookkeeper on a business errand she asked what do you intend to accomplish by it he tried to recapture the exhilaration of their usual feud he sit down my dear im delighted to see you quite frankly and helplessly delighted it really took you too long i expected you here much sooner ive had so many compliments on that little article of mine but honestly it was no fun at all i wanted to hear what youd say what do you intend to accomplish by it look darling i do hope you didnt mind what i said about that uplifting statue of yours i thought you d understand i just couldnt pass up that one what is the purpose of that lawsuit oh well you want to make me talk and i did so want to hear you but half a pleasure is better than none i want to talk ive waited for you so impatiently but i do wish youd sit down ill be more comfortable no well as you prefer so long as you dont run away the lawsuit well isnt it obvious how is it going to stop him she asked in the tone one would use to recite a list of statistics it will prove nothing whether he wins or loses the whole thing is just a spree for great number of louts filthy but pointless i did not think you wasted your time on stink bombs all of it will be forgotten before christmas my god but i must be a failure i never thought of myself as such a poor teacher that you should have learned so little in two years of close association with me its really discouraging since you are the most intelligent woman i know the fault must be mine well lets see you did learn one thing that i dont waste my time quite correct i dont right my dear everything will be forgotten by next christmas and that you see will be the achievement you can fight a live issue you cant fight a dead one dead issues like all dead things dont just vanish but leave some decomposing matter behind a most unpleasant thing to carry on your name mr hopton stoddard will be thoroughly forgotten the temple will be forgotten the lawsuit will be forgotten but heres what will remain howard roark why how could you trust a man like that hes an enemy of religion hes completely immortal first thing you know hell gyp you on your construction costs roark hes no good why a client had to sue him because he made such a botch of a building roark roark wait a moment isnt that the guy who got into all the papers over some sort of a mess now what was it some rotten kind of scandal the owner of the building i think the place was a disorderly house anyway the owner had to sue him you dont want to get involved with a notorious character like that what for when there are so many decent architects to choose from fight that my dear tell me a way to fight it particularly when you have no weapons except your genius which is not a weapon but a great liability her eyes were disappointing they listened patiently an unmoving glance that would not become anger she stood before his desk straight controlled like a sentry in a storm who knows that he has to take it and has to remain there even when he can take it no longer i believe you want me to continue said toohey now you see the peculiar effectiveness of a dead issue you cant talk your way out of it you cant explain you cant defend yourself nobody wants to listen it is difficult enough to acquire fame it is impossible to change its nature once youve acquired it no you can never ruin an architect by proving that hes a bad architect but you can ruin him because hes an atheist or because somebody sued him or because he slept with some woman or because he pulls wings off bottleflies youll say it doesnt make sense of course it doesnt thats why it works reason can be fought with reason how are you going to fight the unreasonable the trouble with you my dear and with most people is that you dont have sufficient respect for the senseless the senseless is the major factor in our lives you have no chance if it is your enemy but if you can make it become your ally ah my dear look dominique i will stop talking the moment you show a sign of being frightened go on she said i think you should now ask me a question or perhaps you dont like to be obvious and feel that i must guess the question myself i think youre right the question is why did i choose howard roark because to quote my own article it is not my function to be a fly swatter i quote this now with a somewhat different meaning but well let that pass also this has helped me to get something i wanted from hopton stoddard but thats only a minor sideissue an incidental just pure gravy principally however the whole thing was an experiment just a test skirmish shall we say the results are most gratifying if you were not involved as you are youd be the one person whod appreciate the spectacle really you know ive done very little when you consider the extent of what followed dont you find it interesting to see a huge complicated piece of machinery such as our society all levers and belts and interlocking gears the kind that looks as if one would need an army to operate it and you find that by pressing your little finger against one spot the one vital spot the center of all its gravity you can make the thing crumble into a worthless heap of scrap iron it can be done my dear but it takes a long time it takes centuries i have the advantage of many experts who came before me i think i shall be the last and the successful one of the line because though not abler than they were i see more clearly what were after however thats abstraction speaking of concrete reality dont you find anything amusing in my little experiment i do for instance do you notice that all the wrong people are on the wrong sides alvah scarret the college professors the newspaper editors the respectable mothers and the chambers of commerce should have come flying to the defense of howard roark if they value their own lives but they didnt they are upholding hopton stoddard on the other hand i heard that some screwy bunch of cafeteria radicals called the new league of proletarian art tried to enlist in support of howard roark they said he was a victim of capitalism when they should have known that hopton stoddard is their champion roark by the way had the good sense to decline he understands you do i do not many others oh well scrap iron has its uses she turned to leave the room dominique youre not going he sounded hurt you wont say anything not anything at all no dominique youre letting me down and how i waited for you im a very selfsufficient person as a rule but i do need an audience once in a while youre the only person with whom i can be myself i suppose its because you have such contempt for me that nothing i say can make any difference you see i know that but i dont care also the methods i use on other people would never work on you strangely enough only my honesty will hell whats the use of accomplishing a skillful piece of work if nobody knows that youve accomplished it had you been your old self youd tell me at this point that that is the psychology of a murderer whos committed the perfect crime and then confesses because he cant bear the idea that nobody knows its a perfect crime and id answer that youre right i want an audience thats the trouble with victims they dont even know theyre victims which is as it should be but it does become monotonous and takes half the fun away youre such a rare treat a victim who can appreciate the artistry of its own execution for gods sake dominique are you leaving when im practically begging you to remain she put her hand on the doorknob he shrugged and settled back in his chair all right he said incidentally dont try to buy hopton stoddard out hes eating out of my hand just now he wont sell she had opened the door but she stopped and pulled it shut again oh yes of course i know that youve tried its no use youre not that rich you havent enough to buy that temple and you couldnt raise enough also hopton wont accept any money from you to pay for the alterations i know youve offered that too he wants it from roark by the way i dont think roark would like it if i let him know that youve tried he smiled in a manner that demanded a protest her face gave no answer she turned to the door again just one more question dominique mr stoddards attorney wants to know whether he can call you as a witness an expert on architecture you will testify for the plaintiff of course yes i will testify for the plaintiff the case of hopton stoddard versus howard roark opened in february of the courtroom was so full that mass reactions could be expressed only by a slow motion running across the spread of heads a sluggish wave like the ripple under the tightpacked skin of a sea lion the crowd brown and streaked with subdued color looked like a fruitcake of all the arts with the cream of the aga rich and heavy on top there were distinguished men and welldressed tightlipped women each woman seemed to feel an exclusive proprietorship of the art practiced by her escort a monopoly guarded by resentful glances at the others almost everybody knew almost everybody else the room had the atmosphere of a convention an opening night and a family picnic there was a feeling of our bunch our boys our show steven mallory austen heller roger enright kent lansing and mike sat together in one corner they tried not to look around them mike was worried about steven mallory he kept close to mallory insisted on sitting next to him and glanced at him whenever a particularly offensive bit of conversation reached them mallory noticed it at last and said dont worry mike i wont scream i wont shoot anyone watch your stomach kid said mike just watch your stomach a man cant get sick just because he oughta mike do you remember the night when we stayed so late that it was almost daylight and dominiques car was out of gas and there were no busses and we all decided to walk home and there was sun on the rooftops by the time the first one of us got to his house thats right you think about that and ill think about the granite quarry what granite quarry its something made me very sick once but then it turned out it make no difference at all in the long run beyond the windows the sky was white and flat like frosted glass the light seemed to come from the banks of snow on roofs and ledges an unnatural light that made everything in the room look naked the judge sat hunched on his high bench as if he were roosting he had a small face wizened into virtue he kept his hands upright in front of his chest the fingertips pressed together hopton stoddard was not present he was represented by his attorney a handsome gentleman tall and grave as an ambassador roark sat alone at the defense table the crowd had stared at him and given up angrily finding no satisfaction he did not look crushed and he did not look defiant he looked impersonal and calm he was not like a public figure in a public place he was like a man alone in his own room listening to the radio he took no notes there were no papers on the table before him only a large brown envelope the crowd would have forgiven anything except a man who could remain normal under the vibrations of its enormous collective sneer some of them had come prepared to pity him all of them hated him after the first few minutes the plaintiffs attorney stated his case in a simple opening address it was true he admitted that hopton stoddard had given roark full freedom to design and build the temple the point was however that mr stoddard had clearly specified and expected a temple the building in question could not be considered a temple by any known standards as the plaintiff proposed to prove with the help of the best authorities in the field roark waived his privilege to make an opening statement to the jury ellsworth monkton toohey was the first witness called by the plaintiff he sat on the edge of the witness chair and leaned back resting on the end of his spine he lifted one leg and placed it horizontally across the other he looked amused but managed to suggest that his amusement was a wellbred protection against looking bored the attorney went through a long list of questions about mr tooheys professional qualifications including the number of copies sold of his book sermons in stone then he read aloud tooheys column sacrilege and asked him to state whether he had written it toohey replied that he had there followed a list of questions in erudite terms on the architectural merits of the temple toohey proved that it had none there followed an historical review toohey speaking easily and casually gave a brief sketch of all known civilizations and of their outstanding religious monuments from the incas to the phoenicians to the easter islanders including whenever possible the dates when these monuments were begun and the dates when they were completed the number of workers employed in the construction and the approximate cost in modern american dollars the audience listened punchdrunk toohey proved that the stoddard temple contradicted every brick stone and precept of history i have endeavored to show he said in conclusion that the two essentials of the conception of a temple are a sense of awe and a sense of mans humility we have noted the gigantic proportions of religious edifices the soaring lines the horrible grotesques of monsterlike gods or later gargoyles all of it tends to impress upon man his essential insignificance to crush him by sheer magnitude to imbue him with that sacred terror which leads to the meekness of virtue the stoddard temple is a brazen denial of our entire past an insolent no flung in the face of history i may venture a guess as to the reason why this case has aroused such public interest all of us have recognized instinctively that it involves a moral issue much beyond its legal aspects this building is a monument to a profound hatred of humanity it is one mans ego defying the most sacred impulses of all mankind of every man on the street of every man in this courtroom this was not a witness in court but ellsworth toohey addressing a meeting and the reaction was inevitable the audience burst into applause the judge struck his gavel and made a threat to have the courtroom cleared order was restored but not to the faces of the crowd the faces remained lecherously selfrighteous it was pleasant to be singled out and brought into the case as an injured party threefourths of them had never seen the stoddard temple thank you mr toohey said the attorney faintly suggesting a bow then he turned to roark and said with delicate courtesy your witness no questions said roark ellsworth toohey raised one eyebrow and left the stand regretfully mr peter keating called the attorney peter keatings face looked attractive and fresh as if he had had a good nights sleep he mounted the witness stand with a collegiate sort of gusto swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily he took the oath and answered the first questions gaily his pose in the witness chair was strange his torso slumped to one side with swaggering ease an elbow on the chairs arm but his feet were planted awkwardly straight and his knees were pressed tight together he never looked at roark will you please name some of the outstanding buildings which you have designed mr keating the attorney asked keating began a list of impressive names the first few came fast the rest slower and slower as if he wished to be stopped the last one died in the air unfinished arent you forgetting the most important one mr keating the attorney asked didnt you design the cosmoslotnick building yes whispered keating now mr keating you attended the stanton institute of technology at the same period as mr roark yes what can you tell us about mr roarks record there he was expelled he was expelled because he was unable to live up to the institutes high standard of requirements yes yes that was it the judge glanced at roark a lawyer would have objected to this testimony as irrelevant roark made no objection at that time did you think that he showed any talent for the profession of architecture no will you please speak a little louder mr keating i didnt think he had any talent queer things were happening to keatings verbal punctuation some words came out crisply as if he dropped an exclamation point after each others ran together as if he would not stop to let himself hear them he did not look at the attorney he kept his eyes on the audience at times he looked like a boy out on a lark a boy who has just drawn a mustache on the face of a beautiful girl on a subway toothpaste ad then he looked as if he were begging the crowd for support as if he were on trial before them at one time you employed mr roark in your office yes and you found yourself forced to fire him yes we did for incompetence yes what can you tell us about mr roarks subsequent career well you know career is a relative term in volume of achievement any draftsman in our office has done more than mr roark we dont call one or two buildings a career we put up that many every month or so will you give us your professional opinion of his work well i think its immature very startling even quite interesting at times but essentially adolescent then mr roark cannot be called a fullfledged architect not in the sense in which we speak of mr ralston holcombe mr guy francon mr gordon prescott no but of course i want to be fair i think mr roark had definite potentialities particularly in problems of pure engineering he could have made something of himself ive tried to talk to him about it ive tried to help him i honestly did but it was like talking to one of his pet pieces of reinforced concrete i knew that hed come to something like this i wasnt surprised when i heard that a client had had to sue him at last what can you tell us about mr roarks attitude toward clients well thats the point thats the whole point he didnt care what the clients thought or wished what anyone in the world thought or wished he didnt even understand how other architects could care he wouldnt even give you that not even understanding not even enough to respect you a little just the same i dont see whats so wrong with trying to please people i dont see whats wrong with wanting to be friendly and liked and popular why is that a crime why should anyone sneer at you for that sneer all the time all the time day and night not giving you a moments peace like the chinese water torture you know where they drop water on your skull drop by drop people in the audience began to realize that peter keating was drunk the attorney frowned the testimony had been rehearsed but it was getting off the rails well now mr keating perhaps youd better tell us about mr roarks views on architecture ill tell you if you want to know he thinks you should take your shoes off and kneel when you speak of architecture thats what he thinks now why should you why its a business like any other isnt it whats so damn sacred about it why do we have to be all keyed up were only human we want to make a living why cant things be simple and easy why do we have to be some sort of goddamn heroes now now mr keating i think were straying slightly from the subject were no were not i know what im talking about you do too they all do every one of them here im talking about the temple dont you see why pick a fiend to build a temple only a very human sort of man should be chosen to do that a man who understands and forgives a man who forgives thats what you go to church for to be forgiven yes mr keating but speaking of mr roark well what about mr roark hes no architect hes no good why should i be afraid to say that hes no good why are you all afraid of him mr keating if youre not well and wish to be dismissed keating looked at him as if awakening he tried to control himself after a while he said his voice flat resigned no im all right ill tell you anything you want what is it you want me to say will you tell us in professional terms your opinion of the structure known as the stoddard temple yes sure the stoddard temple the stoddard temple has an improperly articulated plan which leads to spatial confusion there is no balance of masses it lacks a sense of symmetry its proportions are inept he spoke in a monotone his neck was stiff he was making an effort not to let it drop forward its out of scale it contradicts the elementary principles of composition the total effect is that of louder please mr keating the total effect is that of crudeness and architectural illiteracy it shows it shows no sense of structure no instinct for beauty no creative imagination no he closed his eyes artistic integrity thank you mr keating that is all the attorney turned to roark and said nervously your witness no questions said roark this concluded the first day of the trial that evening mallory heller mike enright and lansing gathered in roarks room they had not consulted one another but they all came prompted by the same feeling they did not talk about the trial but there was no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject roark sat on his drafting table and talked to them about the future of the plastics industry mallory laughed aloud suddenly without apparent reason whats the matter steve roark asked i just thought howard we all came here to help you to cheer you up but its you whore helping us instead youre supporting your supporters howard that evening peter keating lay halfstretched across a table in a speakeasy one arm extending along the table top his face on his arm in the next two days a succession of witnesses testified for the plaintiff every examination began with questions that brought out the professional achievements of the witness the attorney gave them leads like an expert press agent austen heller remarked that architects must have fought for the privilege of being called to the witness stand since it was the grandest spree of publicity in a usually silent profession none of the witnesses looked at roark he looked at them he listened to the testimony he said no questions to each one ralston holcombe on the stand with flowing tie and goldheaded cane had the appearance of a grand duke or a beergarden composer his testimony was long and scholarly but it came down to its all nonsense its all a lot of childish nonsense i cant say that i feel much sympathy for mr hopton stoddard he should have known better it is a scientific fact that the architectural style of the renaissance is the only one appropriate to our age if our best people like mr stoddard refuse to recognize this what can you expect from all sorts of parvenus wouldbe architects and the rabble in general it has been proved that renaissance is the only permissible style for all churches temples and cathedrals what about sir christopher wren just laugh that off and remember the greatest religious monument of all time st peters in rome are you going to improve upon st peters and if mr stoddard did not specifically insist on renaissance he got just exactly what he deserved it serves him jolly well right gordon l prescott wore a turtleneck sweater under a plaid coat tweed trousers and heavy golf shoes the correlation of the transcendental to the purely spatial in the building under discussion is entirely screwy he said if we take the horizontal as the onedimensional the vertical as the twodimensional the diagonal as the threedimensional and the interpenetration of spaces as the fourthdimensional architecture being a fourthdimensional art we can see quite simply that this building is homaloidal or in the language of the layman flat the flowing life which comes from the sense of order in chaos or if you prefer from unity in diversity as well as vice versa which is the realization of the contradiction inherent in architecture is here absolutely absent i am really trying to express myself as clearly as i can but it is impossible to present a dialectic state by covering it up with an old fig leaf of logic just for the sake of the mentally lazy layman john erik snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed roark in his office that roark had been an unreliable disloyal and unscrupulous employee and that roark had started his career by stealing a client from him on the fourth day of the trial the plaintiffs attorney called his last witness miss dominique francon he announced solemnly mallory gasped but no one heard it mikes hand clamped down on his wrist and made him keep still the attorney had reserved dominique for his climax partly because he expected a great deal from her and partly because he was worried she was the only unrehearsed witness she had refused to be coached she had never mentioned the stoddard temple in her column but he had looked up her earlier writings on roark and ellsworth toohey had advised him to call her dominique stood for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand looking slowly over the crowd her beauty was startling but too impersonal as if it did not belong to her it seemed present in the room as a separate entity people thought of a vision that had not quite appeared of a victim on a scaffold of a person standing at night at the rail of an ocean liner what is your name dominique francon and your occupation miss francon newspaper woman you are the author of the brilliant column your house appearing in the new york banner i am the author of your house your father is guy francon the eminent architect yes my father was asked to come here to testify he refused he said he did not care for a building such as the stoddard temple but he did not think that we were behaving like gentlemen well now miss francon shall we confine our answers to our questions we are indeed fortunate to have you with us since you are our only woman witness and women have always had the purest sense of religious faith being in addition an outstanding authority on architecture you are eminently qualified to give us what i shall call with all deference the feminine angle on this case will you tell us in your own words what you think of the stoddard temple i think that mr stoddard has made a mistake there would have been no doubt about the justice of his case if he had sued not for alteration costs but for demolition costs the attorney looked relieved will you explain your reasons miss francon you have heard them from every witness at this trial then i take it that you agree with the preceding testimony completely even more completely than the persons who testified they were very convincing witnesses will you clarify that miss francon just what do you mean what mr toohey said that this temple is a threat to all of us oh i see mr toohey understood the issue so well shall i clarify it in my own words by all means howard roark built a temple to the human spirit he saw man as strong proud clean wise and fearless he saw man as a heroic being and he built a temple to that a temple is a place where man is to experience exaltation he thought that exaltation comes from the consciousness of being guiltless of seeing the truth and achieving it of living up to ones highest possibility of knowing no shame and having no cause for shame of being able to stand naked in full sunlight he thought that exaltation means joy and that joy is mans birthright he thought that a place built as a setting for man is a sacred place that is what howard roark thought of man and of exaltation but ellsworth toohey said that this temple was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity ellsworth toohey said that the essence of exaltation was to be scared out of your wits to fall down and to grovel ellsworth toohey said that mans highest act was to realize his own worthlessness and to beg forgiveness ellsworth toohey said it was depraved not to take for granted that man is something which needs to be forgiven ellsworth toohey saw that this building was of man and of the earth and ellsworth toohey said that this building had its belly in the mud to glorify man said ellsworth toohey was to glorify the gross pleasure of the flesh for the realm of the spirit is beyond the grasp of man to enter that realm said ellsworth toohey man must come as a beggar on his knees ellsworth toohey is a lover of mankind miss francon we are not really discussing mr toohey so if you will confine yourself to i do not condemn ellsworth toohey i condemn howard roark a building they say must be part of its site in what kind of world did roark build his temple for what kind of men look around you can you see a shrine becoming sacred by serving as a setting for mr hopton stoddard for mr ralston holcombe for mr peter keating when you look at them all do you hate ellsworth toohey or do you damn howard roark for the unspeakable indignity which he did commit ellsworth toohey is right that temple is a sacrilege though not in the sense he meant i think mr toohey knows that however when you see a man casting pearls without getting even a pork chop in return it is not against the swine that you feel indignation it is against the man who valued his pearls so little that he was willing to fling them into the muck and to let them become the occasion for a whole concert of grunting transcribed by the court stenographer miss francon i hardly think that this line of testimony is relevant or admissible the witness must be allowed to testify the judge declared unexpectedly he had been bored and he liked to watch dominiques figure besides he knew that the audience was enjoying it in the sheer excitement of scandal even though their sympathies were with hopton stoddard your honor some misunderstanding seems to have occurred said the attorney miss francon for whom are you testifying for mr roark or mr stoddard for mr stoddard of course i am stating the reasons why mr stoddard should win this case i have sworn to tell the truth proceed said the judge all the witnesses have told the truth but not the whole truth i am merely filling in the omissions they spoke of a threat and of hatred they were right the stoddard temple is a threat to many things if it were allowed to exist nobody would dare to look at himself in the mirror and that is a cruel thing to do to men ask anything of men ask them to achieve wealth fame love brutality murder selfsacrifice but dont ask them to achieve selfrespect they will hate your soul well they know best they must have their reasons they wont say of course that they hate you they will say that you hate them its near enough i suppose they know the emotion involved such are men as they are so what is the use of being a martyr to the impossible what is the use of building for a world that does not exist your honor i dont see what possible bearing this can have on i am proving your case for you i am proving why you must go with ellsworth toohey as you will anyway the stoddard temple must be destroyed not to save men from it but to save it from men whats the difference however mr stoddard wins i am in full agreement with everything thats being done here except for one point i didnt think we should be allowed to get away with that point let us destroy but dont let us pretend that we are committing an act of virtue let us say that we are moles and we object to mountain peaks or perhaps that we are lemmings the animals who cannot help swimming out to selfdestruction i realize fully that at this moment i am as futile as howard roark this is my stoddard temple my first and my last she inclined her head to the judge that is all your honor your witness the attorney snapped to roark no questions said roark dominique left the stand the attorney bowed to the bench and said the plaintiff rests the judge turned to roark and made a vague gesture inviting him to proceed roark got up and walked to the bench the brown envelope in hand he took out of the envelope ten photographs of the stoddard temple and laid them on the judges desk he said the defense rests hopton stoddard won the suit ellsworth toohey wrote in his column mr roark pulled a phryne in court and didnt get away with it we never believed that story in the first place roark was instructed to pay the costs of the temples alterations he said that he would not appeal the case hopton stoddard announced that the temple would be remodeled into the hopton stoddard home for subnormal children on the day after the end of the trial alvah scarret gasped when he glanced at the proofs of your house delivered to his desk the column contained most of dominiques testimony in court her testimony had been quoted in the newspaper accounts of the case but only in harmless excerpts alvah scarret hurried to dominiques office darling darling darling he said we cant print that she looked at him blankly and said nothing dominique sweetheart be reasonable quite apart from some of the language you use and some of your utterly unprintable ideas you know very well the stand this paper has taken on the case you know the campaign weve conducted youve read my editorial this morning a victory for decency we cant have one writer running against our whole policy youll have to print it but sweetheart or ill have to quit oh go on go on go on dont be silly now dont get ridiculous you know better than that we cant get along without you we cant youll have to choose alvah scarret knew that he would get hell from gail wynand if he printed the thing and might get hell if he lost dominique francon whose column was popular wynand had not returned from his cruise scarret cabled him in bali explaining the situation within a few hours scarret received an answer it was in wynands private code translated it read fire the bitch gw scarret stared at the cable crushed it was an order that allowed no alternative even if dominique surrendered he hoped she would resign he could not face the thought of having to fire her through an office boy whom he had recommended for the job toohey obtained the decoded copy of wynands cable he put it in his pocket and went to dominiques office he had not seen her since the trial he found her engaged in emptying the drawers of her desk hello he said curtly what are you doing waiting to hear from alvah scarret meaning waiting to hear whether ill have to resign feel like talking about the trial no i do i think i owe you the courtesy of admitting that youve done what no one has ever done before you proved me wrong he spoke coldly his face looked flat his eyes had no trace of kindness i had not expected you to do what you did on the stand it was a scurvy trick though up to your usual standard i simply miscalculated the direction of your malice however you did have the good sense to admit that your act was futile of course you made your point and mine as a token of appreciation i have a present for you he laid the cable on her desk she read it and stood holding it in her hand you cant even resign my dear he said you cant make that sacrifice to your pearlcasting hero remembering that you attach such great importance to not being beaten except by your own hand i thought you would enjoy this she folded the cable and slipped it into her purse thank you ellsworth if youre going to fight me my dear it will take more than speeches havent i always yes yes of course you have quite right youre correcting me again you have always fought me and the only time you broke down and screamed for mercy was on that witness stand thats right thats where i miscalculated yes he bowed formally and left the room she made a package of the things she wanted to take home then she went to scarrets office she showed him the cable in her hand but she did not give it to him okay alvah she said dominique i couldnt help it i couldnt help it it was how the hell did you get that its all right alvah no i wont give it back to you i want to keep it she put the cable back in her bag mail me my check and anything else that has to be discussed you you were going to resign anyway werent you yes i was but i like it better being fired dominique if you knew how awful i feel about it i cant believe it i simply cant believe it so you people made a martyr out of me after all and that is the one thing ive tried all my life not to be its so graceless being a martyr its honoring your adversaries too much but ill tell you this alvah ill tell it to you because i couldnt find a less appropriate person to hear it nothing that you do to me or to him will be worse than what ill do myself if you think i cant take the stoddard temple wait till you see what i can take on an evening three days after the trial ellsworth toohey sat in his room listening to the radio he did not feel like working and he allowed himself a rest relaxing luxuriously in an armchair letting his fingers follow the rhythm of a complicated symphony he heard a knock at his door coome in he drawled catherine came in she glanced at the radio by way of apology for her entrance i knew you werent working uncle ellsworth i want to speak to you she stood slumped her body thin and curveless she wore a skirt of expensive tweed unpressed she had smeared some makeup on her face the skin showed lifeless under the patches of powder at twentysix she looked like a woman trying to hide the fact of being over thirty in the last few years with her uncles help she had become an able social worker she held a paid job in a settlement house she had a small bank account of her own she took her friends out to lunch older women of her profession and they talked about the problems of unwed mothers selfexpression for the children of the poor and the evils of industrial corporations in the last few years toohey seemed to have forgotten her existence but he knew that she was enormously aware of him in her silent selfeffacing way he was seldom first to speak to her but she came to him continuously for minor advice she was like a small motor running on his energy and she had to stop for refueling once in a while she would not go to the theater without consulting him about the play she would not attend a lecture course without asking his opinion once she developed a friendship with a girl who was intelligent capable gay and loved the poor though a social worker toohey did not approve of the girl catherine dropped her when she needed advice she asked for it briefly in passing anxious not to delay him between the courses of a meal at the elevator door on his way out in the living room when some important broadcast stopped for station identification she made it a point to show that she would presume to claim nothing but the waste scraps of his time so toohey looked at her surprised when she entered his study he said certainly pet im not busy im never too busy for you anyway turn the thing down a bit will you she softened the volume of the radio and she slumped down in an armchair facing him her movements were awkward and contradictory like an adolescents she had lost the habit of moving with assurance and yet at times a gesture a jerk of her head would show a dry overbearing impatience which she was beginning to develop she looked at her uncle behind her glasses her eyes were still and tense but unrevealing she said what have you been doing uncle ellsworth i saw something in the papers about winning some big lawsuit that you were connected with i was glad i havent read the papers for months ive been so busy no thats not quite true ive had the time but when i came home i just couldnt make myself do anything i just fell in bed and went to sleep uncle ellsworth do people sleep a lot because theyre tired or because they want to escape from something now my dear this doesnt sound like you at all none of it she shook her head helplessly i know what is the matter she said looking at the toes of her shoes her lips moving with effort i guess im no good uncle ellsworth she raised her eyes to him im so terribly unhappy he looked at her silently his face earnest his eyes gentle she whispered you understand he nodded youre not angry at me you dont despise me my dear how could i i didnt want to say it not even to myself its not just tonight its for a long time back just let me say everything dont be shocked ive got to tell it its like going to confession as i used to oh dont think im returning to that i know religion is only a a device of class exploitation dont think id let you down after you explained it all so well i dont miss going to church but its just its just that ive got to have somebody listen katie darling first of all why are you so frightened you mustnt be certainly not of speaking to me just relax be yourself and tell me what happened she looked at him gratefully youre so sensitive uncle ellsworth thats one thing i didnt want to say but you guessed i am frightened because well you see you just said be yourself and what im afraid of most is of being myself because im vicious he laughed not offensively but warmly the sound destroying her statement but she did not smile no uncle ellsworth its true ill try to explain you see always since i was a child i wanted to do right i used to think everybody did but now i dont think so some people try their best even if they do make mistakes and others just dont care ive always cared i took it very seriously of course i knew that im not a brilliant person and that its a very big subject good and evil but i felt that whatever is the good as much as it would be possible for me to know i would do my honest best to live up to it which is all anybody can try isnt it this probably sounds terribly childish to you no katie it doesnt go on my dear well to begin with i knew that it was evil to be selfish that much i was sure of so i tried never to demand anything for myself when peter would disappear for months no i dont think you approve of that of what my dear of peter and me so i wont talk about that its not important anyway well you can see why i was so happy when i came to live with you youre as close to the ideal of unselfishness as anyone can be i tried to follow you the best i could thats how i chose the work im doing you never actually said that i should choose it but i came to feel that you thought so dont ask me how i came to feel it it was nothing tangible just little things you said i felt very confident when i started i knew that unhappiness comes from selfishness and that one can find true happiness only in dedicating oneself to others you said that so many people have said that why all the greatest men in history have been saying that for centuries and well look at me his face remained motionless for a moment then he smiled gaily and said whats wrong with you pet apart from the fact that your stockings dont match and that you could be more careful about your makeup dont laugh uncle ellsworth please dont laugh i know you say we must be able to laugh at everything particularly at ourselves only i cant i wont laugh katie but what is the matter im unhappy im unhappy in such a horrible nasty undignified way in a way that seems unclean and dishonest i go for days afraid to think to look at myself and thats wrong its becoming a hypocrite i always wanted to be honest with myself but im not im not im not hold on my dear dont shout the neighbors will hear you she brushed the back of her hand against her forehead she shook her head she whispered im sorry ill be all right just why are you unhappy my dear i dont know i cant understand it for instance it was i who arranged to have the classes in prenatal care down at the clifford house it was my idea i raised the money i found the teacher the classes are doing very well i tell myself that i should be happy about it but im not it doesnt seem to make any difference to me i sit down and i tell myself it was you who arranged to have marie gonzales baby adopted into a nice family now be happy but im not i feel nothing when im honest with myself i know that the only emotion ive felt for years is being tired not physically tired just tired its as if as if there were nobody there to feel any more she took off her glasses as if the double barrier of her glasses and his prevented her from reaching him she spoke her voice lower the words coming with greater effort but thats not all theres something much worse its doing something horrible to me im beginning to hate people uncle ellsworth im beginning to be cruel and mean and petty in a way ive never been before i expect people to be grateful to me i i demand gratitude i find myself pleased when slum people bow and scrape and fawn over me i find myself liking only those who are servile once once i told a woman that she didnt appreciate what people like us did for trash like her i cried for hours afterward i was so ashamed i begin to resent it when people argue with me i feel that they have no right to minds of their own that i know best that im the final authority for them there was a girl we were worried about because she was running around with a very handsome boy who had a bad reputation i tortured her for weeks about it telling her how hed get her in trouble and that she should drop him well they got married and theyre the happiest couple in the district do you think im glad no im furious and im barely civil to the girl when i meet her then there was a girl who needed a job desperately it was really a ghastly situation in her home and i promised that id get her one before i could find it she got a good job all by herself i wasnt pleased i was sore as hell that somebody got out of a bad hole without my help yesterday i was speaking to a boy who wanted to go to college and i was discouraging him telling him to get a good job instead i was quite angry too and suddenly i realized that it was because i had wanted so much to go to college you remember you wouldnt let me and so i wasnt going to let that kid do it either uncle ellsworth dont you see im becoming selfish im becoming selfish in a way thats much more horrible than if i were some petty chiseler pinching pennies off these peoples wages in a sweatshop he asked quietly is that all she closed her eyes and then she said looking down at her hands yes except that im not the only one whos like that a lot of them are most of the women i work with i dont know how they got that way i dont know how it happened to me i used to feel happy when i helped somebody i remember once i had lunch with peter that day and on my way back i saw an old organgrinder and i gave him five dollars i had in my bag it was all the money i had id saved it to buy a bottle of christmas night i wanted christmas night very badly but afterward every time i thought of that organgrinder i was happy i saw peter often in those days id come home after seeing him and id want to kiss every ragged kid on our block i think i hate the poor now i think all the other women do too but the poor dont hate us as they should they only despise us you know its funny its the masters who despise the slaves and the slaves who hate the masters i dont know who is which maybe it doesnt fit here maybe it does i dont know she raised her head with a last spurt of rebellion dont you see what it is that i must understand why is it that i set out honestly to do what i thought was right and its making me rotten i think its probably because im vicious by nature and incapable of leading a good life that seems to be the only explanation but but sometimes i think it doesnt make sense that a human being is completely sincere in good will and yet the good is not for him to achieve i cant be as rotten as that but but ive given up everything i have no selfish desire left i have nothing of my own and im miserable and so are the other women like me and i dont know a single selfless person in the world whos happy except you she dropped her head and she did not raise it again she seemed indifferent even to the answer she was seeking katie he said softly reproachfully katie darling she waited silently do you really want me to tell you the answer she nodded because you know youve given the answer yourself in the things you said she lifted her eyes blankly what have you been talking about what have you been complaining about about the fact that you are unhappy about katie halsey and nothing else it was the most egotistical speech ive ever heard in my life she blinked attentively like a schoolchild disturbed by a difficult lesson dont you see how selfish you have been you chose a noble career not for the good you could accomplish but for the personal happiness you expected to find in it but i really wanted to help people because you thought youd be good and virtuous doing it why yes because i thought it was right is it vicious to want to do right yes if its your chief concern dont you see how egotistical it is to hell with everybody so long as im virtuous but if you have no no selfrespect how can you be anything why must you be anything she spread her hands out bewildered if your first concern is for what you are or think or feel or have or havent got youre still a common egotist but i cant jump out of my own body no but you can jump out of your narrow soul you mean i must want to be unhappy no you must stop wanting anything you must forget how important miss catherine halsey is because you see she isnt men are important only in relation to other men in their usefulness in the service they render unless you understand that completely you can expect nothing but one form of misery or another why make such a cosmic tragedy out of the fact that youve found yourself feeling cruel toward people so what its just growing pains one cant jump from a state of animal brutality into a state of spiritual living without certain transitions and some of them may seem evil a beautiful woman is usually a gawky adolescent first all growth demands destruction you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you must be willing to suffer to be cruel to be dishonest to be unclean anything my dear anything to kill the most stubborn of roots the ego and only when it is dead when you care no longer when you have lost your identity and forgotten the name of your soul only then will you know the kind of happiness i spoke about and the gates of spiritual grandeur will fall open before you but uncle ellsworth she whispered when the gates fall open who is it thats going to enter he laughed aloud crisply it sounded like a laugh of appreciation my dear he said i never thought you could surprise me then his face became earnest again it was a smart crack katie but you know i hope that it was only a smart crack yes she said uncertainly i suppose so still we cant be too literal when we deal in abstractions of course its you wholl enter you wont have lost your identity you will merely have acquired a broader one an identity that will be part of everybody else and of the whole universe how in what way part of what now you see how difficult it is to discuss these things when our entire language is the language of individualism with all its terms and superstitions identity its an illusion you know but you cant build a new house out of crumbling old bricks you cant expect to understand me completely through the medium of presentday conceptions we are poisoned by the superstition of the ego we cannot know what will be right or wrong in a selfless society nor what well feel nor in what manner we must destroy the ego first that is why the mind is so unreliable we must not think we must believe believe katie even if your mind objects dont think believe trust your heart not your brain dont think feel believe she sat still composed but somehow she looked like something run over by a tank she whispered obediently yes uncle ellsworth i i didnt think of it that way i mean i always thought that i must think but youre right that is if right is the word i mean if there is a word yes i will believe ill try to understand no not to understand to feel to believe i mean only im so weak i always feel so small after talking to you i suppose i was right in a way i am worthless but it doesnt matter it doesnt matter when the doorbell rang on the following evening toohey went to open the door himself he smiled when he admitted peter keating after the trial he had expected keating to come to him he knew that keating would need to come but he had expected him sooner keating walked in uncertainly his hands seemed too heavy for his wrists his eyes were puffed and the skin of his face looked slack hello peter said toohey brightly want to see me come right in just your luck i have the whole evening free no said keating i want to see katie he was not looking at toohey and he did not see the expression behind tooheys glasses katie but of course said toohey gaily you know youve never come here to call on katie so it didnt occur to me but go right in i believe shes home this way you dont know her room second door keating shuffled heavily down the hall knocked on catherines door and went in when she answered toohey stood looking after him his face thoughtful catherine jumped to her feet when she saw her guest she stood stupidly incredulously for a moment then she dashed to her bed to snatch a girdle she had left lying there and stuff it hurriedly under the pillow then she jerked off her glasses closed her whole fist over them and slipped them into her pocket she wondered which would be worse to remain as she was or to sit down at her dressing table and make up her face in his presence she had not seen keating for six months in the last three years they had met occasionally at long intervals they had had a few luncheons together a few dinners they had gone to the movies twice they had always met in a public place since the beginning of his acquaintance with toohey keating would not come to see her at her home when they met they talked as if nothing had changed but they had not spoken of marriage for a long time hello katie said keating softly i didnt know you wore glasses now its just its only for reading i hello peter i guess i look terrible tonight im glad to see you peter he sat down heavily his hat in his hand his overcoat on she stood smiling helplessly then she made a vague circular motion with her hands and asked is it just for a little while or or do you want to take your coat off no its not just for a little while he got up threw his coat and hat on the bed then he smiled for the first time and asked or are you busy and want to throw me out she pressed the heels of her hands against her eye sockets and dropped her hands again quickly she had to meet him as she had always met him she had to sound light and normal no no fin not busy at all he sat down and stretched out his arm in silent invitation she came to him promptly she put her hand in his and he pulled her down to the arm of his chair the lamplight fell on him and she had recovered enough to notice the appearance of his face peter she gasped what have you been doing to yourself you look awful drinking not like that like that but its over now what was it i wanted to see you katie i wanted to see you darling what have they done to you nobodys done anything to me im all right now im all right because i came here katie have you ever heard of hopton stoddard stoddard i dont know ive seen the name somewhere well never mind it doesnt matter i was only thinking how strange it is you see stoddards an old bastard who just couldnt take his own rottenness any more so to make up for it he built a big present to the city but when i when i couldnt take any more i felt that the only way i could make up for it was by doing the thing i really wanted to do most by coming here when you couldnt take what peter ive done something very dirty katie ill tell you about it some day but not now look will you say that you forgive me without asking what it is ill think ill think that ive been forgiven by someone who can never forgive me someone who cant be hurt and so cant forgive but that makes it worse for me she did not seem perplexed she said earnestly i forgive you peter he nodded his head slowly several times and said thank you then she pressed her head to his and she whispered youve gone through hell havent you yes but its all right now he pulled her into his arms and kissed her then he did not think of the stoddard temple any longer and she did not think of good and evil they did not need to they felt too clean katie why havent we married i dont know she said and added hastily saying it only because her heart was pounding because she could not remain silent and because she felt called upon not to take advantage of him i guess its because we knew we dont have to hurry but we do if were not too late already peter you youre not proposing to me again dont look stunned katie if you do ill know that youve doubted it all these years and i couldnt stand to think that just now thats what i came here to tell you tonight were going to get married were going to get married right away yes peter we dont need announcements dates preparations guests any of it weve let one of those things or another stop us every time i honestly dont know just how it happened that weve let it all drift like that we wont say anything to anyone well just slip out of town and get married well announce and explain afterward if anyone wants explanations and that means your uncle and my mother and everybody yes peter quit your damn job tomorrow ill make arrangements at the office to take a month off guy will be sore as hell ill enjoy that get your things ready you wont need much dont bother about the makeup by the way did you say you looked terrible tonight youve never looked lovelier ill be here at nine oclock in the morning day after tomorrow you must be ready to start then yes peter after he had gone she lay on her bed sobbing aloud without restraint without dignity without a care in the world ellsworth toohey had left the door of his study open he had seen keating pass by the door without noticing it and go out then he heard the sound of catherines sobs he walked to her room and entered without knocking he asked whats the matter my dear has peter done something to hurt you she half lifted herself on the bed she looked at him throwing her hair back off her face sobbing exultantly she said without thinking the first thing she felt like saying she said something which she did not understand but he did im not afraid of you uncle ellsworth who gasped keating miss dominique francon the maid repeated youre drunk you damn fool mr keating he was on his feet he shoved her out of the way he flew into the living room and saw dominique francon standing there in his apartment hello peter dominique dominique how come in his anger apprehension curiosity and flattered pleasure his first conscious thought was gratitude to god that his mother was not at home i phoned your office they said you had gone home im so delighted so pleasantly sur oh hell dominique whats the use i always try to be correct with you and you always see through it so well that its perfectly pointless so i wont play the poised host you know that im knocked silly and that your coming here isnt natural and anything i say will probably be wrong yes thats better peter he noticed that he still held a key in his hand and he slipped it into his pocket he had been packing a suitcase for his wedding trip of tomorrow he glanced at the room and noted angrily how vulgar his victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of dominiques figure she wore a gray suit a black fur jacket with a collar raised to her cheeks and a hat slanting down she did not look as she had looked on the witness stand nor as he remembered her at dinner parties he thought suddenly of that moment years ago when he stood on the stair landing outside guy francons office and wished never to see dominique again she was what she had been then a stranger who frightened him by the crystal emptiness of her face well sit down dominique take your coat off no i shant stay long since were not pretending anything today shall i tell you what i came for or do you want some polite conversation first no i dont want polite conversation all right will you marry me peter he stood very still then he sat down heavily because he knew she meant it if you want to marry me she went on in the same precise impersonal voice you must do it right now my car is downstairs we drive to connecticut and we come back it will take about three hours dominique he didnt want to move his lips beyond the effort of her name he wanted to think that he was paralyzed he knew that he was violently alive that he was forcing the stupor into his muscles and into his mind because he wished to escape the responsibility of consciousness were not pretending peter usually people discuss their reasons and their feelings first then make the practical arrangements with us this is the only way if i offered it to you in any other form id be cheating you it must be like this no questions no conditions no explanations what we dont say answers itself by not being said there is nothing for you to ponder only whether you want to do it or not dominique he spoke with the concentration he used when he walked down a naked girder in an unfinished building i understand only this much i understand that i must try to imitate you not to discuss it not to talk just answer yes only i cant quite this is one time peter when there are no protections nothing to hide behind not even words if youd just say one thing no if youd give me time no either we go downstairs together now or we forget it you mustnt resent it if i youve never allowed me to hope that you could that you no no i wont say it but what can you expect me to think im here alone and and im the only one present to give you advice my advice is to refuse im honest with you peter but i wont help you by withdrawing the offer you would prefer not to have had the chance of marrying me but you have the chance now the choice will be yours then he could not hold on to his dignity any longer he let his head drop he pressed his fist to his forehead dominique why you know the reasons i told them to you once long ago if you havent the courage to think of them dont expect me to repeat them he sat still his head down then he said dominique two people like you and me getting married its almost a frontpage event yes wouldnt it be better to do it properly with an announcement and a real wedding ceremony im strong peter but im not that strong you can have your receptions and your publicity afterward you dont want me to say anything now except yes or no thats all he sat looking up at her for a long time her glance was on his eyes but it had no more reality than the glance of a portrait he felt alone in the room she stood patient waiting granting him nothing not even the kindness of prompting him to hurry all right dominique yes he said at last she inclined her head gravely in acquiescence he stood up ill get my coat he said do you want to take your car yes its an open car isnt it should i wear my fur coat no take a warm muffler though theres a little wind no luggage were coming right back to the city were coming right back he left the door to the hall open and she saw him putting on his coat throwing a muffler around his throat with the gesture of flinging a cape over his shoulder he stepped to the door of the living room hat in hand and invited her to go with a silent movement of his head in the hall outside he pressed the button of the elevator and he stepped back to let her enter first he was precise sure of himself without joy without emotion he seemed more coldly masculine than he had ever been before he took her elbow firmly protectively to cross the street where she had left her car he opened the cars door let her slide behind the wheel and got in silently beside her she leaned over across him and adjusted the glass wind screen on his side she said if its not right fix it any way you want when we start moving so it wont be too cold for you he said get to the grand concourse fewer lights there she put her handbag down on his lap while she took the wheel and started the car there was suddenly no antagonism between them but a quiet hopeless feeling of comradeship as if they were victims of the same impersonal disaster who had to help each other she drove fast as a matter of habit an even speed without a sense of haste they sat silently to the level drone of the motor and they sat patiently without shifting the positions of their bodies when the car stopped for a light they seemed caught in a single streak of motion an imperative direction like the flight of a bullet that could not be stopped on its course there was a first hint of twilight in the streets of the city the pavements looked yellow the shops were still open a movie theater had lighted its sign and the red bulbs whirled jerkily sucking the last daylight out of the air making the street look darker peter keating felt no need of speech he did not seem to be peter keating any longer he did not ask for warmth and he did not ask for pity he asked nothing she thought of that once and she glanced at him a glance of appreciation that was almost gentle he met her eyes steadily she saw understanding but no comment it was as if his glance said of course nothing else they were out of the city with a cold brown road flying to meet them when he said the traffic cops are bad around here got your press card with you just in case im not the press any longer youre not what im not a newspaper woman any more you quit your job no i was fired what are you talking about where have you been the last few days i thought everybody knew it sorry i didnt follow things very well the last few days miles later she said give me a cigarette in my bag he opened her bag and he saw her cigarette case her compact her lipstick her comb a folded handkerchief too white to touch smelling faintly of her perfume somewhere within him he thought that this was almost like unbuttoning her blouse but most of him was not conscious of the thought nor of the intimate proprietorship with which he opened the bag he took a cigarette from her case lighted it and put it from his lips to hers thanks she said he lighted one for himself and closed the bag when they reached greenwich it was he who made the inquiries told her where to drive at what block to turn and said here it is when they pulled up in front of the judges house he got out first and helped her out of the car he pressed the button of the doorbell they were married in a living room that displayed armchairs of faded tapestry blue and purple and a lamp with a fringe of glass beads the witnesses were the judges wife and someone from next door named chuck who had been interrupted at some household task and smelled faintly of clorox then they came back to their car and keating asked want me to drive if youre tired she said no ill drive the road to the city cut through brown fields where every rise in the ground had a shade of tired red on the side facing west there was a purple haze eating away the edges of the fields and a motionless streak of fire in the sky a few cars came toward them as brown shapes still visible others had their lights on two disquieting spots of yellow keating watched the road it looked narrow a small dash in the middle of the windshield framed by earth and hills all of it held within the rectangle of glass before him but the road spread as the windshield flew forward the road filled the glass it ran over the edges it tore apart to let them pass streaming in two gray bands on either side of the car he thought it was a race and he waited to see the windshield win to see the car hurtle into that small dash before it had time to stretch where are we going to live now at first he asked your place or mine yours of course id rather move to yours no im closing my place you cant possibly like my apartment why not i dont know it doesnt fit you ill like it they were silent for a while then he asked how are we going to announce this now in any way you wish ill leave it up to you it was growing darker and she switched on the cars headlights he watched the small blurs of traffic signs low by the side of the road springing suddenly into life as they approached spelling out left turn crossing ahead in dots of light that seemed conscious malevolent winking they drove silently but there was no bond in their silence now they were not walking together toward disaster the disaster had come their courage did not matter any longer he felt disturbed and uncertain as he always felt in the presence of dominique francon he half turned to look at her she kept her eyes on the road her profile in the cold wind was serene and remote and lovely in a way that was hard to bear he looked at her gloved hands resting firmly one on each side of the wheel he looked down at her slender foot on the accelerator then his eyes rose up the line of her leg his glance remained on the narrow triangle of her tight gray skirt he realized suddenly that he had a right to think what he was thinking for the first time this implication of marriage occurred to him fully and consciously then he knew that he had always wanted this woman that it was the kind of feeling he would have for a whore only lasting and hopeless and vicious my wife he thought for the first time without a trace of respect in the word he felt so violent a desire that had it been summer he would have ordered her to drive into the first side lane and he would have taken her there he slipped his arm along the back of the seat and encircled her shoulders his fingers barely touching her she did not move resist or turn to look at him he pulled his arm away and he sat staring straight ahead mrs keating he said flatly not addressing her just as a statement of fact mrs peter keating she said when they stopped in front of his apartment house he got out and held the door for her but she remained sitting behind the wheel good night peter she said ill see you tomorrow she added before the expression of his face had turned into an obscene swearword ill send my things over tomorrow and well discuss everything then everything will begin tomorrow peter where are you going i have things to settle but what will i tell people tonight anything you wish if at all she swung the car into the traffic and drove away when she entered roarks room that evening he smiled not his usual faint smile of acknowledging the expected but a smile that spoke of waiting and pain he had not seen her since the trial she had left the courtroom after her testimony and he had heard nothing from her since he had come to her house but her maid had told him that miss francon could not see him she looked at him now and she smiled it was for the first time like a gesture of complete acceptance as if the sight of him solved everything answered all questions and her meaning was only to be a woman who looked at him they stood silently before each other for a moment and she thought that the most beautiful words were those which were not needed when he moved she said dont say anything about the trial afterward when he took her in his arms she turned her body to meet his straight on to feel the width of his chest with the width of hers the length of his legs with the length of hers as if she were lying against him and her feet felt no weight and she was held upright by the pressure of his body they lay in bed together that night and they did not know when they slept the intervals of exhausted unconsciousness as intense an act of union as the convulsed meetings of their bodies in the morning when they were dressed she watched him move about the room she saw the drained relaxation of his movements she thought of what she had taken from him and the heaviness of her wrists told her that her own strength was now in his nerves as if they had exchanged their energy he was at the other end of the room his back turned to her for a moment when she said roark her voice quiet and low he turned to her as if he had expected it and perhaps guessed the rest she stood in the middle of the floor as she had stood on her first night in this room solemnly composed to the performance of a rite i love you roark she had said it for the first time she saw the reflection of her next words on his face before she had pronounced them i was married yesterday to peter keating it would have been easy if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound closing his fists and twisting them in defense against himself but it was not easy because she did not see him doing this yet knew that this was being done without the relief of a physical gesture roark she whispered gently frightened he said im all right then he said please wait a moment all right go on roark before i met you i had always been afraid of seeing someone like you because i knew that id also have to see what i saw on the witness stand and id have to do what i did in that courtroom i hated doing it because it was an insult to you to defend you and it was an insult to myself that you had to be defended roark i can accept anything except what seems to be the easiest for most people the halfway the almost the justabout the inbetween they may have their justifications i dont know i dont care to inquire i know that it is the one thing not given me to understand when i think of what you are i cant accept any reality except a world of your kind or at least a world in which you have a fighting chance and a fight on your own terms that does not exist and i cant live a life torn between that which exists and you it would mean to struggle against things and men who dont deserve to be your opponents your fight using their methods and thats too horrible a desecration it would mean doing for you what i did for peter keating lie flatter evade compromise pander to every ineptitude in order to beg of them a chance for you beg them to let you live to let you function to beg them roark not to laugh at them but to tremble because they hold the power to hurt you am i too weak because i cant do this i dont know which is the greater strength to accept all this for you or to love you so much that the rest is beyond acceptance i dont know i love you too much he looked at her waiting she knew that he had understood this long ago but that it had to be said youre not aware of them i am i cant help it i love you the contrast is too great roark you wont win theyll destroy you but i wont be there to see it happen i will have destroyed myself first thats the only gesture of protest open to me what else could i offer you the things people sacrifice are so little ill give you my marriage to peter keating ill refuse to permit myself happiness in their world ill take suffering that will be my answer to them and my gift to you i shall probably never see you again i shall try not to but i will live for you through every minute and every shameful act i take i will live for you in my own way in the only way i can he made a movement to speak and she said wait let me finish you could ask why not kill myself then because i love you because you exist that alone is so much that it wont allow me to die and since i must be alive in order to know that you are i will live in the world as it is in the manner of life it demands not halfway but completely not pleading and running from it but walking out to meet it beating it to the pain and the ugliness being first to choose the worst it can do to me not as the wife of some halfdecent human being but as the wife of peter keating and only within my own mind only where nothing can touch it kept sacred by the protecting wall of my own degradation there will be the thought of you and the knowledge of you and i shall say howard roark to myself once in a while and i shall feel that i have deserved to say it she stood before him her face raised her lips were not drawn but closed softly yet the shape of her mouth was too definite on her face a shape of pain and tenderness and resignation in his face she saw suffering that was made old as if it had been part of him for a long time because it was accepted and it looked not like a wound but like a scar dominique if i told you now to have that marriage annulled at once to forget the world and my struggle to feel no anger no concern no hope just to exist for me for my need of you as my wife as my property he saw in her face what she had seen in his when she told him of her marriage but he was not frightened and he watched it calmly after a while she answered and the words did not come from her lips but as if her lips were forced to gather the sounds from the outside id obey you now you see why i wont do it i wont try to stop you i love you dominique she closed her eyes and he said youd rather not hear it now but i want you to hear it we never need to say anything to each other when were together this is for the time when we wont be together i love you dominique as selfishly as the fact that i exist as selfishly as my lungs breathe air i breathe for my own necessity for the fuel of my body for my survival ive given you not my sacrifice or my pity but my ego and my naked need this is the only way you can wish to be loved this is the only way i can want you to love me if you married me now i would become your whole existence but i would not want you then you would not want yourself and so you would not love me long to say i love you one must know first how to say the i the kind of surrender i could have from you now would give me nothing but an empty hulk if i demanded it id destroy you thats why i wont stop you ill let you go to your husband i dont know how ill live through tonight but i will i want you whole as i am as youll remain in the battle youve chosen a battle is never selfless she heard in the measured tension of his words that it was harder for him to speak them than for her to listen so she listened you must learn not to be afraid of the world not to be held by it as you are now never to be hurt by it as you were in that courtroom i must let you learn it i cant help you you must find your own way when you have youll come back to me they wont destroy me dominique and they wont destroy you youll win because youve chosen the hardest way of fighting for your freedom from the world ill wait for you i love you im saying this now for all the years well have to wait i love you dominique then he kissed her and let her go at nine oclock that morning peter keating was pacing the floor of his room his door locked he forgot that it was nine oclock and that catherine was waiting for him he had made himself forget her and everything she implied the door of his room was locked to protect him from his mother last night seeing his furious restlessness she had forced him to tell her the truth he had snapped that he was married to dominique francon and he had added some sort of explanation about dominique going out of town to announce the marriage to some old relative his mother had been so busy with gasps of delight and questions that he had been able to answer nothing and to hide his panic he was not certain that he had a wife and that she would come back to him in the morning he had forbidden his mother to announce the news but she had made a few telephone calls last night and she was making a few more this morning and now their telephone was ringing constantly with eager voices asking is it true pouring out sounds of amazement and congratulations keating could see the news spreading through the city in widening circles by the names and social positions of the people who called he refused to answer the telephone it seemed to him that every corner of new york was flooded with celebration and that he alone hidden in the watertight caisson of his room was cold and lost and horrified it was almost noon when the doorbell rang and he pressed his hands to his ears not to know who it was and what they wanted then he heard his mothers voice so shrill with joy that it sounded embarrassingly silly petey darling dont you want to come out and kiss your wife he flew out into the hall and there was dominique removing her soft mink coat the fur throwing to his nostrils a wave of the streets cold air touched by her perfume she was smiling correctly looking straight at him saying good morning peter he stood drawn up for one instant and in that instant he relived all the telephone calls and felt the triumph to which they entitled him he moved as a man in the arena of a crowded stadium he smiled as if he felt the ray of an arc light playing in the creases of his smile and he said dominique my dear this is like a dream come true the dignity of their doomed understanding was gone and their marriage was what it had been intended to be she seemed glad of it she said sorry you didnt carry me over the threshold peter he did not kiss her but took her hand and kissed her arm above the wrist in casual intimate tenderness he saw his mother standing there and he said with a dashing gesture of triumph mother dominique keating he saw his mother kissing her dominique returned the kiss gravely mrs keating was gulping my dear im so happy so happy god bless you i had no idea you were so beautiful he did not know what to do next but dominique took charge simply leaving them no time for wonder she walked into the living room and she said lets have lunch first and then youll show me the place peter my things will be here in an hour or so mrs keating beamed lunch is all ready for three miss fran she stopped oh dear what am i to call you honey mrs keating or dominique of course dominique answered without smiling arent we going to announce to invite anyone to keating began but dominique said afterwards peter it will announce itself later when her luggage arrived he saw her walking into his bedroom without hesitation she instructed the maid how to hang up her clothes she asked him to help her rearrange the contents of the closets mrs keating looked puzzled but arent you children going to go away at all its all so sudden and romantic but no honeymoon of any kind no said dominique i dont want to take peter away from his work he said this is temporary of course dominique well have to move to another apartment a bigger one i want you to choose it why no she said i dont think thats necessary well remain here ill move out mrs keating offered generously without thinking prompted by an overwhelming fear of dominique ill take a little place for myself no said dominique id rather you wouldnt i want to change nothing i want to fit myself into peters life just as it is thats sweet of you mrs keating smiled while keating thought numbly that it was not sweet of her at all mrs keating knew that when she had recovered she would hate her daughterinlaw she could have accepted snubbing she could not forgive dominiques grave politeness the telephone rang keatings chief designer at the office delivered his congratulations and said we just heard it peter and guys pretty stunned i really think you ought to call him up or come over here or something keating hurried to the office glad to escape from his house for a while he entered the office like a perfect figure of a radiant young lover he laughed and shook hands in the drafting room through noisy congratulations gay shouts of envy and a few smutty references then he hastened to francons office for an instant he felt oddly guilty when he entered and saw the smile on francons face a smile like a blessing he tugged affectionately at francons shoulders and he muttered im so happy guy im so happy ive always expected it said francon quietly but now i feel right now its right that it should be all yours peter all of it this room everything soon what are you talking about come you always understand im tired peter you know there comes a time when you get tired in a way thats final and then no you wouldnt know youre too young but hell peter of what use am i around here the funny part of it is that i dont care any more even about pretending to be of any use i like to be honest sometimes its a nice sort of feeling well anyway it might be another year or two but then im going to retire then its all yours it might amuse me to hang on around here just a little longer you know i actually love the place its so busy its done so well people respect us it was a good firm francon heyer wasnt it what the hell am i saying francon keating then it will be just keating peter he asked softly why dont you look happy of course im happy im very grateful and all that but why in blazes should you think of retiring now i dont mean that i mean why dont you look happy when i say that it will be yours i id like you to be happy about that peter for gods sake guy youre being morbid youre peter its very important to me that you should be happy at what im leaving you that you should be proud of it and you are arent you peter you are well who wouldnt be he did not look at francon he could not stand the sound of pleading in francons voice yes who wouldnt be of course and you are peter what do you want snapped keating angrily i want you to feel proud of me peter said francon humbly simply desperately i want to know that ive accomplished something i want to feel that it had some meaning at the last summing up i want to be sure that it wasnt all for nothing youre not sure of that youre not sure keatings eyes were murderous as if francon were a sudden danger to him whats the matter peter francon asked gently almost indifferently god damn you you have no right not to be sure at your age with your name with your prestige with your i want to be sure peter ive worked very hard but youre not sure he was furious and frightened and so he wanted to hurt and he flung out the one thing that could hurt most forgetting that it hurt him not francon that francon wouldnt know had never known wouldnt even guess well i know somebody wholl be sure at the end of his life wholl be so goddamn sure id like to cut his damn throat for it who asked francon quietly without interest guy guy whats the matter with us what are we talking about i dont know said francon he looked tired that evening francon came to keatings house for dinner he was dressed jauntily and he twinkled with his old gallantry as he kissed mrs keatings hand but he looked grave when he congratulated dominique and he found little to say to her there was a pleading look in his eyes when he glanced up at her face instead of the bright cutting mockery he had expected from her he saw a sudden understanding she said nothing but bent down and kissed him on the forehead and held her lips pressed gently to his head a second longer than formality required he felt a warm flood of gratitude and then he felt frightened dominique he whispered the others could not hear him how terribly unhappy you must be she laughed gaily taking his arm why no father how can you say that forgive me he muttered im just stupid this is really wonderful guests kept coming in all evening uninvited and unannounced anyone who had heard the news and felt privileged to drop in keating did not know whether he was glad to see them or not it seemed all right so long as the gay confusion lasted dominique behaved exquisitely he did not catch a single hint of sarcasm in her manner it was late when the last guest departed and they were left alone among the filled ash trays and empty glasses they sat at opposite ends of the living room and keating tried to postpone the moment of thinking what he had to think now all right peter said dominique rising lets get it over with when he lay in the darkness beside her his desire satisfied and left hungrier than ever by the unmoving body that had not responded not even in revulsion when he felt defeated in the one act of mastery he had hoped to impose upon her his first whispered words were god damn you he heard no movement from her then he remembered the discovery which the moments of passion had wiped off his mind who was he he asked howard roark she answered all right he snapped you dont have to tell me if you dont want to he switched on the light he saw her lying still naked her head thrown back her face looked peaceful innocent clean she said to the ceiling her voice gentle peter if i could do this i can do anything now if you think im going to bother you often if thats your idea of as often or as seldom as you wish peter next morning entering the dining room for breakfast dominique found a florists box long and white resting across her plate whats that she asked the maid it was brought this morning madam with instructions to be put on the breakfast table the box was addressed to mrs peter keating dominique opened it it contained a few branches of white lilac more extravagantly luxurious than orchids at this time of the year there was a small card with a name written upon it in large letters that still held the quality of a hands dashing movement as if the letters were laughing on the pasteboard ellsworth m toohey how nice said keating i wondered why we hadnt heard from him at all yesterday please put them in water mary said dominique handing the box to the maid in the afternoon dominique telephoned toohey and invited him for dinner the dinner took place a few days later keatings mother had pleaded some previous engagement and escaped for the evening she explained it to herself by believing that she merely needed time to get used to things so there were only three places set on the diningroom table candles in crystal holders a centerpiece of blue flowers and glass bubbles when toohey entered he bowed to his hosts in a manner proper to a court reception dominique looked like a society hostess who had always been a society hostess and could not possibly be imagined as anything else well ellsworth well keating asked with a gesture that included the hall the air and dominique my dear peter said toohey lets skip the obvious dominique led the way into the living room she wore a dinner dress a white satin blouse tailored like a mans and a long black skirt straight and simple as the polished planes of her hair the narrow band of the skirt about her waistline seemed to state that two hands could encircle her waist completely or snap her figure in half without much effort the short sleeves left her arms bare and she wore a plain gold bracelet too large and heavy for her thin wrist she had an appearance of elegance become perversion an appearance of wise dangerous maturity achieved by looking like a very young girl ellsworth isnt it wonderful said keating watching dominique as one watches a fat bank account no less than i expected said toohey and no more at the dinner table keating did most of the talking he seemed possessed by a talking jag he turned over words with the sensuous abandon of a cat rolling in catnip actually ellsworth it was dominique who invited you i didnt ask her to youre our first formal guest i think thats wonderful my wife and my best friend ive always had the silly idea that you two didnt like each other god knows where i get those notions but this is what makes me so damn happy the three of us together then you dont believe in mathematics do you peter said toohey why the surprise certain figures in combination have to give certain results granting three entities such as dominique you and i this had to be the inevitable sum they say threes a crowd laughed keating but thats bosh two are better than one and sometimes three are better than two it all depends the only thing wrong with that old cliché said toohey is the erroneous implication that a crowd is a term of opprobrium it is quite the opposite as you are so merrily discovering three i might add is a mystic key number as for instance the holy trinity or the triangle without which we would have no movie industry there are so many variations upon the triangle not necessarily unhappy like the three of us with me serving as understudy for the hypotenuse quite an appropriate substitution since im replacing my antipode dont you think so dominique they were finishing dessert when keating was called to the telephone they could hear his impatient voice in the next room snapping instructions to a draftsman who was working late on a rush job and needed help toohey turned looked at dominique and smiled the smile said everything her manner had not allowed to be said earlier there was no visible movement on her face as she held his glance but there was a change of expression as if she were acknowledging his meaning instead of refusing to understand it he would have preferred the closed look of refusal the acceptance was infinitely more scornful so youve come back to the fold dominique yes ellsworth no more pleas for mercy does it appear as if they will be necessary no i admire you dominique how do you like it i should imagine peter is not bad though not as good as the man were both thinking of whos probably superlative but youll never have a chance to learn she did not look disgusted she looked genuinely puzzled what are you talking about ellsworth oh come my dear were past pretending now arent we youve been in love with roark from that first moment you saw him in kiki holcombes drawing room or shall i be honest you wanted to sleep with him but he wouldnt spit at you hence all your subsequent behavior is that what you thought she asked quietly wasnt it obvious the woman scorned as obvious as the fact that roark had to be the man youd want that youd want him in the most primitive way and that hed never know you existed i overestimated you ellsworth she said she had lost all interest in his presence even the need of caution she looked bored he frowned puzzled keating came back toohey slapped his shoulder as he passed by on the way to his seat before i go peter we must have a chat about the rebuilding of the stoddard temple i want you to bitch that up too ellsworth he gasped toohey laughed dont be stuffy peter just a little professional vulgarity dominique wont mind shes an exnewspaper woman whats the matter ellsworth dominique asked feeling pretty desperate the weapons arent up to your usual standard she rose shall we have coffee in the drawing room hopton stoddard added a generous sum to the award he had won from roark and the stoddard temple was rebuilt for its new purpose by a group of architects chosen by ellsworth toohey peter keating gordon l prescott john erik snyte and somebody named gus webb a boy of twentyfour who liked to utter obscenities when passing wellbred women on the street and who had never handled an architectural commission of his own three of these men had social and professional standing gus webb had none toohey included him for that reason of the four gus webb had the loudest voice and the greatest selfassurance gus webb said he was afraid of nothing he meant it they were all members of the council of american builders the council of american builders had grown after the stoddard trial many earnest discussions were held informally in the club rooms of the aga the attitude of the aga toward ellsworth toohey had not been cordial particularly since the establishment of his council but the trial brought a subtle change many members pointed out that the article in one small voice had actually brought about the stoddard lawsuit and that a man who could force clients to sue was a man to be treated with caution so it was suggested that ellsworth toohey should be invited to address the aga at one of its luncheons some members objected guy francon among them the most passionate objector was a young architect who made an eloquent speech his voice trembling with the embarrassment of speaking in public for the first time he said that he admired ellsworth toohey and had always agreed with tooheys social ideals but if a group of people felt that some person was acquiring power over them that was the time to fight such a person the majority overruled him ellsworth toohey was asked to speak at the luncheon the attendance was enormous and toohey made a witty gracious speech many members of the aga joined the council of american builders john erik snyte among the first the four architects in charge of the stoddard reconstruction met in keatings office around a table on which they spread blueprints of the temple photographs of roarks original drawings obtained from the contractor and a clay model which keating had ordered made they talked about the depression and its disastrous effect on the building industry they talked about women and gordon l prescott told a few jokes of a bathroom nature then gus webb raised his fist and smacked it plump upon the roof of the model which was not quite dry and spread into a flat mess well boys he said lets go to work gus you son of a bitch said keating the thing cost money balls said gus were not paying for it each of them had a set of photographs of the original sketches with the signature howard roark visible in the corner they spent many evenings and many weeks drawing their own versions right on the originals remaking and improving they took longer than necessary they made more changes than required they seemed to find pleasure in doing it afterward they put the four versions together and made a cooperative combination none of them had ever enjoyed a job quite so much they had long friendly conferences there were minor dissensions such as gus webb saying hell gordon if the kitchens going to be yours then the johnsve got to be mine but these were only surface ripples they felt a sense of unity and an anxious affection for one another the kind of brotherhood that makes a man withstand the third degree rather than squeal on the gang the stoddard temple was not torn down but its framework was carved into five floors containing dormitories schoolrooms infirmary kitchen laundry the entrance hall was paved with colored marble the stairways had railings of handwrought aluminum the shower stalls were glassenclosed the recreation rooms had goldleafed corinthian pilasters the huge windows were left untouched merely crossed by floorlines the four architects had decided to achieve an effect of harmony and therefore not to use any historical style in its pure form peter keating designed the white marble semidoric portico that rose over the main entrance and the venetian balconies for which new doors were cut john erik snyte designed the small semigothic spire surmounted by a cross and the bandcourses of stylized acanthus leaves which were cut into the limestone of the walls gordon l prescott designed the semirenaissance cornice and the glassenclosed terrace projecting from the third floor gus webb designed a cubistic ornament to frame the original windows and the modern neon sign on the roof which read the hopton stoddard home for subnormal children comes the revolution said gus webb looking at the completed structure and every kid in the country will have a home like that the original shape of the building remained discernible it was not like a corpse whose fragments had been mercifully scattered it was like a corpse hacked to pieces and reassembled in september the tenants of the home moved in a small expert staff was chosen by toohey it had been harder to find the children who qualified as inmates most of them had to be taken from other institutions sixtyfive children their ages ranging from three to fifteen were picked out by zealous ladies who were full of kindness and so made a point of rejecting those who could be cured and selecting only the hopeless cases there was a fifteenyearold boy who had never learned to speak a grinning child who could not be taught to read or write a girl born without a nose whose father was also her grandfather a person called jackie of whose age or sex nobody could be certain they marched into their new home their eyes staring vacantly the stare of death before which no world existed on warm evenings children from the slums nearby would sneak into the park of the stoddard home and gaze wistfully at the playrooms the gymnasium the kitchen beyond the big windows these children had filthy clothes and smudged faces agile little bodies impertinent grins and eyes bright with a roaring imperious demanding intelligence the ladies in charge of the home chased them away with angry exclamations about little gangsters once a month a delegation from the sponsors came to visit the home it was a distinguished group whose names were in many exclusive registers though no personal achievement had ever put them there it was a group of mink coats and diamond clips occasionally there was a dollar cigar and a glossy derby from a british shop among them ellsworth toohey was always present to show them through the home the inspection made the mink coats seem warmer and their wearers rights to them incontestable since it established superiority and altruistic virtue together in a demonstration more potent than a visit to a morgue on the way back from such an inspection ellsworth toohey received humbled compliments on the wonderful work he was doing and had no trouble in obtaining checks for his other humanitarian activities such as publications lecture courses radio forums and the workshop of social study catherine halsey was put in charge of the childrens occupational therapy and she moved into the home as a permanent resident she took up her work with a fierce zeal she spoke about it insistently to anyone who would listen her voice was dry and arbitrary when she spoke the movements of her mouth hid the two lines that had appeared recently cut from her nostrils to her chin people preferred her not to remove her glasses her eyes were not good to see she spoke belligerently about her work not being charity but human reclamation the most important time of her day was the hour assigned to the childrens art activities known as the creative period there was a special room for the purpose a room with a view of the distant city skyline where the children were given materials and encouraged to create freely under the guidance of catherine who stood watch over them like an angel presiding at a birth she was elated on the day when jackie the least promising one of the lot achieved a completed work of imagination jackie picked up fistfuls of colored felt scraps and a pot of glue and carried them to a corner of the room there was in the corner a slanting ledge projecting from the wallplastered over and painted green left from roarks modeling of the temple interior that had once controlled the recession of the light at sunset catherine walked over to jackie and saw spread out on the ledge the recognizable shape of a dog brown with blue spots and five legs jackie wore an expression of pride now you see you see catherine said to her colleagues isnt it wonderful and moving theres no telling how far the child will go with proper encouragement think of what happens to their little souls if they are frustrated in their creative instincts its so important not to deny them a chance for selfexpression did you see jackies face dominiques statue had been sold no one knew who bought it it had been bought by ellsworth toohey roarks office had shrunk back to one room after the completion of the cord building he found no work the depression had wrecked the building trade there was little work for anyone it was said that the skyscraper was finished architects were closing their offices a few commissions still dribbled out occasionally and a group of architects hovered about them with the dignity of a bread line there were men like ralston holcombe among them men who had never begged but had demanded references before they accepted a client when roark tried to get a commission he was rejected in a manner implying that if he had no more sense than that politeness would be a wasted effort roark cautious businessmen said the tabloid hero moneys too scarce nowadays to waste it on lawsuits afterwards he got a few jobs remodeling rooming houses an assignment that involved no more than erecting partitions and rearranging the plumbing dont take it howard austen heller said angrily the infernal gall of offering you that kind of work after a skyscraper like the cord building after the enright house ill take anything said roark the stoddard award had taken more than the amount of his fee for the cord building but he had saved enough to exist on for a while he paid mallorys rent and he paid for most of their frequent meals together mallory had tried to object shut up steve roark had said im not doing it for you at a time like this i owe myself a few luxuries so im simply buying the most valuable thing that can be bought your time im competing with a whole country and thats quite a luxury isnt it they want you to do baby plaques and i dont and i like having my way against theirs what do you want me to work on howard i want you to work without asking anyone what he wants you to work on austen heller heard about it from mallory and spoke of it to roark in private if youre helping him why dont you let me help you id let you if you could said roark but you cant all he needs is his time he can work without clients i cant its amusing howard to see you in the role of an altruist you dont have to insult me its not altruism but ill tell you this most people say theyre concerned with the suffering of others im not and yet theres one thing i cant understand most of them would not pass by if they saw a man bleeding in the road mangled by a hitandrun driver and most of them would not turn their heads to look at steven mallory but dont they know that if suffering could be measured theres no suffering in steven mallory when he cant do the work he wants to do than in a whole field of victims mowed down by a tank if one must relieve the pain of this world isnt mallory the place to begin however thats not why im doing it roark had never seen the reconstructed stoddard temple on an evening in november he went to see it he did not know whether it was surrender to pain or victory over the fear of seeing it it was late and the garden of the stoddard home was deserted the building was dark a single light showed in a back window upstairs roark stood looking at the building for a long time the door under the greek portico opened and a slight masculine figure came out it hurried casually down the steps and then stopped hello mr roark said ellsworth toohey quietly roark looked at him without curiosity hello said roark please dont run away the voice was not mocking but earnest i wasnt going to i think i knew that youd come here some day and i think i wanted to be here when you came ive kept inventing excuses for myself to hang about this place there was no gloating in the voice it sounded drained and simple well you shouldnt mind speaking to me you see i understand your work what i do about it is another matter you are free to do what you wish about it i understand your work better than any living person with the possible exception of dominique francon and perhaps better than she does thats a deal isnt it mr roark you havent many people around you who can say that its a greater bond than if i were your devoted but blind supporter i knew you understood then you wont mind talking to me about what in the darkness it sounded almost as if toohey had sighed after a while he pointed to the building and asked do you understand this roark did not answer toohey went on softly what does it look like to you like a senseless mess like a chance collection of driftwood like an imbecile chaos but is it mr roark do you see no method you who know the language of structure and the meaning of form do you see no purpose here i see none in discussing it mr roark were alone here why dont you tell me what you think of me in any words you wish no one will hear us but i dont think of you tooheys face had an expression of attentiveness of listening quietly to something as simple as fate he remained silent and roark asked what did you want to say to me toohey looked at him and then at the bare trees around them at the river far below at the great rise of the sky beyond the river nothing said toohey he walked away his steps creaking on the gravel in the silence sharp and even like the cracks of an engines pistons roark stood alone in the empty driveway looking at the building part three gail wynand gail wynand raised a gun to his temple he felt the pressure of a metal ring against his skin and nothing else he might have been holding a lead pipe or a piece of jewelry it was just a small circle without significance i am going to die he said aloud and yawned he felt no relief no despair no fear the moment of his end would not grant him even the dignity of seriousness it was an anonymous moment a few minutes ago he had held a toothbrush in that hand now he held a gun with the same casual indifference one does not die like this he thought one must feel a great joy or a healthy terror one must salute ones own end let me feel a spasm of dread and ill pull the trigger he felt nothing he shrugged and lowered the gun he stood tapping it against the palm of his left hand people always speak of a black death or a red death he thought yours gail wynand will be a gray death why hasnt anyone ever said that this is the ultimate horror not screams pleas or convulsions not the indifference of a clean emptiness disinfected by the fire of some great disaster but this a mean smutty little horror impotent even to frighten you cant do it like that he told himself smiling coldly it would be in such bad taste he walked to the wall of his bedroom his penthouse was built above the fiftyseventh floor of a great residential hotel which he owned in the center of manhattan he could see the whole city below him the bedroom was a glass cage on the roof of the penthouse its walls and ceiling made of huge glass sheets there were dustblue suede curtains to be pulled across the walls and enclose the room when he wished there was nothing to cover the ceiling lying in bed he could study the stars over his head or see flashes of lightning or watch the rain smashed into furious glittering sunbursts in midair above him against the unseen protection he liked to extinguish the lights and pull all the curtains open when he lay in bed with a woman we are fornicating in the sight of six million people he would tell her he was alone now the curtains were open he stood looking at the city it was late and the great riot of lights below him was beginning to die down he thought that he did not mind having to look at the city for many more years and he did not mind never seeing it again he leaned against the wall and felt the cold glass through the thin dark silk of his pyjamas a monogram was embroidered in white on his breast pocket gw reproduced from his handwriting exactly as he signed his initials with a single imperial motion people said that gail wynands greatest deception among many was his appearance he looked like the decadent overperfected end product of a long line of exquisite breeding and everybody knew that he came from the gutter he was tall too slender for physical beauty as if all his flesh and muscle had been bred away it was not necessary for him to stand erect in order to convey an impression of hardness like a piece of expensive steel he bent slouched and made people conscious not of his pose but of the ferocious spring that could snap him straight at any moment this hint was all he needed he seldom stood quite straight he lounged about under any clothes he wore it gave him an air of consummate elegance his face did not belong to modern civilization but to ancient rome the face of an eternal patrician his hair streaked with gray was swept smoothly back from a high forehead his skin was pulled tight over the sharp bones of his face his mouth was long and thin his eyes under slanting eyebrows were pale blue and photographed like two sardonic white ovals an artist had asked him once to sit for a painting of mephistopheles wynand had laughed refusing and the artist had watched sadly because the laughter made the face perfect for his purpose he slouched casually against the glass pane of his bedroom the weight of a gun on his palm today he thought what was today did anything happen that would help me now and give meaning to this moment today had been like so many other days behind him that particular features were hard to recognize he was fiftyone years old and it was the middle of october in the year he was certain of this much the rest took an effort of memory he had awakened and dressed at six oclock this morning he had never slept more than four hours on any night of his adult life he descended to his dining room where breakfast was served to him his penthouse a small structure stood on the edge of a vast roof landscaped as a garden the rooms were a superlative artistic achievement their simplicity and beauty would have aroused gasps of admiration had this house belonged to anyone else but people were shocked into silence when they thought that this was the home of the publisher of the new york banner the most vulgar newspaper in the country after breakfast he went to his study his desk was piled with every important newspaper book and magazine received that morning from all over the country he worked alone at his desk for three hours reading and making brief notes with a large blue pencil across the printed pages the notes looked like a spys shorthand nobody could decipher them except the dry middleaged secretary who entered the study when wynand left it he had not heard her voice in five years but no communication between them was necessary when he returned to his study in the evening the secretary and the pile of papers were gone on his desk he found neatly typed pages containing the things he had wished to be recorded from his mornings work at ten oclock he arrived at the banner building a plain grimy structure in an undistinguished neighborhood of lower manhattan when he walked through the narrow halls of the building the employees he met wished him a good morning the greeting was correct and he answered courteously but his passage had the effect of a death ray that stopped the motor of living organisms among the many hard rules imposed upon the employees of all wynand enterprises the hardest was the one demanding that no man pause in his work if mr wynand entered the room or notice his entrance nobody could predict what department he would choose to visit or when he could appear at any moment in any part of the building and his presence was as unobtrusive as an electric shock the employees tried to obey the rule as best they could but they preferred three hours of overtime to ten minutes of working under his silent observation this morning in his office he went over the proofs of the banners sunday editorials he slashed blue lines across the spreads he wished eliminated he did not sign his initials everybody knew that only gail wynand could make quite that kind of blue slashes lines that seemed to rip the authors of the copy out of existence he finished the proofs then asked to be connected with the editor of the wynand herald in springville kansas when he telephoned his provinces wynands name was never announced to the victim he expected his voice to be known to every key citizen of his empire good morning cummings he said when the editor answered my god gasped the editor it isnt it is said wynand listen cummings one more piece of crap like yesterdays yarn on the last rose of summer and you can go back to the high school bugle yes mr wynand wynand hung up he asked to be connected with an eminent senator in washington good morning senator he said when the gentleman came on the wire within two minutes it is so kind of you to answer this call i appreciate it i do not wish to impose on your time but i felt i owed you an expression of my deepest gratitude i called to thank you for your work in passing the hayeslangston bill but mr wynand the senators voice seemed to squirm its so nice of you but the bill hasnt been passed oh thats right my mistake it will be passed tomorrow a meeting of the board of directors of the wynand enterprises inc had been scheduled for eleventhirty that morning the wynand enterprises consisted of twentytwo newspapers seven magazines three news services and two newsreels wynand owned seventyfive percent of the stock the directors were not certain of their functions or purpose wynand had ordered meetings of the board always to start on time whether he was present or not today he entered the board room at twelve twentyfive a distinguished old gentleman was making a speech the directors were not allowed to stop or notice wynands presence he walked to the empty chair at the head of the long mahogany table and sat down no one turned to him it was as if the chair had just been occupied by a ghost whose existence they dared not admit he listened silently for fifteen minutes he got up in the middle of a sentence and left the room as he had entered on a large table in his office he spread out maps of stoneridge his new realestate venture and spent half an hour discussing it with two of his agents he had purchased a vast tract of land on long island which was to be converted into the stoneridge development a new community of small home owners every curbstone street and house to be built by gail wynand the few people who knew of his realestate activities had told him that he was crazy it was a year when no one thought of building but gail wynand had made his fortune on decisions which people called crazy the architect to design stoneridge had not been chosen news of the project had seeped into the starved profession for weeks wynand had refused to read letters or answer calls from the best architects of the country and their friends he refused once more when at the end of his conference his secretary informed him that mr ralston holcombe most urgently requested two minutes of his time on the telephone when the agents were gone wynand pressed a button on his desk summoning alvah scarret scarret entered the office smiling happily he always answered that buzzer with the flattered eagerness of an office boy alvah what in hell is the gallant gallstone scarret laughed oh that its the title of a novel by lois cook what kind of a novel oh just a lot of drivel its supposed to be a sort of prose poem its all about a gallstone that thinks that its an independent entity a sort of a rugged individualist of the gall bladder if you see what i mean and then the man takes a big dose of castor oil theres a graphic description of the consequences im not sure its correct medically but anyway thats the end of the gallant gallstone its all supposed to prove that theres no such thing as free will how many copies has it sold i dont know not very many i think just among the intelligentsia but i hear its picked up some lately and precisely whats going on around here alvah what oh you mean you noticed the few mentions which i mean ive noticed it all over the banner in the last few weeks very nicely done too if it took me that long to discover that it wasnt accidental what do you mean what do you think i mean why should that particular title appear continuously in the most inappropriate places one day its in a police story about the execution of some murderer who died bravely like the gallant gallstone two days later its on page sixteen in a state yarn from albany senator hazleton thinks hes an independent entity but it might turn out that hes only a gallant gallstone then its in the obituaries yesterday it was on the womens page today its in the comics snooxy calls his rich landlord a gallant gallstone scarret chortled peacefully yes isnt it silly i thought it was silly at first now i dont but what the hell gail its not as if it were a major issue and our byliners plugged it its just the small fry the fortydollaraweek ones thats the point one of them the other is that the books not a famous bestseller if it were i could understand the title popping into their heads automatically but it isnt so someones doing the popping why oh come gail why would anyone want to bother and what do we care if it were a political issue but hell who can get any gravy out of plugging for free will or against free will did anyone consult you about this plugging no i tell you nobodys behind it its just spontaneous just a lot of people who thought it was a funny gag who was the first one that you heard it from i dont know let me see it was yes i think it was ellsworth toohey have it stopped be sure to tell mr toohey okay if you say so but its really nothing just a lot of people amusing themselves i dont like to have anyone amusing himself on my paper yes gail at two oclock wynand arrived as guest of honor at a luncheon given by a national convention of womens clubs he sat at the right of the chairwoman in an echoing banquet hall filled with the odors of corsages gardenias and sweet peas and of fried chicken after luncheon wynand spoke the convention advocated careers for married women the wynand papers had fought against the employment of married women for many years wynand spoke for twenty minutes and said nothing at all but he conveyed the impression that he supported every sentiment expressed at the meeting nobody had ever been able to explain the effect of gail wynand on an audience particularly an audience of women he did nothing spectacular his voice was low metallic inclined to sound monotonous he was too correct in a manner that was almost deliberate satire on correctness yet he conquered all listeners people said it was his subtle enormous virility it made the courteous voice speaking about school home and family sound as if he were making love to every old hag present returning to his office wynand stopped in the city room standing at a tall desk a big blue pencil in his hand he wrote on a huge sheet of plain print stock in letters an inch high a brilliant ruthless editorial denouncing all advocates of careers for women the gw at the end stood like a streak of blue flame he did not read the piece over he never needed to but threw it on the desk of the first editor in sight and walked out of the room late in the afternoon when wynand was ready to leave his office his secretary announced that ellsworth toohey requested the privilege of seeing him let him in said wynand toohey entered a cautious halfsmile on his face a smile mocking himself and his boss but with a delicate sense of balance sixty percent of the mockery directed at himself he knew that wynand did not want to see him and being received was not in his favor wynand sat behind his desk his face courteously blank two diagonal ridges stood out faintly on his forehead parallel with his slanting eyebrows it was a disconcerting peculiarity which his face assumed at times it gave the effect of a double exposure an ominous emphasis sit down mr toohey of what service can i be to you oh im much more presumptuous than that mr wynand said toohey gaily i didnt come to ask for your services but to offer you mine in what matter stoneridge the diagonal lines stood out sharper on wynands forehead of what use can a newspaper columnist be to stoneridge a newspaper columnist none mr wynand but an architectural expert toohey let his voice trail into a mocking question mark if tooheys eyes had not been fixed insolently on wynands he would have been ordered out of the office at once but the glance told wynand that toohey knew to what extent he had been plagued by people recommending architects and how hard he had tried to avoid them and that toohey had outwitted him by obtaining this interview for a purpose wynand had not expected the impertinence of it amused wynand as toohey had known it would all right mr toohey whom are you selling peter keating well i beg your pardon well sell him to me toohey was stopped then shrugged brightly and plunged in you understand of course that im not connected with mr keating in any way im acting only as his friend and yours the voice sounded pleasantly informal but it had lost some of its certainty honestly i know it does sound trite but what else can i say it just happens to be the truth wynand would not help him out i presumed to come here because i felt it was my duty to give you my opinion no not a moral duty call it an esthetic one i know that you demand the best in anything you do for a project of the size you have in mind theres not another architect living who can equal peter keating in efficiency taste originality imagination that mr wynand is my sincere opinion i quite believe you you do of course but mr toohey why should i consider your opinion well after all i am your architectural expert he could not keep the edge of anger out of his voice my dear mr toohey dont confuse me with my readers after a moment toohey leaned back and spread his hands out in laughing helplessness frankly mr wynand i didnt think my word would carry much weight with you so i didnt intend trying to sell you peter keating no what did you intend only to ask that you give half an hour of your time to someone who can convince you of peter keatings ability much better than i can who is that mrs peter keating why should i wish to discuss this matter with mrs peter keating because she is an exceedingly beautiful woman and an extremely difficult one wynand threw his head back and laughed aloud good god toohey am i as obvious as that toohey blinked unprepared really mr toohey i owe you an apology if by allowing my tastes to become so well known i caused you to be so crude but i had no idea that among your many other humanitarian activities you were also a pimp toohey rose to his feet sorry to disappoint you mr toohey i have no desire whatever to meet mrs peter keating i didnt think you would have mr wynand not on my unsupported suggestion i foresaw that several hours ago in fact as early as this morning so i took the liberty of preparing for myself another chance to discuss this with you i took the liberty of sending you a present when you get home tonight you will find my gift there then if you feel that i was justified in expecting you to do so you can telephone me and i shall come over at once so that you will be able to tell me whether you wish to meet mrs peter keating or not toohey this is unbelievable but i believe youre offering me a bribe i am you know thats the sort of stunt you should be allowed to get away with completely or lose your job for i shall rest upon your opinion of my present tonight all right mr toohey ill look at your present toohey bowed and turned to go he was at the door when wynand added you know toohey one of these days youll bore me i shall endeavor not to do so until the right time said toohey bowed again and went out when wynand returned to his home he had forgotten all about ellsworth toohey that evening in his penthouse wynand had dinner with a woman who had a white face soft brown hair and behind her three centuries of fathers and brothers who would have killed a man for a hint of the things which gail wynand had experienced with her the line of her arm when she raised a crystal goblet of water to her lips was as perfect as the lines of the silver candelabra produced by a matchless talent and wynand observed it with the same appreciation the candlelight flickering on the planes of her face made a sight of such beauty that he wished she were not alive so that he could look say nothing and think what he pleased in a month or two gail she said smiling lazily when it gets really cold and nasty lets take the i do and sail somewhere straight into the sun as we did last winter i do was the name of wynands yacht he had never explained that name to anyone many women had questioned him about it this woman had questioned him before now as he remained silent she asked it again by the way darling what does it mean the name of that wonderful mudscow of yours its a question i dont answer he said one of them well shall i get my wardrobe ready for the cruise green is your best color it looks well at sea i love to watch what it does to your hair and your arms i shall miss the sight of your naked arms against green silk because tonight is the last time her fingers lay still on the stem of the glass nothing had given her a hint that tonight was to be the last time but she knew that these words were all he needed to end it all of wynands women had known that they were to expect an end like this and that it was not to be discussed after a while she asked her voice low what reason gail the obvious one he reached into his pocket and took out a diamond bracelet it flashed a cold brilliant fire in the candlelight its heavy links hung limply in his fingers it had no case no wrapper he tossed it across the table a memorial my dear he said much more valuable than that which it commemorates the bracelet hit the goblet and made it ring a thin sharp cry as if the glass had screamed for the woman the woman made no sound he knew that it was horrible because she was the kind to whom one did not offer such gifts at such moments just as all those other women had been and because she would not refuse as all the others had not refused thank you gail she said clasping the bracelet about her wrist not looking at him across the candles later when they had walked into the drawing room she stopped and the glance between her long eyelashes moved toward the darkness where the stairway to his bedroom began to let me earn the memorial gail she asked her voice flat he shook his head i had really intended that he said but im tired when she had gone he stood in the hall and thought that she suffered that the suffering was real but after a while none of it would be real to her except the bracelet he could no longer remember the time when such a thought had the power to give him bitterness when he recalled that he too was concerned in the event of this evening he felt nothing except wonder why he had not done this long ago he went to his library he sat reading for a few hours then he stopped he stopped short without reason in the middle of an important sentence he had no desire to read on he had no desire ever to make another effort nothing had happened to him a happening is a positive reality and no reality could ever make him helpless this was some enormous negative as if everything had been wiped out leaving a senseless emptiness faintly indecent because it seemed so ordinary so unexciting like murder wearing a homey smile nothing was gone except desire no more than that the root the desire to desire he thought that a man who loses his eyes still retains the concept of sight but he had heard of a ghastlier blindness if the brain centers controlling vision are destroyed one loses even the memory of visual perception he dropped the book and stood up he had no wish to remain on that spot he had no wish to move from it he thought that he should go to sleep it was much too early for him but he could get up earlier tomorrow he went to his bedroom he took a shower he put on his pyjamas then he opened a drawer of his dresser and saw the gun he always kept there it was the immediate recognition the sudden stab of interest that made him pick it up it was the lack of shock when he thought he would kill himself that convinced him he should the thought seemed so simple like an argument not worth contesting like a bromide now he stood at the glass wall stopped by that very simplicity one could make a bromide of ones life he thought but not of ones death he walked to the bed and sat down the gun hanging in his hand a man about to die he thought is supposed to see his whole life in a last flash i see nothing but i could make myself see it i could go over it again by force let me find in it either the will to live on or the reason to end it now gail wynand aged twelve stood in the darkness under a broken piece of wall on the shore of the hudson one arm swung back the fist closed ready to strike waiting the stones under his feet rose to the remnant of a corner one side of it hid him from the street there was nothing behind the other side but a sheer drop to the river an unlighted unpaved stretch of waterfront lay before him sagging structures and empty spaces of sky warehouses a crooked cornice hanging somewhere over a window with a malignant light in a moment he would have to fight and he knew it would be for his life he stood still his closed fist held down and back seemed to clutch invisible wires that stretched to every key spot of his lanky fleshless body under the ragged pants and shirt to the long swollen tendon of his bare arm to the taut cords of his neck the wires seemed to quiver the body was motionless he was like a new sort of lethal instrument if a finger were to touch any part of him it would release the trigger he knew that the leader of the boys gang was looking for him and that the leader would not come alone two of the boys he expected fought with knives one had a killing to his credit he waited for them his own pockets empty he was the youngest member of the gang and the last to join the leader had said that he needed a lesson it had started over the looting of the barges on the river which the gang was planning the leader had decided that the job would be done at night the gang had agreed all but gail wynand gail wynand had explained in a slow contemptuous voice that the little pluguglies farther down the river had tried the same stunt last week and had left six members in the hands of the cops plus two in the cemetery the job had to be done at daybreak when no one would expect it the gang hooted him it made no difference gail wynand was not good at taking orders he recognized nothing but the accuracy of his own judgment so the leader wished to settle the issue once and for all the three boys walked so softly that the people behind the thin walls they passed could not hear their steps gail wynand heard them a block away he did not move in his corner only his wrist stiffened a little when the moment was right he leaped he leaped straight into space without thought of landing as if a catapult had sent him on a flight of miles his chest struck the head of one enemy his stomach another his feet smashed into the chest of the third the four of them went down when the three lifted their faces gail wynand was unrecognizable they saw a whirl suspended in the air above them and something darted at them out of the whirl with a scalding touch he had nothing but his two fists they had five fists and a knife on their side it did not seem to count they heard their blows landing with a thud as on hard rubber they felt the break in the thrust of their knife which told that it had been stopped and had cut its way out but the thing they were fighting was invulnerable he had no time to feel he was too fast pain could not catch up with him he seemed to leave it hanging in the air over the spot where it had hit him and where he was no longer in the next second he seemed to have a motor between his shoulder blades to propel his arms in two circles only the circles were visible the arms had vanished like the spokes of a speeding wheel the circle landed each time and stopped whatever it had landed upon without a break in its spin one boy saw his knife disappear in wynands shoulder he saw the jerk of the shoulder that sent the knife slicing down through wynands side and flung it out at the belt it was the last thing the boy saw something happened to his chin and he did not feel it when the back of his head struck against a pile of old bricks for a long time the two others fought the centrifuge that was now spattering red drops against the walls around them but it was no use they were not fighting a man they were fighting a bodiless human will when they gave up groaning among the bricks gail wynand said in a normal voice well pull it off at daybreak and walked away from that moment on he was the leader of the gang the looting of the barges was done at daybreak two days later and came off with brilliant success gail wynand lived with his father in the basement of an old house in the heart of hells kitchen his father was a longshoreman a tall silent illiterate man who had never gone to school his own father and his grandfather were of the same kind and they knew of nothing but poverty in their family but somewhere far back in the line there had been a root of aristocracy the glory of some noble ancestor and then some tragedy long since forgotten that had brought the descendants to the gutter something about all the wynands in tenement saloon and jail did not fit their surroundings gails father was known on the waterfront as the duke gails mother had died of consumption when he was two years old he was an only son he knew vaguely that there had been some great drama in his fathers marriage he had seen a picture of his mother she did not look and she was not dressed like the women of their neighborhood she was very beautiful all life had gone out of his father when she died he loved gail but it was the kind of devotion that did not require two sentences a week gail did not look like his mother or father he was a throwback to something no one could quite figure out the distance had to be reckoned not in generations but in centuries he was always too tall for his age and too thin the boys called him stretch wynand nobody knew what he used for muscles they knew only that he used it he had worked at one job after another since early childhood for a long while he sold newspapers on street corners one day he walked up to the pressroom boss and stated that they should start a new service delivering the paper to the readers door in the morning he explained how and why it would boost circulation yeah said the boss i know it will work said wynand well you dont run things around here said the boss youre a fool said wynand he lost the job he worked in a grocery store he ran errands he swept the soggy wooden floor he sorted out barrels of rotting vegetables he helped to wait on customers patiently weighing a pound of flour or filling a pitcher with milk from a huge can it was like using a steamroller to press handkerchiefs but he set his teeth and stuck to it one day he explained to the grocer what a good idea it would be to put milk up in bottles like whisky you shut your trap and go wait on mrs sullivan there said the grocer dont you tell me nothing i dont know about my business you dont run things around here he waited on mrs sullivan and said nothing he worked in a poolroom he cleaned spittoons and washed up after drunks he heard and saw things that gave him immunity from astonishment for the rest of his life he made his greatest effort and learned to keep silent to keep the place others described as his place to accept ineptitude as his master and to wait no one had ever heard him speak of what he felt he felt many emotions toward his fellow men but respect was not one of them he worked as bootblack on a ferryboat he was shoved and ordered around by every bloated horse trader by every drunken deck hand aboard if he spoke he heard some thick voice answering you dont run things around here but he liked this job when he had no customers he stood at the rail and looked at manhattan he looked at the yellow boards of new houses at the vacant lots at the cranes and derricks at the few towers rising in the distance he thought of what should be built and what should be destroyed of the space the promise and what could be made of it a hoarse shout hey boy interrupted him he went back to his bench and bent obediently over some muddy shoe the customer saw only a small head of light brown hair and two thin capable hands on foggy evenings under a gas lantern on a street corner nobody noticed the slender figure leaning against a lamppost the aristocrat of the middle ages the timeless patrician whose every instinct cried that he should command whose swift brain told him why he had the right to do so the feudal baron created to rule but born to sweep floors and take orders he had taught himself to read and write at the age of five by asking questions he read everything he found he could not tolerate the inexplicable he had to understand anything known to anyone the emblem of his childhood the coatofarms he devised for himself in place of the one lost for him centuries ago was the question mark no one ever needed to explain anything to him twice he learned his first mathematics from the engineers laying sewer pipes he learned geography from the sailors on the waterfront he learned civics from the politicians at a local club that was a gangsters hangout he had never gone to church or to school he was twelve when he walked into a church he listened to a sermon on patience and humility he never came back he was thirteen when he decided to see what education was like and enrolled at a public school his father said nothing about this decision as he said nothing whenever gail came home battered after a gang fight during his first week at school the teacher called on gail wynand constantly it was sheer pleasure to her because he always knew the answers when he trusted his superiors and their purpose he obeyed like a spartan imposing on himself the kind of discipline he demanded of his own subjects in the gang but the force of his will was wasted within a week he saw that he needed no effort to be first in the class after a month the teacher stopped noticing his presence it seemed pointless he always knew his lesson and she had to concentrate on the slower duller children he sat unflinching through hours that dragged like chains while the teacher repeated and chewed and rechewed sweating to force some spark of intellect from vacant eyes and mumbling voices at the end of two months reviewing the rudiments of history which she had tried to pound into her class the teacher asked and how many original states were there in the union no hands were raised then gail wynands arm went up the teacher nodded to him he rose why he asked should i swill everything down ten times i know all that you are not the only one in the class said the teacher he uttered an expression that struck her white and made her blush fifteen minutes later when she grasped it fully he walked to the door on the threshold he turned to add oh yes there were thirteen original states that was the last of his formal education there were people in hells kitchen who never ventured beyond its boundaries and others who seldom stepped out of the tenement in which they were born but gail wynand often went for a walk through the best streets of the city he felt no bitterness against the world of wealth no envy and no fear he was simply curious and he felt at home on fifth avenue just as anywhere else he walked past the stately mansions his hands in his pockets his toes sticking out of flatsoled shoes people glared at him but it had no effect he passed by and left behind him the feeling that he belonged on this street and they didnt he wanted nothing for the time being except to understand he wanted to know what made these people different from those in his neighborhood it was not the clothes the carriages or the banks that caught his notice it was the books people in his neighborhood had clothes horse wagons and money degrees were inessential but they did not read books he decided to learn what was read by the people on fifth avenue one day he saw a lady waiting in a carriage at the curb he knew she was a lady his judgment on such matters was more acute than the discrimination of the social register she was reading a book he leaped to the steps of the carriage snatched the book and ran away it would have taken swifter slimmer men than the cops to catch him it was a volume of herbert spencer he went through a quiet agony trying to read it to the end he read it to the end he understood one quarter of what he had read but this started him on a process which he pursued with a systematic fistclenched determination without advice assistance or plan he began reading an incongruous assortment of books he would find some passage which he could not understand in one book and he would get another on that subject he branched out erratically in all directions he read volumes of specialized erudition first and highschool primers afterward there was no order in his reading but there was order in what remained of it in his mind he discovered the reading room of the public library and he went there for a while to study the layout then one day at various times a succession of young boys painfully combed and unconvincingly washed came to visit the reading room they were thin when they came but not when they left that evening gail wynand had a small library of his own in the corner of his basement his gang had executed his orders without protest it was a scandalous assignment no selfrespecting gang had ever looted anything as pointless as books but stretch wynand had given the orders and one did not argue with stretch wynand he was fifteen when he was found one morning in the gutter a mass of bleeding pulp both legs broken beaten by some drunken longshoreman he was unconscious when found but he had been conscious that night after the beating he had been left alone in a dark alley he had seen a light around the corner nobody knew how he could have managed to drag himself around that corner but he had they saw the long smear of blood on the pavement afterward he had crawled able to move nothing but his arms he had knocked against the bottom of a door it was a saloon still open the saloonkeeper came out it was the only time in his life that gail wynand asked for help the saloonkeeper looked at him with a flat heavy glance a glance that showed full consciousness of agony of injustice and a stolid bovine indifference the saloonkeeper went inside and slammed the door he had no desire to get mixed up with gang fights years later gail wynand publisher of the new york banner still knew the names of the longshoreman and the saloonkeeper and where to find them he never did anything to the longshoreman but he caused the saloonkeepers business to be ruined his home and savings to be lost and drove the man to suicide gail wynand was sixteen when his father died he was alone jobless at the moment with sixtyfive cents in his pocket an unpaid rent bill and a chaotic erudition he decided that the time had come to decide what he would make of his life he went that night to the roof of his tenement and looked at the lights of the city the city where he did not run things he let his eyes move slowly from the windows of the sagging hovels around him to the windows of the mansions in the distance there were only lighted squares hanging in space but he could tell from them the quality of the structures to which they belonged the lights around him looked muddy discouraged those in the distance were clean and tight he asked himself a single question what was there that entered all those houses the dim and the brilliant alike what reached into every room into every person they all had bread could one rule men through the bread they bought they had shoes they had coffee they had the course of his life was set next morning he walked into the office of the editor of the gazette a fourthrate newspaper in a rundown building and asked for a job in the city room the editor looked at his clothes and inquired can you spell cat can you spell anthropomorphology asked wynand we have no jobs here said the editor ill hang around said wynand use me when you want to you dont have to pay me youll put me on salary when youll feel youd better he remained in the building sitting on the stairs outside the city room he sat there every day for a week no one paid any attention to him at night he slept in doorways when most of his money was gone he stole food from counters or from garbage pails before returning to his post on the stairs one day a reporter felt sorry for him and walking down the stairs threw a nickel into wynands lap saying go buy yourself a bowl of stew kid wynand had a dime left in his pocket he took the dime and threw it at the reporter saying go buy yourself a screw the man swore and went on down the nickel and the dime remained lying on the steps wynand would not touch them the story was repeated in the city room a pimplyfaced clerk shrugged and took the two coins at the end of the week in a rush hour a man from the city room called wynand to run an errand other small chores followed he obeyed with military precision in ten days he was on salary in six months he was a reporter in two years he was an associate editor gail wynand was twenty when he fell in love he had known everything there was to know about sex since the age of thirteen he had had many girls he never spoke of love created no romantic illusion and treated the whole matter as a simple animal transaction but at this he was an expert and women could tell it just by looking at him the girl with whom he fell in love had an exquisite beauty a beauty to be worshipped not desired she was fragile and silent her face told of the lovely mysteries within her left unexpressed she became gail wynands mistress he allowed himself the weakness of being happy he would have married her at once had she mentioned it but they said little to each other he felt that everything was understood between them one evening he spoke sitting at her feet his face raised to her he allowed his soul to be heard my darling anything you wish anything i am anything i can ever be thats what i want to offer you not the things ill get for you but the thing in me that will make me able to get them that thing a man cant renounce it but i want to renounce it so that it will be yours so that it will be in your service only for you the girl smiled and asked do you think im prettier than maggy kelly he got up he said nothing and walked out of the house he never saw that girl again gail wynand who prided himself on never needing a lesson twice did not fall in love again in the years that followed he was twentyone when his career on the gazette was threatened for the first and only time politics and corruption had never disturbed him he knew all about it his gang had been paid to help stage beatings at the polls on election days but when pat mulligan police captain of his precinct was framed wynand could not take it because pat mulligan was the only honest man he had ever met in his life the gazette was controlled by the powers that had framed mulligan wynand said nothing he merely put in order in his mind such items of information he possessed as would blow the gazette into hell his job would be blown with it but that did not matter his decision contradicted every rule he had laid down for his career but he did not think it was one of the rare explosions that hit him at times throwing him beyond caution making of him a creature possessed by the single impulse to have his way because the rightness of his way was so blindingly total but he knew that the destruction of the gazette would be only a first step it was not enough to save mulligan for three years wynand had kept one small clipping an editorial on corruption by the famous editor of a great newspaper he had kept it because it was the most beautiful tribute to integrity he had ever read he took that clipping and went to see the great editor he would tell him about mulligan and together they would beat the machine he walked far across town to the building of the famous paper he had to walk it helped to control the fury within him he was admitted into the office of the editor he had a way of getting admitted into places against all rules he saw a fat man at a desk with thin slits of eyes set close together he did not introduce himself but laid the clipping down on the desk and asked do you remember this the editor glanced at the clipping then at wynand it was a glance wynand had seen before in the eyes of the saloonkeeper who had slammed the door how do you expect me to remember every piece of swill i write asked the editor after a moment wynand said thanks it was the only time in his life that he felt gratitude to anyone the gratitude was genuine a payment for a lesson he would never need again but even the editor knew there was something very wrong in that short thanks and very frightening he did not know that it had been an obituary on gail wynand wynand walked back to the gazette feeling no anger toward the editor or the political machine he felt only a furious contempt for himself for pat mulligan for all integrity he felt shame when he thought of those whose victims he and mulligan had been willing to become he did not think victims he thought suckers he got back to the office and wrote a brilliant editorial blasting captain mulligan why i thought you kinda felt sorry for the poor bastard said his editor pleased i dont feel sorry for anyone said wynand grocers and deck hands had not appreciated gail wynand politicians did in his years on the paper he had learned how to get along with people his face had assumed the expression it was to wear for the rest of his life not quite a smile but a motionless look of irony directed at the whole world people could presume that his mockery was intended for the particular things they wished to mock besides it was pleasant to deal with a man untroubled by passion or sanctity he was twentythree when a rival political gang intent on winning a municipal election and needing a newspaper to plug a certain issue bought the gazette they bought it in the name of gail wynand who was to serve as a respectable front for the machine gail wynand became editorinchief he plugged the issue he won the election for his bosses two years later he smashed the gang sent its leaders to the penitentiary and remained as sole owner of the gazette his first act was to tear down the sign over the door of the building and to throw out the papers old masthead the gazette became the new york banner his friends objected publishers dont change the name of a paper they told him this one does he said the first campaign of the banner was an appeal for money for a charitable cause displayed side by side with an equal amount of space the banner ran two stories one about a struggling young scientist starving in a garret working on a great invention the other about a chambermaid the sweetheart of an executed murderer awaiting the birth of her illegitimate child one story was illustrated with scientific diagrams the other with the picture of a loosemouthed girl wearing a tragic expression and disarranged clothes the banner asked its readers to help both these unfortunates it received nine dollars and fortyfive cents for the young scientist it received one thousand and seventyseven dollars for the unwed mother gail wynand called a meeting of his staff he put down on the table the paper carrying both stories and the money collected for both funds is there anyone here who doesnt understand he asked no one answered he said now you all know the kind of paper the banner is to be the publishers of his time took pride in stamping their individual personalities upon their newspapers gail wynand delivered his paper body and soul to the mob the banner assumed the appearance of a circus poster in body of a circus performance in soul it accepted the same goal to stun to amuse and to collect admission it bore the imprint not of one but of a million men men differ in their virtues if any said gail wynand explaining his policy but they are alike in their vices he added looking straight into the questioners eyes i am serving that which exists on this earth in greatest quantity i am representing the majority surely an act of virtue the public asked for crime scandal and sentiment gail wynand provided it he gave people what they wanted plus a justification for indulging the tastes of which they had been ashamed the banner presented murder arson rape corruption with an appropriate moral against each there were three columns of details to one stick of moral if you make people perform a noble duty it bores them said wynand if you make them indulge themselves it shames them but combine the two and youve got them he ran stories about fallen girls society divorces foundling asylums redlight districts charity hospitals sex first said wynand tears second make them itch and make them cry and youve got them the banner led great brave crusades on issues that had no opposition it exposed politicians one step ahead of the grand jury it attacked monopolies in the name of the downtrodden it mocked the rich and the successful in the manner of those who could never be either it overstressed the glamour of society and presented society news with a subtle sneer this gave the man on the street two satisfactions that of entering illustrious drawing rooms and that of not wiping his feet on the threshold the banner was permitted to strain truth taste and credibility but not its readers brain power its enormous headlines glaring pictures and oversimplified text hit the senses and entered mens consciousness without any necessity for an intermediary process of reason like food shot through the rectum requiring no digestion news gail wynand told his staff is that which will create the greatest excitement among the greatest number the thing that will knock them silly the sillier the better provided theres enough of them one day he brought into the office a man he had picked off the street it was an ordinary man neither welldressed nor shabby neither tall nor short neither dark nor quite blond he had the kind of face one could not remember even while looking at it he was frightening by being so totally undifferentiated he lacked even the positive distinction of a halfwit wynand took him through the building introduced him to every member of the staff and let him go then wynand called his staff together and told them when in doubt about your work remember that mans face youre writing for him but mr wynand said a young editor one cant remember his face thats the point said wynand when the name of gail wynand became a threat in the publishing world a group of newspaper owners took him aside at a city charity affair which all had to attend and reproached him for what they called his debasement of the public taste it is not my function said wynand to help people preserve a selfrespect they havent got you give them what they profess to like in public i give them what they really like honesty is the best policy gentlemen though not quite in the sense you were taught to believe it was impossible for wynand not to do a job well whatever his aim his means were superlative all the drive the force the will barred from the pages of his paper went into its making an exceptional talent was burned prodigally to achieve perfection in the unexceptional a new religious faith could have been founded on the energy of spirit which he spent upon collecting lurid stories and smearing them across sheets of paper the banner was always first with the news when an earthquake occurred in south america and no communications came from the stricken area wynand chartered a liner sent a crew down to the scene and had extras on the streets of new york days ahead of his competitors extras with drawings that represented flames chasms and crushed bodies when an sos was received from a ship sinking in a storm off the atlantic coast wynand himself sped to the scene with his crew ahead of the coast guard wynand directed the rescue and brought back an exclusive story with photographs of himself climbing a ladder over raging waves a baby in his arms when a canadian village was cut off from the world by an avalanche it was the banner that sent a balloon to drop food and bibles to the inhabitants when a coalmining community was paralyzed by a strike the banner opened soupkitchens and printed tragic stories on the perils confronting the miners pretty daughters under the pressure of poverty when a kitten got trapped on the top of a pole it was rescued by a banner photographer when theres no news make it was wynands order a lunatic escaped from a state institution for the insane after days of terror for miles around terror fed by the banners dire predictions and its indignation at the inefficiency of the local police he was captured by a reporter of the banner the lunatic recovered miraculously two weeks after his capture was released and sold to the banner an expose of the illtreatment he had suffered at the institution it led to sweeping reforms afterward some people said that the lunatic had worked on the banner before his commitment it could never be proved a fire broke out in a sweatshop employing thirty young girls two of them perished in the disaster mary watson one of the survivors gave the banner an exclusive story about the exploitation they had suffered it led to a crusade against sweatshops headed by the best women of the city the origin of the fire was never discovered it was whispered that mary watson had once been evelyn drake who wrote for the banner it could not be proved in the first years of the banners existence gail wynand spent more nights on his office couch than in his bedroom the effort he demanded of his employees was hard to perform the effort he demanded of himself was hard to believe he drove them like an army he drove himself like a slave he paid them well he got nothing but his rent and meals he lived in a furnished room at the time when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive hotels he spent money faster than it came in and he spent it all on the banner the paper was like a luxurious mistress whose every need was satisfied without inquiry about the price the banner was first to get the newest typographical equipment the banner was last to get the best newspapermen last because it kept them wynand raided his competitors city rooms nobody could meet the salaries he offered his procedure evolved into a simple formula when a newspaperman received an invitation to call on wynand he took it as an insult to his journalistic integrity but he came to the appointment he came prepared to deliver a set of offensive conditions on which he would accept the job if at all wynand began the interview by stating the salary he would pay then he added you might wish of course to discuss other conditions and seeing the swallowing movement in the mans throat concluded no fine report to me on monday when wynand opened his second paper in philadelphia the local publishers met him like european chieftains united against the invasion of attila the war that followed was as savage wynand laughed over it no one could teach him anything about hiring thugs to highjack a papers delivery wagons and beat up news vendors two of his competitors perished in the battle the wynand philadelphia star survived the rest was swift and simple like an epidemic by the time he reached the age of thirtyfive there were wynand papers in all the key cities of the united states by the time he was forty there were wynand magazines wynand newsreels and most of the wynand enterprises inc a great many activities not publicized helped to build his fortune he had forgotten nothing of his childhood he remembered the things he had thought standing as a bootblack at the rail of a ferryboat the chances offered by a growing city he bought real estate where no one expected it to become valuable he built against all advice and he ran hundreds into thousands he bought his way into a great many enterprises of all kinds sometimes they crashed ruining everybody concerned save gail wynand he staged a crusade against a shady streetcar monopoly and caused it to lose its franchise the franchise was granted to a shadier group controlled by gail wynand he exposed a vicious attempt to corner the beef market in the middle west and left the field clear for another gang operating under his orders he was helped by a great many people who discovered that young wynand was a bright fellow worth using he exhibited a charming complaisance about being used in each case the people found that they had been used instead like the men who bought the gazette for gail wynand sometimes he lost money on his investments coldly and with full intention through a series of untraceable steps he ruined many powerful men the president of a bank the head of an insurance company the owner of a steamship line and others no one could discover his motives the men were not his competitors and he gained nothing from their destruction whatever that bastard wynand is after people said its not after money those who denounced him too persistently were run out of their professions some in a few weeks others many years later there were occasions when he let insults pass unnoticed there were occasions when he broke a man for an innocuous remark one could never tell what he would avenge and what he would forgive one day he noticed the brilliant work of a young reporter on another paper and sent for him the boy came but the salary wynand mentioned had no effect on him i cant work for you mr wynand he said with desperate earnestness because you you have no ideals wynands thin lips smiled you cant escape human depravity kid he said gently the boss you work for may have ideals but he has to beg money and take orders from many contemptible people i have no ideals but i dont beg take your choice theres no other the boy went back to his paper a year later he came to wynand and asked if his offer were still open wynand said that it was the boy had remained on the banner ever since he was the only one on the staff who loved gail wynand alvah scarret sole survivor of the original gazette had risen with wynand but one could not say that he loved wynand he merely clung to his boss with the automatic devotion of a rug under wynands feet alvah scarret had never hated anything and so was incapable of love he was shrewd competent and unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one unable to grasp the conception of a scruple he believed everything he wrote and everything written in the banner he could hold a belief for all of two weeks he was invaluable to wynand as a barometer of public reaction no one could say whether gail wynand had a private life his hours away from the office had assumed the style of the banners front page but a style raised to a grand plane as if he were still playing circus only to a gallery of kings he bought out the entire house for a great opera performance and sat alone in the empty auditorium with his current mistress he discovered a beautiful play by an unknown playwright and paid him a huge sum to have the play performed once and never again wynand was the sole spectator at the single performance the script was burned next morning when a distinguished society woman asked him to contribute to a worthy charity cause wynand handed her a signed blank check and laughed confessing that the amount she dared to fill in was less than he would have given otherwise he bought some kind of balkan throne for a penniless pretender whom he met in a speakeasy and never bothered to see afterward he often referred to my valet my chauffeur and my king at night dressed in a shabby suit bought for nine dollars wynand would often ride the subways and wander through the dives of slum districts listening to his public once in a basement beer joint he heard a truck driver denouncing gail wynand as the worst exponent of capitalistic evils in a language of colorful accuracy wynand agreed with him and helped him out with a few expressions of his own from his hells kitchen vocabulary then wynand picked up a copy of the banner left by someone on a table tore his own photograph from page clipped it to a hundreddollar bill handed it to the truck driver and walked out before anyone could utter a word the succession of his mistresses was so rapid that it ceased to be gossip it was said that he never enjoyed a woman unless he had bought her and that she had to be the kind who could not be bought he kept the details of his life secret by making it glaringly public as a whole he had delivered himself to the crowd he was anyones property like a monument in a park like a bus stop sign like the pages of the banner his photographs appeared in his papers more often than pictures of movie stars he had been photographed in all kinds of clothes on every imaginable occasion he had never been photographed naked but his readers felt as if he had he derived no pleasure from personal publicity it was merely a matter of policy to which he submitted every corner of his penthouse had been reproduced in his papers and magazines every bastard in the country knows the inside of my icebox and bathtub he said one phase of his life however was little known and never mentioned the top floor of the building under his penthouse was his private art gallery it was locked he had never admitted anyone except the caretaker a few people knew about it once a french ambassador asked him for permission to visit it wynand refused occasionally not often he would descend to his gallery and remain there for hours the things he collected were chosen by standards of his own he had famous masterpieces he had canvases by unknown artists he rejected the works of immortal names for which he did not care the estimates set by collectors and the matter of great signatures were of no concern to him the art dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a master one night his valet saw wynand returning from the art gallery below and was shocked by the expression of his face it was a look of suffering yet the face seemed ten years younger are you ill sir he asked wynand looked at him indifferently and said go to bed we could make a swell spread for the sunday scandal sheet out of your art gallery said alvah scarret wistfully no said wynand but why gail look alvah every man on earth has a soul of his own that nobody can stare at even the convicts in a penitentiary and the freaks in a side show everybody but me my soul is spread in your sunday scandal sheet in threecolor process so i must have a substitute even if its only a locked room and a few objects not to be pawed it was a long process and there had been premonitory signs but scarret did not notice a certain new trait in gail wynands character until wynand was fortyfive then it became apparent to many wynand lost interest in breaking industrialists and financiers he found a new kind of victim people could not tell whether it was a sport a mania or a systematic pursuit they thought it was horrible because it seemed so vicious and pointless it began with the case of dwight carson dwight carson was a talented young writer who had achieved the spotless reputation of a man passionately devoted to his convictions he upheld the cause of the individual against the masses he wrote for magazines of great prestige and small circulation which were no threat to wynand wynand bought dwight carson he forced carson to write a column in the banner dedicated to preaching the superiority of the masses over the man of genius it was a bad column dull and unconvincing it made many people angry it was a waste of space and of a big salary wynand insisted on continuing it even alvah scarret was shocked by carsons apostasy anybody else gail he said but honest i didnt expect it of carson wynand laughed he laughed too long as if he could not stop it his laughter had an edge of hysteria scarret frowned he did not like the sight of wynand being unable to control an emotion it contradicted everything he knew of wynand it gave scarret a funny feeling of apprehension like the sight of a tiny crack in a solid wall the crack could not possibly endanger the wall except that it had no business being there a few months later wynand bought a young writer from a radical magazine a man known for his honesty and put him to work on a series of articles glorifying exceptional men and damning the masses that too made a great many of his readers angry he continued it he seemed not to care any longer about the delicate signs of effect on circulation he hired a sensitive poet to cover baseball games he hired an art expert to handle financial news he got a socialist to defend factory owners and a conservative to champion labor he forced an atheist to write on the glories of religion he made a disciplined scientist proclaim the superiority of mystical intuition over the scientific method he gave a great symphony conductor a munificent yearly income for no work at all on the sole condition that he never conduct an orchestra again some of these men had refused at first but they surrendered when they found themselves on the edge of bankruptcy through a series of untraceable circumstances within a few years some of the men were famous others obscure wynand showed no interest in the previous standing of his prey he showed no interest in men of glittering success who had commercialized their careers and held no particular beliefs of any kind his victims had a single attribute in common their immaculate integrity once they were broken wynand continued to pay them scrupulously but he felt no further concern for them and no desire to see them again dwight carson became a dipsomaniac two men became drug addicts one committed suicide this last was too much for scarret isnt it going too far gail he asked that was practically murder not at all said wynand i was merely an outside circumstance the cause was in him if lightning strikes a rotten tree and it collapses its not the fault of the lightning but what do you call a healthy tree they dont exist alvah said wynand cheerfully they dont exist alvah scarret never asked wynand for an explanation of this new pursuit by some dim instinct scarret guessed a little of the reason behind it scarret shrugged and laughed telling people that it was nothing to worry about it was just a safety valve only two men understood gail wynand alvah scarret partially ellsworth toohey completely ellsworth toohey who wished above all to avoid a quarrel with wynand at that time could not refrain from a feeling of resentment because wynand had not chosen him as a victim he almost wished wynand would try to corrupt him no matter what the consequences but wynand seldom noticed his existence wynand had never been afraid of death through the years the thought of suicide had occurred to him not as an intention but as one of the many possibilities among the chances of life he examined it indifferently with polite curiosity as he examined any possibility and then forgot it he had known moments of blank exhaustion when his will deserted him he had always cured himself by a few hours in his art gallery thus he reached the age of fiftyone and a day when nothing of consequence happened to him yet the evening found him without desire to take a step farther gail wynand sat on the edge of the bed slumped forward his elbows on his knees the gun on the palm of his hand yes he told himself theres an answer there somewhere but i dont want to know it i dont want to know it and because he felt a pang of dread at the root of this desire not to examine his life further he knew that he would not die tonight as long as he still feared something he had a foothold on living even if it meant only moving forward to an unknown disaster the thought of death gave him nothing the thought of living gave him a slender alms the hint of fear he moved his hand weighing the gun he smiled a faint smile of derision no he thought thats not for you not yet you still have the sense of not wanting to die senselessly you were stopped by that even that is a remnant of something he tossed the gun aside on the bed knowing that the moment was past and the thing was of no danger to him any longer he got up he felt no elation he felt tired but he was back in his normal course there were no problems except to finish this day quickly and go to sleep he went down to his study to get a drink when he switched on the light in the study he saw tooheys present it was a huge vertical crate standing by his desk he had seen it earlier in the evening he had thought what the hell and forgotten all about it he poured himself a drink and stood sipping it slowly the crate was too large to escape his field of vision and as he drank he tried to guess what it could possibly contain it was too tall and slender for a piece of furniture he could not imagine what material property toohey could wish to send him he had expected something less tangible a small envelope containing a hint at some sort of blackmail so many people had tried to blackmail him so unsuccessfully he did think toohey would have more sense than that by the time he finished his drink he had found no plausible explanation for the crate it annoyed him like a stubborn crossword puzzle he had a kit of tools somewhere in a drawer of his desk he found it and broke the crate open it was steven mallorys statue of dominique francon gail wynand walked to his desk and put down the pliers he held as if they were of fragile crystal then he turned and looked at the statue again he stood looking at it for an hour then he went to the telephone and dialed tooheys number hello said tooheys voice its hoarse impatience confessing that he had been awakened out of sound sleep all right come over said wynand and hung up toohey arrived half an hour later it was his first visit to wynands home wynand himself answered the doorbell still dressed in his pyjamas he said nothing and walked into the study toohey following the naked marble body its head thrown back in exaltation made the room look like a place that did not exist any longer like the stoddard temple wynands eyes rested on toohey expectantly a heavy glance of suppressed anger you want of course to know the name of the model toohey asked with just a hint of triumph in his voice hell no said wynand i want to know the name of the sculptor he wondered why toohey did not like the question there was something more than disappointment in tooheys face the sculptor said toohey wait let me see i think i did know it its steven or stanley stanley something or other honestly i dont remember if you knew enough to buy this you knew enough to ask the name and never forget it ill look it up mr wynand where did you get this in some art shop you know one of those places on second avenue how did it get there i dont know i didnt ask i bought it because i knew the model youre lying about that if that were all you saw in it you wouldnt have taken the chance you took you know that ive never let anyone see my gallery did you think id allow you the presumption of contributing to it nobody has ever dared offer me a gift of that kind you wouldnt have risked it unless you were sure terribly sure of how great a work of art this is sure that id have to accept it that youd beat me and you have im glad to hear it mr wynand if you wish to enjoy that ill tell you also that i hate seeing this come from you i hate your having been able to appreciate it it doesnt fit you though i was obviously wrong about you youre a greater art expert than i thought you were such as it is ill have to accept this as a compliment and thank you mr wynand now what was it you wanted you intended me to understand that you wont let me have this unless i grant an interview to mrs peter keating why no mr wynand ive made you a present of it i intended you only to understand that this is mrs peter keating wynand looked at the statue then back at toohey oh you damn fool said wynand softly toohey stared at him bewildered so you really did use this as a red lamp in a window wynand seemed relieved he did not find it necessary to hold tooheys glance now thats better toohey youre not as smart as i thought for a moment but mr wynand what didnt you realize that this statue would be the surest way to kill any possible appetite i might have for your mrs keating you havent seen her mr wynand oh shes probably beautiful she might be more beautiful than this but she cant have what that sculptor has given her and to see that same face but without any meaning like a dead caricature dont you think one would hate the woman for that you havent seen her oh all right ill see her i told you you should be allowed to get away with your stunt completely or not at all i didnt promise you to lay her did i only to see her that is all i wanted mr wynand have her telephone my office and make an appointment thank you mr wynand besides youre lying about not knowing the name of that sculptor but its too much bother to make you tell me shell tell me im sure shell tell you though why should i lie god knows by the way if it had been a lesser sculptor youd have lost your job over this but after all mr wynand i have a contract oh save that for your labor unions elsie and now i think you should wish me a good night and get out of here yes mr wynand i wish you a good night wynand accompanied him to the hall at the door wynand said youre a poor businessman toohey i dont know why youre so anxious to have me meet mrs keating i dont know what your racket is in trying to get a commission for that keating of yours but whatever it is it cant be so valuable that you should have been willing to part with a thing like this in exchange why didnt you wear your emerald bracelet asked peter keating gordon prescotts socalled fiancee had everybody gaping at her star sapphire im sorry peter i shall wear it next time said dominique it was a nice party did you have a good time i always have a good time so did i only oh god do you want to know the truth no dominique i was bored to death vincent knowlton is a pain in the neck hes such a damn snob i cant stand him he added cautiously i didnt show it did i no you behaved very well you laughed at all his jokes even when no one else did oh you noticed that it always works yes i noticed that you think i shouldnt dont you i havent said that you think its low dont you i dont think anything is low he slumped farther in his armchair it made his chin press uncomfortably against his chest but he did not care to move again a fire crackled in the fireplace of his living room he had turned out all the lights save one lamp with a yellow silk shade but it created no air of intimate relaxation it only made the place look deserted like a vacant apartment with the utilities shut off dominique sat at the other end of the room her thin body fitted obediently to the contours of a straightbacked chair she did not look stiff only too poised for comfort they were alone but she sat like a lady at a public function like a lovely dress dummy in a public show window a window facing a busy intersection they had come home from a tea party at the house of vincent knowlton a prominent young society man keatings new friend they had had a quiet dinner together and now their evening was free there were no other social engagements till tomorrow you shouldnt have laughed at theosophy when you spoke to mrs marsh he said she believes in it im sorry i shall be more careful he waited to have her open a subject of conversation she said nothing he thought suddenly that she had never spoken to him first in the twenty months of their marriage he told himself that that was ridiculous and impossible he tried to recall an occasion when she had addressed him of course she had he remembered her asking him what time will you get back tonight and do you wish to include the dixons for tuesdays dinner and many things like that he glanced at her she did not look bored or anxious to ignore him she sat there alert and ready as if his company held her full interest she did not reach for a book she did not stare at some distant thought of her own she looked straight at him not past him as if she were waiting for a conversation he realized that she had always looked straight at him like this and now he wondered whether he liked it yes he did it allowed him no cause to be jealous not even of her hidden thoughts no he didnt not quite it allowed no escape for either one of them ive just finished the gallant gallstone he said its a swell book its the product of a scintillating brain a puck with tears streaming down his face a goldenhearted clown holding for a moment the throne of god i read the same book review in the sunday banner i read the book itself you know i did that was nice of you huh he heard approval and it pleased him it was considerate toward the author im sure she likes to have people read her book so it was kind to take the time when you knew in advance what youd think of it i didnt know but i happened to agree with the reviewer the banner has the best reviewers thats true of course so theres nothing wrong in agreeing with them is there nothing whatever i always agree with whom with everybody are you making fun of me dominique have you given me reason to no i dont see how no of course i havent then im not he waited he heard a truck rumbling past in the street below and that filled a few seconds but when the sound died he had to speak again dominique id like to know what you think of what of of he searched for an important subject and ended with of vincent knowlton i think hes a man worth kissing the backside of for christs sake dominique im sorry thats bad english and bad manners its wrong of course well lets see vincent knowlton is a man whom its pleasant to know old families deserve a great deal of consideration and we must have tolerance for the opinions of others because tolerance is the greatest virtue therefore it would be unfair to force your views on vincent knowlton and if you just let him believe what he pleases he will be glad to help you too because hes a very human person now thats sensible said keating he felt at home in recognizable language i think tolerance is very important because he stopped he finished in an empty voice you said exactly the same thing as before did you notice that she said she said it without question mark indifferently as a simple fact it was not sarcasm he wished it were sarcasm would have granted him a personal recognition the desire to hurt him but her voice had never carried any personal relation to him not for twenty months he stared into the fire that was what made a man happy to sit looking dreamily into a fire at his own hearth in his own home thats what he had always heard and read he stared at the flames unblinking to force himself into a complete obedience to an established truth just one more minute of it and i will feel happy he thought concentrating nothing happened he thought of how convincingly he could describe this scene to friends and make them envy the fullness of his contentment why couldnt he convince himself he had everything hed ever wanted he had wanted superiority and for the last year he had been the undisputed leader of his profession he had wanted fame and he had five thick albums of clippings he had wanted wealth and he had enough to insure luxury for the rest of his life he had everything anyone ever wanted how many people struggled and suffered to achieve what he had achieved how many dreamed and bled and died for this without reaching it peter keating is the luckiest fellow on earth how often had he heard that this last year had been the best of his life he had added the impossible to his possessions dominique francon it had been such a joy to laugh casually when friends repeated to him peter how did you ever do it it had been such a pleasure to introduce her to strangers to say lightly my wife and to watch the stupid uncontrolled look of envy in their eyes once at a large party an elegant drunk had asked him with a wink declaring unmistakable intentions say do you know that gorgeous creature over there slightly keating had answered gratified shes my wife he often told himself gratefully that their marriage had turned out much better than he had expected dominique had become an ideal wife she devoted herself completely to his interests pleasing his clients entertaining his friends running his home she changed nothing in his existence not his hours not his favorite menus not even the arrangement of his furniture she had brought nothing with her except her clothes she had not added a single book or ash tray to his house when he expressed his views on any subject she did not argue she agreed with him graciously as a matter of natural course she took second place vanishing in his background he had expected a torrent that would lift him and smash him against some unknown rocks he had not found even a brook joining his peaceful river it was more as if the river went on and someone came to swim quietly in his wake no not even to swim that was a cutting forceful action but just to float behind him with the current had he been offered the power to determine dominiques attitude after their marriage he would have asked that she behave exactly as she did only their nights left him miserably unsatisfied she submitted whenever he wanted her but it was always as on their first night an indifferent body in his arms without revulsion without answer as far as he was concerned she was still a virgin he had never made her experience anything each time burning with humiliation he decided never to touch her again but his desire returned aroused by the constant presence of her beauty he surrendered to it when he could resist no longer not often it was his mother who stated the thing he had not admitted to himself about his marriage i cant stand it his mother said six months after the wedding if shed just get angry at me once call me names throw things at me it would be all right but i cant stand this what mother he asked feeling a cold hint of panic its no use peter she answered his mother whose arguments opinions reproaches he had never been able to stop would not say another word about his marriage she took a small apartment of her own and moved out of his house she came to visit him often and she was always polite to dominique with a strange beaten air of resignation he told himself that he should be glad to be free of his mother but he was not glad yet he could not grasp what dominique had done to inspire that mounting dread within him he could find no word or gesture for which to reproach her but for twenty months it had been like tonight he could not bear to remain alone with her yet he did not want to escape her and she did not want to avoid him nobodys coming tonight he asked tonelessly turning away from the fire no she said and smiled the smile serving as connection to her next words shall i leave you alone peter no it was almost a cry i must not sound so desperate he thought while he was saying aloud of course not im glad to have an evening with my wife all to myself he felt a dim instinct telling him that he must solve this problem must learn to make their moments together endurable that he dare not run from it for his own sake more than hers what would you like to do tonight dominique anything you wish want to go to a movie do you oh i dont know it kills time all right lets kill time no why should we that sounds awful does it why should we run from our own home lets stay here yes peter he waited but the silence he thought is a flight too a worse kind of flight want to play a hand of russian bank he asked do you like russian bank oh it kills ti he stopped she smiled dominique he said looking at her youre so beautiful youre always so so utterly beautiful i always want to tell you how i feel about it id like to hear how you feel about it peter i love to look at you i always think of what gordon prescott said he said that you are gods perfect exercise in structural mathematics and vincent knowlton said youre a spring morning and ellsworth ellsworth said youre a reproach to every other female shape on earth and ralston holcombe she asked oh never mind he snapped and turned back to the fire i know why i cant stand the silence he thought its because it makes no difference to her at all whether i speak or not as if i didnt exist and never had existed the thing more inconceivable than ones death never to have been born he felt a sudden desperate desire which he could identify a desire to be real to her dominique do you know what ive been thinking he asked eagerly no what have you been thinking ive thought of it for some time all by myself i havent mentioned it to anyone and nobody suggested it its my own idea why thats fine what is it i think id like to move to the country and build a house of our own would you like that id like it very much just as you would you want to design a home for yourself hell no bennett will dash one off for me he does all our country homes hes a whiz at it will you like commuting no i think that will be quite an awful nuisance but you know everybody thats anybody commutes nowadays i always feel like a damn proletarian when i have to admit that i live in the city will you like to see trees and a garden and the earth around you oh thats a lot of nonsense when will i have the time a trees a tree when youve seen a newsreel of the woods in spring youve seen it all will you like to do some gardening people say its very nice working the soil yourself good god no what kind of grounds do you think wed have we can afford a gardener and a good one so the place will be something for the neighbors to admire will you like to take up some sport yes ill like that which one i think ill do better with my golf you know belonging to a country club right where youre one of the leading citizens in the community is different from occasional week ends and the people you meet are different much higher class and the contacts you make he caught himself and added angrily also ill take up horseback riding i like horseback riding do you ive never had much time for it well it does shake your insides unmercifully but who the hell is gordon prescott to think hes the only heman on earth and plaster his photo in riding clothes right in his reception room i suppose you will want to find some privacy well i dont believe in that desertisland stuff i think the house should stand in sight of a major highway so people would point out you know the keating estate who the hell is claude stengel to have a country home while i live in a rented flat he started out about the same time i did and look where he is and where i am why hes lucky if two and a half men ever heard of him so why should he park himself in westchester and and he stopped she sat looking at him her face serene oh god damn it he cried if you dont want to move to the country why dont you just say so i want very much to do anything you want peter to follow any idea you get all by yourself he remained silent for a long time what do we do tomorrow night he asked before he could stop himself she rose walked to a desk and picked up her calendar we have the palmers for dinner tomorrow night she said oh christ he moaned theyre such awful bores why do we have to have them she stood holding the calendar forward between the tips of her fingers as if she were a photograph with the focus on the calendar and her own figure blurred in its background we have to have the palmers she said so that we can get the commission for their new store building we have to get that commission so that we can entertain the eddingtons for dinner on saturday the eddingtons have no commissions to give but theyre in the social register the palmers bore you and the eddingtons snub you but you have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you why do you have to say things like that would you like to look at this calendar peter well thats what everybody does thats what everybody lives for yes peter almost everybody if you dont approve why dont you say so have i said anything about not approving he thought back carefully no he admitted no you havent but its the way you put things would you rather i put it in a more involved way as i did about vincent knowlton id rather then he cried id rather youd express an opinion god damn it just once she asked in the same level monotone whose opinion peter gordon prescotts ralston holcombes ellsworth tooheys he turned to her leaning on the arm of his chair half rising suddenly tense the thing between them was beginning to take shape he had a first hint of words that would name it dominique he said softly reasonably thats it now i know i know whats been the matter all the time has anything been the matter wait this is terribly important dominique youve never said not once what you thought not about anything youve never expressed a desire not of any kind whats wrong about that but its its like death youre not real youre only a body look dominique you dont know it ill try to explain you understand what death is when a body cant move any more when it has no no will no meaning you understand nothing the absolute nothing well your body moves but thats all the other the thing inside you your oh dont misunderstand me im not talking religion but theres no other word for it so ill say your soul your soul doesnt exist no will no meaning theres no real you any more whats the real me she asked for the first time she looked attentive not compassionate but at least attentive whats the real anyone he said encouraged its not just the body its its the soul what is the soul its you the thing inside you the thing that thinks and values and makes decisions yes yes thats it and the thing that feels youve youve given it up so there are two things that one cant give up ones thoughts and ones desires yes oh you do understand so you see youre like a corpse to everybody around you a kind of walking death thats worse than any active crime its negation yes just blank negation youre not here youve never been here if youd tell me that the curtains in this room are ghastly and if youd rip them off and put up some you like something of you would be real here in this room but you never have youve never told the cook what dessert you liked for dinner youre not here dominique youre not alive wheres your i wheres yours peter she asked quietly he sat still his eyes wide she knew that his thoughts in this moment were clear and immediate like visual perception that the act of thinking was an act of seeing a procession of years behind him its not true he said at last his voice hollow its not true what is not true what you said ive said nothing i asked you a question his eyes were begging her to speak to deny she rose stood before him and the taut erectness of her body was a sign of life the life he had missed and begged for a positive quality of purpose but the quality of a judge youre beginning to see arent you peter shall i make it clearer youve never wanted me to be real you never wanted anyone to be but you didnt want to show it you wanted an act to help your act a beautiful complicated act all twists trimmings and words all words you didnt like what i said about vincent knowlton you liked it when i said the same thing under cover of virtuous sentiments you didnt want me to believe you only wanted me to convince you that i believed my real soul peter its real only when its independent youve discovered that havent you its real only when it chooses curtains and desserts youre right about that curtains desserts and religions peter and the shapes of buildings but youve never wanted that you wanted a mirror people want nothing but mirrors around them to reflect them while theyre reflecting too you know like the senseless infinity you get from two mirrors facing each other across a narrow passage usually in the more vulgar kind of hotels reflections of reflections and echoes of echoes no beginning and no end no center and no purpose i gave you what you wanted i became what you are what your friends are what most of humanity is so busy being only with the trimmings i didnt go around spouting book reviews to hide my emptiness of judgment i said i had no judgment i didnt borrow designs to hide my creative impotence i created nothing i didnt say that equality is a noble conception and unity the chief goal of mankind i just agreed with everybody you call it death peter that kind of death ive imposed it on you and on everyone around us but you you havent done that people are comfortable with you they like you they enjoy your presence youve spared them the blank death because youve imposed it on yourself he said nothing she walked away from him and sat down again waiting he got up he made a few steps toward her he said dominique then he was on his knees before her clutching her his head buried against her legs dominique its not true that i never loved you i love you i always have it was not just to show the others that was not all i loved you there were two people you and another person a man who always made me feel the same thing not fear exactly but like a wall a steep wall to climb like a command to rise i dont know where but a feeling going up ive always hated that man but you i wanted you always thats why i married you when i knew you despised me so you should have forgiven me that marriage you shouldnt have taken your revenge like this not like this dominique dominique i cant fight back i who is the man you hated peter it doesnt matter who is he nobody i name him howard roark she said nothing for a long time then she put her hand on his hair the gesture had the form of gentleness i never wanted to take a revenge on you peter she said softly then why i married you for my own reasons i acted as the world demands one should act only i can do nothing halfway those who can have a fissure somewhere inside most people have many they lie to themselves not to know that ive never lied to myself so i had to do what you all do only consistently and completely ive probably destroyed you if i could care id say im sorry that was not my purpose dominique i love you but im afraid because youve changed something in me ever since our wedding since i said yes to you even if i were to lose you now i couldnt go back to what i was before you took something i had no i took something you never had i grant you thats worse what its said that the worst thing one can do to a man is to kill his selfrespect but thats not true selfrespect is something that cant be killed the worst thing is to kill a mans pretense at it dominique i i dont want to talk she looked down at his face resting against her knees and he saw pity in her eyes and for one moment he knew what a dreadful thing true pity is but he kept no knowledge of it because he slammed his mind shut before the words in which he was about to preserve it she bent down and kissed his forehead it was the first kiss she had ever given him i dont want you to suffer peter she said gently this now is real its i its my own words i dont want you to suffer i cant feel anything else but i feel that much he pressed his lips to her hand when he raised his head she looked at him as if for a moment he was her husband she said peter if you could hold on to it to what you are now i love you he said they sat silently together for a long time he felt no strain in the silence the telephone rang it was not the sound that destroyed the moment it was the eagerness with which keating jumped up and ran to answer it she heard his voice through the open door a voice indecent in its relief hello oh hello ellsworth no not a thing free as a lark sure come over come right over okeydoke its ellsworth he said returning to the living room his voice was gay and it had a touch of insolence he wants to drop in she said nothing he busied himself emptying ash trays that contained a single match or one butt gathering newspapers adding a log to the fire that did not need it lighting more lamps he whistled a tune from a screen operetta he ran to open the door when he heard the bell how nice said toohey coming in a fire and just the two of you hello dominique hope im not intruding hello ellsworth she said youre never intruding said keating i cant tell you how glad i am to see you he pushed a chair to the fire sit down here ellsworth whatll you have you know when i heard your voice on the phone well i wanted to jump and yelp like a pup dont wag your tail though said toohey no no drinks thanks how have you been dominique just as i was a year ago she said but not as you were two years ago no what did we do two years ago this time keating asked idly you werent married said toohey prehistorical period let me see what happened then i think the stoddard temple was just being completed oh that said keating toohey asked hear anything about your friend roark peter no i dont think hes worked for a year or more hes finished this time yes i think so what have you been doing peter nothing much oh ive just read the gallant gallstone liked it yes you know i think its a very important book because its true that theres no such thing as free will we cant help what we are or what we do its not our fault nobodys to blame for anything its all in your background and and your glands if youre good thats no achievement of yours you were lucky in your glands if youre rotten nobody should punish you you were unlucky thats all he was saying it defiantly with a violence inappropriate to a literary discussion he was not looking at toohey nor at dominique but speaking to the room and to what that room had witnessed substantially correct said toohey to be logical however we should not think of punishment for those who are rotten since they suffered through no fault of their own since they were unlucky and underendowed they should deserve a compensation of some sort more like a reward why yes cried keating thats thats logical and just said toohey got the banner pretty much where you want it ellsworth asked dominique whats that in reference to the gallant gallstone oh no i cant say i have not quite there are always the imponderables what are you talking about asked keating professional gossip said toohey he stretched his hands to the fire and flexed his fingers playfully by the way peter are you doing anything about stoneridge god damn it said keating whats the matter you know whats the matter you know the bastard better than i do to have a project like that going up now when its manna in the desert and of all people to have that son of a bitch wynand doing it whats the matter with mr wynand oh come ellsworth you know very well if it were anyone else id get that commission just like that he snapped his fingers i wouldnt even have to ask the ownerd come to me particularly when he knows that an architect like me is practically sitting on his fanny now compared to the work our office could handle but mr gail wynand youd think he was a holy lama whos just allergic to the air breathed by architects i gather youve tried oh dont talk about it it makes me sick i think ive spent three hundred dollars feeding lunches and pouring liquor into all sorts of crappy people who said they could get me to meet him all i got is hangovers i think itd be easier to meet the pope i gather you do want to get stoneridge are you baiting me ellsworth id give my right arm for it that wouldnt be advisable you couldnt make any drawings then or pretend to it would be preferable to give up something less tangible id give my soul would you peter asked dominique whats on your mind ellsworth keating snapped just a practical suggestion said toohey who has been your most effective salesman in the past and got you some of your best commissions why dominique i guess thats right and since you cant get to wynand and it wouldnt do you any good if you did dont you think dominique is the one wholl be able to persuade him keating stared at him are you crazy ellsworth dominique leaned forward she seemed interested from what ive heard she said gail wynand does not do favors for a woman unless shes beautiful and if shes beautiful he doesnt do it as a favor toohey looked at her underscoring the fact that he offered no denial its silly snapped keating angrily how would dominique ever get to see him by telephoning his office and making an appointment said toohey who ever told you hed grant it he did when late last night or early this morning to be exact ellsworth gasped keating he added i dont believe it i do said dominique or ellsworth wouldnt have started this conversation she smiled at toohey so wynand promised you to see me yes my dear how did you work that oh i offered him a convincing argument however it would be advisable not to delay it you should telephone him tomorrow if you wish to do it why cant she telephone now said keating oh i guess its too late youll telephone first thing in the morning she looked at him her eyes half closed and said nothing its a long time since youve taken any active interest in peters career said toohey wouldnt you like to undertake a difficult feat like that for peters sake if peter wants me to if i want you to cried keating are you both crazy its the chance of a lifetime the he saw them both looking at him curiously he snapped oh rubbish what is rubbish peter asked dominique are you going to be stopped by a lot of fool gossip why any other architects wifed crawl on her hands and knees for a chance like that to no other architects wife would be offered the chance said toohey no other architect has a wife like dominique youve always been so proud of that peter dominique can take care of herself in any circumstances theres no doubt about that all right ellsworth said dominique ill telephone wynand tomorrow ellsworth youre wonderful said keating not looking at her i believe id like a drink now said toohey we should celebrate when keating hurried out to the kitchen toohey and dominique looked at each other he smiled he glanced at the door through which keating had gone then nodded to her faintly amused you expected it said dominique of course now whats the real purpose ellsworth why i want to help you get stoneridge for peter its really a terrific commission why are you so anxious to have me sleep with wynand dont you think it would be an interesting experience for all concerned youre not satisfied with the way my marriage has turned out are you ellsworth not entirely just about fifty percent well nothings perfect in this world one gathers what one can and then one tries further you were very anxious to have peter marry me you knew what the result would be better than peter or i peter didnt know it at all well it worked fifty percent you got peter keating where you wanted him the leading architect of the country whos now mud clinging to your galoshes ive never liked your style of expression but its always been accurate i should have said whos now a soul wagging its tail your style is gentler but the other fifty percent ellsworth a failure approximately total my fault i should have known better than to expect anyone like peter keating even in the role of husband to destroy you well youre frank i told you once its the only method that will work with you besides surely it didnt take you two years to discover what i wanted of that marriage so you think gail wynand will finish the job might what do you think i think im only a side issue again didnt you call it gravy once what have you got against wynand he laughed the sound betrayed that he had not expected the question she said contemptuously dont show that youre shocked ellsworth all right were taking it straight i have nothing specific against mr gail wynand ive been planning to have him meet you for a long time if you want minor details he did something that annoyed me yesterday morning hes too observant so i decided the time was right and there was stoneridge and there was stoneridge i knew that part of it would appeal to you youd never sell yourself to save your country your soul or the life of a man you loved but youll sell yourself to get a commission he doesnt deserve for peter keating see what will be left of you afterward or of gail wynand ill be interested to see it too quite correct ellsworth all of it even the part about a man you loved if you did yes you wouldnt sell yourself for roark though of course you dont like to hear that name pronounced howard roark she said evenly you have a great deal of courage dominique keating returned carrying a tray of cocktails his eyes were feverish and he made too many gestures toohey raised his glass he said to gail wynand and the new york banner gail wynand rose and met her halfway across his office how do you do mrs keating he said how do you do mr wynand said dominique he moved a chair for her but when she sat down he did not cross to sit behind his desk he stood studying her professionally appraisingly his manner implied a selfevident necessity as if his reason were known to her and there could be nothing improper in this behavior you look like a stylized version of your own stylized version he said as a rule seeing the models of art works tends to make one atheistic but this time its a close one between that sculptor and god what sculptor the one who did that statue of you he had felt that there was some story behind the statue and he became certain of it now by something in her face a tightening that contradicted for a second the trim indifference of her selfcontrol where and when did you see that statue mr wynand in my art gallery this morning where did you get it it was his turn to show perplexity but dont you know that no your friend ellsworth toohey sent it to me as a present to get this appointment for me not through as direct a motivation as i believe youre thinking but in substance yes he hasnt told me that do you mind my having that statue not particularly i expected you to say that you were delighted im not he sat down informally on the outer edge of his desk his legs stretched out his ankles crossed he asked i gather you lost track of that statue and have been trying to find it for two years you cant have it he added watching her you might have stoneridge i shall change my mind im delighted that toohey gave it to you he felt a bitter little stab of triumph and of disappointment in thinking that he could read her mind and that her mind was obvious after all he asked because it gave you this interview no because youre the person before last in the world whom id like to have that statue but toohey is last he lost the triumph it was not a thing which a woman intent on stoneridge should have said or thought he asked you didnt know that toohey had it no we should get together on our mutual friend mr ellsworth toohey i dont like being a pawn and i dont think you do or could ever be made to there are too many things mr toohey chose not to tell the name of that sculptor for instance he didnt tell you that no steven mallory mallory not the one who tried to he laughed aloud whats the matter toohey told me he couldnt remember the name that name does mr toohey still astonish you he has several times in the last few days theres a special kind of subtlety in being as blatant as hes been a very difficult kind i almost like his artistry i dont share your taste not in any field not in sculpture or architecture im sure not in architecture isnt that the utterly wrong thing for you to say probably he looked at her he said youre interesting i didnt intend to be thats your third mistake third the first was about mr toohey in the circumstances one would expect you to praise him to me to quote him to lean on his great prestige in matters of architecture but one would expect you to know ellsworth toohey that should disqualify any quotations i intended to say that to you had you given me the chance you wont give me that should make it more entertaining you expected to be entertained i am about the statue it was the only point of weakness he had discovered no her voice was hard not about the statue tell me when was it made and for whom is that another thing mr toohey forgot apparently do you remember a scandal about a building called the stoddard temple two years ago you were away at the time the stoddard temple how do you happen to know where i was two years ago wait the stoddard temple i remember a sacrilegious church or some such object that gave the bible brigade a howling spree yes there was he stopped his voice sounded hard and reluctant like hers there was the statue of a naked woman involved yes i see he was silent for a moment then he said his voice harsh as if he were holding back some anger whose object she could not guess i was somewhere around bali at the time im sorry all new york saw that statue before i did but i dont read newspapers when im sailing theres a standing order to fire any man who brings a wynand paper around the yacht have you ever seen pictures of the stoddard temple no was the building worthy of the statue the statue was almost worthy of the building it has been destroyed hasnt it yes with the help of the wynand papers he shrugged i remember alvah scarret had a good time with it a big story sorry i missed it but alvah did very well incidentally how did you know that i was away and why has the fact of my absence remained in your memory it was the story that cost me my job with you your job with me didnt you know that my name was dominique francon under the trim jacket his shoulders made a sagging movement forward it was surprise and helplessness he stared at her quite simply after a while he said no she smiled indifferently she said it appears that toohey wanted to make it as difficult for both of us as he could to hell with toohey this has to be understood it doesnt make sense youre dominique francon i was you worked here in this building for years for six years why havent i met you before im sure you dont meet every one of your employees i think you understand what i mean do you wish me to state it for you yes why havent i tried to meet you before yes i had no desire to that precisely doesnt make sense shall i let this go by or understand it ill spare you the choice with the kind of beauty you possess and with knowledge of the kind of reputation i am said to possess why didnt you attempt to make a real career for yourself on the banner i never wanted a real career on the banner why perhaps for the same reason that makes you forbid wynand papers on your yacht its a good reason he said quietly then he asked his voice casual again lets see what was it you did to get fired you went against our policy i believe i tried to defend the stoddard temple didnt you know better than to attempt sincerity on the banner i intended to say that to you if youd given me the chance are you being entertained i wasnt then i liked working here youre the only one whos ever said that in this building i must be one of two whos the other yourself mr wynand dont be too sure of that lifting his head he saw the hint of amusement in her eyes and asked you said it just to trap me into that kind of a statement yes i think so she answered placidly dominique francon he repeated not addressing her i used to like your stuff i almost wish you were here to ask for your old job im here to discuss stoneridge ah yes of course he settled back to enjoy a long speech of persuasion he thought it would be interesting to hear what arguments shed choose and how shed act in the role of petitioner well what do you wish to tell me about that i should like you to give that commission to my husband i understand of course that theres no reason why you should do so unless i agree to sleep with you in exchange if you consider that a sufficient reason i am willing to do it he looked at her silently allowing no hint of personal reaction in his face she sat looking up at him faintly astonished by his scrutiny as if her words had deserved no special attention he could not force on himself though he was seeking it fiercely any other impression of her face than the incongruous one of undisturbed purity he said that is what i was to suggest but not so crudely and not on our first meeting i have saved you time and lies you love your husband very much i despise him you have a great faith in his artistic genius i think hes a thirdrate architect then why are you doing this it amuses me i thought i was the only who acted on such motives you shouldnt mind i dont believe youve ever found originality a desirable virtue mr wynand actually you dont care whether your husband gets stoneridge or not no and you have no desire to sleep with me none at all i could admire a woman whod put on an act like that only its not an act its not please dont begin admiring me i have tried to avoid it whenever he smiled no obvious movement was required of his facial muscles the hint of mockery was always there and it merely came into sharper focus for a moment to recede imperceptibly again the focus was sharper now as a matter of fact he said your chief motive is i after all the desire to give yourself to me he saw the glance she could not control and added no dont enjoy the thought that i have fallen into so gross an error i didnt mean it in the usual sense but in its exact opposite didnt you say you considered me the person before last in the world you dont want stoneridge you want to sell yourself for the lowest motive to the lowest person you can find i didnt expect you to understand that she said simply you want men do that sometimes not women to express through the sexual act your utter contempt for me no mr wynand for myself the thin line of his mouth moved faintly as if his lips had caught the first hint of a personal revelation an involuntary one and therefore a weakness and were holding it tight while he spoke most people go to very to very great lengths in order to convince themselves of their selfrespect yes and of course a quest for selfrespect is proof of its lack yes do you see the meaning of a quest for selfcontempt that i lack it and that youll never achieve it i didnt expect you to understand that either i wont say anything else or ill stop being the person before last in the world and ill become unsuitable to your purpose he rose shall i tell you formally that i accept your offer she inclined her head in agreement as a matter of fact he said i dont care whom i choose to build stoneridge ive never hired a good architect for any of the things ive built i give the public what it wants i was stuck for a choice this time because im tired of the bunglers whove worked for me and its hard to decide without standards or reason im sure you dont mind my saying this im really grateful to you for giving me a much better motive than any i could hope to find im glad you didnt say that youve always admired the work of peter keating you didnt tell me how glad you were to join the distinguished list of gail wynands mistresses you may enjoy my admitting it if you wish but i think well get along very well together quite likely at least youve given me a new experience to do what ive always done but honestly shall i now begin to give you my orders i wont pretend theyre anything else if you wish youll go with me for a two months cruise on my yacht well sail in ten days when we come back youll be free to return to your husband with the contract for stoneridge very well i should like to meet your husband will you both have dinner with me monday night yes if you wish when she rose to leave he asked shall i tell you the difference between you and your statue no but i want to its startling to see the same elements used in two compositions with opposite themes everything about you in that statue is the theme of exaltation but your own theme is suffering suffering im not conscious of having shown that you havent thats what i meant no happy person can be quite so impervious to pain wynand telephoned his art dealer and asked him to arrange a private showing of steven mallorys work he refused to meet mallory in person he never met those whose work he liked the art dealer executed the order in great haste wynand bought five of the pieces he saw and paid more than the dealer had hoped to ask mr mallory would like to know said the dealer what brought him to your attention i saw one of his works which one it doesnt matter toohey had expected wynand to call for him after the interview with dominique wynand had not called but a few days later meeting toohey by chance in the city room wynand asked aloud mr toohey have so many people tried to kill you that you cant remember their names toohey smiled and said im sure quite so many would like to you flatter your fellow men said wynand walking away peter keating stared at the brilliant room of the restaurant it was the most exclusive place in town and the most expensive keating gloated chewing the thought that he was here as the guest of gail wynand he tried not to stare at the gracious elegance of wynands figure across the table he blessed wynand for having chosen to give this dinner in a public place people were gaping at wynand discreetly and with practiced camouflage but gaping nevertheless and their attention included the two guests at wynands table dominique sat between the two men she wore a white silk dress with long sleeves and a cowl neck a nuns garment that acquired the startling effect of an evening gown only by being so flagrantly unsuited to that purpose she wore no jewelry her gold hair looked like a hood the dull white silk moved in angular planes with the movements of her body revealing it in the manner of cold innocence the body of a sacrificial object publicly offered beyond the need of concealment or desire keating found it unattractive he noticed that wynand seemed to admire it someone at a distant table stared in their direction insistently someone tall and bulky then the big shape rose to its feet and keating recognized ralston holcombe hurrying toward them peter my boy so glad to see you boomed holcombe shaking his hand bowing to dominique conspicuously ignoring wynand where have you been hiding why dont we see you around any more they had had luncheon together three days ago wynand had risen and stood leaning forward a little courteously keating hesitated then with obvious reluctance said mr wynand mr holcombe not mr gail wynand said holcombe with splendid innocence mr holcombe if you saw one of the coughdrop smith brothers in real life would you recognize him asked wynand why i guess so said holcombe blinking my face mr holcombe is just as much of a public bromide holcombe muttered a few benevolent generalities and escaped wynand smiled affectionately you didnt have to be afraid of introducing mr holcombe to me mr keating even though he is an architect afraid mr wynand unnecessarily since its all settled hasnt mrs keating told you that stoneridge is yours i no she hasnt told me i didnt know wynand was smiling but the smile remained fixed and keating felt compelled to go on talking until some sign stopped him i hadnt quite hoped not so soon of course i thought this dinner might be a sign help you to decide he blurted out involuntarily do you always throw surprises like that just like that whenever i can said wynand gravely i shall do my best to deserve this honor and live up to your expectations mr wynand i have no doubt about that said wynand he had said little to dominique tonight his full attention seemed centered on keating the public has been kind to my past endeavors said keating but i shall make stoneridge my best achievement that is quite a promise considering the distinguished list of your works i had not hoped that my works were of sufficient importance to attract your attention mr wynand but i know them quite well the cosmoslotnick building which is pure michelangelo keatings face spread in incredulous pleasure he knew that wynand was a great authority on art and would not make such comparisons lightly the prudential bank building which is genuine palladio the slottern department store which is snitched christopher wren keatings face had changed look what an illustrious company i get for the price of one isnt it quite a bargain keating smiled his face tight and said ive heard about your brilliant sense of humor mr wynand have you heard about my descriptive style what do you mean wynand half turned in his chair and looked at dominique as if he were inspecting an inanimate object your wife has a lovely body mr keating her shoulders are too thin but admirably in scale with the rest of her her legs are too long but that gives her the elegance of line youll find in a good yacht her breasts are beautiful dont you think architecture is a crude profession mr wynand keating tried to laugh it doesnt prepare one for the superior sort of sophistication you dont understand me mr keating if i didnt know you were a perfect gentleman i might misunderstand it but you cant fool me that is just what i am trying not to do i appreciate compliments mr wynand but im not conceited enough to think that we must talk about my wife why not mr keating it is considered good form to talk of the things one has or will have in common mr wynand i i dont understand shall i be more explicit no i no shall we drop the subject of stoneridge oh lets talk about stoneridge i but we are mr keating keating looked at the room about them he thought that things like this could not be done in such a place the fastidious magnificence made it monstrous he wished it were a dank cellar he thought blood on paving stones all right but not blood on a drawingroom rug now i know this is a joke mr wynand he said it is my turn to admire your sense of humor mr keating things like like this arent being done thats not what you mean at all mr keating you mean theyre being done all the time but not talked about i didnt think you thought it before you came here you didnt mind i grant you im behaving abominably im breaking all the rules of charity its extremely cruel to be honest please mr wynand lets drop it i dont know what im supposed to do thats simple youre supposed to slap my face keating giggled you were supposed to do that several minutes ago keating noticed that his palms were wet and that he was trying to support his weight by holding on to the napkin on his lap wynand and dominique were eating slowly and graciously as if they were at another table keating thought that they were not human bodies either one of them something had vanished the light of the crystal fixtures in the room was the radiance of xrays that ate through not the bones but deeper they were souls he thought sitting at a dinner table souls held with evening clothes lacking the intermediate shape of flesh terrifying in naked revelation terrifying because he expected to see torturers but saw a great innocence he wondered what they saw what his own clothes contained if his physical shape had gone no said wynand you dont want to do that mr keating but of course you dont have to just say that you dont want any of it i wont mind theres mr ralston holcombe across the room he can build stoneridge as well as you could i dont know what you mean mr wynand whispered keating his eyes were fixed upon the tomato aspic on his salad plate it was soft and shivering it made him sick wynand turned to dominique do you remember our conversation about a certain quest mrs keating i said it was a quest at which you would never succeed look at your husband hes an expert without effort that is the way to go about it match that sometime dont bother to tell me that you cant i know it youre an amateur my dear keating thought that he must speak again but he couldnt not as long as that salad was there before him the terror came from that plate not from the fastidious monster across the table the rest of the room was warm and safe he lurched forward and his elbow swept the plate off the table he made a kind of sound expressing regrets somebodys shape came up there were polite voices of apology and the mess vanished from the carpet keating heard a voice saying why are you doing this saw two faces turned to him and knew that he had said it mr wynand is not doing it to torture you peter said dominique calmly hes doing it for me to see how much i can take thats true mrs keating said wynand partly true the other part is to justify myself in whose eyes yours and my own perhaps do you need to sometimes the banner is a contemptible paper isnt it well i have paid with my honor for the privilege of holding a position where i can amuse myself by observing how honor operates in other men his own clothes thought keating contained nothing now because the two faces did not notice him any longer he was safe his place at that table was empty he wondered from a great indifferent distance why the two were looking at each other quietly not like enemies not like fellow executioners but like comrades two days before they were to sail wynand telephoned dominique late in the evening could you come over right now he asked and hearing a moments silence added oh not what youre thinking i live up to my agreements youll be quite safe i just would like to see you tonight all right she said and was astonished to hear a quiet thank you when the elevator door slid open in the private lobby of his penthouse he was waiting there but did not let her step out he joined her in the elevator i dont want you to enter my house he said were going to the floor below the elevator operator looked at him amazed the car stopped and opened before a locked door wynand unlocked it and let her step out first following her into the art gallery she remembered that this was the place no outsider ever entered she said nothing he offered no explanation four hours she walked silently through the vast rooms looking at the incredible treasures of beauty there was a deep carpet and no sound of steps no sounds from the city outside no windows he followed her stopping when she stopped his eyes went with hers from object to object at times his glance moved to her face she passed without stopping by the statue from the stoddard temple he did not urge her to stay nor to hurry as if he had turned the place over to her she decided when she wished to leave and he followed her to the door then she asked why did you want me to see this it wont make me think better of you worse perhaps yes id expect that he said quietly if i had thought of it that way but i didnt i just wanted you to see it the sun had set when they stepped out of the car in the spread of sky and sea a green sky over a sheet of mercury tracings of fire remained at the edges of the clouds and in the brass fittings of the yacht the yacht was like a white streak of motion a sensitive body strained against the curb of stillness dominique looked at the gold letters i do on the delicate white bow what does that name mean she asked its an answer said wynand to people long since dead though perhaps they are the only immortal ones you see the sentence i heard most often in my childhood was you dont run things around here she remembered hearing that he had never answered this question before he had answered her at once he had not seemed conscious of making an exception she felt a sense of calm in his manner strange and new to him an air of quiet finality when they went aboard the yacht started moving almost as if wynands steps on deck had served as contact he stood at the rail not touching her he looked at the long brown shore that rose and fell against the sky moving away from them then he turned to her she saw no new recognition in his eyes no beginning but only the continuation of a glance as if he had been looking at her all the time when they went below he walked with her into her cabin he said please let me know if theres anything you wish and walked out through an inside door she saw that it led to his bedroom he closed the door and did not return she moved idly across the cabin a smear of reflection followed her on the lustrous surfaces of the pale satinwood paneling she stretched out in a low armchair her ankles crossed her arms thrown behind her head and watched the porthole turning from green to a dark blue she moved her hand switched on a light the blue vanished and became a glazed black circle the steward announced dinner wynand knocked at her door and accompanied her to the dining salon his manner puzzled her it was gay but the sense of calm in the gaiety suggested a peculiar earnestness she asked when they were seated at the table why did you leave me alone i thought you might want to be alone to get used to the idea if you wish to put it that way i was used to it before i came to your office yes of course forgive me for implying any weakness in you i know better by the way you havent asked me where were going that too would be weakness true im glad you dont care because i never have any definite destination this ship is not for going to places but for getting away from them when i stop at a port its only for the sheer pleasure of leaving it i always think heres one more spot that cant hold me i used to travel a great deal i always felt just like that ive been told its because im a hater of mankind youre not foolish enough to believe that are you i dont know surely youve seen through that particular stupidity i mean the one that claims the pig is the symbol of love for humanity the creature that accepts anything as a matter of fact the person who loves everybody and feels at home everywhere is the true hater of mankind he expects nothing of men so no form of depravity can outrage him you mean the person who says that theres some good in the worst of us i mean the person who has the filthy insolence to claim that he loves equally the man who made that statue of you and the man who makes a mickey mouse balloon to sell on street corners i mean the person who loves the men who prefer the mickey mouse to your statue and there are many of that kind i mean the person who loves joan of arc and the salesgirls in dress shops on broadway with an equal fervor i mean the person who loves your beauty and the women he sees in a subway the kind that cant cross their knees and show flesh hanging publicly over their garters with the same sense of exaltation i mean the person who loves the clean steady unfrightened eyes of man looking through a telescope and the white stare of an imbecile equally i mean quite a large generous magnanimous company is it you who hate mankind mrs keating youre saying all the things that since i can remember since i began to see and think have been she stopped have been torturing you of course one cant love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name its one or the other one doesnt love god and sacrilege impartially except when one doesnt know that sacrilege has been committed because one doesnt know god what will you say if i give you the answer people usually give me that love is forgiveness ill say its an indecency of which youre not capable even though you think youre an expert in such matters or that love is pity oh keep still its bad enough to hear things like that to hear them from you is revolting even as a joke whats your answer that love is reverence and worship and glory and the upward glance not a bandage for dirty sores but they dont know it those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones whove never felt it they make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy compassion contempt and general indifference and they call it love once youve felt what it means to love as you and i know it the total passion for the total height youre incapable of anything less as you and i know it its what we feel when we look at a thing like your statue theres no forgiveness in that and no pity and id want to kill the man who claims that there should be but you see when he looks at your statue he feels nothing that or a dog with a broken paw its all the same to him he even feels that hes done something nobler by bandaging the dogs paw than by looking at your statue so if you seek a glimpse of greatness if you want exaltation if you ask for god and refuse to accept the washing of wounds as substitute youre called a hater of humanity mrs keating because youve committed the crime of knowing a love humanity has not learned to deserve mr wynand have you read what i got fired for no i didnt then i dont dare to now why he ignored the question he said smiling and so you came to me and said youre the vilest person on earth take me so that ill learn selfcontempt i lack that which most people live by they find life endurable while i cant do you see now what youve shown i didnt expect it to be seen no not by the publisher of the new york banner of course thats all right i expected a beautiful slut who was a friend of ellsworth toohey they laughed together she thought it was strange that they could talk without strain as if he had forgotten the purpose of this journey his calm had become a contagious sense of peace between them she watched the unobtrusively gracious way their dinner was served she looked at the white tablecloth against the deep red of the mahogany walls everything on the yacht had an air that made her think it was the first truly luxurious place she had ever entered the luxury was secondary a background so proper to him that it could be ignored the man humbled his own wealth she had seen people of wealth stiff and awed before that which represented their ultimate goal the splendor of this place was not the aim not the final achievement of the man who leaned casually across the table she wondered what his aim had been this ship is becoming to you she said she saw a look of pleasure in his eyes and of gratitude thank you is the art gallery yes only thats less excusable i dont want you to make excuses for me he said it simply without reproach they had finished dinner she waited for the inevitable invitation it did not come he sat smoking talking about the yacht and the ocean her hand came to rest accidentally on the tablecloth close to his she saw him looking at it she wanted to jerk her hand away but forced herself to let it lie still now she thought he got up lets go on deck he said they stood at the rail and looked at a black void space was not to be seen only felt by the quality of the air against their faces a few stars gave reality to the empty sky a few sparks of white fire in the water gave life to the ocean he stood slouched carelessly one arm raised grasping a stanchion she saw the sparks flowing forming the edges of waves framed by the curve of his body that too was becoming to him she said may i name another vicious bromide youve never felt which one youve never felt how small you were when looking at the ocean he laughed never nor looking at the planets nor at mountain peaks nor at the grand canyon why should i when i look at the ocean i feel the greatness of man i think of mans magnificent capacity that created this ship to conquer all that senseless space when i look at mountain peaks i think of tunnels and dynamite when i look at the planets i think of airplanes yes and that particular sense of sacred rapture men say they experience in contemplating nature ive never received it from nature only from she stopped from what buildings she whispered skyscrapers why didnt you want to say that i dont know i would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of new yorks skyline particularly when one cant see the details just the shapes the shapes and the thought that made them the sky over new york and the will of man made visible what other religion do we need and then people tell me about pilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a crumbling temple to a leering stone monster with a pot belly created by some leprous savage is it beauty and genius they want to see do they seek a sense of the sublime let them come to new york stand on the shore of the hudson look and kneel when i see the city from my window no i dont feel how small i am but i feel that if a war came to threaten this i would like to throw myself into space over the city and protect these buildings with my body gail i dont know whether im listening to you or to myself did you hear yourself just now she smiled actually not but i wont take it back gail thank you dominique his voice was soft and amused but we werent talking about you or me we were talking about other people he leaned with both forearms on the rail he spoke watching the sparks in the water its interesting to speculate on the reasons that make men so anxious to debase themselves as in that idea of feeling small before nature its not a bromide its practically an institution have you noticed how selfrighteous a man sounds when he tells you about it look he seems to say im so glad to be a pygmy thats how virtuous i am have you heard with what delight people quote some great celebrity whos proclaimed that hes not so great when he looks at niagara falls its as if they were smacking their lips in sheer glee that their best is dust before the brute force of an earthquake as if they were sprawling on all fours rubbing their foreheads in the mud to the majesty of a hurricane but thats not the spirit that leashed fire steam electricity that crossed oceans in sailing sloops that built airplanes and dams and skyscrapers what is it they fear what is they hate so much those who love to crawl and why when i find the answer to that she said ill make my peace with the world he went on talking of his travels of the continents beyond the darkness around them the darkness that made of space a soft curtain pressed against their eyelids she waited she stopped answering she gave him a chance to use the brief silences for ending this for saying the words she expected he would not say them are you tired my dear he asked no ill get you a deck chair if you want to sit down no i like standing here its a little cold but by tomorrow well be far south and then youll see the ocean on fire at night its very beautiful he was silent she heard the ships speed in the sound of the water the rustling moan of protest against the thing that cut a long wound across the waters surface when are we going below she asked were not going below he had said it quietly with an odd kind of simplicity as if he were standing helpless before a fact he could not alter will you marry me he asked she could not hide the shock he had seen it in advance he was smiling quietly understanding it would be best to say nothing else he spoke carefully but you prefer to hear it stated because that kind of silence between us is more than i have a right to expect you dont want to tell me much but ive spoken for you tonight so let me speak for you again youve chosen me as the symbol of your contempt for men you dont love me you wish to grant me nothing im only your tool of selfdestruction i know all that i accept it and i want you to marry me if you wish to commit an unspeakable act as your revenge against the world such an act is not to sell yourself to your enemy but to marry him not to match your worst against his worst but your worst against his best youve tried that once but your victim wasnt worthy of your purpose you see im pleading my case on your own terms what mine are what i want to find in that marriage is of no importance to you and i shall regard it in that manner you dont have to know about it you dont have to consider it i exact no promises and impose no obligations on you youll be free to leave me whenever you wish incidentally since it is of no concern to you i love you she stood one arm stretched behind her fingertips pressed to the rail she said i did not want that i know but if youre curious about it ill tell you that youve made a mistake you let me see the cleanest person ive ever seen isnt that ridiculous after the way we met dominique ive spent my life pulling the strings of the world ive seen all of it do you think i could believe any purity unless it came to me twisted in some such dreadful shape as the one you chose but what i feel must not affect your decision she stood looking at him looking incredulously at all the hours past her mouth had the shape of gentleness he saw it she thought that every word he said today had been of her language that this offer and the form he gave it were of her own world and that he had destroyed his purpose by it taken away from her the motive he suggested made it impossible to seek degradation with a man who spoke as he did she wanted suddenly to reach for him to tell him everything to find a moments release in his understanding then ask him never to see her again then she remembered he noticed the movement of her hand her fingers were not clinging tensely against the rail betraying a need of support giving importance to the moment they relaxed and closed about the rail as if she had taken hold of some reins carelessly because the occasion required no earnest effort any longer she remembered the stoddard temple she thought of the man before her who spoke about the total passion for the total height and about protecting skyscrapers with his body and she saw a picture on a page of the new york banner the picture of howard roark looking up at the enright house and the caption are you happy mr superman she raised her face to him she asked to marry you to become mrs wynandpapers she heard the effort in his voice as he answered if you wish to call it that yes i will marry you thank you dominique she waited indifferently when he turned to her he spoke as he had spoken all day a calm voice with an edge of gaiety well cut the cruise short well take just a week i want to have you here for a while youll leave for reno the day after we return ill take care of your husband he can have stoneridge and anything else he wants and may god damn him well be married the day you come back yes gail now lets go below do you want it no but i dont want our marriage to be important i want it to be important dominique thats why i wont touch you tonight not until were married i know its a senseless gesture i know that a wedding ceremony has no significance for either one of us but to be conventional is the only abnormality possible between us thats why i want it i have no other way of making an exception as you wish gail then he pulled her to him and he kissed her mouth it was the completion of his words the finished statement a statement of such intensity that she tried to stiffen her body not to respond and felt her body responding forced to forget everything but the physical fact of a man who held her he let her go she knew he had noticed he smiled and said youre tired dominique shall i say good night i want to remain here for a while she turned obediently and walked alone down to her cabin whats the matter dont i get stoneridge snapped peter keating dominique walked into the living room he followed waiting in the open door the elevator boy brought in her luggage and left she said removing her gloves youll get stoneridge peter mr wynand will tell you the rest himself he wants to see you tonight at eightthirty at his home why in hell hell tell you she slapped her gloves softly against her palm a small gesture of finality like a period at the end of a sentence she turned to leave the room he stood in her way i dont care he said i dont give a damn i can play it your way youre great arent you because you act like truck drivers you and mr gail wynand to hell with decency to hell with the other fellows feelings well i can do that too ill use you both and ill get what i can out of it and thats all i care how do you like it no point when the worm refuses to be hurt spoils the fun i think thats much better peter im glad he found himself unable to preserve this attitude when he entered wynands study that evening he could not escape the awe of being admitted into gail wynands home by the time he crossed the room to the seat facing the desk he felt nothing but a sense of weight and he wondered whether his feet had left prints on the soft carpet like the leaded feet of a deepsea diver what i have to tell you mr keating should never have needed to be said or done said wynand keating had never heard a man speak in a manner so consciously controlled he thought crazily that it sounded as if wynand held his fist closed over his voice and directed each syllable any extra word i speak will be offensive so i shall be brief i am going to marry your wife she is leaving for reno tomorrow here is the contract for stoneridge i have signed it attached is a check for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars it is in addition to what you will receive for your work under the contract ill appreciate it if you will now make no comment of any kind i realize that i could have had your consent for less but i wish no discussion it would be intolerable if we were to bargain about it therefore will you please take this and consider the matter settled he extended the contract across the desk keating saw the pale blue rectangle of the check held to the top of the page by a paper clip the clip flashed silver in the light of the desk lamp keatings hand did not reach to meet the paper he said his chin moving awkwardly to frame the words i dont want it you can have my consent for nothing he saw a look of astonishment and almost of kindness on wynands face you dont want it you dont want stoneridge either i want stoneridge keatings hand rose and snatched the paper i want it all why should you get away with it why should i care wynand got up he said relief and regret in his voice right mr keating for a moment you had almost justified your marriage let it remain what it was good night keating did not go home he walked to the apartment of neil dumont his new designer and best friend neil dumont was a lanky anemic society youth with shoulders stooped under the burden of too many illustrious ancestors he was not a good designer but he had connections he was obsequious to keating in the office and keating was obsequious to him after office hours he found dumont at home together they got gordon prescott and vincent knowlton and started out to make a wild night of it keating did not drink much he paid for everything he paid more than necessary he seemed anxious to find things to pay for he gave exorbitant tips he kept asking were friends arent we friends arent we he looked at the glasses around him and he watched the lights dancing in the liquid he looked at the three pairs of eyes they were blurred but they turned upon him occasionally with contentment they were soft and comforting that evening her bags packed and ready in her room dominique went to see steven mallory she had not seen roark for twenty months she had called on mallory once in a while mallory knew that these visits were breakdowns in a struggle she would not name he knew that she did not want to come that her rare evenings with him were time torn out of her life he never asked any questions and he was always glad to see her they talked quietly with a feeling of companionship such as that of an old married couple as if he had possessed her body and the wonder of it had long since been consumed and nothing remained but an untroubled intimacy he had never touched her body but he had possessed it in a deeper kind of ownership when he had done her statue and they could not lose the special sense of each other it had given them he smiled when he opened the door and saw her hello dominique hello steve interrupting you no come in he had a studio a huge sloppy place in an old building she noticed the change since her last visit the room had an air of laughter like a breath held too long and released she saw secondhand furniture an oriental rug of rare texture and sensuous color jade ash trays pieces of sculpture that came from historical excavations anything he had wished to seize helped by the sudden fortune of wynands patronage the walls looked strangely bare above the gay clutter he had bought no paintings a single sketch hung over his studio roarks original drawing of the stoddard temple she looked slowly about her noting every object and the reason for its presence he kicked two chairs toward the fireplace and they sat down one at each side of the fire he said quite simply clayton ohio doing what a new building for janers department store five stories on main street how long has he been there about a month it was the first question he answered whenever she came here without making her ask it his simple ease spared her the necessity of explanation or pretense his manner included no comment im going away tomorrow steve for long six weeks reno im glad id rather not tell you now what ill do when i come back you wont be glad ill try to be if its what you want to do its what i want to do one log still kept its shape on the pile of coals in the fireplace it was checkered into small squares and it glowed without flame like a solid string of lighted windows he reached down and threw a fresh log on the coals it cracked the string of windows in half and sent sparks shooting up against the sooted bricks he talked about his own work she listened as if she were an emigrant hearing her homelands language for a brief while in a pause she asked how is he steve as hes always been he doesnt change you know he kicked the log a few coals rolled out he pushed them back he said i often think that hes the only one of us whos achieved immortality i dont mean in the sense of fame and i dont mean that he wont die some day but hes living it i think he is what the conception really means you know how people long to be eternal but they die with every day that passes when you meet them theyre not what you met last in any given hour they kill some part of themselves they change they deny they contradict and they call it growth at the end theres nothing left nothing unreversed or unbetrayed as if there had never been an entity only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass how do they expect a permanence which they have never held for a single moment but howard one can imagine him existing forever she sat looking at the fire it gave a deceptive semblance of life to her face after a while he asked how do you like all the new things i got i like them i like your having them i didnt tell you what happened to me since i saw you last the completely incredible gail wynand yes i know about that you do wynand of all people what on earth made him discover me i know that too ill tell you when i come back he has an amazing judgment amazing for him he bought the best yes he would then she asked without transition yet he knew that she was not speaking of wynand steve has he ever asked you about me no have you told him about my coming here no is that for my sake steve no for his he knew he had told her everything she wanted to know she said rising lets have some tea show me where you keep your stuff ill fix it dominique left for reno early in the morning keating was still asleep and she did not awaken him to say goodbye when he opened his eyes he knew that she was gone before he looked at the clock by the quality of the silence in the house he thought he should say good riddance but he did not say it and he did not feel it what he felt was a vast flat sentence without subject its no use related neither to himself nor to dominique he was alone and there was no necessity to pretend anything he lay in bed on his back his arms flung out helplessly his face looked humble and his eyes bewildered he felt that it was an end and a death but he did not mean the loss of dominique he got up and dressed in the bathroom he found a hand towel she had used and discarded he picked it up he pressed his face to it and held it for a long time not in sorrow but in nameless emotion not understanding knowing only that he had loved her twice on that evening when toohey telephoned and now then he opened his fingers and let the towel slip down to the floor like a liquid running between his fingers he went to his office and worked as usual nobody knew of his divorce and he felt no desire to inform anyone neil dumont winked at him and drawled i say pete you look peaked he shrugged and turned his back the sight of dumont made him sick today he left the office early a vague instinct kept pulling at him like hunger at first then taking shape he had to see ellsworth toohey he had to reach toohey he felt like the survivor of a shipwreck swimming toward a distant light that evening he dragged himself to ellsworth tooheys apartment when he entered he felt dimly glad of his selfcontrol because toohey seemed to notice nothing in his face oh hello peter said toohey airily your sense of timing leaves much to be desired you catch me on the worst possible evening busy as all hell but dont let that bother you what are friends for but to inconvenience one sit down sit down ill be with you in a minute im sorry ellsworth but i had to make yourself at home just ignore me for a minute will you keating sat down and waited toohey worked making notes on sheets of typewritten copy he sharpened a pencil the sound grating like a saw across keatings nerves he bent over his copy again rustling the pages once in a while half an hour later he pushed the papers aside and smiled at keating thats that he said keating made a small movement forward sit tight said toohey just one telephone call ive got to make he dialed the number of gus webb hello gus he said gaily how are you you walking advertisement for contraceptives keating had never heard that tone of loose intimacy from toohey a special tone of brotherhood that permitted sloppiness he heard webbs piercing voice say something and laugh in the receiver the receiver went on spitting out rapid sounds from deep down in its tube like a throat being cleared the words could not be recognized only their quality the quality of abandon and insolence with high shrieks of mirth once in a while toohey leaned back in his chair listening half smiling yes he said occasionally uhhuh you said it boy surern hell he leaned back farther and put one foot in a shining pointed shoe on the edge of the desk listen boy what i wanted to tell you is go easy on old bassett for a while sure he likes your work but dont shock hell out of him for the time being no roughhouse see keep that big facial cavity of yours buttoned up you know damn well who i am to tell you thats right thats the stuff kid oh he did good angelface well byebye oh say gus have you heard the one about the british lady and the plumber there followed a story the receiver yelled raucously at the end well watch your step and your digestion angelface nightynight toohey dropped the receiver said now peter stretched got up walking to keating and stood before him rocking a little on his small feet his eyes bright and kindly now peter whats the matter has the world crashed about your nose keating reached into his inside pocket and produced a yellow check crumpled much handled it bore his signature and the sum of ten thousand dollars made out to ellsworth m toohey the gesture with which he handed it to toohey was not that of a donor but of a beggar please ellsworth here take this for a good cause for the workshop of social study or for anything you wish you know best for a good cause toohey held the check with the tips of his fingers like a soiled penny bent his head to one side pursing his lips in appreciation and tossed the check on his desk very handsome of you peter very handsome indeed whats the occasion ellsworth you remember what you said once that it doesnt matter what we are or do if we help others thats all that counts thats good isnt it thats clean i havent said it once ive said it a million times and its really true of course its true if you have the courage to accept it youre my friend arent you youre the only friend ive got i im not even friendly with myself but you are with me i mean arent you ellsworth but of course which is of more value than your own friendship with yourself a rather queer conception but quite valid you understand nobody else does and you like me devotedly whenever i have the time ah your sense of humor peter wheres your sense of humor whats the matter a bellyache or a soulindigestion ellsworth i yes i cant tell you even you youre a coward peter keating stared helplessly the voice had been severe and gentle he did not know whether he should feel pain insult or confidence you come here to tell me that it doesnt matter what you do and then you go to pieces over something or other youve done come on be a man and say it doesnt matter say youre not important mean it show some guts forget your little ego im not important ellsworth im not important oh god if only everybodyd say it like you do im not important i dont want to be important where did that money come from i sold dominique what are you talking about the cruise only it seems as if its not dominique that i sold what do you care if shes gone to reno what he could not understand the violence of tooheys reaction but he was too tired to wonder he told everything as it had happened to him it had not taken long to happen or to tell you damn fool you shouldnt have allowed it what could i do against wynand but to let him marry her why not ellsworth its better than i didnt think hed ever but oh god damn it im a bigger fool than you are but its better for dominique if to hell with your dominique its wynand im thinking about ellsworth whats the matter with you why should you care keep still will you let me think in a moment toohey shrugged sat down beside keating and slipped his arm about his shoulders im sorry peter he said i apologize ive been inexcusably rude to you it was just the shock but i understand how you feel only you mustnt take it too seriously it doesnt matter he spoke automatically his mind was far away keating did not notice that he heard the words they were the spring in the desert it doesnt matter youre only human thats all you want to be whos any better who has the right to cast the first stone were all human it doesnt matter my god said alvah scarret he cant not dominique francon he will said toohey as soon as she returns scarret had been surprised that toohey should invite him to lunch but the news he heard wiped out the surprise in a greater and more painful one im fond of dominique said scarret pushing his plate aside his appetite gone ive always been very fond of her but to have her as mrs gail wynand these exactly are my own sentiments said toohey ive always advised him to marry it helps lends an air an insurance of respectability sort of and he could do with one hes always skated on pretty thin ice got away with it so far but dominique why do you find such a marriage unsuitable well well its not damn it you know its not right i know it do you look shes a dangerous kind of woman she is thats your minor premise your major premise however is hes a dangerous kind of man well in some ways yes my esteemed editor you understand me quite well but there are times when its helpful to formulate things it tends toward futurecooperation you and i have a great deal in commonthough you have been somewhat reluctant to admit it we are two variations on the same theme shall we say or we play two ends against the same middle if you prefer your own literary style but our dear boss is quite another tune a different leitmotif entirelydont you think so alvah our dear boss is an accident in our midst accidents are unreliable phenomena youve been sitting on the edge of your seat for yearshavent youwatching mr gail wynand so you know exactly what im talking about you know also that miss dominique francon is not our tune either and you do not wish to see that particular influence enter the life of our boss do i have to state the issue any plainer youre a smart man ellsworth said scarret heavily thats been obvious for years ill talk to him youd better nothe hates your guts if youll excuse me but i dont think id do much good either not if hes made up his mind i dont expect you to you may try if you wish though its useless we cant stop that marriage one of my good points is the fact that i admit defeat when it has to be admitted but then why did you tell you this in the nature of a scoop alvah advance information i appreciate it ellsworth i sure do it would be wise to go on appreciating it the wynand papers alvah are not to be given up easily in unity there is strength your style what do you mean only that were in for a difficult time my friend so wed do better to stick together why im with you ellsworth ive always been inaccurate but well let it pass were concerned only with the present and the future as a token of mutual understanding how about getting rid of jimmy kearns at the first opportunity i thought youve been driving at that for months whats the matter with jimmy kearns hes a bright kid the best drama critic in town hes got a mind smart as a whip most promising hes got a mind of his own i dont think you want any whips around the place except the one you hold i think you want to be careful about what the promise promises whomll i stick in his spot jules fougler oh hell ellsworth why not that old son of a we cant afford him you can if you want to and look at the name hes got but hes the most impossible old well you dont have to take him well discuss it some other time just get rid of jimmy kearns look ellsworth i dont play favorites its all the same to me ill give jimmy the boot if you say so only i dont see what difference it makes and what its got to do with what we were talking about you dont said toohey you will gail you know that i want you to be happy said alvah scarret sitting in a comfortable armchair in the study of wynands penthouse that evening you know that im thinking of nothing else wynand lay stretched out on a couch one leg bent with the foot resting on the knee of the other he smoked and listened silently ive known dominique for years said scarret long before you ever heard of her i love her i love her you might say like a father but youve got to admit that shes not the kind of woman your public would expect to see as mrs gail wynand wynand said nothing your wife is a public figure gail just automatically a public property your readers have a right to demand and expect certain things of her a symbol value if you know what i mean like the queen of england sort of how do you expect dominique to live up to that how do you expect her to preserve any appearances at all shes the wildest person i know she has a terrible reputation but worst of all think gail a divorcee and here we spend tons of good print standing for the sanctity of the home and the purity of womanhood how are you going to make your public swallow that one how am i going to sell your wife to them dont you think this conversation had better be stopped alvah yes gail said scarret meekly scarret waited with a heavy sense of aftermath as if after a violent quarrel anxious to make up i know gail he cried happily i know what we can do well put dominique back on the paper and well have her write a column a different one a syndicated column on the home you know household hints kitchen babies and all that itll take the curse off show what a good little homebody she really is her youthful mistakes notwithstanding make the women forgive her well have a special department mrs gail wynands recipes a few pictures of her will help you know gingham dresses and aprons and her hair done up in a more conventional way shut up alvah before i slap your face said wynand without raising his voice yes gail scarret made a move to get up sit still i havent finished scarret waited obediently tomorrow morning said wynand you will send a memo to every one of our papers you will tell them to look through their files and find any pictures of dominique francon they might have in connection with her old column you will tell them to destroy the pictures you will tell them that henceforward any mention of her name or the use of her picture in any of my papers will cost the job of the entire editorial staff responsible when the proper time comes you will have an announcement of my marriage appear in all our papers that cannot be avoided the briefest announcement you can compose no commentaries no stories no pictures pass the word around and make sure its understood its any mans job yours included if this is disobeyed no stories when you marry her no stories alvah but good god thats news the other papers i dont care what the other papers do about it but why gail you wouldnt understand dominique sat at the window listening to the train wheels under the floor she looked at the countryside of ohio flying past in the fading daylight her head lay back against the seat and her hands lay limply at each side of her on the seat cushion she was one with the structure of the car she was carried forward just as the window frame the floor the walls of the compartment were carried forward the corners blurred gathering darkness the window remained luminous evening light rising from the earth she let herself rest in that faint illumination it entered the car and ruled it so long as she did not turn on the light to shut it out she had no consciousness of purpose there was no goal to this journey only the journey itself only the motion and the metal sound of motion around her she felt slack and empty losing her identity in a painless ebb content to vanish and let nothing remain defined save that particular earth in the window when she saw in the slowing movement beyond the glass the name clayton on a faded board under the eaves of a station building she knew what she had been expecting she knew why she had taken this train not a faster one why she had looked carefully at the timetable of its stops although it had been just a column of meaningless names to her then she seized her suitcase coat and hat she ran she could not take time to dress afraid that the floor under her feet would carry her away from here she ran down the narrow corridor of the car down the steps she leaped to the station platform feeling the shock of winter cold on her bare throat she stood looking at the station building she heard the train moving behind her clattering away then she put on her coat and hat she walked across the platform into the waiting room across a wooden floor studded with lumps of dry chewing gum through the heavy billows of heat from an iron stove to the square beyond the station she saw a last band of yellow in the sky above the low roof lines she saw a pitted stretch of paving bricks and small houses leaning against one another a bare tree with twisted branches skeletons of weeds at the doorless opening of an abandoned garage dark shop fronts a drugstore still open on a corner its lighted window dim low over the ground she had never been here before but she felt this place proclaiming its ownership of her closing in about her with ominous intimacy it was as if every dark mass exercised a suction like the pull of the planets in space prescribing her orbit she put her hand on a fire hydrant and felt the cold seeping through her glove into her skin this was the way the town told her a direct penetration which neither her clothes nor her mind could stop the peace of the inevitable remained only now she had to act but the actions were simple set in advance she asked a passerby where is the site of the new building of janers department store she walked patiently through the dark streets she walked past desolate winter lawns and sagging porches past vacant lots where weeds rustled against tin cans past closed grocery stores and a steaming laundry past an uncurtained window where a man in shirt sleeves sat by a fire reading a paper she turned corners and crossed streets with the feel of cobblestones under the thin soles of her pumps rare passersby looked astonished at her air of foreign elegance she noticed it she felt an answering wonder she wanted to say but dont you understand i belong here more than you do she stopped once in a while closing her eyes she found it difficult to breathe she came to main street and walked slower there were a few lights cars parked diagonally at the curb a movie theater a store window displaying pink underwear among kitchen utensils she walked stiffly looking ahead she saw a glare of light on the side of an old building on a blind wall of yellow bricks showing the sooted floor lines of the neighboring structure that had been torn down the light came from an excavation pit she knew this was the site she hoped it was not if they worked late he would be here she did not want to see him tonight she had wanted only to see the place and the building she was not ready for more she had wanted to see him tomorrow but she could not stop now she walked to the excavation it lay on a corner open to the street without fence she heard the grinding clatter of iron she saw the arm of a derrick the shadows of men on the slanting sides of fresh earth yellow in the light she could not see the planks that led up to the sidewalk but she heard the sound of steps and then she saw roark coming up to the street he was hatless he had a loose coat hanging open he stopped he looked at her she thought that she was standing straight that it was simple and normal she was seeing the gray eyes and the orange hair as she had always seen them she was astonished that he moved toward her with a kind of urgent haste that his hand closed over her elbow too firmly and he said youd better sit down then she saw she could not have stood up without that hand on her elbow he took her suitcase he led her across the dark side street and made her sit down on the steps of a vacant house she leaned back against a closed door he sat down beside her he kept his hand tight on her elbow not a caress but an impersonal hold of control over both of them after a while he dropped his hand she knew that she was safe now she could speak thats your new building yes you walked here from the station yes its a long walk i think it was she thought that they had not greeted each other and that it was right this was not a reunion but just one moment out of something that had never been interrupted she thought how strange it would be if she ever said hello to him one did not greet oneself each morning what time did you get up today she asked at seven i was in new york then in a cab going to grand central where did you have breakfast in a lunch wagon the kind that stays open all night yes mostly for truck drivers do you go there often whenever i want a cup of coffee and you sit at a counter and there are people around looking at you i sit at a counter when i have the time there are people around i dont think they look at me much and afterward you walk to work yes you walk every day down any of these streets past any window so that if one just wanted to reach and open the window people dont stare out of windows here from the vantage of the high stoop they could see the excavation across the street the earth the workmen the rising steel columns in a glare of harsh light she thought it was strange to see fresh earth in the midst of pavement and cobblestones as if a piece had been torn from the clothing of a town showing naked flesh she said youve done two country homes in the last two years yes one in pennsylvania and one near boston they were unimportant houses inexpensive if thats what you mean but very interesting to do how long will you remain here another month why do you work at night its a rush job across the street the derrick was moving balancing a long girder in the air she saw him watching it and she knew he was not thinking of it but there was the instinctive response in his eyes something physically personal intimacy with any action taken for his building roark they had not pronounced each others names it had the sensuous pleasure of a surrender long delayed to pronounce the name and to have him hear it roark its the quarry again he smiled if you wish only it isnt after the enright house after the cord building i dont think of it that way how do you think of it i love doing it every building is like a person single and unrepeatable he was looking across the street he had not changed there was the old sense of lightness in him of ease in motion in action in thought she said her sentence without beginning or end doing fivestory buildings for the rest of your life if necessary but i dont think it will be like that what are you waiting for im not waiting she closed her eyes but she could not hide her mouth her mouth held bitterness anger and pain roark if youd been in the city i wouldnt have come to see you i know it but it was you in another place in some nameless hole of a place like this i had to see it i had to see the place when are you going back you know i havent come to remain yes why youre still afraid of lunch wagons and windows im not going back to new york not at once no you havent asked me anything roark only whether i walked from the station what do you want me to ask you i got off the train when i saw the name of the station she said her voice dull i didnt intend coming here i was on my way to reno and after that i will marry again do i know your fiancé youve heard of him his name is gail wynand she saw his eyes she thought she should want to laugh she had brought him at last to a shock she had never expected to achieve but she did not laugh he thought of henry cameron of cameron saying i have no answer to give them howard im leaving you to face them youll answer them all of them the wynand papers and what makes the wynand papers possible and what lies behind that roark he didnt answer thats worse than peter keating isnt it she asked much worse do you want to stop me no he had not touched her since he had released her elbow and that had been only a touch proper in an ambulance she moved her hand and let it rest against his he did not withdraw his fingers and he did not pretend indifference she bent over holding his hand not raising it from his knee and she pressed her lips to his hand her hat fell off he saw the blond head at his knees he felt her mouth kissing his hand again and again his fingers held hers answering but that was the only answer she raised her head and looked at the street a lighted window hung in the distance behind a grillwork of bare branches small houses stretched off into the darkness and trees stood by the narrow sidewalks she noticed her hat on the steps below and bent to pick it up she leaned with her bare hand flat against the steps the stone was old worn smooth icy she felt comfort in the touch she sat for a moment bent over palm pressed to the stone to feel these steps no matter how many feet had used them to feel them as she had felt the fire hydrant roark where do you live in a rooming house what kind of a room just a room whats in it what kind of walls some sort of wallpaper faded what furniture a table chairs a bed no tell me in detail theres a clothes closet then a chest of drawers the bed in the corner by the window a large table at the other side by the wall no i put it across the corner to the window i work there then theres a straight chair an armchair with a bridge lamp and a magazine rack i never use i think thats all no rugs or curtains i think theres something at the window and some kind of rug the floor is nicely polished its beautiful old wood i want to think of your room tonight on the train he sat looking across the street she said roark let me stay with you tonight no she let her glance follow his to the grinding machinery below after a while she asked how did you get this store to design the owner saw my buildings in new york and liked them a man in overalls stepped out of the excavation pit peered into the darkness at them and called is that you up there boss yes roark called back come here a minute will you roark walked to him across the street she could not hear their conversation but she heard roark saying gaily thats easy and then they both walked down the planks to the bottom the man stood talking pointing up explaining roark threw his head back to glance up at the rising steel frame the light was full on his face and she saw his look of concentration not a smile but an expression that gave her a joyous feeling of competence of disciplined reason in action he bent picked up a piece of board took a pencil from his pocket he stood with one foot on a pile of planks the board propped on his knee and drew rapidly explaining something to the man who nodded pleased she could not hear the words but she felt the quality of roarks relation to that man to all the other men in that pit an odd sense of loyalty and of brotherhood but not the kind she had ever heard named by these words he finished handed the board to the man and they both laughed at something then he came back and sat down on the steps beside her roark she said i want to remain here with you for all the years we might have he looked at her attentively waiting i want to live here her voice had the sound of pressure against a dam i want to live as you live not to touch my money ill give it away to anyone to steve mallory if you wish or to one of tooheys organizations it doesnt matter well take a house here like one of these and ill keep it for you dont laugh i can ill cook ill wash your clothes ill scrub the floor and youll give up architecture he had not laughed she saw nothing but an unmoving attention prepared to listen on roark try to understand please try to understand i cant bear to see what theyre doing to you what theyre going to do its too great you and building and what you feel about it you cant go on like that for long it wont last they wont let you youre moving to some terrible kind of disaster it cant end any other way give it up take some meaningless job like the quarry well live here well have little and well give nothing well live only for what we are and for what we know he laughed she heard in the sound of it a surprising touch of consideration for her the attempt not to laugh but he couldnt stop it dominique the way he pronounced the name remained with her and made it easier to hear the words that followed i wish i could tell you that it was a temptation at least for a moment but it wasnt he added if i were very cruel id accept it just to see how soon youd beg me to go back to building yes probably marry wynand and stay married to him it will be better than what youre doing to yourself right now do you mind if we just sit here for a little while longer and not talk about that but just talk as if everything were right just an armistice for half an hour out of years tell me what youve done every day youve been here everything you can remember then they talked as if the stoop of the vacant house were an airplane hanging in space without sight of earth or sky he did not look across the street then he glanced at his wrist watch and said theres a train for the west in an hour shall i go with you to the station do you mind if we walk there all right she stood up she asked until when roark his hand moved over the streets until you stop hating all this stop being afraid of it learn not to notice it they walked together to the station she listened to the sound of his steps with hers in the empty streets she let her glance drag along the walls they passed like a clinging touch she loved this place this town and everything that was part of it they were walking past a vacant lot the wind blew an old sheet of newspaper against her legs it clung to her with a tight insistence that seemed conscious like the peremptory caress of a cat she thought anything of this town had that intimate right to her she bent picked up the paper and began folding it to keep it what are you doing he asked something to read on the train she said stupidly he snatched the paper from her crumpled it and flung it away into the weeds she said nothing and they walked on a single light bulb hung over the empty station platform they waited he stood looking up the tracks where the train was to appear when the tracks rang shuddering when the white ball of a headlight spurted out of the distance and stood still in the sky not approaching only widening growing in furious speed he did not move or turn to her the rushing beam flung his shadow across the platform made it sweep over the planks and vanish for an instant she saw the tall straight line of his body against the glare the engine passed them and the car rattled slowing down he looked at the windows rolling past she could not see his face only the outline of his cheekbone when the train stopped he turned to her they did not shake hands they did not speak they stood straight facing each other for a moment as if at attention it was almost like a military salute then she picked up her suitcase and went aboard the train the train started moving a minute later chuck and why not a muskrat why should man imagine himself superior to a muskrat life beats in all the small creatures of field and wood life singing of eternal sorrow an old sorrow the song of songs we dont understand but who cares about understanding only public accountants and chiropodists also mailmen we only love the sweet mystery of love thats all there is to it give me love and shove all your philosophers up your stovepipe when mary took the homeless muskrat her heart broke open and life and love rushed in muskrats make good imitation mink coats but thats not the point life is the point jake rushing in say folks whos got a stamp with a picture of george washington on it curtain ike slammed his manuscript shut and took a long swig of air his voice was hoarse after two hours of reading aloud and he had read the climax of his play on a single long breath he looked at his audience his mouth smiling in selfmockery his eyebrows raised insolently but his eyes pleading ellsworth toohey sitting on the floor scratched his spine against a chair leg and yawned gus webb stretched out on his stomach in the middle of the room rolled over on his back lancelot clokey the foreign correspondent reached for his highball glass and finished it off jules fougler the new drama critic of the banner sat without moving he had not moved for two hours lois cook hostess raised her arms twisting them stretching and said jesus ike its awful lancelot clokey drawled lois my girl where do you keep your gin dont be such a damn miser youre the worst hostess i know gus webb said i dont understand literature its nonproductive and a waste of time authors will be liquidated ike laughed shrilly a stinker huh he waved his script a real superstinker what do you think i wrote it for just show me anyone who can write a bigger flop worst play youll ever hear in your life it was not a formal meeting of the council of american writers but an unofficial gathering ike had asked a few of his friends to listen to his latest work at twentysix he had written eleven plays but had never had one produced youd better give up the theater ike said lancelot clokey writing is a serious business and not for any stray bastard that wants to try it lancelot clokeys first book an account of his personal adventures in foreign countries was in its tenth week on the bestseller list why isnt it lance toohey drawled sweetly all right snapped clokey all right give me a drink its awful said lois cook her head lolling wearily from side to side its perfectly awful its so awful its wonderful balls said gus webb why do i ever come here ike flung his script at the fireplace it struck against the wire screen and landed face down open the thin pages crushed if ibsen can write plays why cant i he asked hes good and im lousy but thats not a sufficient reason not in the cosmic sense said lancelot clokey still youre lousy you dont have to say it i said so first this is a great play said a voice the voice was slow nasal and bored it had spoken for the first time that evening and they all turned to jules fougler a cartoonist had once drawn a famous picture of him it consisted of two sagging circles a large one and a small one the large one was his stomach the small one his lower lip he wore a suit beautifully tailored of a color to which he referred as merde doie he kept his gloves on at all times and he carried a cane he was an eminent drama critic jules fougler stretched out his cane caught the playscript with the hook of the handle and dragged it across the floor to his feet he did not pick it up but he repeated looking down at it this is a great play why asked lancelot clokey because i say so said jules fougler is that a gag jules asked lois cook i never gag said jules fougler it is vulgar send me a coupla seats to the opening sneered lancelot clokey eighteighty for two seats to the opening said jules fougler it will be the biggest hit of the season jules fougler turned and saw toohey looking at him toohey smiled but the smile was not light or careless it was an approving commentary upon something he considered as very serious indeed fouglers glance was contemptuous when turned to the others but it relaxed for a moment of understanding when it rested on toohey why dont you join the council of american writers jules asked toohey i am an individualist said fougler i dont believe in organizations besides is it necessary no not necessary at all said toohey cheerfully not for you jules theres nothing i can teach you what i like about you ellsworth is that its never necessary to explain myself to you hell why explain anything here were six of a kind five said fougler i dont like gus webb why dont you asked gus he was not offended because he doesnt wash his ears answered fougler as if the question had been asked by a third party oh that said gus ike had risen and stood staring at fougler not quite certain whether he should breathe you like my play mr fougler he asked at last his voice small i havent said i liked it fougler answered coldly i think it smells that is why its great oh said ike he laughed he seemed relieved his glance went around the faces in the room a glance of sly triumph yes said fougler my approach to its criticism is the same as your approach to its writing our motives are identical youre a grand guy jules mr fougler please youre a grand guy and the swellest bastard on earth mr fougler fougler turned the pages of the script at his feet with the tip of his cane your typing is atrocious ike he said hell im not a stenographer im a creative artist you will be able to afford a secretary after this show opens i shall be obliged to praise it if for no other reason than to prevent any further abuse of a typewriter such as this the typewriter is a splendid instrument not to be outraged all right jules said lancelot clokey its all very witty and smart and youre sophisticated and brilliant as all getout but what do you actually want to praise that crap for because it is as you put it crap youre not logical lance said ike not in the cosmic sense you arent to write a good play and to have it praised is nothing anybody can do that anybody with talent and talent is only a glandular accident but to write a piece of crap and have it praised well you match that he has said toohey thats a matter of opinion said lancelot clokey he upturned his empty glass over his mouth and sucked at a last piece of ice ike understands things much better than you do lance said jules fougler he has just proved himself to be a real thinker in that little speech of his which incidentally was better than his whole play ill write my next play about that said ike ike has stated his reasons fougler continued and mine and also yours lance examine my case if you wish what achievement is there for a critic in praising a good play none whatever the critic is then nothing but a kind of glorified messenger boy between author and public whats there in that for me im sick of it i have a right to wish to impress my own personality upon people otherwise i shall become frustrated and i do not believe in frustration but if a critic is able to put over a perfectly worthless play ah you do perceive the difference therefore i shall make a hit out of whats the name of your play ike no skin off your ass said ike i beg your pardon thats the title oh i see therefore i shall make a hit out of no skin off your ass lois cook laughed loudly you all make too damn much fuss about everything said gus webb lying flat his hands entwined under his head now if you wish to consider your own case lance fougler went on what satisfaction is there for a correspondent in reporting on world events the public reads about all sorts of international crises and youre lucky if they ever notice your byline but youre every bit as good as any general admiral or ambassador you have a right to make people conscious of yourself so youve done the wise thing youve written a remarkable collection of bilge yes bilge but morally justified a clever book world catastrophes used as a backdrop for your own nasty little personality how lancelot clokey got drunk at an international conference what beauties slept with lancelot clokey during an invasion how lancelot clokey got dysentery in a land of famine well why not lance it went over didnt it ellsworth put it over didnt he the public appreciates good humaninterest stuff said lancelot clokey looking angrily into his glass oh can the crap lance cried lois cook whore you acting for here you know damn well it wasnt any kind of a human interest but plain ellsworth toohey i dont forget what i owe ellsworth said clokey sullenly ellsworths my best friend still he couldnt have done it if he didnt have a good book to do it with eight months ago lancelot clokey had stood with a manuscript in his hand before ellsworth toohey as ike stood before fougler now not believing it when toohey told him that his book would top the bestseller list but two hundred thousand copies sold had made it impossible for clokey ever to recognize any truth again in any form well he did it with the gallant gallstone said lois cook placidly and a worse piece of trash never was put down on paper i ought to know but he did it and almost lost my job doing it said toohey indifferently what do you do with your liquor lois snapped clokey save it to take a bath in all right blotter said lois cook rising lazily she shuffled across the room picked somebodys unfinished drink off the floor drank the remnant walked out and came back with an assortment of expensive bottles clokey and ike hurried to help themselves i think youre unfair to lance lois said toohey why shouldnt he write an autobiography because his life wasnt worth living let alone recording ah but that is precisely why i made it a bestseller youre telling me i like to tell someone there were many comfortable chairs around him but toohey preferred to remain on the floor he rolled over to his stomach propping his torso upright on his elbows and he lolled pleasurably switching his weight from elbow to elbow his legs spread out in a wide fork on the carpet he seemed to enjoy unrestraint i like to tell someone next month im pushing the autobiography of a smalltown dentist whos really a remarkable person because theres not a single remarkable day in his life nor sentence in his book youll like it lois can you imagine a solid bromide undressing his soul as if it were a revelation the little people said ike tenderly i love the little people we must love the little people of this earth save that for your next play said toohey i cant said ike its in this one whats the big idea ellsworth snapped clokey why its simple lance when the fact that one is a total nonentity whos done nothing more outstanding than eating sleeping and chatting with neighbors becomes a fact worthy of pride of announcement to the world and of diligent study by millions of readers the fact that one has built a cathedral becomes unrecordable and unannounceable a matter of perspectives and relativity the distance permissible between the extremes of any particular capacity is limited the sound perception of an ant does not include thunder you talk like a decadent bourgeois ellsworth said gus webb pipe down sweetiepie said toohey without resentment its all very wonderful said lois cook except that youre doing too well ellsworth youll run me out of business pretty soon if i still want to be noticed ill have to write something thats actually good not in this century lois said toohey and perhaps not in the next its later than you think but you havent said ike cried suddenly worried what havent i said you havent said whos going to produce my play leave that to me said jules fougler i forgot to thank you ellsworth said ike solemnly so now i thank you there are lots of bum plays but you picked mine you and mr fougler your bumness is serviceable ike well thats something its a great deal how for instance dont talk too much ellsworth said gus webb youve got a talking jag shut your face kewpiedoll i like to talk for instance ike well for instance suppose i didnt like ibsen ibsen is good said ike sure hes good but suppose i didnt like him suppose i wanted to stop people from seeing his plays it would do me no good whatever to tell them so but if i sold them the idea that youre just as great as ibsen pretty soon they wouldnt be able to tell the difference jesus can you its only an example ike but it would be wonderful yes it would be wonderful and then it wouldnt matter what they went to see at all then nothing would matter neither the writers nor those for whom they wrote hows that ellsworth look ike theres no room in the theater for both ibsen and you you do understand that dont you in a manner of speaking yes well you do want me to make room for you dont you all of this useless discussion has been covered before and much better said gus webb shorter i believe in functional economy wheres it covered gus asked lois cook who had been nothing shall be all sister gus is crude but deep said ike i like him go to hell said gus lois cooks butler entered the room he was a stately elderly man and he wore fulldress evening clothes he announced peter keating pete said lois cook gaily why sure shove him in shove him right in keating entered and stopped startled when he saw the gathering oh hello everybody he said bleakly i didnt know you had company lois thats not company come in pete sit down grab yourself a drink you know everybody hello ellsworth said keating his eyes resting on toohey for support toohey waved his hand scrambled to his feet and settled down in an armchair crossing his legs gracefully everybody in the room adjusted himself automatically to a sudden control to sit straighter to bring knees together to pull in a relaxed mouth only gus webb remained stretched as before keating looked cool and handsome bringing into the unventilated room the freshness of a walk through cold streets but he was pale and his movements were slow tired sorry if i intrude lois he said had nothing to do and felt so damn lonely thought id drop in he slurred over the word lonely throwing it away with a selfdeprecatory smile damn tired of neil dumont and the bunch wanted more uplifting company sort of spiritual food huh im a genius said ike ill have a play on broadway me and ibsen ellsworth said so ike has just read his new play to us said toohey a magnificent piece of work youll love it peter said lancelot clokey its really great it is a masterpiece said jules fougler i hope you will prove yourself worthy of it peter it is the kind of play that depends upon what the members of the audience are capable of bringing with them into the theater if you are one of those literalminded people with a dry soul and a limited imagination it is not for you but if you are a real human being with a big big heart full of laughter who has preserved the uncorrupted capacity of his childhood for pure emotion you will find it an unforgettable experience except as ye become as little children ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven said ellsworth toohey thanks ellsworth said jules fougler that will be the lead of my review keating looked at ike at the others his eyes eager they all seemed remote and pure far above him in the safety of their knowledge but their faces had hints of smiling warmth a benevolent invitation extended downward keating drank the sense of their greatness that spiritual food he sought in common here and felt himself rising through them they saw their greatness made real by him a circuit was established in the room and the circle closed everybody was conscious of that except peter keating ellsworth toohey came out in support of the cause of modern architecture in the past ten years while most of the new residences continued to be built as faithful historical copies the principles of henry cameron had won the field of commercial structures the factories the office buildings the skyscrapers it was a pale distorted victory a reluctant compromise that consisted of omitting columns and pediments allowing a few stretches of wall to remain naked apologizing for a shape good through accident by finishing it off with an edge of simplified grecian volutes many stole camerons forms few understood his thinking the sole part of his argument irresistible to the owners of new structures was financial economy he won to that extent in the countries of europe most prominently in germany a new school of building had been growing for a long time it consisted of putting up four walls and a flat top over them with a few openings this was called new architecture the freedom from arbitrary rules for which cameron had fought the freedom that imposed a great new responsibility on the creative builder became mere elimination of all effort even the effort of mastering historical styles it became a rigid set of new rules the discipline of conscious incompetence creative poverty made into a system mediocrity boastfully confessed a building creates its own beauty and its ornament is derived from the rules of its theme and its structure cameron had said a building needs no beauty no ornament and no theme said the new architects it was safe to say it cameron and a few men had broken the path and paved it with their lives other men of whom there were greater numbers the men who had been safe in copying the parthenon saw the danger and found a way to security to walk camerons path and make it lead them to a new parthenon an easier parthenon in the shape of a packing crate of glass and concrete the palm tree had broken through the fungus came to feed on it to deform it to hide it to pull it back into the common jungle the jungle found its words in one small voice subtitled i swim with the current ellsworth toohey wrote we have hesitated for a long time to acknowledge the powerful phenomenon known as modern architecture such caution is requisite in anyone who stands in the position of mentor to the public taste too often isolated manifestations of anomaly can be mistaken for a broad popular movement and one should be careful not to ascribe to them a significance they do not deserve but modern architecture has stood the test of time has answered a demand of the masses and we are glad to salute it it is not amiss to offer a measure of recognition to the pioneers of this movement such as the late henry cameron premonitory echoes of the new grandeur can be found in some of his work but like all pioneers he was still bound by the inherited prejudices of the past by the sentimentality of the middle class from which he came he succumbed to the superstition of beauty and ornament even though the ornament was of his own devising and consequently inferior to that of established historical forms it remained for the power of a broad collective movement to bring modern architecture to its full and true expression now it can be seen growing throughout the world not as a chaos of individual fancies but as a cohesive organized discipline which makes severe demands upon the artist among them the demand to subordinate himself to the collective nature of his craft the rules of this new architecture have been formulated by the vast process of popular creation they are as strict as the rules of classicism they demand unadorned simplicity like the honesty of the unspoiled common man just as in the passing age of international bankers every building had to have an ostentatious cornice so now the coming age ordains that every building have a flat roof just as the imperialist era of humanity required that every house have corner windows symbol of the sunshine distributed equally to all the discriminating will see the social significance eloquent in the forms of this new architecture under the old system of exploitation the most useful social elements the workers were never permitted to realize their importance their practical functions were kept hidden and disguised thus a master had his servants dressed up in fancy goldbraided livery this was reflected in the architecture of the period the functional elements of a building its doors windows stairways were hidden under the scrolls of pointless ornamentation but in a modern building it is precisely these useful elements symbols of toil that come starkly in the open do we not hear in this the voice of a new world where the worker shall come into his own as the best example of modern architecture in america we call to your attention the new plant of the bassett brush company soon to be completed it is a small building but in its modest proportions it embodies all the grim simplicity of the new discipline and presents an invigorating example of the grandeur of the little it was designed by augustus webb a young architect of great promise meeting toohey a few days later peter keating asked disturbed say ellsworth did you mean it what about modern architecture of course i meant it how did you like my little piece oh i thought it was very beautiful very convincing but say ellsworth why why did you pick gus webb after all ive done some modernistic things in the last few years the palmer building was quite bare and the mowry building was nothing but roof and windows and the sheldon warehouse was now peter dont be a hog ive done pretty well by you havent i let me give somebody else a boost once in a while at a luncheon where he had to speak on architecture peter keating stated in reviewing my career to date i came to the conclusion that i have worked on a true principle the principle that constant change is a necessity of life since buildings are an indispensable part of life it follows that architecture must change constantly i have never developed any architectural prejudices for myself but insisted on keeping my mind open to all the voices of the times the fanatics who went around preaching that all structures must be modern were just as narrowminded as the hidebound conservatives who demanded that we employ nothing but historical styles i do not apologize for those of my buildings which were designed in the classical tradition they were an answer to the need of their era neither do i apologize for the buildings which i designed in the modern style they represent the coming better world it is my opinion that in the humble realization of this principle lies the reward and the joy of being an architect there was gratifying publicity and many flattering comments of envy in professional circles when the news of peter keatings selection to build stoneridge was made public he tried to recapture his old pleasure in such manifestations he failed he still felt something that resembled gladness but it was faded and thin the effort of designing stoneridge seemed a load too vast to lift he did not mind the circumstances through which he had obtained it that too had become pale and weightless in his mind accepted and almost forgotten he simply could not face the task of designing the great number of houses that stoneridge required he felt very tired he felt tired when he awakened in the morning and he found himself waiting all day for the time when he would be able to go back to bed he turned stoneridge over to neil dumont and bennett go ahead he said wearily do what you want what style pete dumont asked oh make it some sort of period the small home owners wont go for it otherwise but trim it down a little for the press comments give it historical touches and a modern feeling any way you wish i dont care dumont and bennett went ahead keating changed a few roof lines on their sketches a few windows the preliminary drawings were approved by wynands office keating did not know whether wynand had approved in person he did not see wynand again dominique had been away a month when guy francon announced his retirement keating had told him about the divorce offering no explanation francon had taken the news calmly he had said i expected it its all right peter its probably not your fault nor hers he had not mentioned it since now he gave no explanation of his retirement only i told you it was coming long ago im tired good luck peter the responsibility of the firm on his lonely shoulders and the prospect of his solitary name on the office door left keating uneasy he needed a partner he chose neil dumont neil had grace and distinction he was another lucius heyer the firm became peter keating cornelius dumont some sort of drunken celebration of the event was held by a few friends but keating did not attend it he had promised to attend but he forgot about it went for a solitary weekend in the snowbound country and did not remember the celebration until the morning after it was held when he was walking alone down a frozen country road stoneridge was the last contract signed by the firm of francon keating when dominique stepped off the train in new york wynand was there to meet her she had not written to him nor heard from him during the weeks of her residence in reno she had notified no one of her return but his figure standing on the platform standing calmly with an air of finality told her that he had kept in touch with her lawyers had followed every step of the divorce proceedings had known the date when the decree was granted the hour when she took the train and the number of her compartment he did not move forward when he saw her it was she who walked to him because she knew that he wanted to see her walking if only the short space between them she did not smile but her face had the lovely serenity that can become a smile without transition hello gail hello dominique she had not thought of him in his absence not sharply not with a personal feeling of his reality but now she felt an immediate recognition a sense of reunion with someone known and needed he said give me your baggage checks ill have it attended to later my car is outside she handed him the checks and he slipped them into his pocket they knew they must turn and walk up the platform to the exit but the decisions both had made in advance broke down in the same instant because they did not turn but remained standing looking at each other he made the first effort to correct the breach he smiled lightly if i had the right to say it id say that i couldnt have endured the waiting had i known that youd look as you do but since i have no such right im not going to say it she laughed all right gail that was a form of pretense too our being too casual it makes things more important not less doesnt it lets say whatever we wish i love you he said his voice expressionless as if the words were a statement of pain and not addressed to her im glad to be back with you gail i didnt know i would be but im glad in what way dominique i dont know in a way of contagion from you i think in a way of finality and peace then they noticed that this was said in the middle of a crowded platform with people and baggage racks hurrying past they walked out to the street to his car she did not ask where they were going and did not care she sat silently beside him she felt divided most of her swept by a wish not to resist and a small part of her left to wonder about it she felt a desire to let him carry her a feeling of confidence without appraisal not a happy confidence but confidence after a while she noticed that her hand lay in his the length of her gloved fingers held to the length of his only the spot of her bare wrist pressed to his skin she had not noticed him take her hand it seemed so natural and what she had wanted from the moment of seeing him but she could not allow herself to want it where are we going gail she asked to get the license then to the judges office to be married she sat up slowly turning to face him she did not withdraw her hand but her fingers became rigid conscious taken away from him no she said she smiled and held the smile too long in deliberate fixed precision he looked at her calmly i want a real wedding gail i want it at the most ostentatious hotel in town i want engraved invitations guests mobs of guests celebrities flowers flash bulbs and newsreel cameras i want the kind of wedding the public expects of gail wynand he released her fingers simply without resentment he looked abstracted for a moment as if he were calculating a problem in arithmetic not too difficult then he said all right that will take a week to arrange i could have it done tonight but if its engraved invitations we must give the guests a weeks notice at the least otherwise it would look abnormal and you want a normal gail wynand wedding ill have to take you to a hotel now where you can live for a week i had not planned for this so ive made no reservations where would you like to stay at your penthouse no the nordland then he leaned forward and said to the chauffeur the nordland john in the lobby of the hotel he said to her i will see you a week from today tuesday at the noyesbelmont at four oclock in the afternoon the invitations will have to be in the name of your father let him know that ill get in touch with him ill attend to the rest he bowed his manner unchanged his calm still holding the same peculiar quality made of two things the mature control of a man so certain of his capacity for control that it could seem casual and a childlike simplicity of accepting events as if they were subject to no possible change she did not see him during that week she found herself waiting impatiently she saw him again when she stood beside him facing a judge who pronounced the words of the marriage ceremony over the silence of six hundred people in the floodlighted ballroom of the noyesbelmont hotel the background she had wished was set so perfectly that it became its own caricature not a specific society wedding but an impersonal prototype of lavish exquisite vulgarity he had understood her wish and obeyed scrupulously he had refused himself the relief of exaggeration he had not staged the event crudely but made it beautiful in the exact manner gail wynand the publisher would have chosen had he wished to be married in public but gail wynand did not wish to be married in public he made himself fit the setting as if he were part of the bargain subject to the same style when he entered she saw him looking at the mob of guests as if he did not realize that such a mob was appropriate to a grand opera premiere or a royal rummage sale not to the solemn climax of his life he looked correct incomparably distinguished then she stood with him the mob becoming a heavy silence and a gluttonous stare behind him and they faced the judge together she wore a long black dress with a bouquet of fresh jasmine his present attached by a black band to her wrist her face in the halo of a black lace hat was raised to the judge who spoke slowly letting his words hang one by one in the air she glanced at wynand he was not looking at her nor at the judge then she saw that he was alone in that room he held this moment and he made of it of the glare of the vulgarity a silent height of his own he had not wished a religious ceremony which he did not respect and he could have less respect for the states functionary reciting a formula before him but he made the rite an act of pure religion she thought if she were being married to roark in such a setting roark would stand like this afterward the mockery of the monster reception that followed left him immune he posed with her for the battery of press cameras and he complied gracefully with all the demands of the reporters a special noisier mob within the mob he stood with her in the receiving line shaking an assembly belt of hands that unrolled past them for hours he looked untouched by the lights the haystacks of easter lilies the sounds of a string orchestra the river of people flowing on and breaking into a delta when it reached the champagne untouched by these guests who had come here driven by boredom by an envious hatred a reluctant submission to an invitation bearing his dangerous name a scandalhungry curiosity he looked as if he did not know that they took his public immolation as their rightful due that they considered their presence as the indispensable seal of sacrament upon the occasion that of all the hundreds he and his bride were the only ones to whom the performance was hideous she watched him intently she wanted to see him take pleasure in all this if only for a moment let him accept and join just once she thought let him show the soul of the new york banner in its proper element she saw no acceptance she saw a hint of pain at times but even the pain did not reach him completely and she thought of the only other man she knew who had spoken about suffering that went down only to a certain point when the last congratulations had drifted past them they were free to leave by the rules of the occasion but he made no move to leave she knew he was waiting for her decision she walked away from him into the currents of guests she smiled bowed and listened to offensive nonsense a glass of champagne in her hand she saw her father in the throng he looked proud and wistful he seemed bewildered he had taken the announcement of her marriage quietly he had said i want you to be happy dominique i want it very much i hope hes the right man his tone had said that he was not certain she saw ellsworth toohey in the crowd he noticed her looking at him and turned away quickly she wanted to laugh aloud but the matter of ellsworth toohey caught off guard did not seem important enough to laugh about now alvah scarret pushed his way toward her he was making a poor effort at a suitable expression but his face looked hurt and sullen he muttered something rapid about his wishes for her happiness but then he said distinctly and with a lively anger but why dominique why she could not quite believe that alvah scarret would permit himself the crudeness of what the question seemed to mean she asked coldly what are you talking about alvah the veto of course what veto you know very well what veto now i ask you with every sheet in the city here every damn one of them the lousiest tabloid included and the wire services too everything but the banner everything but the wynand papers what am i to tell people how am i to explain is that a thing for you to do to a former comrade of the trade youd better repeat that alvah you mean you didnt know that gail wouldnt allow a single one of our guys here that we wont have any stories tomorrow not a spread not a picture nothing but two lines on page eighteen no she said i didnt know it he wondered at the sudden jerk of her movement as she turned away from him she handed the champagne glass to the first stranger in sight whom she mistook for a waiter she made her way through the crowd to wynand lets go gail yes my dear she stood incredulously in the middle of the drawing room of his penthouse thinking that this place was now her home and how right it looked to be her home he watched her he showed no desire to speak or touch her only to observe her here in his house brought here lifted high over the city as if the significance of the moment were not to be shared not even with her she moved slowly across the room took off her hat leaned against the edge of a table she wondered why her normal desire to say little to hold things closed broke down before him why she felt compelled to simple frankness such as she could offer no one else youve had your way after all gail you were married as you wanted to be married yes i think so it was useless to try to torture you actually yes but i didnt mind it too much you didnt no if thats what you wanted it was only a matter of keeping my promise but you hated it gail utterly what of it only the first moment was hard when you said it in the car afterward i was rather glad of it he spoke quietly matching her frankness she knew he would leave her the choice he would follow her manner he would keep silent or admit anything she wished to be admitted why didnt you notice your own mistake if it was a mistake you wouldnt have wanted to make me suffer if you were completely indifferent to me no it was not a mistake youre a good loser dominique i think thats also contagion from you gail and theres something i want to thank you for what that you barred our wedding from the wynand papers he looked at her his eyes alert in a special way for a moment then he smiled its out of character your thanking me for that it was out of character for you to do it i had to but i thought youd be angry i should have been but i wasnt im not i thank you can one feel gratitude for gratitude its a little hard to express but thats what i feel dominique she looked at the soft light on the walls around her that lighting was part of the room giving the walls a special texture of more than material or color she thought that there were other rooms beyond these walls rooms she had never seen which were hers now and she found that she wanted them to be hers gail i havent asked you what we are to do now are we going away are we having a honeymoon funny i havent even wondered about it i thought of the wedding and nothing beyond as if it stopped there and you took over from then on also out of character gail but not in my favor this time passivity is not a good sign not for you it might be if im glad of it might though it wont last no were not going anywhere unless you wish to go no then we stay here another peculiar manner of making an exception the proper manner for you and me going away has always been running for both of us this time we dont run yes gail when he held her and kissed her her arm lay bent pressed between her body and his her hand at her shoulder and she felt her cheek touching the faded jasmine bouquet on her wrist its perfume still intact still a delicate suggestion of spring when she entered his bedroom she found that it was not the place she had seen photographed in countless magazines the glass cage had been demolished the room built in its place was a solid vault without a single window it was lighted and airconditioned but neither light nor air came from the outside she lay in his bed and she pressed her palms to the cold smooth sheet at her sides not to let her arms move and touch him but her rigid indifference did not drive him to helpless anger he understood he laughed she heard him say his voice rough without consideration amused it wont do dominique and she knew that this barrier would not be held between them that she had no power to hold it she felt the answer in her body an answer of hunger of acceptance of pleasure she thought that it was not a matter of desire not even a matter of the sexual act but only that man was the life force and woman could respond to nothing else that this man had the will of life the prime power and this act was only its simplest statement and she was responding not to the act nor to the man but to that force within him well asked ellsworth toohey now do you get the point he stood leaning informally against the back of scarrets chair and scarret sat staring down at a hamper full of mail by the side of his desk thousands sighed scarret thousands ellsworth you ought to see what they call him why didnt he print the story of his wedding whats he ashamed of whats he got to hide why didnt he get married in church like any decent man how could he marry a divorcee thats what theyre all asking thousands and he wont even look at the letters gail wynand the man they called the seismograph of public opinion thats right said toohey that kind of a man heres a sample scarret picked up a letter from his desk and read aloud im a respectable woman and mother of five children and i certainly dont think i want to bring up my children with your newspaper have taken same for fourteen years but now that you show that youre the kind of man that has no decency and making a mockery of the holy institution of marriage which is to commit adultery with a fallen woman also another mans wife who gets married in a black dress as she jolly well ought to i wont read your newspaper any more as youre not a man fit for children and im certainly disappointed in you very truly yours mrs thomas parker i read it to him he just laughed uhhuh said toohey whats got into him its nothing that got into him alvah its something that got out at last by the way did you know that many papers dug up their old pictures of dominiques nude statue from that goddamn temple and ran it right with the wedding story to show mrs wynands interest in art the bastards are they glad to get back at gail are they giving it to him the lice wonder who reminded them of that one i wouldnt know well of course its just one of those storms in a teacup theyll forget all about it in a few weeks i dont think it will do much harm no not this incident alone not by itself huh are you predicting something those letters predict it alvah not the letters as such but that he wouldnt read them oh its no use getting too silly either gail knows where to stop and when dont make a mountain out of a mo he glanced up at toohey and his voice switched to christ yes ellsworth youre right what are we going to do nothing my friend nothing not for a long time yet toohey sat down on the edge of scarrets desk and let the tip of his pointed shoe play among the envelopes in the hamper tossing them up making them rustle he had acquired a pleasant habit of dropping in and out of scarrets office at all hours scarret had come to depend on him say ellsworth scarret asked suddenly are you really loyal to the banner alvah dont talk in dialect nobodys really that stuffy no i mean it well you know what i mean havent the faintest idea whos ever disloyal to his bread and butter yeah thats so still you know ellsworth i like you a lot only im never sure when youre just talking my language or when its really yours dont go getting yourself into psychological complexities youll get all tangled up whats on your mind why do you still write for the new frontiers for money oh come thats chicken feed to you well its a prestige magazine why shouldnt i write for them you havent got an exclusive on me no and i dont care who you write for on the side but the new frontiers has been damn funny lately about what about gail wynand oh rubbish alvah no sir this isnt rubbish you just havent noticed guess you dont read it close enough but ive got an instinct about things like that and i know i know when its just some smart young punk taking potshots or when a magazine means business youre nervous alvah and youre exaggerating the new frontiers is a liberal magazine and theyve always sniped at gail wynand everybody has hes never been any too popular in the trade you know hasnt hurt him though has it this is different i dont like it when theres a system behind it a kind of special purpose like a lot of little trickles dribbling along all innocently and pretty soon they make a little stream and it all fits pat and pretty soon getting a persecution mania alvah i dont like it it was all right when people took cracks at his yachts and women and a few municipal election scandals which were never proved he added hastily but i dont like it when its that new intelligentsia slang that people seem to be going for nowadays gail wynand the exploiter gail wynand the pirate of capitalism gail wynand the disease of an era its still crap ellsworth only theres dynamite in that kind of crap its just the modern way of saying the same old things nothing more besides i cant be responsible for the policy of a magazine just because i sell them an article once in a while yeah but thats not what i hear what do you hear i hear youre financing the damn thing who me with what well not you yourself exactly but i hear it was you who got young ronny pickering the booze hound to give them a shot in the arm to the tune of one hundred thousand smackers just about when new frontiers was going the way of all frontiers hell that was just to save ronny from the towns more expensive gutters the kid was going to the dogs gave him a sort of higher purpose in life and put one hundred thousand smackers to better use than the chorus cuties whod have got it out of him anyway yeah but you couldve attached a little string to the gift slipped word to the editors that theyd better lay off gail or else the new frontiers is not the banner alvah its a magazine of principles one doesnt attach strings to its editors and one doesnt tell them or else in this game ellsworth whom are you kidding well if it will set your mind at rest ill tell you something you havent heard its not supposed to be known it was done through a lot of proxies did you know that i just got mitchell layton to buy a nice fat chunk of the banner no yes christ ellsworth thats great mitchell layton we can use a reservoir like that and wait a minute mitchell layton yes whats wrong with mitchell layton isnt he the little boy who couldnt digest grandpaws money grandpaw left him an awful lot of money yeah but hes a crackpot hes the one whos been a yogi then a vegetarian then a unitarian then a nudist and now hes gone to build a palace of the proletariat in moscow so what but jesus a red among our stockholders mitch isnt a red how can one be a red with a quarter of a billion dollars hes just a pale tearose mostly yellow but a nice kid at heart but on the banner alvah youre an ass dont you see ive made him put some dough into a good solid conservative paper thatll cure him of his pink notions and set him in the right direction besides what harm can he do your dear gail controls his papers doesnt he does gail know about this no dear gail hasnt been as watchful in the last five years as he used to be and youd better not tell him you see the way gails going hell need a little pressure and youll need the dough be nice to mitch layton he can come in handy thats so it is you see my hearts in the right place ive helped a puny little liberal mag like the new frontiers but ive also brought a much more substantial hunk of cash to a big stronghold of archconservatism such as the new york banner so you have damn decent of you too considering that youre a kind of radical yourself now are you going to talk about any disloyalty guess not guess youll stand by the old banner of course i will why i love the banner id do anything for it why id give my life for the new york banner walking the soil of a desert island holds one anchored to the rest of the earth but in their penthouse with the telephone disconnected wynand and dominique had no feeling of the fiftyseven floors below them of steel shafts braced against granite and it seemed to them that their home was anchored in space not an island but a planet the city became a friendly sight an abstraction with which no possible communication could be established like the sky a spectacle to be admired but of no direct concern in their lives for two weeks after their wedding they never left the penthouse she could have pressed the button of the elevator and broken these weeks any time she wished she did not wish it she had no desire to resist to wonder to question it was enchantment and peace he sat talking to her for hours when she wanted he was content to sit silently when she preferred and look at her as he looked at the objects in his art gallery with the same distant undisturbing glance he answered any question she put to him he never asked questions he never spoke of what he felt when she wished to be alone he did not call for her one evening she sat reading in her room and saw him standing at the frozen parapet of the dark roof garden outside not looking back at the house only standing in the streak of light from her window when the two weeks ended he went back to his work to the office of the banner but the sense of isolation remained like a theme declared and to be preserved through all their future days he came home in the evening and the city ceased to exist he had no desire to go anywhere he invited no guests he never mentioned it but she knew that he did not want her to step out of the house neither with him nor alone it was a quiet obsession which he did not expect to enforce when he came home he asked have you been out never where have you been it was not jealousy the where did not matter when she wanted to buy a pair of shoes he had three stores send a collection of shoes for her choice it prevented her visit to a store when she said she wanted to see a certain picture he had a projection room built on the roof she obeyed for the first few months when she realized that she loved their isolation she broke it at once she made him accept invitations and she invited guests to their house he complied without protest but he maintained a wall she could not break the wall he had erected between his wife and his newspapers her name never appeared in their pages he stopped every attempt to draw mrs gail wynand into public life to head committees sponsor charity drives endorse crusades he did not hesitate to open her mail if it bore an official letterhead that betrayed its purpose to destroy it without answer and to tell her that he had destroyed it she shrugged and said nothing yet he did not seem to share her contempt for his papers he did not allow her to discuss them she could not discover what he thought of them nor what he felt once when she commented on an offensive editorial he said coldly ive never apologized for the banner i never will but this is really awful gail i thought you married me as the publisher of the banner i thought you didnt like to think of that what i like or dislike doesnt concern you dont expect me to change the banner or sacrifice it i wouldnt do that for anyone on earth she laughed i wouldnt ask it gail he did not laugh in answer in his office in the banner building he worked with a new energy a kind of elated ferocious drive that surprised the men who had known him in his most ambitious years he stayed in the office all night when necessary as he had not done for a long time nothing changed in his methods and policy alvah scarret watched him with satisfaction we were wrong about him ellsworth said scarret to his constant companion its the same old gail god bless him better than ever my dear alvah said toohey nothing is ever as simple as you think nor as fast but hes happy dont you see that hes happy to be happy is the most dangerous thing that could have happened to him and as a humanitarian for once i mean this for his own sake sally brent decided to outwit her boss sally brent was one of the proudest possessions of the banner a stout middleaged woman who dressed like a model for a style show of the twentyfirst century and wrote like a chambermaid she had a large personal following among the readers of the banner her popularity made her overconfident sally brent decided to do a story on mrs gail wynand it was just her type of story and there it was simply going to waste she gained admittance to wynands penthouse using the tactics of gaining admittance to places where one is not wanted which she had been taught as a welltrained wynand employee she made her usual dramatic entrance wearing a black dress with a fresh sunflower on her shoulder her constant ornament that had become a personal trademark and she said to dominique breathlessly mrs wynand ive come here to help you deceive your husband then she winked at her own naughtiness and explained our dear mr wynand has been unfair to you my dear depriving you of your rightful fame for some reason which i just simply cant understand but well fix him you and i what can a man do when we girls get together he simply doesnt know what good copy you are so just give me your story and ill write it and it will be so good that he just simply wont be able not to run it dominique was alone at home and she smiled in a manner which sally brent had never seen before so the right adjectives did not occur to sallys usually observant mind dominique gave her the story she gave the exact kind of story sally had dreamed about yes of course i cook his breakfast said dominique ham and eggs is his favorite dish just plain ham and eggs oh yes miss brent im very happy i open my eyes in the morning and i say to myself it cant be true its not poor little me whos become the wife of the great gail wynand who had all the glamorous beauties of the world to choose from you see ive been in love with him for years he was just a dream to me a beautiful impossible dream and now its like a dream come true please miss brent take this message from me to the women of america patience is always rewarded and romance is just around the corner i think its a beautiful thought and perhaps it will help other girls as it has helped me yes all i want of life is to make gail happy to share his joys and sorrows to be a good wife and mother alvah scarret read the story and liked it so much that he lost all caution run it off alvah sally brent urged him just have a proof run off and leave it on his desk hell okay it see if he wont that evening sally brent was fired her costly contract was bought off it had three more years to run and she was told never to enter the banner building again for any purpose whatsoever scarret protested in panic gail you cant fire sally not sally when i cant fire anyone i wish on my paper ill close it and blow up the goddamn building said wynand calmly but her public well lose her public to hell with her public that night at dinner wynand took from his pocket a crumpled wad of paper the proof cut of the story and threw it without a word at dominiques face across the table it hit her cheek and fell to the floor she picked it up unrolled it saw what it was and laughed aloud sally brent wrote an article on gail wynands love life in a gay intellectual manner in the terms of sociological study the article presented material such as no pulp magazine would have accepted it was published in the new frontiers wynand bought dominique a necklace designed at his special order it was made of diamonds without visible settings spaced wide apart in an irregular pattern like a handful scattered accidentally held together by platinum chains made under a microscope barely noticeable when he clasped it about her neck it looked like drops of water fallen at random she stood before a mirror she slipped her dressing gown off her shoulders and let the raindrops glitter on her skin she said that life story of the bronx housewife who murdered her husbands young mistress is pretty sordid gail but i think theres something dirtier the curiosity of the people who like to read about it and then theres something dirtier still the people who pander to that curiosity actually it was that housewife she has piano legs and such a baggy neck in her pictures who made this necklace possible its a beautiful necklace i shall be proud to wear it he smiled the sudden brightness of his eyes had an odd quality of courage thats one way of looking at it he said theres another i like to think that i took the worst refuse of the human spirit the mind of that housewife and the minds of the people who like to read about her and i made of it this necklace on your shoulders i like to think that i was an alchemist capable of performing so great a purification she saw no apology no regret no resentment as he looked at her it was a strange glance she had noticed it before a glance of simple worship and it made her realize that there is a stage of worship which makes the worshiper himself an object of reverence she was sitting before her mirror when he entered her dressing room on the following night he bent down he pressed his lips to the back of her neck and he saw a square of paper attached to the corner of her mirror it was the decoded copy of the cablegram that had ended her career on the banner fire the bitch g w he lifted his shoulders to stand erect behind her he asked how did you get that ellsworth toohey gave it to me i thought it was worth preserving of course i didnt know it would ever become so appropriate he inclined his head gravely acknowledging the authorship and said nothing else she expected to find the cablegram gone next morning but he had not touched it she would not remove it it remained on display on the corner of her mirror when he held her in his arms she often saw his eyes move to that square of paper she could not tell what he thought in the spring a publishers convention took him away from new york for a week it was their first separation dominique surprised him by coming to meet him at the airport when he returned she was gay and gentle her manner held a promise he had never expected could not trust and found himself trusting completely when he entered the drawing room of their penthouse and slumped down half stretching on a couch she knew that he wanted to lie still here to feel the recaptured safety of his own world she saw his eyes open delivered to her without defense she stood straight ready she said youd better dress gail were going to the theater tonight he lifted himself to a sitting posture he smiled the slanting ridges standing out on his forehead she had a cold feeling of admiration for him the control was perfect all but these ridges he said fine black tie or white white i have tickets for no skin off your nose they were very hard to get it was too much it seemed too ludicrous to be part of this moments contest between them he broke down by laughing frankly in helpless disgust good god dominique not that one why gail its the biggest hit in town your own critic jules fougler he stopped laughing he understood said it was the great play of our age ellsworth toohey said it was the fresh voice of the coming new world alvah scarret said it was not written in ink but in the milk of human kindness sally brent before you fired her said it made her laugh with a lump in her throat why its the godchild of the banner i thought you would certainly want to see it yes of course he said he got up and went to dress no skin off your nose had been running for many months ellsworth toohey had mentioned regretfully in his column that the title of the play had had to be changed slightly as a concession to the stuffy prudery of the middle class which still controls our theater it is a crying example of interference with the freedom of the artist now dont lets hear any more of that old twaddle about ours being a free society originally the title of this beautiful play was an authentic line drawn from the language of the people with the brave simple eloquence of folk expression wynand and dominique sat in the center of the fourth row not looking at each other listening to the play the things being done on the stage were merely trite and crass but the undercurrent made them frightening there was an air about the ponderous inanities spoken which the actors had absorbed like an infection it was in their smirking faces in the slyness of their voices in their untidy gestures it was an air of inanities uttered as revelations and insolently demanding acceptance as such an air not of innocent presumption but of conscious effrontery as if the author knew the nature of his work and boasted of his power to make it appear sublime in the minds of his audience and thus destroy the capacity for the sublime within them the work justified the verdict of its sponsors it brought laughs it was amusing it was an indecent joke acted out not on the stage but in the audience it was a pedestal from which a god had been torn and in his place there stood not satan with a sword but a corner lout sipping a bottle of cocacola there was silence in the audience puzzled and humble when someone laughed the rest joined in with relief glad to learn that they were enjoying themselves jules fougler had not tried to influence anybody he had merely made clear well in advance and through many channels that anyone unable to enjoy this play was basically a worthless human being its no use asking for explanations he had said either youre fine enough to like it or you arent in the intermission wynand heard a stout woman saying its wonderful i dont understand it but i have the feeling that its something very important dominique asked him do you wish to go gail he said no well stay to the end he was silent in the car on their way home when they entered their drawing room he stood waiting ready to hear and accept anything for a moment she felt the desire to spare him she felt empty and very tired she did not want to hurt him she wanted to seek his help then she thought again what she had thought in the theater she thought that this play was the creation of the banner this was what the banner had forced into life had fed upheld made to triumph and it was the banner that had begun and ended the destruction of the stoddard temple the new york banner november one small voice sacrilege by ellsworth m toohey the churches of our childhood by alvah scarret are you happy mr superman and now that destruction was not an event long since past this was not a comparison between two mutually unmeasurable entities a building and a play it was not an accident nor a matter of persons of ike fougler toohey herself and roark it was a contest without time a struggle of two abstractions the thing that had created the building against the things that made the play possible two forces suddenly naked to her in their simple statement two forces that had fought since the world began and every religion had known of them and there had always been a god and a devil only men had been so mistaken about the shapes of their devil he was not single and big he was many and smutty and small the banner had destroyed the stoddard temple in order to make room for this play it could not do otherwise there was no middle choice no escape no neutrality it was one or the other it had always been and the contest had many symbols but no name and no statement roark she heard herself screaming inside roark roark roark dominique whats the matter she heard wynands voice it was soft and anxious he had never allowed himself to betray anxiety she grasped the sound as a reflection of her own face of what he had seen in her face she stood straight and sure of herself and very silent inside im thinking of you gail she said he waited well gail the total passion for the total height she laughed letting her arms swing sloppily in the manner of the actors they had seen say gail have you got a twocent stamp with a picture of george washington on it how old are you gail how hard have you worked your life is more than half over but youve seen your reward tonight your crowning achievement of course no man is ever quite equal to his highest passion now if you strive and make a great effort some day youll rise to the level of that play he stood quietly hearing it accepting i think you should take a manuscript of that play and place it on a stand in the center of your gallery downstairs i think you should rechristen your yacht and call her no skin off your nose i think you should take me keep still and put me in the cast and make me play the role of mary every evening mary who adopts the homeless muskrat and dominique keep still then talk i want to hear you talk ive never justified myself to anyone well boast then that would do just as well if you want to hear it it made me sick that play as you knew it would that was worse than the bronx housewife much worse but i can think of something worse still writing a great play and offering it for tonights audience to laugh at letting oneself be martyred by the kind of people we saw frolicking tonight he saw that something had reached her he could not tell whether it was an answer of surprise or of anger he did not know how well she recognized these words he went on it did make me sick but so have a great many things which the banner has done it was worse tonight because there was a quality about it that went beyond the usual a special kind of malice but if this is popular with fools its the banners legitimate province the banner was created for the benefit of fools what else do you want me to admit what you felt tonight a minor kind of hell because you sat there with me thats what you wanted wasnt it to make me feel the contrast still you miscalculated i looked at the stage and i thought this is what people are like such are their spirits but i ive found you i have you and the contrast was worth the pain i did suffer tonight as you wanted but it was a pain that went only down to a certain point and then shut up she screamed shut up god damn you they stood for a moment both astonished he moved first he knew she needed his help he grasped her shoulders she tore herself away she walked across the room to the window she stood looking at the city at the great buildings spread in black and fire below her after a while she said her voice toneless im sorry gail he did not answer i had no right to say those things to you she did not turn her arms raised holding the frame of the window were even gail im paid back if that will make it better for you i broke first i dont want you to be paid back he spoke quietly dominique what was it nothing what did i make you think of it wasnt what i said it was something else what did the words mean to you nothing a pain that went only down to a certain point it was that sentence why she was looking at the city in the distance she could see the shaft of the cord building dominique ive seen what you can take it must be something very terrible if it could do that to you i must know theres nothing impossible i can help you against it whatever it is she did not answer at the theater it was not just that fool play there was something else for you tonight i saw your face and then it was the same thing again here what is it gail she said softly will you forgive me he let a moment pass he had not been prepared for that what have i to forgive you everything and tonight that was your privilege the condition on which you married me to make me pay for the banner i dont want to make you pay for it why dont you want it any more it cant be paid for in the silence she listened to his steps pacing the room behind her dominique what was it the pain that stops at a certain point nothing only that you had no right to say it the men who have pay for that right a price you cant afford but it doesnt matter now say it if you wish i have no right to say it either that wasnt all i think we have a great deal in common you and i weve committed the same treason somewhere no thats a bad word yes i think its the right word its the only one that has the feeling of what i mean dominique you cant feel that his voice sounded strange she turned to him why because thats what i felt tonight treason toward whom i dont know if i were religious id say god but im not religious thats what i meant gail why should you feel it the banner is not your child there are other forms of the same guilt then he walked to her across the long room he held her in his arms he said you dont know the meaning of the kind of words you use we have a great deal in common but not that id rather you went on spitting at me than trying to share my offenses she let her hand rest against the length of his cheek her fingertips at his temple he asked will you tell me now what it was nothing i undertook more than i could carry youre tired gail why dont you go on upstairs leave me here for a little while i just want to look at the city then ill join you and ill be all right dominique stood at the rail of the yacht the deck warm under her flat sandals the sun on her bare legs the wind blowing her thin white dress she looked at wynand stretched in a deck chair before her she thought of the change she noticed in him again aboard ship she had watched him through the months of their summer cruise she had seen him once running down a companionway the picture remained in her mind a tall white figure thrown forward in a streak of speed and confidence his hand grasped a railing risking deliberately the danger of a sudden break gaining a new propulsion he was not the corrupt publisher of a popular empire he was an aristocrat aboard a yacht he looked she thought like what one believes aristocracy to be when one is young a brilliant kind of gaiety without guilt she looked at him in the deck chair she thought that relaxation was attractive only in those for whom it was an unnatural state then even limpness acquired purpose she wondered about him gail wynand famous for his extraordinary capacity but this was not merely the force of an ambitious adventurer who had created a chain of newspapers this the quality she saw in him here the thing stretched out under the sun like an answer this was greater a first cause a faculty out of universal dynamics gail she said suddenly involuntarily he opened his eyes to look at her i wish i had taken a recording of that he said lazily youd be startled to hear what it sounded like quite wasted here id like to play it back in a bedroom ill repeat it there if you wish thank you dearest and i promise not to exaggerate or presume too much youre not in love with me youve never loved anyone why do you think that if you loved a man it wouldnt be just a matter of a circus wedding and an atrocious evening in the theater youd put him through total hell how do you know that gail why have you been staring at me ever since we met because im not the gail wynand youd heard about you see i love you and love is exceptionmaking if you were in love youd want to be broken trampled ordered dominated because thats the impossible the inconceivable for you in your relations with people that would be the one gift the great exception youd want to offer the man you loved but it wouldnt be easy for you if thats true then you then i become gentle and humble to your great astonishment because im the worst scoundrel living i dont believe that gail no im not the person before last any more not any more well dearest as a matter of fact i am why do you want to think that i dont want to but i like to be honest that has been my only private luxury dont change your mind about me go on seeing me as you saw me before we met gail thats not what you want it doesnt matter what i want i dont want anything except to own you without any answer from you it has to be without answer if you begin to look at me too closely youll see things you wont like at all what things youre so beautiful dominique its such a lovely accident on gods part that theres one person who matches inside and out what things gail do you know what youre actually in love with integrity the impossible the clean consistent reasonable selffaithful the allofonestyle like a work of art thats the only field where it can be found art but you want it in the flesh youre in love with it well you see ive never had any integrity how sure are you of that gail have you forgotten the banner to hell with the banner all right to hell with the banner its nice to hear you say that but the banners not the major symptom that ive never practiced any sort of integrity is not so important whats important is that ive never felt any need for it i hate the conception of it i hate the presumptuousness of the idea dwight carson she said he heard the sound of disgust in her voice he laughed yes dwight carson the man i bought the individualist whos become a mobglorifier and incidentally a dipsomaniac i did that that was worse than the banner wasnt it you dont like to be reminded of that no but surely youve heard enough screaming about it all the giants of the spirit whom ive broken i dont think anybody ever realized how much i enjoyed doing it its a kind of lust im perfectly indifferent to slugs like ellsworth toohey or my friend alvah and quite willing to leave them in peace but just let me see a man of slightly higher dimension and ive got to make a sort of toohey out of him ive got to its like a sex urge why i dont know incidentally you misunderstand ellsworth toohey possibly you dont expect me to waste mental effort to untangle that snails shell and you contradict yourself where why didnt you set out to destroy me the exceptionmaking dominique i love you i had to love you god help you if you were a man gail why why have i done all that yes power dominique the only thing i ever wanted to know that theres not a man living whom i cant force to do anything anything i choose the man i couldnt break would destroy me but ive spent years finding out how safe i am they say i have no sense of honor ive missed something in life well i havent missed very much have i the thing ive missed it doesnt exist he spoke in a normal tone of voice but he noticed suddenly that she was listening with the intent concentration needed to hear a whisper of which one can afford to lose no syllable whats the matter dominique what are you thinking about im listening to you gail she did not say she was listening to his words and to the reason behind them it was suddenly so clear to her that she heard it as an added clause to each sentence even though he had no knowledge of what he was confessing the worst thing about dishonest people is what they think of as honesty he said i know a woman whos never held to one conviction for three days running but when i told her she had no integrity she got very tightlipped and said her idea of integrity wasnt mine it seems shed never stolen any money well shes one thats in no danger from me whatever i dont hate her i hate the impossible conception you love so passionately dominique do you ive had a lot of fun proving it she walked to him and sat down on the deck beside his chair the planks smooth and hot under her bare legs he wondered why she looked at him so gently he frowned she knew that some reflection of what she had understood remained in her eyes and she looked away from him gail why tell me all that its not what you want me to think of you no it isnt why tell you now want the truth because it has to be told because i want to be honest with you only with you and with myself but i wouldnt have the courage to tell you anywhere else not at home not ashore only here because here it doesnt seem quite real does it no i think i hoped that here youd accept it and still think of me as you did when you spoke my name in that way i wanted to record she put her head against his chair her face pressed to his knees her hand dropped fingers halfcurled on the glistening planks of the deck she did not want to show what she had actually heard him saying about himself today on a night of late fall they stood together at the roofgarden parapet looking at the city the long shafts made of lighted windows were like streams breaking out of the black sky flowing down in single drops to feed the great pool of fire below there they are dominique the great buildings the skyscrapers do you remember they were the first link between us were both in love with them you and i she thought she should resent his right to say it but she felt no resentment yes gail im in love with them she looked at the vertical threads of light that were the cord building she raised her fingers off the parapet just enough to touch the place of its unseen form on the distant sky she felt no reproach from it i like to see a man standing at the foot of a skyscraper he said it makes him no bigger than an ant isnt that the correct bromide for the occasion the goddamn fools its man who made it the whole incredible mass of stone and steel it doesnt dwarf him it makes him greater than the structure it reveals his true dimensions to the world what we love about these buildings dominique is the creative faculty the heroic in man do you love the heroic in man gail i love to think of it i dont believe it she leaned against the parapet and watched the green lights stretched in a long straight line far below she said i wish i could understand you i thought i should be quite obvious ive never hidden anything from you he watched the electric signs that flashed in disciplined spasms over the black river then he pointed to a blurred light far to the south a faint reflection of blue thats the banner building see over there that blue light ive done so many things but ive missed one the most important theres no wynand building in new york some day ill build a new home for the banner it will be the greatest structure of the city and it will bear my name i started in a miserable dump and the paper was called the gazette i was only a stooge for some very filthy people but i thought then of the wynand building that would rise some day ive thought of it all the years since why havent you built it i wasnt ready for it why im not ready for it now i dont know why i know only that its very important to me it will be the final symbol ill know the right time when it comes he turned to look out to the west to a path of dim scattered lights he pointed thats where i was born hells kitchen she listened attentively he seldom spoke of his beginning i was sixteen when i stood on a roof and looked at the city like tonight and decided what i would be the quality of his voice became a line underscoring the moment saying take notice this is important not looking at him she thought this was what he had waited for this should give her the answer the key to him years ago thinking of gail wynand she had wondered how such a man faced his life and his work she expected boasting and a hidden sense of shame or impertinence flaunting its own guilt she looked at him his head lifted his eyes level on the sky before him he conveyed none of the things she had expected he conveyed a quality incredible in this connection a sense of gallantry she knew it was a key but it made the puzzle greater yet something within her understood knew the use of that key and made her speak gail fire ellsworth toohey he turned to her bewildered why gail listen her voice had an urgency she had never shown in speaking to him ive never wanted to stop toohey ive even helped him i thought he was what the world deserved i havent tried to save anything from him or anyone i never thought it would be the banner the banner which he fits best that id want to save from him what on earth are you talking about gail when i married you i didnt know id come to feel this kind of loyalty to you it contradicts everything ive done it contradicts so much more than i can tell you its a sort of catastrophe for me a turning point dont ask me why it will take me years to understand i know only that this is what i owe you fire ellsworth toohey get him out before its too late youve broken many much less vicious men and much less dangerous fire toohey go after him and dont rest until youve destroyed every last bit of him why why should you think of him just now because i know what hes after what is he after control of the wynand papers he laughed aloud it was not derision or indignation just pure gaiety greeting the point of a silly joke gail she said helplessly oh for gods sake dominique and here ive always respected your judgment youve never understood toohey and i dont care to can you see me going after ellsworth toohey a tank to eliminate a bedbug why should i fire elsie hes the kind that makes money for me people love to read his twaddle i dont fire good boobytraps like that hes as valuable to me as a piece of flypaper thats the danger part of it his wonderful following ive had bigger and better sobsisters on my payroll when a few of them had to be kicked out that was the end of them their popularity stopped at the door of the banner but the banner went on its not his popularity its the special nature of it you cant fight him on his terms youre only a tank and thats a very clean innocent weapon an honest weapon that goes first out in front and mows everything down or takes every counterblow hes a corrosive gas the kind that eats lungs out i think there really is a secret to the core of evil and he has it i dont know what it is i know how he uses it and what hes after control of the wynand papers control of the wynand papers as one of the means to an end what end control of the world he said with patient disgust what is this dominique what sort of gag and what for im serious gail im terribly serious control of the world my dear belongs to men like me the tooheys of this earth wouldnt know how to dream about it ill try to explain its very difficult the hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident which everybody has decided not to see but if youll listen i wont listen youll forgive me but discussing the idea of ellsworth toohey as a threat to me is ridiculous discussing it seriously is offensive gail i no darling i dont think you really understand much about the banner and i dont want you to i dont want you to take any part in it forget it leave the banner to me is it a demand gail its an ultimatum all right forget it dont go acquiring horror complexes about anyone as big as ellsworth toohey its not like you all right gail lets go in its too cold for you here without an overcoat he chuckled softly it was the kind of concern she had never shown for him before he took her hand and kissed her palm holding it against his face for many weeks when left alone together they spoke little and never about each other but it was not a silence of resentment it was the silence of an understanding too delicate to limit by words they would be in a room together in the evening saying nothing content to feel each others presence they would look at each other suddenly and both would smile the smile like hands clasped then one evening she knew he would speak she sat at her dressingtable he came in and stood leaning against the wall beside her he looked at her hands at her naked shoulders but she felt as if he did not see her he was looking at something greater than the beauty of her body greater than his love for her he was looking at himself and this she knew was the one incomparable tribute i breathe for my own necessity for the fuel of my body for my survival ive given you not my sacrifice or my pity but my ego and my naked need she heard roarks words roarks voice speaking for gail wynand and she felt no sense of treason to roark in using the words of his love for the love of another man gail she said gently some day ill have to ask your forgiveness for having married you he shook his head slowly smiling she said i wanted you to be my chain to the world youve become my defense instead and that makes my marriage dishonest no i told you i would accept any reason you chose but youve changed everything for me or was it i that changed it i dont know weve done something strange to each other ive given you what i wanted to lose that special sense of living i thought this marriage would destroy for me the sense of life as exaltation and you youve done all the things i would have done do you know how much alike we are i knew that from the first but it should have been impossible gail i want to remain with you now for another reason to wait for an answer i think when i learn to understand what you are ill understand myself there is an answer there is a name for the thing we have in common i dont know it i know its very important probably i suppose i should want to understand it but i dont i cant care about anything now i cant even be afraid she looked up at him and said very calmly i am afraid gail of what dearest of what im doing to you why i dont love you gail i cant care even about that she dropped her head and he looked down at the hair that was like a pale helmet of polished metal dominique she raised her face to him obediently i love you dominique i love you so much that nothing can matter to me not even you can you understand that only my love not your answer not even your indifference ive never taken much from the world i havent wanted much ive never really wanted anything not in the total undivided way not with the kind of desire that becomes an ultimatum yes or no and one cant accept the no without ceasing to exist thats what you are to me but when one reaches that stage its not the object that matters its the desire not you but i the ability to desire like that nothing less is worth feeling or honoring and ive never felt that before dominique ive never known how to say mine about anything not in the sense i say it about you mine did you call it a sense of life as exaltation you said that you understand i cant be afraid i love you dominique i love you youre letting me say it now i love you she reached over and took the cablegram off her mirror she crumpled it her fingers twisting slowly in a grinding motion against her palm he stood listening to the crackle of the paper she leaned forward opened her hand over the wastebasket and let the paper drop her hand remained still for a moment the fingers extended slanting down as they had opened part four howard roark the leaves streamed down trembling in the sun they were not green only a few scattered through the torrent stood out in single drops of a green so bright and pure that it hurt the eyes the rest were not a color but a light the substance of fire on metal living sparks without edges and it looked as if the forest were a spread of light boiling slowly to produce this color this green rising in small bubbles the condensed essence of spring the trees met bending over the road and the spots of sun on the ground moved with the shifting of the branches like a conscious caress the young man hoped he would not have to die not if the earth could look like this he thought not if he could hear the hope and the promise like a voice with leaves tree trunks and rocks instead of words but he knew that the earth looked like this only because he had seen no sign of men for hours he was alone riding his bicycle down a forgotten trail through the hills of pennsylvania where he had never been before where he could feel the fresh wonder of an untouched world he was a very young man he had just graduated from college in this spring of the year and he wanted to decide whether life was worth living he did not know that this was the question in his mind he did not think of dying he thought only that he wished to find joy and reason and meaning in life and that none had been offered to him anywhere he had not liked the things taught to him in college he had been taught a great deal about social responsibility about a life of service and selfsacrifice everybody had said it was beautiful and inspiring only he had not felt inspired he had felt nothing at all he could not name the thing he wanted of life he felt it here in this wild loneliness but he did not face nature with the joy of a healthy animal as a proper and final setting he faced it with the joy of a healthy man as a challenge as tools means and material so he felt anger that he should find exultation only in the wilderness that this great sense of hope had to be lost when he would return to men and mens work he thought that this was not right that mans work should be a higher step an improvement on nature not a degradation he did not want to despise men he wanted to love and admire them but he dreaded the sight of the first house poolroom and movie poster he would encounter on his way he had always wanted to write music and he could give no other identity to the thing he sought if you want to know what it is he told himself listen to the first phrases of tchaikovskys first concerto or the last movement of rachmaninoffs second men have not found the words for it nor the deed nor the thought but they have found the music let me see that in one single act of man on earth let me see it made real let me see the answer to the promise of that music not servants nor those served not altars and immolations but the final the fulfilled innocent of pain dont help me or serve me but let me see it once because i need it dont work for my happiness my brothers show me yours show me that it is possible show me your achievement and the knowledge will give me courage for mine he saw a blue hole ahead where the road ended on the crest of a ridge the blue looked cool and clean like a film of water stretched in the frame of green branches it would be funny he thought if i came to the edge and found nothing but that blue beyond nothing but the sky ahead above and below he closed his eyes and went on suspending the possible for a moment granting himself a dream a few instants of believing that he would reach the crest open his eyes and see the blue radiance of the sky below his foot touched the ground breaking his motion he stopped and opened his eyes he stood still in the broad valley far below him in the first sunlight of early morning he saw a town only it was not a town towns did not look like that he had to suspend the possible for a while longer to seek no questions or explanations only to look there were small houses on the ledges of the hill before him flowing down to the bottom he knew that the ledges had not been touched that no artifice had altered the unplanned beauty of the graded steps yet some power had known how to build on these ledges in such a way that the houses became inevitable and one could no longer imagine the hills as beautiful without them as if the centuries and the series of chances that produced these ledges in the struggle of great blind forces had waited for their final expression had been only a road to a goal and the goal was these buildings part of the hills shaped by the hills yet ruling them by giving them meaning the houses were plain field stone like the rocks jutting from the green hillsides and of glass great sheets of glass used as if the sun were invited to complete the structures sunlight becoming part of the masonry there were many houses they were small they were cut off from one another and no two of them were alike but they were like variations of a single theme like a symphony played by an inexhaustible imagination and one could still hear the laughter of the force that had been let loose on them as if that force had run unrestrained challenging itself to be spent but had never reached its end music he thought the promise of the music he had invoked the sense of it made real there it was before his eyes he did not see it he heard it in chords he thought that there was a common language of thought sight and sound was it mathematics the discipline of reason music was mathematics and architecture was music in stone he knew he was dizzy because this place below him could not be real he saw trees lawns walks twisting up the hillsides steps cut in the stone he saw fountains swimming pools tennis courts and not a sign of life the place was uninhabited it did not shock him not as the sight of it had shocked him in a way it seemed proper this was not part of known existence for the moment he had no desire to know what it was after a long time he glanced about him and then he saw that he was not alone some steps away from him a man sat on a boulder looking down at the valley the man seemed absorbed in the sight and had not heard his approach the man was tall and gaunt and had orange hair he walked straight to the man who turned his eyes to him the eyes were gray and calm the boy knew suddenly that they felt the same thing and he could speak as he would not speak to a stranger anywhere else that isnt real is it the boy asked pointing down why yes it is now the man answered its not a movie set or a trick of some kind no its a summer resort its just been completed it will be opened in a few weeks who built it i did whats your name howard roark thank you said the boy he knew that the steady eyes looking at him understood everything these two words had to cover howard roark inclined his head in acknowledgment wheeling his bicycle by his side the boy took the narrow path down the slope of the hill to the valley and the houses below roark looked after him he had never seen that boy before and he would never see him again he did not know that he had given someone the courage to face a lifetime roark had never understood why he was chosen to build the summer resort at monadnock valley it had happened a year and a half ago in the fall of he had heard of the project and gone to see mr caleb bradley the head of some vast company that had purchased the valley and was doing a great deal of loud promotion he went to see bradley as a matter of duty without hope merely to add another refusal to his long list of refusals he had built nothing in new york since the stoddard temple when he entered bradleys office he knew that he must forget monadnock valley because this man would never give it to him caleb bradley was a short pudgy person with a handsome face between rounded shoulders the face looked wise and boyish unpleasantly ageless he could have been fifty or twenty he had blank blue eyes sly and bored but it was difficult for roark to forget monadnock valley so he spoke of it forgetting that speech was useless here mr bradley listened obviously interested but obviously not in what roark was saying roark could almost feel some third entity present in the room mr bradley said little beyond promising to consider it and to get in touch with him but then he said a strange thing he asked in a voice devoid of all clue to the purpose of the question neither in approval nor scorn youre the architect who built the stoddard temple arent you mr roark yes said roark funny that i hadnt thought of you myself said mr bradley roark went away thinking that it would have been funny if mr bradley had thought of him three days later bradley telephoned and invited him to his office roark came and met four other men the board of the monadnock valley company they were welldressed men and their faces were as closed as mr bradleys please tell these gentlemen what you told me mr roark bradley said pleasantly roark explained his plan if what they wished to build was an unusual summer resort for people of moderate incomes as they had announced then they should realize that the worst curse of poverty was the lack of privacy only the very rich or the very poor of the city could enjoy their summer vacations the very rich because they had private estates the very poor because they did not mind the feel and smell of one anothers flesh on public beaches and public dance floors the people of good taste and small income had no place to go if they found no rest or pleasure in herds why was it assumed that poverty gave one the instincts of cattle why not offer these people a place where for a week or a month at small cost they could have what they wanted and needed he had seen monadnock valley it could be done dont touch those hillsides dont blast and level them down not one huge ant pile of a hotel but small houses hidden from one another each a private estate where people could meet or not as they pleased not one fishmarket tank of a swimming pool but many private swimming pools as many as the company wished to afford he could show them how it could be done cheaply not one stockfarm corral of tennis courts for exhibitionists but many private tennis courts not a place where one went to meet refined company and land a husband in two weeks but a resort for people who enjoyed their own presence well enough and sought only a place where they would be left free to enjoy it the men listened to him silently he saw them exchanging glances once in a while he felt certain that they were the kind of glances people exchange when they cannot laugh at the speaker aloud but it could not have been that because he signed a contract to build the monadnock valley summer resort two days later he demanded mr bradleys initials on every drawing that came out of his drafting rooms he remembered the stoddard temple mr bradley initialed signed okayed he agreed to everything he approved everything he seemed delighted to let roark have his way but this eager complaisance had a peculiar undertone as if mr bradley were humoring a child he could learn little about mr bradley it was said that the man had made a fortune in real estate in the florida boom his present company seemed to command unlimited funds and the names of many wealthy backers were mentioned as shareholders roark never met them the four gentlemen of the board did not appear again except on short visits to the construction site where they exhibited little interest mr bradley was in full charge of everything but beyond a close watch over the budget he seemed to like nothing better than to leave roark in full charge in the eighteen months that followed roark had no time to wonder about mr bradley roark was building his greatest assignment for the last year he lived at the construction site in a shanty hastily thrown together on a bare hillside a wooden enclosure with a bed a stove and a large table his old draftsmen came to work for him again some abandoning better jobs in the city to live in shacks and tents to work in naked plank barracks that served as architects office there was so much to build that none of them thought of wasting structural effort on their own shelters they did not realize until much later that they had lacked comforts and then they did not believe it because the year at monadnock valley remained in their minds as the strange time when the earth stopped turning and they lived through twelve months of spring they did not think of the snow the frozen clots of earth wind whistling through the cracks of planking thin blankets over army cots stiff fingers stretched over coal stoves in the morning before a pencil could be held steadily they remembered only the feeling which is the meaning of spring ones answer to the first blades of grass the first buds on tree branches the first blue of the sky the singing answer not to grass trees and sky but to the great sense of beginning of triumphant progression of certainty in an achievement that nothing will stop not from leaves and flowers but from wooden scaffoldings from steam shovels from blocks of stone and sheets of glass rising out of the earth they received the sense of youth motion purpose fulfillment they were an army and it was a crusade but none of them thought of it in these words except steven mallory steven mallory did the fountains and all the sculpture work of monadnock valley but he came to live at the site long before he was needed battle thought steven mallory is a vicious concept there is no glory in war and no beauty in crusades of men but this was a battle this was an army and a war and the highest experience in the life of every man who took part in it why where was the root of the difference and the law to explain it he did not speak of it to anyone but he saw the same feeling in mikes face when mike arrived with the gang of electricians mike said nothing but he winked at mallory in cheerful understanding i told you not to worry mike said to him once without preamble at the trial that was he cant lose quarries or no quarries trials or no trials they cant beat him steve they just cant not the whole goddamn world but they had really forgotten the world thought mallory this was a new earth their own the hills rose to the sky around them as a wall of protection and they had another protection the architect who walked among them down the snow or the grass of the hillsides over the boulders and the piled planks to the drafting tables to the derricks to the tops of rising walls the man who had made this possible the thought in the mind of that man and not the content of that thought nor the result not the vision that had created monadnock valley nor the will that had made it real but the method of his thought the rule of its function the method and rule which were not like those of the world beyond the hills that stood on guard over the valley and over the crusaders within it and then he saw mr bradley come to visit the site to smile blandly and depart again then mallory felt anger without reason and fear howard mallory said one night when they sat together at a fire of dry branches on the hillside over the camp its the stoddard temple again yes said roark i think so but i cant figure out in just what way or what theyre after he rolled over on his stomach and looked down at the panes of glass scattered through the darkness below they caught reflections from somewhere and looked like phosphorescent selfgenerated springs of light rising out of the ground he said it doesnt matter steve does it not what they do about it nor who comes to live here only that weve made it would you have missed this no matter what price they make you pay for it afterward no said mallory roark had wanted to rent one of the houses for himself and spend the summer there the first summer of monadnock valleys existence but before the resort was open he received a wire from new york i told you i would didnt i it took five years to get rid of my friends and brothers but the aquitania is now mine and yours come to finish it kent lansing so he went back to new york to see the rubble and cement dust cleared away from the hulk of the unfinished symphony to see derricks swing girders high over central park to see the gaps of windows filled the broad decks spread over the roofs of the city the aquitania hotel completed glowing at night in the parks skyline he had been very busy in the last two years monadnock valley had not been his only commission from different states from unexpected parts of the country calls had come for him private homes small office buildings modest shops he had built them snatching a few hours of sleep on trains and planes that carried him from monadnock valley to distant small towns the story of every commission he received was the same i was in new york and i liked the enright house i saw the cord building i saw a picture of that temple they tore down it was as if an underground stream flowed through the country and broke out in sudden springs that shot to the surface at random in unpredictable places they were small inexpensive jobs but he was kept working that summer with monadnock valley completed he had no time to worry about its future fate but steven mallory worried about it why dont they advertise it howard why the sudden silence have you noticed there was so much talk about their grand project so many little items in print before they started there was less and less while we were doing it and now mr bradley and company have gone deafmute now when youd expect them to stage a press agents orgy why i wouldnt know said roark im an architect not a rental agent why should you worry weve done our job let them do theirs in their own way its a damn queer way did you see their ads the few theyve let dribble out they say all the things you told them about rest peace and privacy but how they say it do you know what those ads amount to in effect come to monadnock valley and be bored to death it sounds it actually sounds as if they were trying to keep people away i dont read ads steve but within a month of its opening every house in monadnock valley was rented the people who came were a strange mixture society men and women who could have afforded more fashionable resorts young writers and unknown artists engineers and newspapermen and factory workers suddenly spontaneously people were talking about monadnock valley there was a need for that kind of a resort a need no one had tried to satisfy the place became news but it was private news the papers had not discovered it mr bradley had no press agents mr bradley and his company had vanished from public life one magazine unsolicited printed four pages of photographs of monadnock valley and sent a man to interview howard roark by the end of summer the houses were leased in advance for the following year in october early one morning the door of roarks reception room flew open and steven mallory rushed in making straight for roarks office the secretary tried to stop him roark was working and no interruptions were allowed but mallory shoved her aside and tore into the office slamming the door behind she noticed that he held a newspaper in his hand roark glanced up at him from the drafting table and dropped his pencil he knew that this was the way mallorys face had looked when he shot at ellsworth toohey well howard do you want to know why you got monadnock valley he threw the newspaper down on the table roark saw the heading of a story on the third page caleb bradley arrested its all there said mallory dont read it it will make you sick all right steve what is it they sold two hundred percent of it who did of what bradley and his gang of monadnock valley mallory spoke with a forced vicious selftorturing precision they thought it was worthless from the first they got the land practically for nothing they thought it was no place for a resort at all out of the way with no bus lines or movie theaters around they thought the time wasnt right and the public wouldnt go for it they made a lot of noise and sold snares to a lot of wealthy suckers it was just a huge fraud they sold two hundred percent of the place they got twice what it cost them to build it they were certain it would fail they wanted it to fail they expected no profits to distribute they had a nice scheme ready for how to get out of it when the place went bankrupt they were prepared for anything except for seeing it turn into the kind of success it is and they couldnt go on because now theyd have to pay their backers twice the amount the place earned each year and its earning plenty and they thought they had arranged for certain failure howard dont you understand they chose you as the worst architect they could find roark threw his head back and laughed god damn you howard its not funny sit down steve stop shaking you look as if youd just seen a whole field of butchered bodies i have ive seen worse ive seen the root ive seen what makes such fields possible what do the damn fools think of as horror wars murders fires earthquakes to hell with that this is horror that story in the paper thats what men should dread and fight and scream about and call the worst shame on their record howard im thinking of all the explanations of evil and all the remedies offered for it through the centuries none of them worked none of them explained or cured anything but the root of evil my drooling beast its there howard in that story in that and in the souls of the smug bastards wholl read it and say oh well genius must always struggle its good for em and then go and look for some village idiot to help to teach him how to weave baskets thats the drooling beast in action howard think of monadnock close your eyes and see it and then think that the men who ordered it believed it was the worst thing they could build howard theres something wrong something very terribly wrong in the world if you were given your greatest job as a filthy joke when will you stop thinking about that about the world and me when will you learn to forget it when will dominique he stopped they had not mentioned that name in each others presence for five years he saw mallorys eyes intent and shocked mallory realized that his words had hurt roark hurt him enough to force this admission but roark turned to him and said deliberately dominique used to think just as you do mallory had never spoken of what he guessed about roarks past their silence had always implied that mallory understood that roark knew it and that it was not to be discussed but now mallory asked are you still waiting for her to come back mrs gail wynand god damn her roark said without emphasis shut up steve mallory whispered im sorry roark walked to his table and said his voice normal again go home steve and forget about bradley theyll all be suing one another now but we wont be dragged in and they wont destroy monadnock forget it and get out i have to work he brushed the newspaper off the table with his elbow and bent over the sheets of drafting paper there was a scandal over the revelations of the financing methods behind monadnock valley there was a trial a few gentlemen sentenced to the penitentiary and a new management taking monadnock over for the shareholders roark was not involved he was busy and he forgot to read the accounts of the trial in the papers mr bradley admitted in apology to his partners that he would be damned if he could have expected a resort built on a crazy unsociable plan ever to become successful i did all i could i chose the worst fool i could find then austen heller wrote an article about howard roark and monadnock valley he spoke of all the buildings roark had designed and he put into words the things roark had said in structure only they were not austen hellers usual quiet words they were a ferocious cry of admiration and of anger and may we be damned if greatness must reach us through fraud the article started a violent controversy in art circles howard mallory said one day some months later youre famous yes said roark i suppose so threequarters of them dont know what its all about but theyve heard the other onequarter fighting over your name and so now they feel they must pronounce it with respect of the fighting quarter fourtenths are those who hate you threetenths are those who feel they must express an opinion in any controversy twotenths are those who play safe and herald any discovery and onetenth are those who understand but theyve all found out suddenly that there is a howard roark and that hes an architect the aga bulletin refers to you as a great but unruly talent and the museum of the future has hung up photographs of monadnock the enright house the cord building and the aquitania under beautiful glass next to the room where theyve got gordon l prescott and still im glad kent lansing said one evening heller did a grand job do you remember howard what i told you once about the psychology of a pretzel dont despise the middleman hes necessary someone had to tell them it takes two to make a very great career the man who is great and the man almost rarer who is great enough to see greatness and say so ellsworth toohey wrote the paradox in all this preposterous noise is the fact that mr caleb bradley is the victim of a grave injustice his ethics are open to censure but his esthetics were unimpeachable he exhibited sounder judgment in matters of architectural merit than mr austen heller the outmoded reactionary who has suddenly turned art critic mr caleb bradley was martyred by the bad taste of his tenants in the opinion of this column his sentence should have been commuted in recognition of his artistic discrimination monadnock valley is a fraud but not merely a financial one there was little response to roarks fame among the solid gentlemen of wealth who were the steadiest source of architectural commissions the men who had said roark never heard of him now said roark hes too sensational but there were men who were impressed by the simple fact that roark had built a place which made money for owners who didnt want to make money this was more convincing than abstract artistic discussions and there was the onetenth who understood in the year after monadnock valley roark built two private homes in connecticut a movie theater in chicago a hotel in philadelphia in the spring of a western city completed plans for a worlds fair to be held next year an international exposition to be known as the march of the centuries the committee of distinguished civic leaders in charge of the project chose a council of the countrys best architects to design the fair the civic leaders wished to be conspicuously progressive howard roark was one of the eight architects chosen when he received the invitation roark appeared before the committee and explained that he would be glad to design the fair alone but you cant be serious mr roark the chairman declared after all with a stupendous undertaking of this nature we want the best that can be had i mean two heads are better than one you know and eight heads why you can see for yourself the best talents of the country the brightest names you know friendly consultation cooperation and collaboration you know what makes great achievements i do then you realize if you want me youll have to let me do it all alone i dont work with councils you wish to reject an opportunity like this a shot in history a chance of world fame practically a chance of immortality i dont work with collectives i dont consult i dont cooperate i dont collaborate there was a great deal of angry comment on roarks refusal in architectural circles people said the conceited bastard the indignation was too sharp and raw for a mere piece of professional gossip each man took it as a personal insult each felt himself qualified to alter advise and improve the work of any man living the incident illustrates to perfection wrote ellsworth toohey the antisocial nature of mr howard roarks egotism the arrogance of the unbridled individualism which he has always personified among the eight chosen to design the march of the centuries were peter keating gordon l prescott ralston holcombe i wont work with howard roark said peter keating when he saw the list of the council youll have to choose its he or i he was informed that mr roark had declined keating assumed leadership over the council the press stories about the progress of the fairs construction referred to peter keating and his associates keating had acquired a sharp intractable manner in the last few years he snapped orders and lost his patience before the smallest difficulty when he lost his patience he screamed at people he had a vocabulary of insults that carried a caustic insidious almost feminine malice his face was sullen in the fall of roark moved his office to the top floor of the cord building he had thought when he designed that building that it would be the place of his office some day when he saw the inscription howard roark architect on his new door he stopped for a moment then he walked into the office his own room at the end of a long suite had three walls of glass high over the city he stopped in the middle of the room through the broad panes he could see the fargo store the enright house the aquitania hotel he walked to the windows facing south and stood there for a long time at the tip of manhattan far in the distance he could see the dana building by henry cameron on an afternoon of november returning to his office after a visit to the site of a house under construction on long island roark entered the reception room shaking his drenched raincoat and saw a look of suppressed excitement on the face of his secretary she had been waiting impatiently for his return mr roark this is probably something very big she said i made an appointment for you for three oclock tomorrow afternoon at his office whose office he telephoned half an hour ago mr gail wynand a sign hung over the entrance door a reproduction of the papers masthead the new york banner the sign was small a statement of fame and power that needed no emphasis it was like a fine mocking smile that justified the buildings bare ugliness the building was a factory scornful of all ornament save the implications of that masthead the entrance lobby looked like the mouth of a furnace elevators drew a stream of human fuel and spat it out the men did not hurry but they moved with subdued haste the propulsion of purpose nobody loitered in that lobby the elevator doors clicked like valves a pulsating rhythm in their sound drops of red and green light flashed on a wall board signaling the progress of cars high in space it looked as if everything in that building were run by such control boards in the hands of an authority aware of every motion as if the building were flowing with channeled energy functioning smoothly soundlessly a magnificent machine that nothing could destroy nobody paid any attention to the redheaded man who stopped in the lobby for a moment howard roark looked up at the tiled vault he had never hated anyone somewhere in this building was its owner the man who had made him feel his nearest approach to hatred gail wynand glanced at the small clock on his desk in a few minutes he had an appointment with an architect the interview he thought would not be difficult he had held many such interviews in his life he merely had to speak he knew what he wanted to say and nothing was required of the architect except a few sounds signifying understanding his glance went from the clock back to the sheets of proofs on his desk he read an editorial by alvah scarret on the public feeding of squirrels in central park and a column by ellsworth toohey on the great merits of an exhibition of paintings done by the workers of the city department of sanitation a buzzer rang on his desk and his secretarys voice said mr howard roark mr wynand okay said wynand flicking the switch off as his hand moved back he noticed the row of buttons at the edge of his desk bright little knobs with a color code of their own each representing the end of a wire that stretched to some part of the building each wire controlling some man each man controlling many men under his orders each group of men contributing to the final shape of words on paper to go into millions of homes into millions of human brains these little knobs of colored plastic there under his fingers but he had no time to let the thought amuse him the door of his office was opening he moved his hand away from the buttons wynand was not certain that he missed a moment that he did not rise at once as courtesy demanded but remained seated looking at the man who entered perhaps he had risen immediately and it only seemed to him that a long time preceded his movement roark was not certain that he stopped when he entered the office that he did not walk forward but stood looking at the man behind the desk perhaps there had been no break in his steps and it only seemed to him that he had stopped but there had been a moment when both forgot the terms of immediate reality when wynand forgot his purpose in summoning this man when roark forgot that this man was dominiques husband when no door desk or stretch of carpet existed only the total awareness for each of the man before him only two thoughts meeting in the middle of the room this is gail wynand this is howard roark then wynand rose his hand motioned in simple invitation to the chair beside his desk roark approached and sat down and they did not notice that they had not greeted each other wynand smiled and said what he had never intended to say he said very simply i dont think youll want to work for me i want to work for you said roark who had come here prepared to refuse have you seen the kind of things ive built yes wynand smiled this is different its not for my public its for me youve never built anything for yourself before no if one doesnt count the cage i have up on a roof and this old printing factory here can you tell me why ive never built a structure of my own with the means of erecting a city if i wished i dont know i think youd know he forgot that he did not allow men he hired the presumption of personal speculation upon him because youve been unhappy said roark he said it simply without insolence as if nothing but total honesty were possible to him here this was not the beginning of an interview but the middle it was like a continuation of something begun long ago wynand said make that clear i think you understand i want to hear you explain it most people build as they live as a matter of routine and senseless accident but a few understand that building is a great symbol we live in our minds and existence is the attempt to bring that life into physical reality to state it in gesture and form for the man who understands this a house he owns is a statement of his life if he doesnt build when he has the means its because his life has not been what he wanted you dont think its preposterous to say that to me of all people no i dont either roark smiled but you and i are the only two whod say it either part of it that i didnt have what i wanted or that i could be included among the few expected to understand any sort of great symbols you dont want to retract that either no how old are you thirtysix i owned most of the papers i have now when i was thirtysix he added i didnt mean that as any kind of a personal remark i dont know why i said that i just happened to think of it what do you wish me to build for you my home wynand felt that the two words had some impact on roark apart from any normal meaning they could convey he sensed it without reason he wanted to ask whats the matter but couldnt since roark had really shown nothing you were right in your diagnosis said wynand because you see now i do want to build a house of my own now im not afraid of a visible shape for my life if you want it said directly as you did now im happy what kind of house in the country ive purchased the site an estate in connecticut five hundred acres what kind of a house youll decide that did mrs wynand choose me for the job no mrs wynand knows nothing about this it was i who wanted to move out of the city and she agreed i did ask her to select the architect my wife is the former dominique francon she was once a writer on architecture but she preferred to leave the choice to me you want to know why i picked you i took a long time to decide i felt rather lost at first i had never heard of you i didnt know any architects at all i mean this literally and im not forgetting the years ive spent in real estate the things ive built and the imbeciles who built them for me this is not a stoneridge this is what did you call it a statement of my life then i saw monadnock it was the first thing that made me remember your name but i gave myself a long test i went around the country looking at homes hotels all sorts of buildings every time i saw one i liked and asked who had designed it the answer was always the same howard roark so i called you he added shall i tell you how much i admire your work thank you said roark he closed his eyes for an instant you know i didnt want to meet you why have you heard about my art gallery yes i never meet the men whose work i love the work means too much to me i dont want the men to spoil it they usually do theyre an anticlimax to their own talent youre not i dont mind talking to you i told you this only because i want you to know that i respect very little in life but i respect the things in my gallery and your buildings and mans capacity to produce work like that maybe its the only religion ive ever had he shrugged i think ive destroyed perverted corrupted just about everything that exists but ive never touched that why are you looking at me like this im sorry please tell me about the house you want i want it to be a palace only i dont think palaces are very luxurious theyre so big so promiscuously public a small house is the true luxury a residence for two people only for my wife and me it wont be necessary to allow for a family we dont intend to have children nor for visitors we dont intend to entertain one guest room in case we should need it but not more than that living room dining room library two studies one bedroom servants quarters garage thats the general idea ill give you the details later the cost whatever you need the appearance he smiled shrugging ive seen your buildings the man who wants to tell you what a house should look like must either be able to design it better or shut up ill say only that i want my house to have the roark quality what is that i think you understand i want to hear you explain it i think some buildings are cheap showoffs all front and some are cowards apologizing for themselves in every brick and some are the eternal unfit botched malicious and false your buildings have one sense above all a sense of joy not a placid joy a difficult demanding kind of joy the kind that makes one feel as if it were an achievement to experience it one looks and thinks im a better person if i can feel that roark said slowly not in the tone of an answer i suppose it was inevitable what that you would see that why do you say it as if you regretted my being able to see it i dont regret it listen dont hold it against me the things ive built before i dont its all those stoneridges and noyesbelmont hotels and wynand papers that made it possible for me to have a house by you isnt that a luxury worth achieving does it matter how they were the means youre the end you dont have to justify yourself to me i wasnt jus yes i think thats what i was doing you dont need to i wasnt thinking of what youve built what were you thinking that im helpless against anyone who sees what you saw in my buildings you felt you wanted help against me no only i dont feel helpless as a rule im not prompted to justify myself as a rule either then its all right isnt it yes i must tell you much more about the house i want i suppose an architect is like a father confessor he must know everything about the people who are to live in his house since what he gives them is more personal than their clothes or food please consider it in that spirit and forgive me if you notice that this is difficult for me to say ive never gone to confession you see i want this house because im very desperately in love with my wife whats the matter do you think its an irrelevant statement no go on i cant stand to see my wife among other people its not jealousy its much more and much worse i cant stand to see her walking down the streets of a city i cant share her not even with shops theaters taxicabs or sidewalks i must take her away i must put her out of reach where nothing can touch her not in any sense this house is to be a fortress my architect is to be my guard roark sat looking straight at him he had to keep his eyes on wynand in order to be able to listen wynand felt the effort in that glance he did not recognize it as effort only as strength he felt himself supported by the glance he found that nothing was hard to confess this house is to be a prison no not quite that a treasury a vault to guard things too precious for sight but it must be more it must be a separate world so beautiful that well never miss the one we left a prison only by the power of its own perfection not bars and ramparts but your talent standing as a wall between us and the world thats what i want of you and more have you ever built a temple for a moment roark had no strength to answer but he saw that the question was genuine wynand didnt know yes said roark then think of this commission as you would think of a temple a temple to dominique wynand i want you to meet her before you design it i met mrs wynand some years ago you have then you understand i do wynand saw roarks hand lying on the edge of his desk the long fingers pressed to the glass next to the proofs of the banner the proofs were folded carelessly he saw the heading one small voice inside the page he looked at roarks hand he thought he would like to have a bronze paperweight made of it and how beautiful it would look on his desk now you know what i want go ahead start at once drop anything else youre doing ill pay whatever you wish i want that house by summer oh forgive me too much association with bad architects i havent asked whether you want to do it roarks hand moved first he took it off the desk yes said roark ill do it wynand saw the prints of the fingers left on the glass distinct as if the skin had cut grooves in the surface and the grooves were wet how long will it take you wynand asked youll have it by july of course you must see the site i want to show it to you myself shall i drive you down there tomorrow morning if you wish be here at nine yes do you want me to draw up a contract i have no idea how you prefer to work as a rule before i deal with a man in any matter i make it a point to know everything about him from the day of his birth or earlier ive never checked up on you i simply forgot it didnt seem necessary i can answer any question you wish wynand smiled and shook his head no theres nothing i need to ask you except about the business arrangements i never make any conditions except one if you accept the preliminary drawings of the house it is to be built as i designed it without any alterations of any kind certainly thats understood ive heard you dont work otherwise but will you mind if i dont give you any publicity on this house i know it would help you professionally but i want this building kept out of the newspapers i wont mind that will you promise not to release pictures of it for publication i promise thank you ill make up for it you may consider the wynand papers as your personal press service ill give you all the plugging you wish on any other work of yours i dont want any plugging wynand laughed aloud what a thing to say in what a place i dont think you have any idea how your fellow architects would have conducted this interview i dont believe you were actually conscious at any time that you were speaking to gail wynand i was said roark this was my way of thanking you i dont always like being gail wynand i know that im going to change my mind and ask you a personal question you said youd answer anything i will have you always liked being howard roark roark smiled the smile was amused astonished involuntarily contemptuous youve answered said wynand then he rose and said nine oclock tomorrow morning extending his hand when roark had gone wynand sat behind his desk smiling he moved his hand toward one of the plastic buttons and stopped he realized that he had to assume a different manner his usual manner that he could not speak as he had spoken in the last halfhour then he understood what had been strange about the interview for the first time in his life he had spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance the sense of pressure the need of disguise he had always experienced when he spoke to people there had been no strain and no need of strain as if he had spoken to himself he pressed the button and said to his secretary tell the morgue to send me everything they have on howard roark guess what said alvah scarret his voice begging to be begged for his information ellsworth toohey waved a hand impatiently in a brushingoff motion not raising his eyes from his desk go way alvah im busy no but this is interesting ellsworth really its interesting i know youll want to know toohey lifted his head and looked at him the faint contraction of boredom in the corners of his eyes letting scarret understand that this moment of attention was a favor he drawled in a tone of emphasized patience all right what is it scarret saw nothing to resent in tooheys manner toohey had treated him like that for the last year or longer scarret had not noticed the change it was too late to resent it it had become normal to them both scarret smiled like a bright pupil who expects the teacher to praise him for discovering an error in the teachers own textbook ellsworth your private fbi is slipping what are you talking about bet you dont know what gails been doing and you always make such a point of keeping yourself informed what dont i know guess who was in his office today my dear alvah i have no time for quiz games you wouldnt guess in a thousand years very well since the only way to get rid of you is to play the vaudeville stooge i shall ask the proper question who was in dear gails office today howard roark toohey turned to him full face forgetting to dole out his attention and said incredulously no yes said scarret proud of the effect well said toohey and burst out laughing scarret half smiled tentatively puzzled anxious to join in but not quite certain of the cause for amusement yes its funny but just exactly why ellsworth oh alvah it would take so long to tell you i had an idea it might havent you any sense of the spectacular alvah dont you like fireworks if you want to know what to expect just think that the worst wars are religious wars between sects of the same religion or civil wars between brothers of the same race i dont quite follow you oh dear i have so many followers i brush them out of my hair well im glad youre so cheerful about it but i thought its bad of course its bad but not for us but look you know bow weve gone out on a limb you particularly on how this roark is just about the worst architect in town and if now our own boss hires him isnt it going to be embarrassing oh that oh maybe well im glad you take it that way what was he doing in wynands office is it a commission thats what i dont know cant find out nobody knows have you heard of mr wynand planning to build anything lately no have you no i guess my fbi is slipping oh well one does the best one can but you know ellsworth i had an idea i had an idea where this might be very helpful to us indeed what idea ellsworth gails been impossible lately scarret uttered it solemnly with the air of imparting a discovery toohey sat half smiling well of course you predicted it ellsworth you were right youre always right ill be damned if i can figure out just whats happening to him whether its dominique or some sort of a change of life or what but somethings happening why does he get fits suddenly and start reading every damn line of every damn edition and raise hell for the silliest reasons hes killed three of my best editorials lately and hes never done that to me before never you know what he said to me he said motherhood is wonderful alvah but for gods sake go easy on the bilge theres a limit even for intellectual depravity what depravity that was the sweetest mothers day editorial i ever put together honest i was touched myself since when has he learned to talk about depravity the other day he called jules fougler a bargainbasement mind right to his face and threw his sunday piece into the wastebasket a swell piece too on the workers theater jules fougler our best writer no wonder gail hasnt got a friend left in the place if they hated his guts before you ought to hear them now ive heard them hes losing his grip ellsworth i dont know what id do if it werent for you and the swell bunch of people you picked theyre practically our whole actual working staff those youngsters of yours not our old sacred cows whore writing themselves out anyway those bright kids will keep the banner going but gail listen last week he fired dwight carson now you know i think that was significant of course dwight was just a deadweight and a damn nuisance but he was the first one of those special pets of gails the boys who sold their souls so in a way you see i liked having dwight around it was all right it was healthy it was a relic of gails best days i always said it was gails safety valve and when he suddenly let carson go i didnt like it ellsworth i didnt like it at all what is this alvah are you telling me things i dont know or is this just in the nature of letting off steam do forgive the mixed metaphor on my shoulder i guess so i dont like to knock gail but ive been so damn mad for so long im fit to be tied but heres what im driving at this howard roark what does he make you think of i could write a volume on that alvah this is hardly the time to launch into such an undertaking no but i mean whats the one thing we know about him thats hes a crank and a freak and a fool all right but what else that hes one of those fools you cant budge with love or money or a sixteeninch gun hes worse than dwight carson worse than the whole lot of galls pets put together well get my point whats gail going to do when he comes up against that kind of a man one of several possible things one thing only if i know gail and i know gail thats why i feel kind of hopeful this is what hes needed for a long time a swig of his old medicine the safety valve hell go out to break that guys spine and it will be good for gail the best thing in the world bring him back to normal that was my idea ellsworth he waited saw no complementary enthusiasm on tooheys face and finished lamely well i might be wrong i dont know it might mean nothing at all i just thought that was psychology thats what it was alvah then you think itll work that way it might or it might be much worse than anything you imagine but its of no importance to us any more because you see alvah as far as the banner is concerned if it came to a showdown between us and our boss we dont have to be afraid of mr gail wynand any longer when the boy from the morgue entered carrying a thick envelope of clippings wynand looked up from his desk and said that much i didnt know he was so famous well its the stoddard trial mr wynand the boy stopped there was nothing wrong only the ridges on wynands forehead and he did not know wynand well enough to know what these meant he wondered what made him feel as if he should be afraid after a moment wynand said all right thank you the boy deposited the envelope on the glass surface of the desk and walked out wynand sat looking at the bulging shape of yellow paper he saw it reflected in the glass as if the bulk had eaten through the surface and grown roots to his desk he looked at the walls of his office and he wondered whether they contained a power which could save him from opening that envelope then he pulled himself erect he put both forearms in a straight line along the edge of the desk his fingers stretched and meeting he looked down past his nostrils at the surface of the desk he sat for a moment grave proud collected like the angular mummy of a pharaoh then he moved one hand pulled the envelope forward opened it and began to read sacrilege by ellsworth m toohey the churches of our childhood by alvah scarret editorials sermons speeches statements letters to the editor the banner unleashed fullblast photographs cartoons interviews resolutions of protest letters to the editor he read every word methodically his hands on the edge of the desk fingers meeting not lifting the clippings not touching them reading them as they lay on top of the pile moving a hand only to turn a clipping over and read the one beneath moving the hand with a mechanical perfection of timing the fingers rising as his eyes took the last word not allowing the clipping to remain in sight a second longer than necessary but he stopped for a long time to look at the photographs of the stoddard temple he stopped longer to look at one of roarks pictures the picture of exaltation captioned are you happy mr superman he tore it from the story it illustrated and slipped it into his desk drawer then he continued reading the trial the testimony of ellsworth m toohey of peter keating of ralston holcombe of gordon l prescott no quotations from the testimony of dominique francon only a brief report the defense rests a few mentions in one small voice then a gap the next clipping dated three years later monadnock valley it was late when he finished reading his secretaries had left he felt the sense of empty rooms and halls around him but he heard the sound of presses a low rumbling vibration that went through every room he had always liked that the sound of the buildings heart beating he listened they were running off tomorrows banner he sat without moving for a long time roark and wynand stood on the top of a hill looking over a spread of land that sloped away in a long gradual curve bare trees rose on the hilltop and descended to the shore of a lake their branches geometrical compositions cut through the air the color of the sky a clear fragile bluegreen made the air colder the cold washed the colors of the earth revealing that they were not colors but only the elements from which color was to come the dead brown not a full brown but a future green the tired purple an overture to flame the gray a prelude to gold the earth was like the outline of a great story like the steel frame of a building to be filled and finished holding all the splendor of the future in naked simplification where do you think the house should stand asked wynand here said roark i hoped youd choose this wynand had driven his car from the city and they had walked for two hours down the paths of his new estate through deserted lanes through a forest past the lake to the hill now wynand waited while roark stood looking at the countryside spread under his feet wynand wondered what reins this man was gathering from all the points of the landscape into his hand when roark turned to him wynand asked may i speak to you now of course roark smiled amused by the deference which he had not requested wynands voice sounded clear and brittle like the color of the sky above them with the same quality of icegreen radiance why did you accept this commission because im an architect for hire you know what i mean im not sure i do dont you hate my guts no why should i you want me to speak of it first of what the stoddard temple roark smiled so you did check up on me since yesterday i read our clippings he waited but roark said nothing all of them his voice was harsh half defiance half plea everything we said about you the calm of roarks face drove him to fury he went on giving slow full value to each word we called you an incompetent fool a tyro a charlatan a swindler an egomaniac stop torturing yourself wynand closed his eyes as if roark had struck him in a moment he said mr roark you dont know me very well you might as well learn this i dont apologize i never apologize for any of my actions what made you think of apology i havent asked for it i stand by every one of those descriptive terms i stand by every word printed in the banner i havent asked you to repudiate it i know what you think you understood that i didnt know about the stoddard temple yesterday i had forgotten the name of the architect involved you concluded it wasnt i who led that campaign against you youre right it wasnt i i was away at the time but you dont understand that the campaign was in the true and proper spirit of the banner it was in strict accordance with the banners function no one is responsible for it but me alvah scarret was doing only what i taught him had i been in town i would have done the same thats your privilege you dont believe i would have done it no i havent asked you for compliments and i havent asked you for pity i cant do what youre asking for what do you think im asking that i slap your face why dont you i cant pretend an anger i dont feel said roark its not pity its much more cruel than anything i could do only im not doing it in order to be cruel if i slapped your face youd forgive me for the stoddard temple is it you who should seek forgiveness no you wish i did you know that theres an act of forgiveness involved youre not clear about the actors you wish i would forgive you or demand payment which is the same thing and you believe that that would close the record but you see i have nothing to do with it im not one of the actors it doesnt matter what i do or feel about it now youre not thinking of me i cant help you im not the person youre afraid of just now who is yourself who gave you the right to say all this you did well go on do you wish the rest go on i think it hurts you to know that youve made me suffer you wish you hadnt and yet theres something that frightens you more the knowledge that i havent suffered at all go on the knowledge that im neither kind nor generous now but simply indifferent it frightens you because you know that things like the stoddard temple always require payment and you see that im not paying for it you were astonished that i accepted this commission do you think my acceptance required courage you needed far greater courage to hire me you see this is what i think of the stoddard temple im through with it youre not wynand let his fingers fall open palms out his shoulders sagged a little relaxing he said very simply all right its true all of it then he stood straight but with a kind of quiet resignation as if his body were consciously made vulnerable i hope you know youve given me a beating in your own way he said yes and youve taken it so youve accomplished what you wanted shall we say were even and forget the stoddard temple youre very wise or ive been very obvious either is your achievement nobodys ever caused me to become obvious before shall i still do what you want what do you think i want now personal recognition from me its my turn to give in isnt it youre appallingly honest arent you why shouldnt i be i cant give you the recognition of having made me suffer but youll take the substitute of having given me pleasure wont you all right then im glad you like me i think you know this is as much an exception for me as your taking a beating i dont usually care whether im liked or not i do care this time im glad wynand laughed aloud youre as innocent and presumptuous as an emperor when you confer honors you merely exalt yourself what in hell made you think i liked you now you dont want any explanations of that youve reproached me once for causing you to be obvious wynand sat down on a fallen tree trunk he said nothing but his movement was an invitation and a demand roark sat down beside him roarks face was sober but the trace of a smile remained amused and watchful as if every word he heard were not a disclosure but a confirmation youve come up from nothing havent you wynand asked you came from a poor family yes how did you know that just because it feels like a presumption the thought of handing you anything a compliment an idea or a fortune i started at the bottom too who was your father a steel puddler mine was a longshoreman did you hold all sorts of funny jobs when you were a child all sorts mostly in the building trades i did worse than that i did just about everything what job did you like best catching rivets on steel structures i liked being a bootblack on a hudson ferry i should have hated that but i didnt i dont remember the people at all i remember the city the city always there on the shore spread out waiting as if i were tied to it by a rubber band the band would stretch and carry me away to the other shore but it would always snap back and i would return it gave me the feeling that id never escaped from that city and it would never escape from me roark knew that wynand seldom spoke of his childhood by the quality of his words they were bright and hesitant untarnished by usage like coins that had not passed through many hands were you ever actually homeless and starving wynand asked a few times did you mind that no i didnt either i minded something else did you want to scream when you were a child seeing nothing but fat ineptitude around you knowing how many things could be done and done so well but having no power to do them having no power to blast the empty skulls around you having to take orders and thats bad enough but to take orders from your inferiors have you felt that yes did you drive the anger back inside of you and store it and decide to let yourself be torn to pieces if necessary but reach the day when youd rule those people and all people and everything around you no you didnt you let yourself forget no i hate incompetence i think its probably the only thing i do hate but it didnt make me want to rule people nor to teach them anything it made me want to do my own work in my own way and let myself be torn to pieces if necessary and you were no not in any way that counts you dont mind looking back at anything no i do there was one night i was beaten and i crawled to a door i remember the pavement it was right under my nostrils i can still see it there were veins in the stone and white spots i had to make sure that that pavement moved i couldnt feel whether i was moving or not but i could tell by the pavement i had to see that those veins and spots changed i had to reach the next pattern or the crack six inches away it took a long time and i knew it was blood under my stomach his voice had no tone of selfpity it was simple impersonal with a faint sound of wonder roark said id like to help you wynand smiled slowly not gaily i believe you could i even believe that it would be proper two days ago i would have murdered anyone whod think of me as an object for help you know of course that that nights not what i hate in my past not what i dread to look back on it was only the least offensive to mention the other things cant be talked about i know i meant the other things what are they you name them the stoddard temple you want to help me with that yes youre a damn fool dont you realize dont you realize im doing it already how by building this house for you roark saw the slanting ridges on wynands forehead wynands eyes seemed whiter than usual as if the blue had ebbed from the iris two white ovals luminous on his face he said and getting a fat commission check for it he saw roarks smile suppressed before it appeared fully the smile would have said that this sudden insult was a declaration of surrender more eloquent than the speeches of confidence the suppression said that roark would not help him over this particular moment why of course said roark calmly wynand got up lets go were wasting time i have more important things to do at the office they did not speak on their way back to the city wynand drove his car at ninety miles an hour the speed made two solid walls of blurred motion on the sides of the road as if they were flying down a long closed silent corridor he stopped at the entrance to the cord building and let roark out he said youre free to go back to that site as often as you wish mr roark i dont have to go with you you can get the surveys and all the information you need from my office please do not call on me again until it is necessary i shall be very busy let me know when the first drawings are ready when the drawings were ready roark telephoned wynands office he had not spoken to wynand for a month please hold the wire mr roark said wynands secretary he waited the secretarys voice came back and informed him that mr wynand wished the drawings brought to his office that afternoon she gave the hour wynand would not answer in person when roark entered the office wynand said how do you do mr roark his voice gracious and formal no memory of intimacy remained on his blank courteous face roark handed him the plans of the house and a large perspective drawing wynand studied each sheet he held the drawing for a long time then he looked up i am very much impressed mr roark the voice was offensively correct i have been quite impressed by you from the first i have thought it over and i want to make a special deal with you his glance was directed at roark with a soft emphasis almost with tenderness as if he were showing that he wished to treat roark cautiously to spare him intact for a purpose of his own he lifted the sketch and held it up between two fingers letting all the light hit it straight on the white sheet glowed as a reflector for a moment pushing the black pencil lines eloquently forward you want to see this house erected wynand asked softly you want it very much yes said roark wynand did not move his hand only parted his fingers and let the cardboard drop face down on the desk it will be erected mr roark just as you designed it just as it stands on this sketch on one condition roark sat leaning back his hands in his pockets attentive waiting you dont want to ask me what condition mr roark very well ill tell you i shall accept this house on condition that you accept the deal i offer you i wish to sign a contract whereby you will be sole architect for any building i undertake to erect in the future as you realize this would be quite an assignment i venture to say i control more structural work than any other single person in the country every man in your profession has wanted to be known as my exclusive architect i am offering it to you in exchange you will have to submit yourself to certain conditions before i name them id like to point out some of the consequences should you refuse as you may have heard i do not like to be refused the power i hold can work two ways it would be easy for me to arrange that no commission be available to you anywhere in this country you have a small following of your own but no prospective employer can withstand the kind of pressure i am in a position to exert you have gone through wasted periods of your life before they were nothing compared to the blockade i can impose you might have to go back to a granite quarry oh yes i know about that summer of the francon quarry in connecticut how private detectives mr roark you might have to go back to a granite quarry only i shall see to it that the quarries also will be closed to you now ill tell you what i want of you in all the gossip about gail wynand no one had ever mentioned the expression of his face as it was in this moment the few men who had seen it did not talk about it of these men dwight carson had been the first wynands lips were parted his eyes brilliant it was an expression of sensual pleasure derived from agony the agony of his victim or his own or both i want you to design all my future commercial structures as the public wishes commercial structures to be designed youll build colonial houses rococo hotels and semigrecian office buildings youll exercise your matchless ingenuity within forms chosen by the taste of the people and youll make money for me youll take your spectacular talent and make it obedient originality and subservience together they call it harmony youll create in your sphere what the banner is in mine do you think it took no talent to create the banner such will be your future career but the house youve designed for me shall be erected as you designed it it will be the last roark building to rise on earth nobody will have one after mine youve read about ancient rulers who put to death the architect of their palace that no others might equal the glory he had given them they killed the architect or cut his eyes out modern methods are different for the rest of your life youll obey the will of the majority i shant attempt to offer you any arguments i am merely stating an alternative youre the kind of man who can understand plain language you have a simple choice if you refuse youll never build anything again if you accept youll build this house which you want so much to see erected and a great many other houses which you wont like but which will make money for both of us for the rest of your life youll design rental developments such as stoneridge that is what i want he leaned forward waiting for one of the reactions he knew well and enjoyed a look of anger or indignation or ferocious pride why of course said roark gaily ill be glad to do it thats easy he reached over took a pencil and the first piece of paper he saw on wynands desk a letter with an imposing letterhead he drew rapidly on the back of the letter the motion of his hand was smooth and confident wynand looked at his face bent over the paper he saw the unwrinkled forehead the straight line of the eyebrows attentive but untroubled by effort roark raised his head and threw the paper to wynand across the desk is this what you want wynands house stood drawn on the paper with colonial porches a gambrel roof two massive chimneys a few little pilasters a few porthole windows it was not a parody it was a serious job of adaptation in what any professor would have called excellent taste good god no the gasp was instinctive and immediate then shut up said roark and dont ever let me hear any architectural suggestions wynand slumped down in his chair and laughed he laughed for a long time unable to stop it was not a happy sound roark shook his head wearily you knew better than that and its such an old one to me my antisocial stubbornness is so well known that i didnt think anyone would waste time trying to tempt me again howard i meant it until i saw this i knew you meant it i didnt think you could be such a fool you knew you were taking a terrible kind of chance none at all i had an ally i could trust what your integrity yours gail wynand sat looking down at the surface of his desk after a while he said youre wrong about that i dont think so wynand lifted his head he looked tired he sounded indifferent it was your method of the stoddard trial again wasnt it the defense rests i wish i had been in the courtroom to hear that sentence you did throw the trial back at me again didnt you call it that but this time you won i suppose you know im not glad that you won i know youre not dont think it was one of those temptations when you tempt just to test your victim and are happy to be beaten and smile and say well at last heres the kind of man i want dont imagine that dont make that excuse for me im not i know what you wanted i wouldnt have lost so easily before this would have been only the beginning i know i can try further i dont want to try not because youd probably hold out to the end but because i wouldnt hold out no im not glad and im not grateful to you for this but it doesnt matter gail how much lying to yourself are you actually capable of im not lying everything i just told you is true i thought you understood it everything you just told me yes i wasnt thinking of that youre wrong in what youre thinking youre wrong in remaining here do you wish to throw me out you know i cant wynands glance moved from roark to the drawing of the house lying face down on his desk he hesitated for a moment looking at the blank cardboard then turned it over he asked softly shall i tell you now what i think of this youve told me howard you spoke about a house as a statement of my life do you think my life deserves a statement like this yes is this your honest judgment my honest judgment gail my most sincere one my final one no matter what might happen between us in the future wynand put the drawing down and sat studying the plans for a long time when he raised his head he looked calm and normal why did you stay away from here he asked you were busy with private detectives wynand laughed oh that i couldnt resist my old bad habits and i was curious now i know everything about you except the women in your life either youve been very discreet or there havent been many no information available on that anywhere there havent been many i think i missed you it was a kind of substitute gathering the details of your past why did you actually stay away you told me to are you always so meek about taking orders when i find it advisable well heres an order hope you place it among the advisable ones come to have dinner with us tonight ill take this drawing home to show my wife ive told her nothing about the house so far you havent told her no i want her to see this and i want you to meet her i know she hasnt been kind to you in the past i read what she wrote about you but its so long ago i hope it doesnt matter now no it doesnt matter then will you come yes dominique stood at the glass door of her room wynand saw the starlight on the ice sheets of the roof garden outside he saw its reflection touching the outline of her profile a faint radiance on her eyelids on the planes of her cheeks he thought that this was the illumination proper to her face she turned to him slowly and the light became an edge around the pale straight mass of her hair she smiled as she had always smiled at him a quiet greeting of understanding whats the matter gail good evening dear why you look happy thats not the word but its the nearest light is nearer i feel light thirty years lighter not that id want to be what i was thirty years ago one never does what the feeling means is only a sense of being carried back intact as one is now back to the beginning its quite illogical and impossible and wonderful what the feeling usually means is that youve met someone a woman as a rule i have not a woman a man dominique youre very beautiful tonight but i always say that its not what i wanted to say its this i am very happy tonight that youre so beautiful what is it gail nothing only a feeling of how much is unimportant and how easy it is to live he took her hand and held it to his lips dominique ive never stopped thinking its a miracle that our marriage has lasted now i believe that it wont be broken by anything or anyone she leaned back against the glass pane i have a present for you dont remind me its the sentence i use more often than any other i will have a present for you by the end of this summer our house the house you havent spoken of it for so long i thought you had forgotten ive thought of nothing else for the last six months you havent changed your mind you do want to move out of the city yes gail if you want it so much have you decided on an architect ive done more than that i have the drawing of the house to show you oh id like to see it its in my study come on i want you to see it she smiled and closed her fingers over his wrist a brief pressure like a caress of encouragement then she followed him he threw the door of his study open and let her enter first the light was on and the drawing stood propped on his desk facing the door she stopped her hands behind her palms flattened against the doorjamb she was too far away to see the signature but she knew the work and the only man who could have designed that house her shoulders moved describing a circle twisting slowly as if she were tied to a pole had abandoned hope of escape and only her body made a last instinctive gesture of protest she thought were she lying in bed in roarks arms in the sight of gail wynand the violation would be less terrible this drawing more personal than roarks body created in answer to a matching force that came from gail wynand was a violation of her of roark of wynand and yet she knew suddenly that it was the inevitable no she whispered things like that are never a coincidence what but she held up her hand softly pushing back all conversation and she walked to the drawing her steps soundless on the carpet she saw the sharp signature in the corner howard roark it was less terrifying than the shape of the house it was a thin point of support almost a greeting dominique she turned her face to him he saw her answer he said i knew youd like it forgive the inadequacy were stuck for words tonight she walked to the davenport and sat down she let her back press against the cushions it helped to sit straight she kept her eyes on wynand he stood before her leaning on the mantelpiece half turned away looking at the drawing she could not escape that drawing wynands face was like a mirror of it youve seen him gail whom the architect of course ive seen him not an hour ago when did you first meet him last month you knew him all this time every evening when you came home at the dinner table you mean why didnt i tell you i wanted to have the sketch to show you i saw the house like this but i couldnt explain it i didnt think anyone would ever understand what i wanted and design it he did who howard roark she had wanted to hear the name pronounced by gail wynand how did you happen to choose him gail i looked all over the country every building i liked had been done by him she nodded slowly dominique i take it for granted you dont care about it any more but i know that i picked the one architect you spent all your time denouncing when you were on the banner you read that i read it you had an odd way of doing it it was obvious that you admired his work and hated him personally but you defended him at the stoddard trial yes you even worked for him once that statue dominique it was made for his temple yes its strange you lost your job on the banner for defending him i didnt know it when i chose him i didnt know about that trial i had forgotten his name dominique in a way its he who gave you to me that statue from his temple and now hes going to give me this house dominique why did you hate him i didnt hate him it was so long ago i suppose none of that matters now does it he pointed to the drawing i havent seen him for years youre going to see him in about an hour hes coming here for dinner she moved her hand tracing a spiral on the arm of the davenport to convince herself that she could here yes youve asked him for dinner he smiled he remembered his resentment against the presence of guests in their house he said this is different i want him here i dont think you remember him well or you wouldnt be astonished she got up all right gail ill give the orders then ill get dressed they faced each other across the drawing room of gail wynands penthouse she thought how simple it was he had always been here he had been the motive power of every step she had taken in these rooms he had brought her here and now he had come to claim this place she was looking at him she was seeing him as she had seen him on the morning when she awakened in his bed for the last time she knew that neither his clothes nor the years stood between her and the living intactness of that memory she thought this had been inevitable from the first from the instant when she had looked down at him on the ledge of a quarry it had to come like this in gail wynands house and now she felt the peace of finality knowing that her share of decision had ended she had been the one who acted but he would act from now on she stood straight her head level the planes of her face had a military cleanliness of precision and a feminine fragility her hands hung still composed by her sides parallel with the long straight lines of her black dress how do you do mr roark how do you do mrs wynand may i thank you for the house you have designed for us it is the most beautiful of your buildings it had to be by the nature of the assignment mrs wynand she turned her head slowly how did you present the assignment to mr roark gail just as i spoke of it to you she thought of what roark had heard from wynand and had accepted she moved to sit down the two men followed her example roark said if you like the house the first achievement was mr wynands conception of it she asked are you sharing the credit with a client yes in a way i believe this contradicts what i remember of your professional convictions but supports my personal ones im not sure i ever understood that i believe in conflict mrs wynand was there a conflict involved in designing this house the desire not to be influenced by my client in what way i have liked working for some people and did not like working for others but neither mattered this time i knew that the house would be what it became only because it was being done for mr wynand i had to overcome this or rather i had to work with it and against it it was the best way of working the house had to surpass the architect the client and the future tenant it did but the house its you howard said wynand its still you it was the first sign of emotion on her face a quiet shock when she heard the howard wynand did not notice it roark did he glanced at her his first glance of personal contact she could read no comment in it only a conscious affirmation of the thought that had shocked her thank you for understanding that gail he answered she was not certain whether she had heard him stressing the name its strange said wynand i am the most offensively possessive man on earth i do something to things let me pick up an ash tray from a dimestore counter pay for it and put it in my pocket and it becomes a special kind of ash tray unlike any on earth because its mine its an extra quality in the thing like a sort of halo i feel that about everything i own from my overcoat to the oldest linotype in the composing room to the copies of the banner on newsstands to this penthouse to my wife and ive never wanted to own anything as much as i want this house youre going to build for me howard i will probably be jealous of dominique living in it i can be quite insane about things like that and yet i dont feel that ill own it because no matter what i do or say its still yours it will always be yours it has to be mine said roark but in another sense gail you own that house and everything else ive built you own every structure youve stopped before and heard yourself answering in what sense in the sense of that personal answer what you feel in the presence of a thing you admire is just one word yes the affirmation the acceptance the sign of admittance and that yes is more than an answer to one thing its a kind of amen to life to the earth that holds this thing to the thought that created it to yourself for being able to see it but the ability to say yes or no is the essence of all ownership its your ownership of your own ego your soul if you wish your soul has a single basic function the act of valuing yes or no i wish or i do not wish you cant say yes without saying i theres no affirmation without the one who affirms in this sense everything to which you grant your love is yours in this sense you share things with others no its not sharing when i listen to a symphony i love i dont get from it what the composer got his yes was different from mine he could have no concern for mine and no exact conception of it that answer is too personal to each man but in giving himself what he wanted he gave me a great experience im alone when i design a house gail and you can never know the way in which i own it but if you said you own amen to it its also yours and im glad its yours wynand said smiling i like to think that that i own monadnock and the enright house and the cord building and the stoddard temple said dominique she had listened to them she felt numb wynand had never spoken like this to any guest in their house roark had never spoken like this to any client she knew that the numbness would break into anger denial indignation later now it was only a cutting sound in her voice a sound to destroy what she had heard she thought that she succeeded wynand answered the word dropping heavily yes forget the stoddard temple gail said roark there was such a simple careless gaiety in his voice that no solemn dispensation could have been more effective yes howard said wynand smiling she saw roarks eyes turned to her i have not thanked you mrs wynand for accepting me as your architect i know that mr wynand chose me and you could have refused my services i wanted to tell you that im glad you didnt she thought i believe it because none of this can be believed ill accept anything tonight im looking at him she said courteously indifferent wouldnt it be a reflection on my judgment to suppose that i would wish to reject a house you had designed mr roark she thought that nothing she said aloud could matter tonight wynand asked howard that yes once granted can it be withdrawn she wanted to laugh in incredulous anger it was wynands voice that had asked this it should have been hers he must look at me when he answers she thought he must look at me never roark answered looking at wynand theres so much nonsense about human inconstancy and the transience of all emotions said wynand ive always thought that a feeling which changes never existed in the first place there are books i liked at the age of sixteen i still like them the butler entered carrying a tray of cocktails holding her glass she watched roark take his off the tray she thought at this moment the glass stem between his fingers feels just like the one between mine we have this much in common wynand stood holding a glass looking at roark with a strange kind of incredulous wonder not like a host like an owner who cannot quite believe his ownership of his prize possession she thought im not insane im only hysterical but its quite all right im saying something i dont know what it is but it must be all right they are both listening and answering gail is smiling i must be saying the proper things dinner was announced and she rose obediently she led the way to the dining room like a graceful animal given poise by conditioned reflexes she sat at the head of the table between the two men facing each other at her sides she watched the silverware in roarks fingers the pieces of polished metal with the initials d w she thought i have done this so many times i am the gracious mrs gail wynand there were senators judges presidents of insurance companies sitting at dinner in that place at my right and this is what i was being trained for this is why gail has been rising through tortured years to the position of entertaining senators and judges at dinner for the purpose of reaching an evening when the guest facing him would be howard roark wynand spoke about the newspaper business he showed no reluctance to discuss it with roark and she pronounced a few sentences when it seemed necessary her voice had a luminous simplicity she was being carried along unresisting any personal reaction would be superfluous even pain or fear she thought if in the flow of conversation wynands next sentence should be youve slept with him she would answer yes gail of course just as simply but wynand seldom looked at her when he did she knew by his face that hers was normal afterward they were in the drawing room again and she saw roark standing at the window against the lights of the city she thought gail built this place as a token of his own victory to have the city always before him the city where he did run things at last but this is what it had really been built for to have roark stand at that window and i think gail knows it tonight roarks body blocking miles out of that perspective with only a few dots of fire and a few cubes of lighted glass left visible around the outline of his figure he was smoking and she watched his cigarette moving slowly against the black sky as he put it between his lips then held it extended in his fingers and she thought they are only sparks from his cigarette those points glittering in space behind him she said softly gail always liked to look at the city at night he was in love with skyscrapers then she noticed she had used the past tense and wondered why she did not remember what she said when they spoke about the new house wynand brought the drawings from his study spread the plans on a table and the three of them stood bent over the plans together roarks pencil moved pointing across the hard geometrical patterns of thin black lines on white sheets she heard his voice close to her explaining they did not speak of beauty and affirmation but of closets stairways pantries bathrooms roark asked her whether she found the arrangements convenient she thought it was strange that they all spoke as if they really believed she would ever live in this house when roark had gone she heard wynand asking her what do you think of him she felt something angry and dangerous like a single sudden twist within her and she said half in fear half in deliberate invitation doesnt he remind you of dwight carson oh forget dwight carson wynands voice refusing earnestness refusing guilt had sounded exactly like the voice that had said forget the stoddard temple the secretary in the reception room looked startled at the patrician gentleman whose face she had seen so often in the papers gail wynand he said inclining his head in selfintroduction i should like to see mr roark if he is not busy please do not disturb him if he is i had no appointment she had never expected wynand to come to an office unannounced and to ask admittance in that tone of grave deference she announced the visitor roark came out into the reception room smiling as if he found nothing unusual in this call hello gail come in hello howard he followed roark to the office beyond the broad windows the darkness of late afternoon dissolved the city it was snowing black specks whirled furiously across the lights i dont want to interrupt if youre busy howard this is not important he had not seen roark for five days since the dinner im not busy take your coat off shall i have the drawings brought in no i dont want to talk about the house actually i came without any reason at all i was down at my office all day got slightly sick of it and felt like coming here what are you grinning about nothing only you said that it wasnt important wynand looked at him smiled and nodded he sat down on the edge of roarks desk with an ease which he had never felt in his own office his hands in his pockets one leg swinging its almost useless to talk to you howard i always feel as if i were reading to you a carbon copy of myself and youve already seen the original you seem to hear everything i say a minute in advance were unsynchronized you call that unsynchronized all right too well synchronized his eyes were moving slowly over the room if we own the things to which we say yes then i own this office then you own it you know what i feel here no i wont say i feel at home i dont think ive ever felt at home anywhere and i wont say i feel as i did in the palaces ive visited or in the great european cathedrals i feel as i did when i was still in hells kitchen in the best days i had there there werent many but sometimes when i sat like this only it was some piece of broken wall by the wharf and there were a lot of stars above and dump heaps around me and the river smelt of rotting shells howard when you look back does it seem to you as if all your days had rolled forward evenly like a sort of typing exercise all alike or were there stopspoints reached and then the typing rolled on again there were stops did you know them at the time did you know that thats what they were yes i didnt i knew afterward but i never knew the reasons there was one moment i was twelve and i stood behind a wall waiting to be killed only i knew i wouldnt be killed not what i did afterward not the fight i had but just that one moment when i waited i dont know why that was a stop to be remembered or why i feel proud of it i dont know why i have to think of it here dont look for the reason do you know it i said dont look for it i have been thinking about my past ever since i met you and i had gone for years without thinking of it no no secret conclusions for you to draw from that it doesnt hurt me to look back this way and it doesnt give me pleasure its just looking not a quest not even a journey just a kind of walk at random like wandering through the countryside in the evening when ones a little tired if theres any connection to you at all its only one thought that keeps coming back to me i keep thinking that you and i started in the same way from the same point from nothing i just think that without any comment i dont seem to find any particular meaning in it at all just we started in the same way want to tell me what it means no wynand glanced about the room and noticed a newspaper on top of a filing cabinet who the hell reads the banner around here i do since when since about a month ago sadism no just curiosity wynand rose picked up the paper and glanced through the pages he stopped at one and chuckled he held it up the page that bore photographed drawings of the buildings for the march of the centuries exposition awful isnt it said wynand its disgusting that we have to plug that stuff but i feel better about it when i think of what you did to those eminent civic leaders he chuckled happily you told them you dont cooperate or collaborate but it wasnt a gesture gail it was plain common sense one cant collaborate on ones own job i can cooperate if thats what they call it with the workers who erect my buildings but i cant help them to lay bricks and they cant help me to design the house it was the kind of gesture id like to make im forced to give those civic leaders free space in my papers but its all right youve slapped their faces for me he tossed the paper aside without anger its like that luncheon i had to attend today a national convention of advertisers i must give them publicity all wiggling wriggling and drooling i got so sick of it i thought id run amuck and bash somebodys skull and then i thought of you i thought that you werent touched by any of it not in any way the national convention of advertisers doesnt exist as far as youre concerned its in some sort of fourth dimension that can never establish any communication with you at all i thought of that and i felt a peculiar kind of relief he leaned against the filing cabinet letting his feet slide forward his arms crossed and he spoke softly howard i had a kitten once the damn thing attached itself to me a fleabitten little beast from the gutter just fur mud and bones followed me home i fed it and kicked it out but the next day there it was again and finally i kept it i was seventeen then working for the gazette just learning to work in the special way i had to learn for life i could take it all right but not all of it there were times when it was pretty bad evenings usually once i wanted to kill myself not anger anger made me work harder not fear but disgust howard the kind of disgust that made it seem as if the whole world were under water and the water stood still water that had backed up out of the sewers and ate into everything even the sky even my brain and then i looked at that kitten and i thought that it didnt know the things i loathed it could never know it was clean clean in the absolute sense because it had no capacity to conceive of the worlds ugliness i cant tell you what relief there was in trying to imagine the state of consciousness inside that little brain trying to share it a living consciousness but clean and free i would lie down on the floor and put my face on that cats belly and hear the beast purring and then i would feel better there howard ive called your office a rotting wharf and yourself an alley cat thats my way of paying homage roark smiled wynand saw that the smile was grateful keep still wynand said sharply dont say anything he walked to a window and stood looking out i dont know why in hell i should speak like that these are the first happy years of my life i met you because i wanted to build a monument to my happiness i come here to find rest and i find it and yet these are the things i talk about well never mind look at the filthy weather are you through with your work here can you call it a day yes just about lets go and have dinner together somewhere close by all right may i use your phone ill tell dominique not to expect me for dinner he dialed the number roark moved to the door of the drafting room he had orders to give before leaving but he stopped at the door he had to stop and hear it hello dominique yes tired no you just sounded like it i wont be home for dinner will you excuse me dearest i dont know it might be late im eating downtown no im having dinner with howard roark hello dominique yes what im calling from his office so long dear he replaced the receiver in the library of the penthouse dominique stood with her hand on the telephone as if some connection still remained for five days and nights she had fought a single desire to go to him to see him alone anywhere his home or his office or the street for one word or only one glance but alone she could not go her share of action was ended he would come to her when he wished she knew he would come and that he wanted her to wait she had waited but she had held on to one thought of an address an office in the cord building she stood her hand closed over the stem of the telephone receiver she had no right to go to that office but gail wynand had when ellsworth toohey entered wynands office as summoned he made a few steps then stopped the walls of wynands office the only luxurious room in the banner building were made of cork and copper paneling and had never borne any pictures now on the wall facing wynands desk he saw an enlarged photograph under glass the picture of roark at the opening of the enright house roark standing at the parapet of the river his head thrown back toohey turned to wynand they looked at each other wynand indicated a chair and toohey sat down wynand spoke smiling i never thought i would come to agree with some of your social theories mr toohey but i find myself forced to do so you have always denounced the hypocrisy of the upper caste and preached the virtue of the masses and now i find that i regret the advantages i enjoyed in my former proletarian state were i still in hells kitchen i would have begun this interview by saying listen louse but since i am an inhibited capitalist i shall not do so toohey waited he looked curious i shall begin by saying listen mr toohey i do not know what makes you tick i do not care to dissect your motives i do not have the stomach required of medical students so i shall ask no questions and i wish to hear no explanations i shall merely tell you that from now on there is a name you will never mention in your column again he pointed to the photograph i could make you reverse yourself publicly and i would enjoy it but i prefer to forbid the subject to you entirely not a word mr toohey not ever again now dont mention your contract or any particular clause of it it would not be advisable go on writing your column but remember its title and devote it to commensurate subjects keep it small mr toohey very small yes mr wynand said toohey easily i dont have to write about mr roark at present thats all toohey rose yes mr wynand gail wynand sat at his desk in his office and read the proofs of an editorial on the moral value of raising large families sentences like used chewing gum chewed and rechewed spat out and picked up again passing from mouth to mouth to pavement to shoe sole to mouth to brain he thought of howard roark and went on reading the banner it made things easier daintiness is a girls greatest asset be sure to launder your undies every night and learn to talk on some cultured subject and you will have all the dates you want your horoscope for tomorrow shows a beneficent aspect application and sincerity will bring rewards in the fields of engineering public accounting and romance mrs huntingtoncoles hobbies are gardening the opera and early american sugarbowls she divides her time between her little son kit and her numerous charitable activities im jus millie im jus a orphan for the complete diet send ten cents and a selfaddressed stamped envelope he turned the pages thinking of howard roark he signed the advertising contract with kreamo pudding for five years on the entire wynand chain two full pages in every paper every sunday the men before his desk sat like triumphal arches in flesh monuments to victory to evenings of patience and calculation restaurant tables glasses emptied into throats months of thought his energy his living energy flowing like the liquid in the glasses into the opening of heavy lips into stubby fingers across a desk into two full pages every sunday into drawings of yellow molds trimmed with strawberries and yellow molds trimmed with butterscotch sauce he looked over the heads of the men at the photograph on the wall of his office the sky the river and a mans face lifted but it hurts me he thought it hurts me every time i think of him it makes everything easier the people the editorials the contracts but easier because it hurts so much pain is a stimulant also i think i hate that name i will go on repeating it it is a pain i wish to bear then he sat facing roark in the study of his penthouse and he felt no pain only a desire to laugh without malice howard everything youve done in your life is wrong according to the stated ideals of mankind and here you are and somehow it seems a huge joke on the whole world roark sat in an armchair by the fireplace the glow of the fire moved over the study the light seemed to curve with conscious pleasure about every object in the room proud to stress its beauty stamping approval upon the taste of the man who had achieved this setting for himself they were alone dominique had excused herself after dinner she had known that they wanted to be alone a joke on all of us said wynand on every man in the street i always look at the men in the street i used to ride in the subways just to see how many of them carried the banner i used to hate them and sometimes to be afraid but now i look at every one of them and i want to say why you poor fool thats all he telephoned roarks office one morning can you have lunch with me howard meet me at the nordland in half an hour he shrugged smiling when he faced roark across the restaurant table nothing at all howard no special reason just spent a revolting halfhour and wanted to take the taste of it out of my mouth what revolting halfhour had my pictures taken with lancelot clokey whos lancelot clokey wynand laughed aloud forgetting his controlled elegance forgetting the startled glance of the waiter thats it howard thats why i had to have lunch with you because you can say things like that now whats the matter dont you read books dont you know that lancelot clokey is our most sensitive observer of the international scene thats what the critic said in my own banner lancelot clokey has just been chosen author of the year or something by some organization or other were running his biography in the sunday supplement and i had to pose with my arm around his shoulders he wears silk shirts and smells of gin his second book is about his childhood and how it helped him to understand the international scene it sold a hundred thousand copies but youve never heard of him go on eat your lunch howard i like to see you eating i wish you were broke so that i could feed you this lunch and know you really needed it at the end of a day he would come unannounced to roarks office or to his home roark had an apartment in the enright house one of the crystalshaped units over the east river a workroom a library a bedroom he had designed the furniture himself wynand could not understand for a long time why the place gave him an impression of luxury until he saw that one did not notice the furniture at all only a clean sweep of space and the luxury of an austerity that had not been simple to achieve in financial value it was the most modest home that wynand had entered as a guest in twentyfive years we started in the same way howard he said glancing about roarks room according to my judgment and experience you should have remained in the gutter but you havent i like this room i like to sit here i like to see you here howard have you ever held power over a single human being no and i wouldnt take it if it were offered to me i cant believe that it was offered to me once gail i refused it wynand looked at him with curiosity it was the first time that he heard effort in roarks voice why i had to out of respect for the man it was a woman oh you damn fool out of respect for a woman out of respect for myself dont expect me to understand were as opposite as two men can be i thought that once i wanted to think that and now you dont no dont you despise every act ive ever committed just about every one i know of and you still like to see me here yes gail there was a man who considered you the symbol of the special evil that destroyed him and would destroy me he left me his hatred and there was another reason i think i hated you before i saw you i knew you did what made you change your mind i cant explain that to you they drove together to the estate in connecticut where the walls of the house were rising out of the frozen ground wynand followed roark through the future rooms he stood aside and watched roark giving instructions sometimes wynand came alone the workers saw the black roadster twisting up the road to the top of the hill saw wynands figure standing at a distance looking at the structure his figure always carried with it all the implications of his position the quiet elegance of his overcoat the angle of his hat the confidence of his posture tense and casual together made one think of the wynand empire of the presses thundering from ocean to ocean of the papers the lustrous magazine covers the light rays trembling through newsreels the wires coiling over the world the power flowing into every palace every capital every secret crucial room day and night through every costly minute of this mans life he stood still against a sky gray as laundry water and snowflakes fluttered lazily past the brim of his hat on a day in april he drove alone to connecticut after an absence of many weeks the roadster flew across the countryside not an object but a long streak of speed he felt no jolting motion inside his small cube of glass and leather it seemed to him that his car stood still suspended over the ground while the control of his hands on the wheel made the earth fly past him and he merely had to wait until the place he desired came rolling to him he loved the wheel of a car as he loved his desk in the office of the banner both gave him the same sense of a dangerous monster let loose under the expert direction of his fingers something tore past across his vision and he was a mile away before he thought how strange it was that he should have noticed it because it had been only a clump of weeds by the road a mile later he realized that it was stranger still the weeds were green not in the middle of winter he thought and then he understood surprised that it was not winter any longer he had been very busy in the last few weeks he had not had time to notice now he saw it hanging over the fields around him a hint of green like a whisper he heard three statements in his mind in precise succession like interlocking gears its spring i wonder if i have many left to see i am fiftyfive years old they were statements not emotions he felt nothing neither eagerness nor fear but he knew it was strange that he should experience a sense of time he had never thought of his age in relation to any measure he had never defined his position on a limited course he had not thought of a course nor of limits he had been gail wynand and he had stood still like this car and the years had sped past him like this earth and the motor within him had controlled the flight of the years no he thought i regret nothing there have been things i missed but i ask no questions because i have loved it such as it has been even the moments of emptiness even the unanswered and that i loved it that is the unanswered in my life but i loved it if it were true that old legend about appearing before a supreme judge and naming ones record i would offer with all my pride not any act i committed but one thing i have never done on this earth that i never sought an outside sanction i would stand and say i am gail wynand the man who has committed every crime except the foremost one that of ascribing futility to the wonderful fact of existence and seeking justification beyond myself this is my pride that now thinking of the end i do not cry like all the men of my age but what was the use and the meaning i was the use and meaning i gail wynand that i lived and that i acted he drove to the foot of the hill and slammed the brakes on startled looking up in his absence the house had taken shape it could be recognized now it looked like the drawing he felt a moment of childish wonder that it had really come out just as on the sketch as if he had never quite believed it rising against the pale blue sky it still looked like a drawing unfinished the planes of masonry like spreads of watercolor filled in the naked scaffolding like pencil lines a huge drawing on a pale blue sheet of paper he left the car and walked to the top of the hill he saw roark among the men he stood outside and watched the way roark walked through the structure the way he turned his head or raised his hand pointing he noticed roarks manner of stopping his legs apart his arms straight at his sides his head lifted an instinctive pose of confidence of energy held under effortless control a moment that gave to his body the structural cleanliness of his own building structure thought wynand is a solved problem of tension of balance of security in counterthrusts he thought theres no emotional significance in the act of erecting a building its just a mechanical job like laying sewers or making an automobile and he wondered why he watched roark feeling what he felt in his art gallery he belongs in an unfinished building thought wynand more than in a completed one more than at a drafting table its his right setting its becoming to him as dominique said a yacht was becoming to me afterward roark came out and they walked together along the crest of the hill among the trees they sat down on a fallen tree trunk they saw the structure in the distance through the stems of the brushwood the stems were dry and naked but there was a quality of spring in the cheerful insolence of their upward thrust the stirring of a selfassertive purpose wynand asked howard have you ever been in love roark turned to look straight at him and answer quietly i still am but when you walk through a building what you feel is greater than that much greater gail i was thinking of people who say that happiness is impossible on earth look how hard they all try to find some joy in life look how they struggle for it why should any living creature exist in pain by what conceivable right can anyone demand that a human being exist for anything but his own joy every one of them wants it every part of him wants it but they never find it i wonder why they whine and say they dont understand the meaning of life theres a particular kind of people that i despise those who seek some sort of a higher purpose or universal goal who dont know what to live for who moan that they must find themselves you hear it all around us that seems to be the official bromide of our century every book you open every drooling selfconfession it seems to be the noble thing to confess id think it would be the most shameful one look gail roark got up reached out tore a thick branch off a tree held it in both hands one fist closed at each end then his wrists and knuckles tensed against the resistance he bent the branch slowly into an arc now i can make what i want of it a bow a spear a cane a railing thats the meaning of life your strength your work he tossed the branch aside the material the earth offers you and what you make of it what are you thinking of gail the photograph on the wall of my office to remain controlled as he wished to be patient to make of patience an active duty executed consciously each day to stand before roark and let her serenity tell him this is the hardest you could have demanded of me but im glad if its what you want such was the discipline of dominiques existence she stood by as a quiet spectator of roark and wynand she watched them silently she had wanted to understand wynand this was the answer she accepted roarks visits to their house and the knowledge that in the hours of these evenings he was wynands property not hers she met him as a gracious hostess indifferent and smiling not a person but an exquisite fixture of wynands home she presided at the dinner table she left them in the study afterward she sat alone in the drawing room with the lights turned off and the door open she sat erect and quiet her eyes on the slit of light under the door of the study across the hall she thought this is my task even when alone even in the darkness within no knowledge but my own to look at that door as i looked at him here without complaint roark if its the punishment you chose for me ill carry it completely not as a part to play in your presence but as a duty to perform alone you know that violence is not hard for me to bear only patience is you chose the hardest and i must perform it and offer it to you my dearest one when roark looked at her there was no denial of memory in his eyes the glance said simply that nothing had changed and nothing was needed to state it she felt as if she heard him saying why are you shocked have we ever been parted your drawing room your husband and the city you dread beyond the windows are they real now dominique do you understand are you beginning to understand yes she would say suddenly aloud trusting that the word would fit the conversation of the moment knowing that roark would hear it as his answer it was not a punishment he had chosen for her it was a discipline imposed on both of them the last test she understood his purpose when she found that she could feel her love for him proved by the room by wynand even by his love for wynand and hers by the impossible situation by her enforced silence the barriers proving to her that no barriers could exist she did not see him alone she waited she would not visit the site of construction she had said to wynand ill see the house when its finished she never questioned him about roark she let her hands lie in sight on the arms of her chair so that the relief of any violent motion would be denied her her hands as her private barometer of endurance when wynand came home late at night and told her that he had spent the evening at roarks apartment the apartment she had never seen once she broke enough to ask what is this gail an obsession i suppose so he added its strange that you dont like him i havent said that i can see it im not really surprised its your way you would dislike him precisely because hes the type of man you should like dont resent my obsession i dont resent it dominique would you understand it if i told you that i love you more since ive met him even i want to say this even when you lie in my arms its more than it was i feel a greater right to you he spoke with the simple confidence they had given each other in the last three years she sat looking at him as she always did her glance had tenderness without scorn and sadness without pity i understand gail after a moment she asked what is he to you gail in the nature of a shrine in the nature of a hair shirt said wynand when she had gone upstairs he walked to a window and stood looking up at the sky his head thrown back he felt the pull of his throat muscles and he wondered whether the peculiar solemnity of looking at the sky comes not from what one contemplates but from that uplift of ones head the basic trouble with the modern world said ellsworth toohey is the intellectual fallacy that freedom and compulsion are opposites to solve the gigantic problems crushing the world today we must clarify our mental confusion we must acquire a philosophical perspective in essence freedom and compulsion are one let me give you a simple illustration traffic lights restrain your freedom to cross a street whenever you wish but this restraint gives you the freedom from being run over by a truck if you were assigned to a job and prohibited from leaving it it would restrain the freedom of your career but it would give you freedom from the fear of unemployment whenever a new compulsion is imposed upon us we automatically gain a new freedom the two are inseparable only by accepting total compulsion can we achieve total freedom thats right shrieked mitchell layton it was an actual shriek thin and high it had come with the startling suddenness of a fire siren his guests looked at mitchell layton he sat in a tapestry armchair of his drawing room half lying legs and stomach forward like an obnoxious child flaunting his bad posture everything about the person of mitchell layton was almost and not quite just short of succeeding his body had started out to be tall but changed its mind leaving him with a long torso above short stocky legs his face had delicate bones but the flesh had played a joke on them puffing out not enough to achieve obesity just enough to suggest permanent mumps mitchell layton pouted it was not a temporary expression nor a matter of facial arrangement it was a chronic attribute pervading his entire person he pouted with his whole body mitchell layton had inherited a quarter of a billion dollars and had spent the thirtythree years of his life trying to make amends for it ellsworth toohey in dinner clothes stood lounging against a cabinet his nonchalance had an air of gracious informality and a touch of impertinence as if the people around him did not deserve the preservation of rigid good manners his eyes moved about the room the room was not exactly modern not quite colonial and just a little short of french empire the furnishings presented straight planes and swanneck supports black mirrors and electric hurricane lamps chromium and tapestry there was unity in a single attribute in the expensiveness of everything thats right said mitchell layton belligerently as if he expected everyone to disagree and was insulting them in advance people make too damn much fuss about freedom what i mean is its a vague overabused word im not even sure its such a goddamn blessing i think people would be much happier in a regulated society that had a definite pattern and a unified form like a folk dance you know how beautiful a folk dance is and rhythmic too thats because it took generations to work it out and they dont let just any chance fool come along to change it thats what we need pattern i mean and rhythm also beauty thats an apt comparison mitch said ellsworth toohey ive always told you that you had a creative mind what i mean is what makes people unhappy is not too little choice but too much said mitchell layton having to decide always to decide torn every which way all of the time now in a society of pattern a man could feel safe nobody would come to him all the time pestering him to do something nobody would have to do anything what i mean is of course except working for the common good its spiritual values that count said homer slottern got to be up to date and keep up with the world this is a spiritual century homer slottern had a big face with drowsy eyes his shirt studs were made of rubies and emeralds combined like gobs of salad dripping down his starched white shirt front he owned three department stores there ought to be a law to make everybody study the mystical secrets of the ages said mitchell layton its all been written out in the pyramids in egypt thats true mitch homer slottern agreed theres a lot to be said for mysticism on the one hand on the other hand dialectic materialism its not a contradiction mitchell layton drawled contemptuously the world of the future will combine both as a matter of fact said ellsworth toohey the two are superficially varied manifestations of the same thing of the same intention his eyeglasses gave a spark as if lighted from within he seemed to relish his particular statement in his own way all i know is unselfishness is the only moral principle said jessica pratt the noblest principle and a sacred duty and much more important than freedom unselfishness is the only way to happiness i would have everybody who refused to be unselfish shot to put them out of their misery they cant be happy anyway jessica pratt spoke wistfully she had a gentle aging face her powdery skin innocent of makeup gave the impression that a finger touching it would be left with a spot of white dust jessica pratt had an old family name no money and a great passion her love for her younger sister renée they had been left orphaned at an early age and she had dedicated her life to renees upbringing she had sacrificed everything she had never married she had struggled plotted schemed defrauded through the years and achieved the triumph of renees marriage to homer slottern renee slottern sat curled up on a footstool munching peanuts once in a while she reached up to the crystal dish on a side table and took another she exhibited no further exertion her pale eyes stared placidly out of her pale face thats going too far jess said homer slottern you cant expect everybody to be a saint i dont expect anything said jessica pratt meekly ive given up expecting long ago but its education that we all need now i think mr toohey understands if everybody were compelled to have the proper kind of education wed have a better world if we force people to do good they will be free to be happy this is a perfectly useless discussion said eve layton no intelligent person believes in freedom nowadays its dated the future belongs to social planning compulsion is a law of nature thats that its selfevident eve layton was beautiful she stood under the light of a chandelier her smooth black hair clinging to her skull the pale green satin of her gown alive like water about to stream off and expose the rest of her soft tanned skin she had the special faculty of making satin and perfume appear as modern as an aluminum table top she was venus rising out of a submarine hatch eve layton believed that her mission in life was to be the vanguard it did not matter of what her method had always been to take a careless leap and land triumphantly far ahead of all others her philosophy consisted of one sentence i can get away with anything in conversation she paraphrased it to her favorite line i im the day after tomorrow she was an expert horsewoman a racing driver a stunt pilot a swimming champion when she saw that the emphasis of the day had switched to the realm of ideas she took another leap as she did over any ditch she landed well in front in the latest having landed she was amazed to find that there were people who questioned her feat nobody had ever questioned her other achievements she acquired an impatient anger against all those who disagreed with her political views it was a personal issue she had to be right since she was the day after tomorrow her husband mitchell layton hated her its a perfectly valid discussion he snapped everybody cant be as competent as you my dear we must help the others its the moral duty of intellectual leaders what i mean is we ought to lose that bugaboo of being scared of the word compulsion its not compulsion when its for a good cause what i mean is in the name of love but i dont know how we can make this country understand it americans are so stuffy he could not forgive his country because it had given him a quarter of a billion dollars and then refused to grant him an equal amount of reverence people would not take his views on art literature history biology sociology and metaphysics as they took his checks he complained that people identified him with his money too much he hated them because they did not identify him enough theres a great deal to be said for compulsion stated homer slottern provided its democratically planned the common good must always come first whether we like it or not translated into language homer slotterns attitude consisted of two parts they were contradictory parts but this did not trouble him since they remained untranslated in his mind first he felt that abstract theories were nonsense and if the customers wanted this particular kind it was perfectly safe to give it to them and good business besides second he felt uneasy that he had neglected whatever it was people called spiritual life in the rush of making money maybe men like toohey had something there and what if his stores were taken away from him wouldnt it really be easier to live as manager of a stateowned department store wouldnt a managers salary give him all the prestige and comfort he now enjoyed without the responsibility of ownership is it true that in the future society any woman will sleep with any man she wants asked renee slottern it had started as a question but it petered out she did not really want to know she merely felt a vapid wonder about how it felt to have a man one really wanted and how one went about wanting its stupid to talk about personal choice said eve layton its oldfashioned theres no such thing as a person theres only a collective entity its selfevident ellsworth toohey smiled and said nothing somethings got to be done about the masses mitchell layton declared theyve got to be led they dont know whats good for them what i mean is i cant understand why people of culture and position like us understand the great ideal of collectivism so well and are willing to sacrifice our personal advantages while the working man who has everything to gain from it remains so stupidly indifferent i cant understand why the workers in this country have so little sympathy with collectivism cant you said ellsworth toohey his glasses sparkled im bored with this snapped eve layton pacing the room light streaming off her shoulders the conversation switched to art and its acknowledged leaders of the day in every field lois cook said that words must be freed from the oppression of reason she said the stranglehold of reason upon words is like the exploitation of the masses by the capitalists words must be permitted to negotiate with reason through collective bargaining thats what she said shes so amusing and refreshing dee whats his name again says that the theater is an instrument of love its all wrong he says about a play taking place on the stage it takes place in the hearts of the audience jules fougler said in last sundays banner that in the world of the future the theater will not be necessary at all he says that the daily life of the common man is as much a work of art in itself as the best shakespearean tragedy in the future there will be no need for a dramatist the critic will simply observe the life of the masses and evaluate its artistic points for the public thats what jules fougler said now i dont know whether i agree with him but hes got an interesting fresh angle there lancelot clokey says the british empire is doomed he says there will be no war because the workers of the world wont allow it its international bankers and munitions markers who start wars and theyve been kicked out of the saddle lancelot clokey says that the universe is a mystery and that his mother is his best friend he says the premier of bulgaria eats herring for breakfast gordon prescott says that four walls and a ceiling is all there is to architecture the floor is optional all the rest is capitalistic ostentation he says nobody should be allowed to build anything anywhere until every inhabitant of the globe has a roof over his head well what about the patagonians its our job to teach them to want a roof prescott calls it dialectic transspatial interdependence ellsworth toohey said nothing he stood smiling at the vision of a huge typewriter each famous name he heard was a key of its keyboard each controlling a special field each hitting leaving its mark and the whole making connected sentences on a vast blank sheet a typewriter he thought presupposes the hand that punches its keys he snapped to attention when he heard mitchell laytons sulking voice say oh yes the banner god damn it i know said homer slottern its slipping said mitchell layton its definitely slipping a swell investment it turned out to be for me its the only time ellsworths been wrong ellsworth is never wrong said eve layton well he was that time it was he who advised me to buy a piece of that lousy sheet he saw tooheys eyes patient as velvet and he added hastily what i mean is im not complaining ellsworth its all right it may even help me to slice something off my damned income tax but that filthy reactionary rag is sure going downhill have a little patience mitch said toohey you dont think i should sell and get out from under no mitch i dont okay if you say so i can afford it i can afford anything but i jolly well cant homer slottern cried with surprising vehemence its coming to where one cant afford to advertise in the banner its not their circulation thats okay but theres a feeling around a funny kind of feeling ellsworth ive been thinking of dropping my contract why do you know about the we dont read wynand movement ive heard about it its run by somebody named gus webb they paste stickers on parked windshields and in public privies they hiss wynand newsreels in theaters i dont think its a large group but last week an unappetizing female threw a fit in my store the one on fifty avenue calling us enemies of labor because we advertised in the banner you can ignore that but it becomes serious when one of our oldest customers a mild little old lady from connecticut and a republican for three generations calls us to say that perhaps maybe she should cancel her charge account because somebody told her that wynand is a dictator gail wynand knows nothing about politics except of the most primitive kind said toohey he still thinks in terms of the democratic club of hells kitchen there was a certain innocence about the political corruption of those days dont you think so i dont care thats not what im talking about i mean the banner is becoming a kind of liability it hurts business ones got to be so careful nowadays you get tied up with the wrong people and first thing you know theres a smear campaign going on and you get splashed too i cant afford that sort of thing its not entirely an unjustified smear i dont care i dont give a damn whether its true or not who am i to stick my neck out for gail wynand if theres a public sentiment against him my job is to get as far away as i can pronto and im not the only one theres a bunch of us whore thinking the same jim ferris of ferris symes billy shultz of vimo flakes bud harper of toddler togs and hell you know them all theyre all your friends our bunch the liberal businessmen we all want to yank our ads out of the banner have a little patience homer i wouldnt hurry theres a proper time for everything theres such a thing as a psychological moment okay ill take your word for it but theres theres a kind of feeling in the air it will become dangerous some day it might ill tell you when it will i thought ellsworth worked on the banner said renee slottern vacantly puzzled the others turned to her with indignation and pity youre naive renee shrugged eve layton but whats the matter with the banner now child dont you bother with dirty politics said jessica pratt the banner is a wicked paper mr wynand is a very evil man he represents the selfish interests of the rich i think hes goodlooking said renee i think he has sex appeal oh for christs sake cried eve layton now after all renee is entitled to express her opinion jessica pratt said with immediate rage somebody told me ellsworth is the president of the union of wynand employees drawled renee oh dear me no renee im never president of anything im just a rankandfile member like any copy boy do they have a union of wynand employees asked homer slottern it was just a club at first said toohey it became a union last year who organized it how can one tell it was more or less spontaneous like all mass movements i think wynand is a bastard declared mitchell layton who does he think he is anyway i come to a meeting of stockholders and he treats us like flunkies isnt my money as good as his dont i own a hunk of his damn paper i could teach him a thing or two about journalism i have ideas whats he so damn arrogant about just because he made that fortune himself does he have to be such a damn snob just because he came from hells kitchen it isnt other peoples fault if they werent lucky enough to be born in hells kitchen to rise out of nobody understands what a terrible handicap it is to be born rich because people just take for granted that because you were born that way youd just be no good if you werent what i mean is if id had gail wynands breaks id be twice as rich as he is by now and three times as famous but hes so conceited he doesnt realize this at all nobody said a word they heard the rising inflection of hysteria in mitchell laytons voice eve layton looked at toohey silently appealing for help toohey smiled and made a step forward im ashamed of you mitch he said homer slottern gasped one did not rebuke mitchell layton on this subject one did not rebuke mitchell layton on any subject mitchell laytons lower lip vanished im ashamed of you mitch toohey repeated sternly for comparing yourself to a man as contemptible as gail wynand mitchell laytons mouth relaxed in the equivalent of something almost as gentle as a smile thats true he said humbly no you would never be able to match gail wynands career not with your sensitive spirit and humanitarian instincts thats whats holding you down mitch not your money who cares about money the age of money is past its your nature thats too fine for the brute competition of our capitalistic system but that too is passing its selfevident said eve layton it was late when toohey left he felt exhilarated and he decided to walk home the streets of the city lay gravely empty around him and the dark masses of the buildings rose to the sky confident and unprotected he remembered what he had said to dominique once a complicated piece of machinery such as our society and by pressing your little finger against one spot the center of all its gravity you can make the thing crumble into a worthless heap of scrap iron he missed dominique he wished she could have been with him to hear this evenings conversation the unshared was boiling up within him he stopped in the middle of a silent street threw his head back and laughed aloud looking at the tops of skyscrapers a policeman tapped him on the shoulder asking well mister toohey saw buttons and blue cloth tight over a broad chest a stolid face hard and patient a man as set and dependable as the buildings around them doing your duty officer toohey asked the echoes of laughter like jerks in his voice protecting law and order and decency and human lives the policeman scratched the back of his head you ought to arrest me officer okay pal okay said the policeman run along we all take one too many once in a while it was only when the last painter had departed that peter keating felt a sense of desolation and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows he stood in the hall looking up at the ceiling under the harsh gloss of paint he could still see the outline of the square where the stairway had been removed and the opening closed over guy francons old office was gone the firm keating dumont had a single floor left now he thought of the stairway and how he had walked up its redplushed steps for the first time carrying a drawing on the tips of his fingers he thought of guy francons office with the glittering butterfly reflections he thought of the four years when that office had been his own he had known what was happening to his firm in these last years he had known it quite well while men in overalls removed the stairway and closed the gap in the ceiling but it was that square under the white paint that made it real to him and final he had resigned himself to the process of going down long ago he had not chosen to resign himself that would have been a positive decision it had merely happened and he had let it happen it had been simple and almost painless like drowsiness carrying one down to nothing more sinister than a welcome sleep the dull pain came from wishing to understand why it had happened there was the march of the centuries exposition but that alone could not have mattered the march of the centuries had opened in may it was a flop whats the use thought keating why not say the right word flop it was a ghastly flop the title of this venture would be most appropriate ellsworth toohey had written if we assumed that the centuries had passed by on horseback everything else written about the architectural merits of the exposition had been of the same order keating thought with wistful bitterness of how conscientiously they had worked he and the seven other architects designing those buildings it was true that he had pushed himself forward and hogged the publicity but he certainly had not done that as far as designing was concerned they had worked in harmony through conference after conference each giving in to the others in true collective spirit none trying to impose his personal prejudices or selfish ideas even ralston holcombe had forgotten renaissance they had made the buildings modern more modem than anything ever seen more modern than the show windows of slotterns department store he did not think that the buildings looked like coils of toothpaste when somebody steps on the tube or stylized versions of the lower intestine as one critic had said but the public seemed to think it if the public thought at all he couldnt tell he knew only that tickets to the march of the centuries were being palmed off at screeno games in theaters and that the sensation of the exposition the financial savior was somebody named juanita fay who danced with a live peacock as sole garment but what if the fair did flop it had not hurt the other architects of its council gordon l prescott was going stronger than ever it wasnt that thought keating it had begun before the fair he could not say when there could be so many explanations the depression had hit them all others had recovered to some extent keating dumont had not something had gone out of the firm and out of the circles from which it drew its clients with the retirement of guy francon keating realized that there had been art and skill and its own kind of illogical energy in the career of guy francon even if the art consisted only of his social charm and the energy was directed at snaring bewildered millionaires there had been a twisted sort of sense in peoples response to guy francon he could see no hint of rationality in the things to which people responded now the leader of the profession on a mean scale there was no grand scale left in anything was gordon l prescott chairman of the council of american builders gordon l prescott who lectured on the transcendental pragmatism of architecture and social planning who put his feet on tables in drawing rooms attended formal dinners in knickerbockers and criticized the soup aloud society people said they liked an architect who was a liberal the aga still existed in stiff hurt dignity but people referred to it as the old folks home the council of american builders ruled the profession and talked about a closed shop though no one had yet devised a way of achieving that whenever an architects name appeared in ellsworth tooheys column it was always that of augustus webb at thirtynine keating heard himself described as oldfashioned he had given up trying to understand he knew dimly that the explanation of the change swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know in his youth he had felt an amicable contempt for the works of guy francon or ralston holcombe and emulating them had seemed no more than innocent quackery but he knew that gordon l prescott and gus webb represented so impertinent so vicious a fraud that to suspend the evidence of his eyes was beyond his elastic capacity he had believed that people found greatness in holcombe and there had been a reasonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness he knew that no one saw anything whatever in prescott he felt something dark and leering in the manner with which people spoke of prescotts genius as if they were not doing homage to prescott but spitting upon genius for once keating could not follow people it was too clear even to him that public favor had ceased being a recognition of merit that it had become almost a brand of shame he went on driven by inertia he could not afford his large floor of offices and he did not use half the rooms but he kept them and paid the deficit out of his own pocket he had to go on he had lost a large part of his personal fortune in careless stock speculation but he had enough left to insure some comfort for the rest of his life this did not disturb him money had ceased to hold his attention as a major concern it was inactivity he dreaded it was the question mark looming beyond if the routine of his work were to be taken away from him he walked slowly his arms pressed to his body his shoulders hunched as if drawn against a permanent chill he was gaining weight his face was swollen he kept it down and the pleat of a second chin was flattened against the knot of his necktie a hint of his beauty remained and made him look worse as if the lines of his face had been drawn on a blotter and had spread blurring the gray threads on his temples were becoming noticeable he drank often without joy he had asked his mother to come back to live with him she had come back they sat through long evenings together in the living room saying nothing not in resentment but seeking reassurance from each other mrs keating offered no suggestions no reproaches there was instead a new panicshaped tenderness in her manner toward her son she would cook his breakfast even though they had a maid she would prepare his favorite dish french pancakes the kind he had liked so much when he was nine years old and sick with the measles if he noticed her efforts and made some comment of pleasure she nodded blinking turning away asking herself why it should make her so happy and if it did why should her eyes fill with tears she would ask suddenly after a silence it will be all right petey wont it and he would not ask what she meant but answer quietly yes mother it will be all right putting the last of his capacity for pity into an effort to make his voice sound convincing once she asked him youre happy petey arent you he looked at her and saw that she was not laughing at him her eyes were wide and frightened and as he could not answer she cried but youve got to be happy petey youve got to else what have i lived for he wanted to get up gather her in his arms and tell her that it was all right and then he remembered guy francon saying to him on his wedding day i want you to feel proud of me peter i want to feel that it had some meaning then he could not move he felt himself in the presence of something he must not grasp must never allow into his mind he turned away from his mother one evening she said without preamble petey i think you should get married i think it would be much better if you were married he found no answer and while he groped for something gay to utter she added petey why dont you why dont you marry catherine halsey he felt anger filling his eyes he felt pressure on his swollen lids while he was turning slowly to his mother then he saw her squat little figure before him stiff and defenseless with a kind of desperate pride offering to take any blow he wished to deliver absolving him in advance and he knew that it had been the bravest gesture she had ever attempted the anger went because he felt her pain more sharply than the shock of his own and he lifted one hand to let it fall limply to let the gesture cover everything saying only mother dont lets on weekends not often but once or twice a month he vanished out of town no one knew where he went mrs keating worried about it but asked no questions she suspected that there was a woman somewhere and not a nice one or he would not be so glumly silent on the subject mrs keating found herself hoping that he had fallen into the clutches of the worst greediest slut who would have sense enough to make him marry her he went to a shack he had rented in the hills of an obscure village he kept paints brushes and canvas in the shack he spent his days in the hills painting he could not tell why he had remembered that unborn ambition of his youth which his mother had drained and switched into the channel of architecture he could not tell by what process the impulse had become irresistible but he had found the shack and tie liked going there he could not say that he liked to paint it was neither pleasure nor relief it was selftorture but somehow that didnt matter he sat on a canvas stool before a small easel and he looked at an empty sweep of hills at the woods and the sky he had a quiet pain as sole conception of what he wanted to express a humble unbearable tenderness for the sight of the earth around him and something tight paralyzed as sole means to express it he went on he tried he looked at his canvases and knew that nothing was captured in their childish crudeness it did not matter no one was to see them he stacked them carefully in a corner of the shack and he locked the door before he returned to town there was no pleasure in it no pride no solution only while he sat alone before the easel a sense of peace he tried not to think of ellsworth toohey a dim instinct told him that he could preserve a precarious security of spirit so long as he did not touch upon that subject there could be but one explanation of tooheys behavior toward him and he preferred not to formulate it toohey had drifted away from him the intervals between their meetings had grown longer each year he accepted it and told himself that toohey was busy tooheys public silence about him was baffling he told himself that toohey had more important things to write about tooheys criticism of the march of the centuries had been a blow he told himself that his work had deserved it he accepted any blame he could afford to doubt himself he could not afford to doubt ellsworth toohey it was neil dumont who forced him to think of toohey again neil spoke petulantly about the state of the world about crying over spilt milk change as a law of existence adaptability and the importance of getting in on the ground floor keating gathered from a long confused speech that business as they had known it was finished that government would take over whether they liked it or not that the building trade was dying and the government would soon be the sole builder and they might as well get in now if they wanted to get in at all look at gordon prescott said neil dumont and what a sweet little monopoly hes got himself in housing projects and post offices look at gus webb muscling in on the racket keating did not answer neil dumont was throwing his own unconfessed thoughts at him he had known that he would have to face this soon and he had tried to postpone the moment he did not want to think of cortlandt homes cortlandt homes was a government housing project to be built in astoria on the shore of the east river it was planned as a gigantic experiment in lowrent housing to serve as model for the whole country for the whole world keating had heard architects talking about it for over a year the appropriation had been approved and the site chosen but not the architect keating would not admit to himself how desperately he wanted to get cortlandt and how little chance he had of getting it listen pete we might as well call a spade a spade said neil dumont were on the skids pal and you know it all right well last another year or two coasting on your reputation and then its not our fault its just that private enterprise is dead and getting deader its a historical process the wave of the future so we might as well get our surfboard while we can theres a good sturdy one waiting for the boy whos smart enough to grab it cortlandt homes now he had heard it pronounced keating wondered why the name had sounded like the muffled stroke of a bell as if the sound had opened and closed a sequence which he would not be able to stop what do you mean neil cortlandt homes ellsworth toohey now you know what i mean neil i whats the matter with you pete listen everybodys laughing about it everybodys saying that if they were tooheys special pet like you are theyd get cortlandt homes like that he snapped his manicured fingers just like that and nobody can understand what youre waiting for you know its friend ellsworth whos running this particular housing show its not true he is not he has no official position he never has any official position whom are you kidding most of the boys that count in every office are his boys damned if i know how he got them in but he did whats the matter pete are you afraid of asking ellsworth toohey for a favor this was it thought keating now there was no retreat he could not admit to himself that he was afraid of asking ellsworth toohey no he said his voice dull im not afraid neil ill all right neil ill speak to ellsworth ellsworth toohey sat spread out on a couch wearing a dressing gown his body had the shape of a sloppy letter xarms stretched over his head along the edge of the back pillows legs open in a wide fork the dressing gown was made of silk bearing the trademarked pattern of cotys face powder white puffs on an orange background it looked daring and gay supremely elegant through sheer silliness under the gown toohey wore sleeping pyjamas of pistachiogreen linen crumpled the trousers floated about the thin sticks of his ankles this was just like toohey thought keating this pose amidst the severe fastidiousness of his living room a single canvas by a famous artist on the wall behind him and the rest of the room unobtrusive like a monks cell no thought keating like the retreat of a king in exile scornful of material display tooheys eyes were warm amused encouraging toohey had answered the telephone in person toohey had granted him the appointment at once keating thought its good to be received like this informally what was i afraid of what did i doubt were old friends oh dear me said toohey yawning one gets so tired there comes a moment into every mans day when he gets the urge to relax like a stumble bum i got home and just felt i couldnt keep my clothes on another minute felt like a damn peasant just plain itchy and had to get out you dont mind do you peter with some people its necessary to be stiff and formal but with you its not necessary at all no of course not think ill take a bath after a while theres nothing like a good hot bath to make one feel like a parasite do you like hot baths peter why yes i guess so youre gaining weight peter pretty soon youll look revolting in a bathtub youre gaining weight and you look peaked thats a bad combination absolutely wrong aesthetically fat people should be happy and jolly i im all right ellsworth its only that you used to have a nice disposition you mustnt lose that people will get bored with you i havent changed ellsworth suddenly he stressed the words i havent really changed at all im just what i was when i designed the cosmoslotnick building he looked at toohey hopefully he thought this was a hint crude enough for toohey to understand toohey understood things much more delicate than that he waited to be helped out toohey went on looking at him his eyes sweet and blank why peter thats an unphilosophical statement change is the basic principle of the universe everything changes seasons leaves flowers birds morals men and buildings the dialectic process peter yes of course things change so fast in such a funny way you dont even notice how and suddenly one morning there it is remember just a few years ago lois cook and gordon prescott and ike and lance they were nobody at all and now why ellsworth theyre on top and theyre all yours anywhere i look any big name i hear its one of your boys youre amazing ellsworth how anybody can do that in just a few years its much simpler than it appears to you peter thats because you think in terms of personalities you think its done piecemeal but dear me the lifetimes of a hundred press agents wouldnt be enough it can be done much faster this is the age of timesaving devices if you want something to grow you dont nurture each seed separately you just spread a certain fertilizer nature will do the rest i believe you think im the only one responsible but im not goodness no im just one figure out of many one lever in a very vast movement very vast and very ancient it just so happened that i chose the field that interests you the field of art because i thought that it focused the decisive factors in the task we had to accomplish yes of course but i mean i think you were so clever i mean that you could pick young people who had talent who had a future damned if i know how you guessed in advance remember the awful loft we had for the council of american builders and nobody took us seriously and people used to laugh at you for wasting time on all kinds of silly organizations my dear peter people go by so many erroneous assumptions for instance that old one divide and conquer well it has its applications but it remained for our century to discover a much more potent formula unite and rule what do you mean nothing that you could possibly grasp and i must not overtax your strength you dont look as if you had much to spare oh im all right i might look a little worried because worry is a waste of emotional reserves very foolish unworthy of an enlightened person since we are merely the creatures of our chemical metabolism and of the economic factors of our background theres not a damn thing we can do about anything whatever so why worry there are of course apparent exceptions merely apparent when circumstances delude us into thinking that free action is indicated such for instance as your coming here to talk about cortlandt homes keating blinked then smiled gratefully he thought it was just like toohey to guess and spare him the embarrassing preliminaries thats right ellsworth thats just what i wanted to talk to you about youre wonderful you know me like a book what kind of a book peter a dime novel a love story a crime thriller or just a plagiarized manuscript no lets say like a serial a good long exciting serial with the last installment missing the last installment got mislaid somewhere there wont be any last installment unless of course its cortlandt homes yes that would be a fitting closing chapter keating waited eyes intent and naked forgetting to think of shame of pleading that should be concealed a tremendous project cortlandt homes bigger than stoneridge do you remember stoneridge peter hes just relaxed with me thought keating hes tired he cant be tactful all the time he doesnt realize what he stoneridge the great residential development by gail wynand have you ever thought of gail wynands career peter from wharf rat to stoneridge do you know what a step like that means would you care to compute the effort the energy the suffering with which gail wynand has paid for every step of his way and here i am and i hold a project much bigger than stoneridge in the palm of my hand without any effort at all he dropped his hand and added if i do hold it might be only a figure of speech dont take me literally peter i hate wynand said keating looking down at the floor his voice thick i hate him more than any man living wynand hes a very naive person hes naive enough to think that men are motivated primarily by money you arent ellsworth youre a man of integrity thats why i believe in you its all ive got if i stopped believing in you there would be nothing anywhere thank you peter thats sweet of you hysterical but sweet ellsworth you know how i feel about you i have a fair idea you see thats why i cant understand what he had to say it he had decided above all never to say it but he had to ellsworth why have you dropped me why dont you ever write anything about me any more why is it always in your column and everywhere and on any commission you have a chance to swing why is it always gus webb but peter why shouldnt it be but i im sorry to see that you havent understood me at all in all these years youve learned nothing of my principles i dont believe in individualism peter i dont believe that any one man is any one thing which everybody else cant be i believe were all equal and interchangeable a position you hold today can be held by anybody and everybody tomorrow egalitarian rotation havent i always preached that to you why do you suppose i chose you why did i put you where you were to protect the field from men who would become irreplaceable to leave a chance for the gus webbs of this world why do you suppose i fought against for instance howard roark keatings mind was a bruise he thought it would be a bruise because it felt as if something flat and heavy had smashed against it and it would be black and blue and swollen later now he felt nothing except a sweetish numbness such chips of thought as he could distinguish told him that the ideas he heard were of a high moral order the ones he had always accepted and therefore no evil could come to him from that no evil could be intended tooheys eyes looked straight at him dark gentle benevolent maybe later he would know later but one thing had pierced through and remained caught on some fragment of his brain he had understood that the name and while his sole hope of grace rested in toohey something inexplicable twisted within him he leaned forward knowing that this would hurt wishing it to hurt toohey and his lips curled incredibly into a smile baring his teeth and gums you failed there didnt you ellsworth look where he is now howard roark oh dear me how dull it is to discuss things with minds devoted to the obvious you are utterly incapable of grasping principles peter you think only in terms of persons do you really suppose that i have no mission in life save to worry over the specific fate of your howard roark mr roark is merely one detail out of many i have dealt with him when it was convenient i am still dealing with him though not directly i do grant you however that mr howard roark is a great temptation to me at times i feel it would be a shame if i never came up against him personally again but it might not be necessary at all when you deal in principles peter it saves you the trouble of individual encounters what do you mean i mean that you can follow one of two procedures you can devote your life to pulling out each single weed as it comes up and then ten lifetimes wont be enough for the job or you can prepare your soil in such a manner by spreading a certain chemical let us say that it will be impossible for weeds to grow this last is faster i say weed because it is the conventional symbolism and will not frighten you the same technique of course holds true in the case of any other living plant you may wish to eliminate buckwheat potatoes oranges orchids or morning glories ellsworth i dont know what youre talking about but of course you dont thats my advantage i say these things publicly every single day and nobody knows what im talking about have you heard that howard roark is doing a house his own home for gail wynand my dear peter did you think i had to wait to learn it from you well how do you like that why should it concern me one way or another have you heard that roark and wynand are the best of friends and what friendship from what i hear well you know what wynand can do you know what he can make of roark try and stop roark now try and stop him try he choked on a gulp and kept still he found himself staring at tooheys bare ankle between the pyjama trouser and the rich fur of a sheepskinlined slipper he had never visualized tooheys nudity somehow he had never thought of toohey as possessing a physical body there was something faintly indecent about that ankle just skin too bluishwhite stretched over bones that looked too brittle it made him think of chicken bones left on a plate after dinner dried out if one touches them it takes no effort at all they just snap he found himself wishing to reach out to take that ankle between thumb and forefinger and just twist the pads of his fingertips ellsworth i came here to talk about cortlandt homes he could not take his eyes off the ankle he hoped the words would release him dont shout like that whats the matter cortlandt homes well what did you want to say about it he had to lift his eyes now in astonishment toohey waited innocently i want to design cortlandt homes he said his voice coming like a paste strained through a cloth i want you to give it to me why should i give it to you there was no answer if he were to say now because youve written that im the greatest architect living the reminder would prove that toohey believed it no longer he dared not face such proof nor tooheys possible reply he was staring at two long black hairs on the bluish knob of tooheys ankle he could see them quite clearly one straight the other twisted into a curlicue after a long time he answered because i need it very badly ellsworth i know you do there was nothing further to say toohey shifted his ankle raised his foot and put it flat upon the arm of the couch spreading his legs comfortably sit up peter you look like a gargoyle keating did not move what made you assume that the selection of an architect for cortlandt homes was up to me keating raised his head it was a stab of relief he had presumed too much and offended toohey that was the reason that was the only reason why i understand its being said i was told that you have a great deal of influence on this particular project with those people and in washington and places strictly in an unofficial capacity as something of an expert in architectural matters nothing else yes of course thats what i meant i can recommend an architect thats all i can guarantee nothing my word is not final thats all i wanted ellsworth a word of recommendation from you but peter if i recommend someone i must give a reason i cant use such influence as i might have just to push a friend can i keating stared at the dressing gown thinking powder puffs why powder puffs thats whats wrong with me if hed only take the thing off your professional standing is not what it used to be peter you said to push a friend ellsworth it was a whisper well of course im your friend ive always been your friend youre not doubting that are you no i cant ellsworth well cheer up then look ill tell you the truth were stuck on that damn cortlandt theres a nasty little sticker involved ive tried to get it for gordon prescott and gus webb i thought it was more in their line i didnt think youd be so interested but neither of them could make the grade do you know the big problem in housing economy peter how to design a decent modern unit that could rent for fifteen dollars a month ever tried to figure out that one well thats whats expected of the architect wholl do cortlandt if they ever find him of course tenant selection helps they stagger the rents the families who make twelve hundred a year pay more for the same apartment to help carry the families who make six hundred a year you know underdog milked to help somebody underdoggier but still the cost of the building and the upkeep must be as low as humanly possible the boys in washington dont want another one of those you heard about it a little government development where the homes cost ten thousand dollars apiece while a private builder could have put them up for two thousand cortlandt is to be a model project an example for the whole world it must be the most brilliant the most efficient exhibit of planning ingenuity and structural economy ever achieved anywhere thats what the big boys demand gordon and gus couldnt do it they tried and were turned down youd be surprised to know how many people have tried peter i couldnt sell you to them even at the height of your career what can i tell them about you all you stand for is plush gilt and marble old guy francon the cosmoslotnick building the frink national bank and that little abortion of the centuries that will never pay for itself what they want is a millionaires kitchen for a sharecroppers income think you can do it i i have ideas ellsworth ive watched the field ive studied new methods i could if you can its yours if you cant all my friendship wont help you and god knows id like to help you you look like an old hen in the rain heres what ill do for you peter come to my office tomorrow ill give you all the dope take it home and see if you wish to break your head over it take a chance if you care to work me out a preliminary scheme i cant promise anything but if you come anywhere near it ill submit it to the right people and ill push it for all im worth thats all i can do for you its not up to me its really up to you keating sat looking at him keatings eyes were anxious eager and hopeless care to try peter will you let me try of course ill let you why shouldnt i id be delighted if you of all people turned out to be the one to turn the trick about the way i look ellsworth he said suddenly about the way i look its not because i mind so much that im a failure its because i cant understand why i slipped like that from the top without any reason at all well peter that could be terrifying to contemplate the inexplicable is always terrifying but it wouldnt be so frightening if you stopped to ask yourself whether theres ever been any reason why you should have been at the top oh come peter smile im only kidding one loses everything when one loses ones sense of humor on the following morning keating came to his office after a visit to ellsworth tooheys cubbyhole in the banner building he brought with him a briefcase containing the data on the cortlandt homes project he spread the papers on a large table in his office and locked the door he asked a draftsman to bring him a sandwich at noon and he ordered another sandwich at dinner time want me to help pete asked neil dumont we could consult and discuss it and keating shook his head he sat at his table all night after a while he stopped looking at the papers he sat still thinking he was not thinking of the charts and figures spread before him he had studied them he had understood what he could not do when he noticed that it was daylight when he heard steps behind his locked door the movement of men returning to work and knew that office hours had begun here and everywhere else in the city he rose walked to his desk and reached for the telephone book he dialed the number this is peter keating speaking i should like to make an appointment to see mr roark dear god he thought while waiting dont let him see me make him refuse dear god make him refuse and i will have the right to hate him to the end of my days dont let him see me will four oclock tomorrow afternoon be convenient for you mr keating said the calm gentle voice of the secretary mr roark will see you then roark knew that he must not show the shock of his first glance at peter keating and that it was too late he saw a faint smile on keatings lips terrible in its resigned acknowledgment of disintegration are you only two years younger than i am howard was the first thing keating asked looking at the face of the man he had not seen for six years i dont know peter i think so im thirtyseven im thirtynine thats all he moved to the chair in front of roarks desk groping for it with his hand he was blinded by the band of glass that made three walls of roarks office he stared at the sky and the city he had no feeling of height here and the buildings seemed to lie under his toes not a real city but miniatures of famous landmarks incongruously close and small he felt he could bend and pick any one of them up in his hand he saw the black dashes which were automobiles and they seemed to crawl it took them so long to cover a block the size of his finger he saw the stone and plaster of the city as a substance that had soaked up light and was throwing it back row upon row of flat vertical planes grilled with dots of windows each plane a reflector rosecolored gold and purple and jagged streaks of smokeblue running among them giving them shape angles and distance light streamed from the buildings into the sky and made of the clear summer blue a humble second thought a spread of pale water over living fire my god thought keating who are the men that made all this and then remembered that he had been one of them he saw roarks figure for an instant straight and gaunt against the angle of two glass panes behind the desk then roark sat down facing him keating thought of men lost in the desert and of men perishing at sea when in the presence of the silent eternity of the sky they have to speak the truth and now he had to speak the truth because he was in the presence of the earths greatest city howard is this the terrible thing they meant by turning the other cheek your letting me come here he did not think of his voice he did not know that it had dignity roark looked at him silently for a moment this was a greater change than the swollen face i dont know peter no if they meant actual forgiveness had i been hurt id never forgive it yes if they meant what im doing i dont think a man can hurt another not in any important way neither hurt him nor help him i have really nothing to forgive you it would be better if you felt you had it would be less cruel i suppose so you havent changed howard i guess not if this is the punishment i must take i want you to know that im taking it and that i understand at one time i would have thought i was getting off easy you have changed peter i know i have im sorry if it has to be punishment i know you are i believe you but its all right its only the last of it i really took it night before last when you decided to come here yes then dont be afraid now what is it keating sat straight calm not as he had sat facing a man in a dressing gown three days ago but almost in confident repose he spoke slowly and without pity howard im a parasite ive been a parasite all my life you designed my best projects at stanton you designed the first house i ever built you designed the cosmoslotnick building i have fed on you and on all the men like you who lived before we were born the men who designed the parthenon the gothic cathedrals the first skyscrapers if they hadnt existed i wouldnt have known how to put stone on stone in the whole of my life i havent added a new doorknob to what men have done before me i have taken that which was not mine and given nothing in return i had nothing to give this is not an act howard and im very conscious of what im saying and i came here to ask you to save me again if you wish to throw me out do it now roark shook his head slowly and moved one hand in silent permission to continue i suppose you know that im finished as an architect oh not actually finished but near enough others could go on like this for quite a few years but i cant because of what ive been or was thought to have been people dont forgive a man whos slipping i must live up to what they thought i can do it only in the same way ive done everything else in my life i need a prestige i dont deserve for an achievement i didnt accomplish to save a name i havent earned the right to bear ive been given a last chance i know its my last chance i know i cant do it i wont try to bring you a mess and ask you to correct it im asking you to design it and let me put my name on it whats the job cortlandt homes the housing project yes youve heard about it i know everything about it youre interested in housing projects howard who offered it to you on what conditions keating explained precisely dispassionately relating his conversation with toohey as if it were the summary of a court transcript he had read long ago he pulled the papers out of his briefcase put them down on the desk and went on speaking while roark looked at them roark interrupted him once wait a moment peter keep still he waited for a long time he saw roarks hand moving the papers idly but he knew that roark was not looking at the papers roark said go on and keating continued obediently allowing himself no questions i suppose theres no reason why you should do it for me he concluded if you can solve their problem you can go to them and do it on your own roark smiled do you think i could get past toohey no no i dont think you could who told you i was interested in housing projects what architect isnt well i am but not in the way you think he got up it was a swift movement impatient and tense keating allowed himself his first opinion he thought it was strange to see suppressed excitement in roark let me think this over peter leave that here come to my house tomorrow night ill tell you then youre not turning me down not yet you might after everything thats happened to hell with that youre going to consider i cant say anything now peter i must think it over dont count on it i might want to demand something impossible of you anything you ask howard anything well talk about it tomorrow howard i how can i try to thank you even for dont thank me if i do it ill have my own purpose ill expect to gain as much as you will probably more just remember that i dont do things on any other terms keating came to roarks house on the following evening he could not say whether he had waited impatiently or not the bruise had spread he could act he could weigh nothing he stood in the middle of roarks room and looked about slowly he had been grateful for all the things roark had not said to him but he gave voice to the things himself when he asked this is the enright house isnt it yes you built it roark nodded and said sit down peter understanding too well keating had brought his briefcase he put it down on the floor propping it against his chair the briefcase bulged and looked heavy he handled it cautiously then he spread his hands out and forgot the gesture holding it asking well peter can you think for a moment that youre alone in the world ive been thinking that for three days no thats not what i mean can you forget what youve been taught to repeat and think think hard with your own brain there are things ill want you to understand its my first condition im going to tell you what i want if you think of it as most people do youll say its nothing but if you say that i wont be able to do it not unless you understand completely with your whole mind how important it is ill try howard i was honest with you yesterday yes if you hadnt been i would have turned you down yesterday now i think you might be able to understand and do your part of it you want to do it i might if you offer me enough howard anything you ask anything id sell my soul thats the sort of thing i want you to understand to sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world thats what everybody does every hour of his life if i asked you to keep your soul would you understand why thats much harder yes yes i think so well go on i want you to give me a reason why i should wish to design cortlandt i want you to make me an offer you can have all the money they pay me i dont need it you can have twice the money ill double their fee you know better than that peter is that what you wish to tempt me with you would save my life can you think of any reason why i should want to save your life no well its a great public project howard a humanitarian undertaking think of the poor people who live in slums if you can give them decent comfort within their means youll have the satisfaction of performing a noble deed peter you were more honest than that yesterday his eyes dropped his voice low keating said you will love designing it yes peter now youre speaking my language what do you want now listen to me ive been working on the problem of lowrent housing for years i never thought of the poor people in slums i thought of the potentialities of our modern world the new materials the means the chances to take and use there are so many products of mans genius around us today there are such great possibilities to exploit to build cheaply simply intelligently ive had a lot of time to study i didnt have much to do after the stoddard temple i didnt expect results i worked because i cant look at any material without thinking what could be done with it and the moment i think that ive got to do it to find the answer to break the thing ive worked on it for years i loved it i worked because it was a problem i wanted to solve you wish to know how to build a unit to rent for fifteen dollars a month ill show you how to build it for ten keating made an involuntary movement forward but first i want you to think and tell me what made me give years to this work money fame charity altruism keating shook his head slowly all right youre beginning to understand so whatever we do dont lets talk about the poor people in the slums they have nothing to do with it though i wouldnt envy anyone the job of trying to explain that to fools you see im never concerned with my clients only with their architectural requirements i consider these as part of my buildings theme and problem as my buildings material just as i consider bricks and steel bricks and steel are not my motive neither are the clients both are only the means of my work peter before you can do things for people you must be the kind of man who can get things done but to get things done you must love the doing not the secondary consequences the work not the people your own action not any possible object of your charity ill be glad if people who need it find a better manner of living in a house i designed but thats not the motive of my work nor my reason nor my reward he walked to a window and stood looking out at the lights of the city trembling in the dark river you said yesterday what architect isnt interested in housing i hate the whole blasted idea of it i think its a worthy undertaking to provide a decent apartment for a man who earns fifteen dollars a week but not at the expense of other men not if it raises the taxes raises all the other rents and makes the man who earns forty live in a rat hole thats whats happening in new york nobody can afford a modern apartment except the very rich and the paupers have you seen the converted brownstones in which the average selfsupporting couple has to live have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing theyre forced to live like that because theyre not incompetent enough they make forty dollars a week and wouldnt be allowed into a housing project but theyre the ones who provide the money for the damn project they pay the taxes and the taxes raise their own rent and they have to move from a converted brownstone into an unconverted one and from that into a railroad flat id have no desire to penalize a man because hes worth only fifteen dollars a week but ill be damned if i can see why a man worth forty must be penalized and penalized in favor of the one whos less competent sure there are a lot of theories on the subject and volumes of discussion but just look at the results still architects are all for government housing and have you ever seen an architect who wasnt screaming for planned cities id like to ask him how he can be so sure that the plan adopted will be his own and if it is what right has he to impose it on the others and if it isnt what happens to his work i suppose hell say that he wants neither he wants a council a conference cooperation and collaboration and the result will be the march of the centuries peter every single one of you on that committee has done better work alone than the eight of you produced collectively ask yourself why sometime i think i know it but cortlandt yes cortlandt well ive told you all the things in which i dont believe so that youll understand what i want and what right i have to want it i dont believe in government housing i dont want to hear anything about its noble purposes i dont think theyre noble but that too doesnt matter thats not my first concern not who lives in the house nor who orders it built only the house itself if it has to be built it might as well be built right you want to build it in all the years ive worked on this problem i never hoped to see the results in practical application i forced myself not to hope i knew i couldnt expect a chance to show what could be done on a large scale your government housing among other things has made all building so expensive that private owners cant afford such projects nor any type of lowrent construction and i will never be given any job by any government youve understood that much yourself you said i couldnt get past toohey hes not the only one ive never been given a job by any group board council or committee public or private unless some man fought for me like kent lansing theres a reason for that but we dont have to discuss it now i want you to know only that i realize in what manner i need you so that what well do will be a fair exchange you need me peter i love this work i want to see it erected i want to make it real living functioning built but every living thing is integrated do you know what that means whole pure complete unbroken do you know what constitutes an integrating principle a thought the one thought the single thought that created the thing and every part of it the thought which no one can change or touch i want to design cortlandt i want to see it built i want to see it built exactly as i design it howard i wont say its nothing you understand yes i like to receive money for my work but i can pass that up this time i like to have people know my work is done by me but i can pass that up i like to have tenants made happy by my work but that doesnt matter too much the only thing that matters my goal my reward my beginning my end is the work itself my work done my way peter theres nothing in the world that you can offer me except this offer me this and you can have anything ive got to give my work done my way a private personal selfish egotistical motivation thats the only way i function thats all i am yes howard i understand with my whole mind then heres what im offering you ill design cortlandt youll put your name on it youll keep all the fees but youll guarantee that it will be built exactly as i design it keating looked at him and held the glance deliberately quietly for a moment all right howard he added i waited to show you that i know exactly what youre asking and what im promising you know it wont be easy i know it will be very terribly difficult it will because its such a large project most particularly because its a government project there will be so many people involved each with authority each wanting to exercise it in some way or another youll have a hard battle you will have to have the courage of my convictions ill try to live up to that howard you wont be able to unless you understand that im giving you a trust which is more sacred and nobler if you like the word than any altruistic purpose you could name unless you understand that this is not a favor that im not doing it for you nor for the future tenants but for myself and that you have no right to it except on these terms yes howard youll have to devise your own way of accomplishing it youll have to get yourself an ironclad contract with your bosses and then fight every bureaucrat that comes along every five minutes for the next year or more i will have no guarantee except your word wish to give it to me i give you my word roark took two typewritten sheets of paper from his pocket and handed them to him sign it whats that a contract between us stating the terms of our agreement a copy for each of us it would probably have no legal validity whatever but i can hold it over your head i couldnt sue you but i could make this public if its prestige you want you cant allow this to become known if your courage fails you at any point remember that youll lose everything by giving in but if youll keep your word i give you mine its written there that ill never betray this to anyone cortlandt will be yours on the day when its finished ill send this paper back to you and you can burn it if you wish all right howard keating signed handed the pen to him and roark signed keating sat looking at him for a moment then said slowly as if trying to distinguish the dim form of some thought of his own everybody would say youre a fool everybody would say im getting everything youll get everything society can give a man youll keep all the money youll take any fame or honor anyone might want to grant youll accept such gratitude as the tenants might feel and i ill take what nobody can give a man except himself i will have built cortlandt youre getting more than i am howard peter the voice was triumphant you understand that yes roark leaned back against a table and laughed softly it was the happiest sound keating had ever heard this will work peter it will work it will be all right youve done something wonderful you havent spoiled everything by thanking me keating nodded silently now relax peter want a drink we wont discuss any details tonight just sit there and get used to me stop being afraid of me forget everything you said yesterday this wipes it off were starting from the beginning were partners now you have your share to do its a legitimate share this is my idea of cooperation by the way youll handle people ill do the building well each do the job we know best as honestly as we can he walked to keating and extended his hand sitting still not raising his head keating took the hand his fingers tightened on it for a moment when roark brought him a drink keating swallowed three long gulps and sat looking at the room his fingers were closed firmly about the glass his arm steady but the ice tinkled in the liquid once in a while without apparent motion his eyes moved heavily over the room over roarks body he thought its not intentional not just to hurt me he cant help it he doesnt even know it but its in his whole body that look of a creature glad to be alive and he realized he had never actually believed that any living thing could be glad of the gift of existence youre so young howard youre so young once i reproached you for being too old and serious do you remember when you worked for me at francons drop it peter weve done so well without remembering thats because youre kind wait dont frown let me talk ive got to talk about something i know this is what you didnt want to mention god i didnt want you to mention it i had to steel myself against it that night against all the things you could throw at me but you didnt if it were reversed now and this were my home can you imagine what id do or say youre not conceited enough why no im too conceited if you want to call it that i dont make comparisons i never think of myself in relation to anyone else i just refuse to measure myself as part of anything im an utter egotist yes you are but egotists are not kind and you are youre the most egotistical and the kindest man i know and that doesnt make sense maybe the concepts dont make sense maybe they dont mean what people have been taught to think they mean but lets drop that now if youve got to talk of something lets talk of what were going to do he leaned out to look through the open window it will stand down there that dark stretch thats the site of cortlandt when its done ill be able to see it from my window then it will be part of the city peter have i ever told you how much i love this city keating swallowed the rest of the liquid in his glass i think id rather go now howard im no good tonight ill call you in a few days wed better meet here dont come to my office you dont want to be seen there somebody might guess by the way later when my sketches are done youll have to copy them yourself in your own manner some people would recognize my way of drawing yes all right keating rose and stood looking uncertainly at his briefcase for a moment then picked it up he mumbled some vague words of patting he took his hat he walked to the door then stopped and looked down at his briefcase howard i brought something i wanted to show you he walked back into the room and put the briefcase on the table i havent shown it to anyone his fingers fumbled opening the straps not to mother or ellsworth toohey i just want you to tell me if theres any he handed to roark six of his canvases roark looked at them one after another he took a longer time than he needed when he could trust himself to lift his eyes he shook his head in silent answer to the word keating had not pronounced its too late peter he said gently keating nodded guess i knew that when keating had gone roark leaned against the door closing his eyes he was sick with pity he had never felt this before not when henry cameron collapsed in the office at his feet not when he saw steven mallory sobbing on a bed before him those moments had been clean but this was pity this complete awareness of a man without worth or hope this sense of finality of the not to be redeemed there was shame in this feeling his own shame that he should have to pronounce such judgment upon a man that he should know an emotion which contained no shred of respect this is pity he thought and then he lifted his head in wonder he thought that there must be something terribly wrong with a world in which this monstrous feeling is called a virtue they sat on the shore of the lake wynand slouched on a boulder roark stretched out on the ground dominique sitting straight her body rising stiffly from the pale blue circle of her skirt on the grass the wynand house stood on the hill above them the earth spread out in terraced fields and rose gradually to make the elevation of the hill the house was a shape of horizontal rectangles rising toward a slashing vertical projection a group of diminishing setbacks each a separate room its size and form making the successive steps in a series of interlocking floor lines it was as if from the wide living room on the first level a hand had moved slowly shaping the next steps by a sustained touch then had stopped had continued in separate movements each shorter brusquer and had ended torn off remaining somewhere in the sky so that it seemed as if the slow rhythm of the rising fields had been picked up stressed accelerated and broken into the staccato chords of the finale i like to look at it from here said wynand i spent all day here yesterday watching the light change on it when you design a building howard do you know exactly what the sun will do to it at any moment of the day from any angle do you control the sun sure said roark without raising his head unfortunately i cant control it here move over gail youre in my way i like the sun on my back wynand let himself flop down into the grass roark lay stretched on his stomach his face buried on his arm the orange hair on the white shirt sleeve one hand extended before him palm pressed to the ground dominique looked at the blades of grass between his fingers the fingers moved once in a while crushing the grass with lazy sensuous pleasure the lake spread behind them a flat sheet darkening at the edges as if the distant trees were moving in to enclose it for the evening the sun cut a glittering band across the water dominique looked up at the house and thought that she would like to stand there at a window and look down and see this one white figure stretched on a deserted shore his hand on the ground spent emptied at the foot of that hill she had lived in the house for a month she had never thought she would then roark had said the house will be ready for you in ten days mrs wynand and she had answered yes mr roark she accepted the house the touch of the stair railings under her hand the walls that enclosed the air she breathed she accepted the light switches she pressed in the evening and the light firm wires he had laid out through the walls the water that ran when she turned a tap from conduits he had planned the warmth of an open fire on august evenings before a fireplace built stone by stone from his drawing she thought every moment every need of my existence she thought why not its the same with my body lungs blood vessels nerves brain under the same control she felt one with the house she accepted the nights when she lay in wynands arms and opened her eyes to see the shape of the bedroom roark had designed and she set her teeth against a racking pleasure that was part answer part mockery of the unsatisfied hunger in her body and surrendered to it not knowing what man gave her this which one of them or both wynand watched her as she walked across a room as she descended the stairs as she stood at a window she had heard him saying to her i didnt know a house could be designed for a woman like a dress you cant see yourself here as i do you cant see how completely this house is yours every angle every part of every room is a setting for you its scaled to your height to your body even the texture of the walls goes with the texture of your skin in an odd way its the stoddard temple but built for a single person and its mine this is what i wanted the city cant touch you here ive always felt that the city would take you away from me it gave me everything i have i dont know why i feel at times that it will demand payment some day but here youre safe and youre mine she wanted to cry gail i belong to him here as ive never belonged to him roark was the only guest wynand allowed in their new home she accepted roarks visits to them on week ends that was the hardest to accept she knew he did not come to torture her but simply because wynand asked him and he liked being with wynand she remembered saying to him in the evening her hand on the stair railing on the steps of the stairs leading up to her bedroom come down to breakfast whenever you wish mr roark just press the button in the dining room thank you mrs wynand good night once she saw him alone for a moment it was early morning she had not slept all night thinking of him in a room across the hall she had come out before the house was awake she walked down the hill and she found relief in the unnatural stillness of the earth around her the stillness of full light without sun of leaves without motion of a luminous waiting silence she heard steps behind her she stopped she leaned against a tree trunk he had a bathing suit thrown over his shoulder he was going down to swim in the lake he stopped before her and they stood still with the rest of the earth looking at each other he said nothing turned and went on she remained leaning against the tree and after a while she walked back to the house now sitting by the lake she heard wynand saying to him you look like the laziest creature in the world howard i am ive never seen anyone relax like that try staying awake for three nights in succession i told you to get here yesterday couldnt are you going to pass out right here id like to this is wonderful he lifted his head his eyes laughing as if he had not seen the building on the hill as if he were not speaking of it this is the way id like to die stretched out on some shore like this just close my eyes and never come back she thought he thinks what im thinking we still have that together gail wouldnt understand not he and gail for this once he and i wynand said you damn fool this is not like you not even as a joke youre killing yourself over something what ventilator shafts at the moment very stubborn ventilator shafts for whom clients i have all sorts of clients right now do you have to work nights yes for these particular people very special work cant even bring it into the office what are you talking about nothing dont pay any attention im half asleep she thought this is the tribute to gail the confidence of surrender he relaxes like a cat and cats dont relax except with people they like ill kick you upstairs after dinner and lock the door said wynand and leave you there to sleep twelve hours all right want to get up early lets go for a swim before sunrise mr roark is tired gail said dominique her voice sharp roark raised himself on an elbow to look at her she saw his eyes direct understanding youre acquiring the bad habits of all commuters gail she said imposing your country hours on guests from the city who are not used to them she thought let it be mine that one moment when you were walking to the lake dont let gail take that also like everything else you cant order mr roark around as if he were an employee of the banner i dont know anyone on earth id rather order around than mr roark said wynand gaily whenever i can get away with it youre getting away with it i dont mind taking orders mrs wynand said roark not from a man as capable as gail let me win this time she thought please let me win this time it means nothing to you its senseless and it means nothing at all but refuse him refuse him for the sake of the memory of a moments pause that had not belonged to him i think you should rest mr roark you should sleep late tomorrow ill tell the servants not to disturb you why no thanks ill be all right in a few hours mrs wynand i like to swim before breakfast knock at the door when youre ready gail and well go down together she looked over the spread of lake and hills with not a sign of men not another house anywhere just water trees and sun a world of their own and she thought he was right they belonged together the three of them the drawings of cortlandt homes presented six buildings fifteen stories high each made in the shape of an irregular star with arms extending from a central shaft the shafts contained elevators stairways heating systems and all the utilities the apartments radiated from the center in the form of extended triangles the space between the arms allowed light and air from three sides the ceilings were precast the inner walls were of plastic tile that required no painting or plastering all pipes and wires were laid out in metal ducts at the edge of the floors to be opened and replaced when necessary without costly demolition the kitchens and bathrooms were prefabricated as complete units the inner partitions were of light metal that could be folded into the walls to provide one large room or pulled out to divide it there were few halls or lobbies to clean a minimum of cost and labor required for the maintenance of the place the entire plan was a composition in triangles the buildings of poured concrete were a complex modeling of simple structural features there was no ornament none was needed the shapes had the beauty of sculpture ellsworth toohey did not look at the plans which keating had spread out on his desk he stared at the perspective drawings he stared his mouth open then he threw his head back and howled with laughter peter he said youre a genius he added i think you know exactly what i mean keating looked at him blankly without curiosity youve succeeded in what ive spent a lifetime trying to achieve in what centuries of men and bloody battles behind us have tried to achieve i take my hat off to you peter in awe and admiration look at the plans said keating listlessly it will rent for ten dollars a unit i havent the slightest doubt that it will i dont have to look oh yes peter this will go through dont worry this will be accepted my congratulations peter you goddamn fool said gail wynand what are you up to he threw to roark a copy of the banner folded at an inside page the page bore a photograph captioned architects drawing of cortlandt homes the federal housing project to be built in astoria l i keating dumont architects roark glanced at the photograph and asked what do you mean you know damn well what i mean do you think i picked the things in my art gallery by their signatures if peter keating designed this ill eat every copy of todays banner peter keating designed this gail you fool what are you after if i dont want to understand what youre talking about i wont understand it no matter what you say oh you might if i run a story to the effect that a certain housing project was designed by howard roark which would make a swell exclusive story and a joke on one mr toohey whos the boy behind the boys on most of those damn projects you publish that and ill sue hell out of you you really would i would drop it gail dont you see i dont want to discuss it later wynand showed the picture to dominique and asked who designed this she looked at it of course was all she answered what kind of changing world alvah changing to what from what whos doing the changing parts of alvah scarrets face looked anxious but most of it was impatient as he glanced at the proofs of his editorial on motherhood in a changing world which lay on wynands desk what the hell gail he muttered indifferently thats what i want to know what the hell he picked up the proof and read aloud the world we have known is gone and done for and its no use kidding ourselves about it we cannot go back we must go forward the mothers of today must set the example by broadening their own emotional view and raising their selfish love for their own children to a higher plane to include everybodys little children mothers must love every kid in their block in their street in their city county state nation and the whole wide wide world just exactly as much as their own little mary or johnny wynand wrinkled his nose fastidiously alvah its all right to dish out crap but this kind of crap alvah scarret would not look at him youre out of step with the times gail he said his voice was low it had a tone of warning as of something baring its teeth tentatively just for future reference this was so odd a behavior for alvah scarret that wynand lost all desire to pursue the conversation he drew a line across the editorial but the blue pencil stroke seemed tired and ended in a blur he said go and bat out something else alvah scarret rose picked up the strip of paper turned and left the room without a word wynand looked after him puzzled amused and slightly sick he had known for several years the trend which his paper had embraced gradually imperceptibly without any directive from him he had noticed the cautious slanting of news stories the halfhints the vague allusions the peculiar adjectives peculiarly placed the stressing of certain themes the insertion of political conclusions where none was needed if a story concerned a dispute between employer and employee the employer was made to appear guilty simply through wording no matter what the facts presented if a sentence referred to the past it was always our dark past or our dead past if a statement involved someones personal motive it was always goaded by selfishness or egged by greed a crossword puzzle gave the definition of obsolescent individuals and the word came out as capitalists wynand had shrugged about it contemptuously amused his staff he thought was well trained if this was the popular slang of the day his boys assumed it automatically it meant nothing at all he kept it off the editorial page and the rest did not matter it was no more than a fashion of the moment and he had survived many changing fashions he felt no concern over the we dont read wynand campaign he obtained one of their mensroom stickers pasted it on the windshield of his own lincoln added the words we dont either and kept it there long enough to be discovered and snapped by a photographer from a neutral paper in the course of his career he had been fought damned denounced by the greatest publishers of his time by the shrewdest coalitions of financial power he could not summon any apprehension over the activities of somebody named gus webb he knew that the banner was losing some of its popularity a temporary fad he told scarret shrugging he would run a limerick contest or a series of coupons for victrola records see a slight spurt of circulation and promptly forget the matter he could not rouse himself to full action he had never felt a greater desire to work he entered his office each morning with important eagerness but within an hour he found himself studying the joints of the paneling on the walls and reciting nursery rhymes in his mind it was not boredom not the satisfaction of a yawn but more like the gnawing pull of wishing to yawn and not quite making it he could not say that he disliked his work it had merely become distasteful not enough to force a decision not enough to make him clench his fists just enough to contract his nostrils he thought dimly that the cause lay in that new trend of the public taste he saw no reason why he should not follow it and play on it as expertly as he had played on all other fads but he could not follow he felt no moral scruples it was not a positive stand rationally taken not defiance in the name of a cause of importance just a fastidious feeling something pertaining almost to chastity the hesitation one feels before putting ones foot down into muck he thought it doesnt matter it will not last ill be back when the wave swings on to another theme i think id rather sit this one out he could not say why the encounter with alvah scarret gave him a feeling of uneasiness sharper than usual he thought it was funny that alvah should have switched to that line of tripe but there had been something else there had been a personal quality in alvahs exit almost a declaration that he saw no necessity to consider the bosss opinion any longer i ought to fire alvah he thought and then laughed at himself aghast fire alvah scarret one might as well think of stopping the earth or of the unthinkable of closing the banner but through the months of that summer and fall there were days when he loved the banner then he sat at this desk with his hand on the pages spread before him fresh ink smearing his palm and he smiled as he saw the name of howard roark in the pages of the banner the word had come down from his office to every department concerned plug howard roark in the art section the realestate section the editorials the columns mentions of roark and his buildings began to appear regularly there were not many occasions when one could give publicity to an architect and buildings had little news value but the banner managed to throw roarks name at the public under every kind of ingenious pretext wynand edited every word of it the material was startling on the pages of the banner it was written in good taste there were no sensational stories no photographs of roark at breakfast no human interest no attempts to sell a man only a considered gracious tribute to the greatness of an artist he never spoke of it to roark and roark never mentioned it they did not discuss the banner coming home to his new house in the evening wynand saw the banner on the living room table every night he had not allowed it in his home since his marriage he smiled when he saw it for the first time and said nothing then he spoke of it one evening he turned the pages until he came to an article on the general theme of summer resorts most of which was a description of monadnock valley he raised his head to glance at dominique across the room she sat on the floor by the fireplace he said thank you dear for what gail for understanding when i would be glad to see the banner in my house he walked to her and sat down on the floor beside her he held her thin shoulders in the curve of his arm he said think of all the politicians movie stars visiting grand dukes and sash weight murderers whom the banner has trumpeted all these years think of my great crusades about streetcar companies redlight districts and homegrown vegetables for once dominique i can say what i believe yes gail all this power i wanted reached and never used now theyll see what i can do ill force them to recognize him as he should be recognized ill give him the fame he deserves public opinion public opinion is what i make it do you think he wants this probably not i dont care he needs it and hes going to get it i want him to have it as an architect hes public property he cant stop a newspaper from writing about him if it wants to all that copy on him do you write it yourself most of it gail what a great journalist you could have been the campaign brought results of a kind he had not expected the general public remained blankly indifferent but in the intellectual circles in the art world in the profession people were laughing at roark comments were reported to wynand roark oh yes wynands pet the banners glamour boy the genius of the yellow press the banner is now selling art send two box tops or a reasonable facsimile wouldnt you know it thats what ive always thought of roark the kind of talent fit for the wynand papers well see said wynand contemptuously and continued his private crusade he gave roark every commission of importance whose owners were open to pressure since spring he had brought to roarks office the contracts for a yacht club on the hudson an office building two private residences ill get you more than you can handle he said ill make you catch up with all the years theyve made you waste austen heller said to roark one evening if i may be so presumptuous i think you need advice howard yes of course i mean this preposterous business of mr gail wynand you and he as inseparable friends upsets every rational concept ive ever held after all there are distinct classes of humanity no im not talking tooheys language but there are certain boundary lines among men which cannot be crossed yes there are but nobody has ever given the proper statement of where they must be drawn well the friendship is your own business but theres one aspect of it that must be stopped and youre going to listen to me for once im listening i think its fine all those commissions hes dumping on you im sure hell be rewarded for that and lifted several rungs in hell where hes certain to go but he must stop that publicity hes splashing you with in the banner youve got to make him stop dont you know that the support of the wynand papers is enough to discredit anyone roark said nothing its hurting you professionally howard i know it is are you going to make him stop no but why in blazes i said id listen austen i didnt say id speak about him late one afternoon in the fall wynand came to roarks office as he often did at the end of a day and when they walked out together he said its a nice evening lets go for a walk howard theres a piece of property i want you to see he led the way to hells kitchen they walked around a great rectangle two blocks between ninth avenue and eleventh five blocks from north to south roark saw a grimy desolation of tenements sagging hulks of what had been red brick crooked doorways rotting boards strings of gray underclothing in narrow air shafts not as a sign of life but as a malignant growth of decomposition you own that roark said all of it why show it to me dont you know that making an architect look at that is worse than showing him a field of unburied corpses wynand pointed to the whitetiled front of a new diner across the street lets go in there they sat by the window at a clean metal table and wynand ordered coffee he seemed as graciously at home as in the best restaurants of the city his elegance had an odd quality here it did not insult the place but seemed to transform it like the presence of a king who never alters his manner yet makes a palace of any house he enters he leaned forward with his elbows on the table watching roark through the steam of the coffee his eyes narrowed amused he moved one finger to point across the street thats the first piece of property i ever bought howard it was a long time ago i havent touched it since what were you saving it for you roark raised the heavy white mug of coffee to his lips his eyes holding wynands narrowed and mocking in answer he knew that wynand wanted eager questions and he waited patiently instead you stubborn bastard wynand chuckled surrendering all right listen this is where i was born when i could begin to think of buying real estate i bought this piece house by house block by block it took a long time i could have bought better property and made money fast as i did later but i waited until i had this even though i knew i would make no use of it for years you see i had decided then that this is where the wynand building would stand some day all right keep still all you want ive seen what your face looked like just now oh god gail whats the matter want to do it want it pretty badly i think id almost give my life for it only then i couldnt build it is that what you wanted to hear something like that i wont demand your life but its nice to shock the breath out of you for once thank you for being shocked it means you understood what the wynand building implies the highest structure in the city and the greatest i know thats what youd want i wont build it yet but ive waited for it all these years and now youll wait with me do you know that i really like to torture you in a way that i always want to i know i brought you here only to tell you that it will be yours when i build it i have waited because i felt i was not ready for it since i met you i knew i was ready and i dont mean because youre an architect but well have to wait a little longer just another year or two till the country gets back on its feet this is the wrong time for building of course everybody says that the day of the skyscraper is past that its obsolete i dont give a damn about that ill make it pay for itself the wynand enterprises have offices scattered all over town i want them all in one building and i hold enough over the heads of enough important people to force them to rent all the rest of the space perhaps it will be the last skyscraper built in new york so much the better the greatest and the last roark sat looking across the street at the streaked ruins to be torn down howard all of it razed off the place where i did not run things to be supplanted by a park and the wynand building the best structures of new york are wasted because they cant be seen squeezed against one another in blocks my building will be seen it will reclaim the whole neighborhood let the others follow not the right location theyll say who makes right locations theyll see this might become the new center of the city when the city starts living again i planned it when the banner was nothing but a fourthrate rag i havent miscalculated have i i knew what i would become a monument to my life howard remember what you said when you came to my office for the first time a statement of my life there were things in my past which i have not liked but all the things of which i was proud will remain after i am gone that building will be gail wynand i knew id find the right architect when the time came i didnt know he would be much more than just an architect i hired im glad it happened this way its a kind of reward its as if i had been forgiven my last and greatest achievement will also be your greatest it will be not only my monument but the best gift i could offer to the man who means most to me on earth dont frown you know thats what you are to me look at that horror across the street i want to sit here and watch you looking at it thats what were going to destroy you and i thats what it will rise from the wynand building by howard roark ive waited for it from the day i was born from the day you were born youve waited for your one great chance there it is howard across the street yours from me it had stopped raining but peter keating wished it would start again the pavements glistened there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings and since it did not come from the sky it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat the air was heavy with untimely darkness disquieting like premature old age and there were yellow puddles of light in windows keating had missed the rain but he felt wet from his bones out he had left his office early and he walked home the office seemed unreal to him as it had for a long time he could find reality only in the evenings when he slipped furtively up to roarks apartment he did not slip and it was not furtive he told himself angrily and knew that it was even though he walked through the lobby of the enright house and rode up in an elevator like any man on a legitimate errand it was the vague anxiety the impulse to glance around at every face the fear of being recognized it was a load of anonymous guilt not toward any person but the more frightening sense of guilt without a victim he took from roark rough sketches for every detail of cortlandt to have them translated into working drawings by his own staff he listened to roarks instructions he memorized arguments to offer his employers against every possible objection he absorbed like a recording machine afterward when he gave explanations to his draftsmen his voice sounded like a disk being played he did not mind he questioned nothing now he walked slowly through the streets full of rain that would not come he looked up and saw empty space where the towers of familiar buildings had been it did not look like fog or clouds but like a solid spread of gray sky that had worked a gigantic soundless destruction that sight of buildings vanishing through the sky had always made him uneasy he walked on looking down it was the shoes that he noticed first he knew that he must have seen the womans face that the instinct of selfpreservation had jerked his glance away from it and let his conscious perception begin with the shoes they were flat brown oxfords offensively competent too well shined on the muddy pavement contemptuous of rain and of beauty his eyes went to the brown skirt to the tailored jacket costly and cold like a uniform to the hand with a hole in the finger of an expensive glove to the lapel that bore a preposterous ornament a bowlegged mexican with redenameled pants stuck there in a clumsy attempt at pertness to the thin lips to the glasses to the eyes katie he said she stood by the window of a bookstore her glance hesitated halfway between recognition and a book title she had been examining then with recognition evident in the beginning of a smile the glance went back to the book title to finish and make an efficient note of it then her eyes returned to keating her smile was pleasant not as an effort over bitterness and not as welcome just pleasant why peter keating she said hello peter katie he could not extend his hand or move closer to her yes imagine running into you like this why new york is just like any small town though i suppose without the better features there was no strain in her voice what are you doing here i thought i heard he knew she had a good job in washington and had moved there two years ago just a business trip have to dash right back tomorrow cant say that i mind it either new york seems so dead so slow well im glad you like your job if you mean isnt that what you mean like my job what a silly thing to say washington is the only grownup place in the country i dont see how people can live anywhere else what have you been doing peter i saw your name in the paper the other day it was something important i im working you havent changed much katie not really have you i mean your face you look like you used to in a way its the only face ive got why do people always have to talk about changes if they havent seen each other for a year or two i ran into grace parker yesterday and she had to go into an inventory of my appearance i could just hear every word before she said it you look so nice not a day older really catherine people are provincial but you do look nice its its nice to see you im glad to see you too how is the building industry i dont know what you read about must have been cortlandt im doing cortlandt homes a housing yes of course that was it i think its very good for you peter to do a job not just for private profit and a fat fee but with a social purpose i think architects should stop money grubbing and give a little time to government work and broader objectives why most of them would grab it if they could get it its one of the hardest rackets to break into its a closed yes yes i know its simply impossible to make the laymen understand our methods of working and thats why all we hear are all those stupid boring complaints you mustnt read the wynand papers peter i never read the wynand papers what on earth has it got to do with oh i i dont know what were talking about katie he thought that she owed him nothing or every kind of anger and scorn she could command and yet there was a human obligation she still had toward him she owed him an evidence of strain in this meeting there was none we really should have a great deal to talk about peter the words would have lifted him had they not been pronounced so easily but we cant stand here all day she glanced at her wrist watch ive got an hour or so suppose you take me somewhere for a cup of tea you could use some hot tea you look frozen that was her first comment on his appearance that and a glance without reaction he thought even roark had been shocked had acknowledged the change yes katie that will be wonderful i he wished she had not been the one to suggest it it was the right thing for them to do he wished she had not been able to think of the right thing not so quickly lets find a nice quiet place well go to thorpes theres one around the corner they have the nicest watercress sandwiches it was she who took his arm to cross the street and dropped it again on the other side the gesture had been automatic she had not noticed it there was a counter of pastry and candy inside the door of thorpes a large bowl of sugarcoated almonds green and white glared at keating the place smelled of orange icing the lights were dim a stuffy orange haze the odor made the light seem sticky the tables were too small set close together he sat looking down at a paper lace doily on a black glass table top but when he lifted his eyes to catherine he knew that no caution was necessary she did not react to his scrutiny her expression remained the same whether he studied her face or that of the woman at the next table she seemed to have no consciousness of her own person it was her mouth that had changed most he thought the lips were drawn in with only a pale edge of flesh left around the imperious line of their opening a mouth to issue orders he thought but not big orders or cruel orders just mean little ones about plumbing and disinfectants he saw the fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes a skin like paper that had been crumpled and then smoothed out she was telling him about her work in washington and he listened bleakly he did not hear the words only the tone of her voice dry and crackling a waitress in a starched orchid uniform came to take their orders catherine snapped the tea sandwiches special please keating said a cup of coffee he saw catherines eyes on him and in a sudden panic of embarrassment feeling he must not confess that he couldnt swallow a bite of food now feeling that the confession would anger her he added a ham and swiss on rye i guess peter what ghastly food habits wait a minute waitress you dont want that peter its very bad for you you should have a fresh salad and coffee is bad at this time of the day americans drink too much coffee all right said keating tea and a combination salad waitress and oh waitress no bread with the salad youre gaining weight peter some diet crackers please keating waited until the orchid uniform had moved away and then he said hopefully i have changed havent i katie i do look pretty awful even a disparaging comment would be a personal link what oh i guess so it isnt healthy but americans know nothing whatever about the proper nutritional balance of course men do make too much fuss over mere appearance theyre much vainer than women its really women whore taking charge of all productive work now and women will build a better world how does one build a better world katie well if you consider the determining factor which is of course economic no i i didnt ask it that way katie ive been very unhappy im sorry to hear that one hears so many people say that nowadays thats because its a transition period and people feel rootless but youve always had a bright disposition peter do you do you remember what i was like goodness peter you talk as if it had been sixtyfive years ago but so many things happened i he took the plunge he had to take it the crudest way seemed the easiest i was married and divorced yes i read about that i was glad when you were divorced he leaned forward if your wife was the kind of woman who could marry gail wynand you were lucky to get rid of her the tone of chronic impatience that ran words together had not altered to pronounce this he had to believe it this was all the subject meant to her katie youre very tactful and kind but drop the act he said knowing in dread that it was not an act drop it tell me what you thought of me then say everything i dont mind i want to hear it dont you understand ill feel better if i hear it surely peter you dont want me to start some sort of recriminations id say it was conceited of you if it werent so childish what did you feel that day when i didnt come and then you heard i was married he did not know what instinct drove him through numbness to be brutal as the only means left to him katie you suffered then yes of course i suffered all young people do in such situations it seems foolish afterward i cried and i screamed some dreadful things at uncle ellsworth and he had to call a doctor to give me a sedative and then weeks afterward i fainted on the street one day without any reason which was really disgraceful all the conventional things i suppose everybody goes through them like measles why should i have expected to be exempt as uncle ellsworth said he thought that he had not known there was something worse than a living memory of pain a dead one and of course we knew it was for the best i cant imagine myself married to you you cant imagine it katie that is nor to anyone else it wouldnt have worked peter im temperamentally unsuited to domesticity its too selfish and narrow of course i understand what you feel just now and i appreciate it its only human that you should feel something like remorse since you did what is known as jilted me he winced you see how stupid those things sound its natural for you to be a little contrite a normal reflex but we must look at it objectively were grownup rational people nothing is too serious we cant really help what we do were conditioned that way we just charge it off to experience and go on from there katie youre not talking some fallen girl out of her problem youre speaking about yourself is there any essential difference everybodys problems are the same just like everybodys emotions he saw her nibbling a thin strip of bread with a smear of green and noticed that his order had been served he moved his fork about in his salad bowl and he made himself bite into a gray piece of diet cracker then he discovered how strange it was when one lost the knack of eating automatically and had to do it by full conscious effort the cracker seemed inexhaustible he could not finish the process of chewing he moved his jaws without reducing the amount of gritty pulp in his mouth katie for six years i thought of how id ask your forgiveness some day and now i have the chance but i wont ask it it seems it seems beside the point i know its horrible to say that but thats how it seems to me it was the worst thing i ever did in my life but not because i hurt you i did hurt you katie and maybe more than you know yourself but thats not my worst guilt katie i wanted to marry you it was the only thing i ever really wanted and thats the sin that cant be forgiven that i hadnt done what i wanted it feels so dirty and pointless and monstrous as one feels about insanity because theres no sense to it no dignity nothing but pain and wasted pain katie why do they always teach us that its easy and evil to do what we want and that we need discipline to restrain ourselves its the hardest thing in the world to do what we want and it takes the greatest kind of courage i mean what we really want as i wanted to marry you not as i want to sleep with some woman or get drunk or get my name in the papers those things theyre not even desires theyre things people do to escape from desires because its such a big responsibility really to want something peter what youre saying is very ugly and selfish maybe i dont know ive always had to tell you the truth about everything even if you didnt ask i had to yes you did it was a commendable trait you were a charming boy peter it was the bowl of sugarcoated almonds on the counter that hurt him he thought in a dull anger the almonds were green and white they had no business being green and white at this time of the year the colors of st patricks day then there was always candy like that in all the store windows and st patricks day meant spring no better than spring that moment of wonderful anticipation just before spring is to begin katie i wont say that im still in love with you i dont know whether i am or not ive never asked myself it wouldnt matter now im not saying this because i hope for anything or think of trying or i know only that i loved you katie i loved you whatever i made of it even if this is how ive got to say it for the last time i loved you katie she looked at him and she seemed pleased not stirred not happy not pitying but pleased in a casual way he thought if she were completely the spinster the frustrated social worker as people think of those women the kind who would scorn sex in the haughty conceit of her own virtue that would still be recognition if only in hostility but this this amused tolerance seemed to admit that romance was only human one had to take it like everybody else it was a popular weakness of no great consequence she was gratified as she would have been gratified by the same words from any other man it was like that redenamel mexican on her lapel a contemptuous concession to peoples demand of vanity katie katie lets say that this doesnt count this now its past counting anyway isnt it this cant touch what it was like can it katie people always regret that the past is so final that nothing can change it but im glad its so we cant spoil it we can think of the past cant we why shouldnt we i mean as you said like grownup people not fooling ourselves not trying to hope but only to look back at it do you remember when i came to your house in new york for the first time you looked so thin and small and your hair hung every which way i told you i would never love anyone else i held you on my lap you didnt weigh anything at all and i told you i would never love anyone else and you said you knew it i remember when we were together katie im ashamed of so many things but not of one moment when we were together when i asked you to marry me no i never asked you to marry me i just said we were engaged and you said yes it was on a park bench it was snowing yes you had funny woolen gloves like mittens i remember there were drops of water in the fuzz round like crystal they flashed it was because a car passed by yes i think its agreeable to look back occasionally but ones perspective widens one grows richer spiritually with the years he kept silent for a long time then he said his voice flat im sorry why youre very sweet peter ive always said men are the sentimentalists he thought its not an act one cant put on an act like that unless its an act inside for oneself and then there is no limit no way out no reality she went on talking to him and after a while it was about washington again he answered when it was necessary he thought that he had believed it was a simple sequence the past and the present and if there was loss in the past one was compensated by pain in the present and pain gave it a form of immortality but he had not known that one could destroy like this kill retroactively so that to her it had never existed she glanced at her wrist watch and gave a little gasp of impatience im late already i must run along he said heavily do you mind if i dont go with you katie its not rudeness i just think its better but of course not at all im quite able to find my way in the streets and theres no need for formalities among old friends she added gathering her bag and gloves crumpling a paper napkin into a ball dropping it neatly into her teacup ill give you a ring next time im in town and well have a bite together again though i cant promise when that will be im so busy i have to go so many places last month it was detroit and next week im flying to st louis but when they shoot me out to new york again ill ring you up so long peter it was ever so nice gail wynand looked at the shining wood of the yacht deck the wood and a brass doorknob that had become a smear of fire gave him a sense of everything around him the miles of space filled with sun between the burning spreads of sky and ocean it was february and the yacht lay still her engines idle in the southern pacific he leaned on the rail and looked down at roark in the water roark floated on his back his body stretched into a straight line arms spread eyes closed the tan of his skin implied a month of days such as this wynand thought that this was the way he liked to apprehend space and time through the power of his yacht through the tan of roarks skin or the sunbrown of his own arms folded before him on the rail he had not sailed his yacht for several years this time he had wanted roark to be his only guest dominique was left behind wynand had said youre killing yourself howard youve been going at a pace nobody can stand for long ever since monadnock isnt it think youd have the courage to perform the feat most difficult for you to rest he was astonished when roark accepted without argument roark laughed im not running away from my work if thats what surprises you i know when to stop and i cant stop unless its completely i know ive overdone it ive been wasting too much paper lately and doing awful stuff do you ever do awful stuff probably more of it than any other architect and with less excuse the only distinction i can claim is that my botches end up in my own wastebasket i warn you well be away for months if you begin to regret it and cry for your drafting table in a week like all men whove never learned to loaf i wont take you back im the worst kind of dictator aboard my yacht youll have everything you can imagine except paper or pencils i wont even leave you any freedom of speech no mention of girders plastics or reinforced concrete once you step on board ill teach you to eat sleep and exist like the most worthless millionaire id like to try that the work in the office did not require roarks presence for the next few months his current jobs were being completed two new commissions were not to be started until spring he had made all the sketches keating needed for cortlandt the construction was about to begin before sailing on a day in late december roark went to take a last look at the site of cortlandt an anonymous spectator in a group of the idle curious he stood and watched the steam shovels biting the earth breaking the way for future foundations the east river was a broad band of sluggish black water and beyond in a sparse haze of snowflakes the towers of the city stood softened half suggested in watercolors of orchid and blue dominique did not protest when wynand told her that he wanted to sail on a long cruise with roark dearest you understand that its not running away from you i just need some time taken out of everything being with howard is like being alone with myself only more at peace of course gail i dont mind but he looked at her and suddenly he laughed incredulously pleased dominique i believe youre jealous its wonderful im more grateful to him than ever if it could make you jealous of me she could not tell him that she was jealous or of whom the yacht sailed at the end of december roark watched grinning wynands disappointment when wynand found that he needed to enforce no discipline roark did not speak of buildings lay for hours stretched out on deck in the sun and loafed like an expert they spoke little there were days when wynand could not remember what sentences they had exchanged it would have seemed possible to him that they had not spoken at all their serenity was their best means of communication today they had dived together to swim and wynand had climbed back first as he stood at the rail watching roark in the water he thought of the power he held in this moment he could order the yacht to start moving sail away and leave that redheaded body to sun and ocean the thought gave him pleasure the sense of power and the sense of surrender to roark in the knowledge that no conceivable force could make him exercise that power every physical instrumentality was on his side a few contractions of his vocal cords giving the order and someones hand opening a valve and the obedient machine would move away he thought its not just a moral issue not the mere horror of the act one could conceivably abandon a man if the fate of a continent depended on it but nothing would enable him to abandon this man he gail wynand was the helpless one in this moment with the solid planking of the deck under his feet roark floating like a piece of driftwood held a power greater than that of the engine in the belly of the yacht wynand thought because that is the power from which the engine has come roark climbed back on deck wynand looked at roarks body at the threads of water running down the angular planes he said you made a mistake on the stoddard temple howard that statue should have been not of dominique but of you no im too egotistical for that egotistical an egotist would have loved it you use words in the strangest way in the exact way i dont wish to be the symbol of anything im only myself stretched in a deck chair wynand glanced up with satisfaction at the lantern a disk of frosted glass on the bulkhead behind him it cut off the black void of the ocean and gave him privacy within solid walls of light he heard the sound of the yachts motion he felt the warm night air on his face he saw nothing but the stretch of deck around him enclosed and final roark stood before him at the rail a tall white figure leaning back against black space his head lifted as wynand had seen it lifted in an unfinished building his hands clasped the rail the short shirt sleeves left his arms in the light vertical ridges of shadow stressed the tensed muscles of his arms and the tendons of his neck wynand thought of the yachts engine of skyscrapers of transatlantic cables of everything man had made howard this is what i wanted to have you here with me i know do you know what it really is avarice im a miser about two things on earth you and dominique im a millionaire whos never owned anything do you remember what you said about ownership im like a savage whos discovered the idea of private property and run amuck on it its funny think of ellsworth toohey why ellsworth toohey i mean the things he preaches ive been wondering lately whether he really understands what hes advocating selflessness in the absolute sense why thats what ive been does he know that im the embodiment of his ideal of course he wouldnt approve of my motive but motives never alter facts if its true selflessness hes after in the philosophical sense and mr toohey is a philosopher in a sense much beyond matters of money why let him look at me ive never owned anything ive never wanted anything i didnt give a damn in the most cosmic way toohey could ever hope for i made myself into a barometer subject to the pressure of the whole world the voice of his masses pushed me up and down of course i collected a fortune in the process does that change the intrinsic reality of the picture suppose i gave away every penny of it suppose i had never wished to take any money at all but had set out in pure altruism to serve the people what would i have to do exactly what ive done give the greatest pleasure to the greatest number express the opinions the desires the tastes of the majority the majority that voted me its approval and support freely in the shape of a threecent ballot dropped at the corner newsstand every morning the wynand papers for thirtyone years they have represented everybody except gail wynand i erased my ego out of existence in a way never achieved by any saint in a cloister yet people call me corrupt why the saint in a cloister sacrifices only material things its a small price to pay for the glory of his soul he hoards his soul and gives up the world but i i took automobiles silk pyjamas a penthouse and gave the world my soul in exchange whos sacrificed more if sacrifice is the test of virtue whos the actual saint gail i didnt think youd ever admit that to yourself why not i knew what i was doing i wanted power over a collective soul and i got it a collective soul its a messy kind of concept but if anyone wishes to visualize it concretely let him pick up a copy of the new york banner yes of course toohey would tell me that this is not what he means by altruism he means i shouldnt leave it up to the people to decide what they want i should decide it i should determine not what i like nor what they like but what i think they should like and then ram it down their throats it would have to be rammed since their voluntary choice is the banner well there are several such altruists in the world today you realize that of course what else can one do if one must serve the people if one must live for others either pander to everybodys wishes and be called corrupt or impose on everybody by force your own idea of everybodys good can you think of any other way no whats left then where does decency start what begins where altruism ends do you see what im in love with yes gail wynand had noticed that roarks voice had a reluctance that sounded almost like sadness whats the matter with you why do you sound like that im sorry forgive me its just something i thought ive been thinking of this for a long time and particularly all these days when youve made me lie on deck and loaf thinking about me about you among many other things what have you decided im not an altruist gail i dont decide for others you dont have to worry about me ive sold myself but ive held no illusions about it ive never become an alvah scarret he really believes whatever the public believes i despise the public thats my only vindication ive sold my life but i got a good price power ive never used it i couldnt afford a personal desire but now im free now i can use it for what i want for what i believe for dominique for you roark turned away when he looked back at wynand he said only i hope so gail what have you been thinking about these past weeks the principle behind the dean who fired me from stanton what principle the thing that is destroying the world the thing you were talking about actual selflessness the ideal which they say does not exist theyre wrong it does exist though not in the way they imagine its what i couldnt understand about people for a long time they have no self they live within others they live secondhand look at peter keating you look at him i hate his guts ive looked at him at whats left of him and its helped me to understand hes paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that hes been too selfish in what act or thought of his has there ever been a self what was his aim in life greatness in other peoples eyes fame admiration envy all that which comes from others others dictated his convictions which he did not hold but he was satisfied that others believed he held them others were his motive power and his prime concern he didnt want to be great but to be thought great he didnt want to build but to be admired as a builder he borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others theres your actual selflessness its his ego hes betrayed and given up but everybody calls him selfish thats the pattern most people follow yes and isnt that the root of every despicable action not selfishness but precisely the absence of a self look at them the man who cheats and lies but preserves a respectable front he knows himself to be dishonest but others think hes honest and he derives his selfrespect from that secondhand the man who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own he knows himself to be mediocre but hes great in the eyes of others the frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed in order to establish his own superiority by comparison the man whose sole aim is to make money now i dont see anything evil in a desire to make money but money is only a means to some end if a man wants it for a personal purpose to invest in his industry to create to study to travel to enjoy luxury hes completely moral but the men who place money first go much beyond that personal luxury is a limited endeavor what they want is ostentation to show to stun to entertain to impress others theyre secondhanders look at our socalled cultural endeavors a lecturer who spouts some borrowed rehash of nothing at all that means nothing at all to him and the people who listen and dont give a damn but sit there in order to tell their friends that they have attended a lecture by a famous name all secondhanders if i were ellsworth toohey id say arent you making out a case against selfishness arent they all acting on a selfish motive to be noticed liked admired by others at the price of their own selfrespect in the realm of greatest importance the realm of values of judgment of spirit of thought they place others above self in the exact manner which altruism demands a truly selfish man cannot be affected by the approval of others he doesnt need it i think toohey understands that thats what helps him spread his vicious nonsense just weakness and cowardice its so easy to run to others its so hard to stand on ones own record you can fake virtue for an audience you cant fake it in your own eyes your ego is the strictest judge they run from it they spend their lives running its easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base selfrespect on personal standards of personal achievement its simple to seek substitutes for competence such easy substitutes love charm kindness charity but there is no substitute for competence that precisely is the deadliness of secondhanders they have no concern for facts ideas work theyre concerned only with people they dont ask is this true they ask is this what others think is true not to judge but to repeat not to do but to give the impression of doing not creation but show not ability but friendship not merit but pull what would happen to the world without those who do think work produce those are the egotists you dont think through anothers brain and you dont work through anothers hands when you suspend your faculty of independent judgment you suspend consciousness to stop consciousness is to stop life secondhanders have no sense of reality their reality is not within them but somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another not an entity but a relation anchored to nothing thats the emptiness i couldnt understand in people thats what stopped me whenever i faced a committee men without an ego opinion without a rational process motion without brakes or motor power without responsibility the secondhander acts but the source of his actions is scattered in every other living person its everywhere and nowhere and you cant reason with him hes not open to reason you cant speak to him he cant hear youre tried by an empty bench a blind mass running amuck to crush you without sense or purpose steve mallory couldnt define the monster but he knew thats the drooling beast he fears the secondhander i think your secondhanders understand this try as they might not to admit it to themselves notice how theyll accept anything except a man who stands alone they recognize him at once by instinct theres a special insidious kind of hatred for him they forgive criminals they admire dictators crime and violence are a tie a form of mutual dependence they need ties theyve got to force their miserable little personalities on every single person they meet the independent man kills them because they dont exist within him and thats the only form of existence they know notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence notice the malice toward an independent man look back at your own life howard and at the people youve met they know theyre afraid youre a reproach thats because some sense of dignity always remains in them theyre still human beings but theyve been taught to seek themselves in others yet no man can achieve the kind of absolute humility that would need no selfesteem in any form he wouldnt survive so after centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted by seeking selfesteem through others by living secondhand and it has opened the way for every kind of horror it has become the dreadful form of selfishness which a truly selfish man couldnt have conceived and now to cure a world perishing from selflessness were asked to destroy the self listen to what is being preached today look at everyone around us youve wondered why they suffer why they seek happiness and never find it if any man stopped and asked himself whether hes ever held a truly personal desire hed find the answer hed see that all his wishes his efforts his dreams his ambitions are motivated by other men hes not really struggling even for material wealth but for the secondhanders delusion prestige a stamp of approval not his own he can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded he cant say about a single thing this is what i wanted because i wanted it not because it made my neighbors gape at me then he wonders why hes unhappy every form of happiness is private our greatest moments are personal selfmotivated not to be touched the things which are sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing but now we are taught to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing to seek joy in meeting halls we havent even got a word for the quality i mean for the selfsufficiency of mans spirit its difficult to call it selfishness or egotism the words have been perverted theyve come to mean peter keating gail i think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men ive always demanded a certain quality in the people i liked ive always recognized it at once and its the only quality i respect in men i chose my friends by that now i know what it is a selfsufficient ego nothing else matters im glad you admit that you have friends i even admit that i love them but i couldnt love them if they were my chief reason for living do you notice that peter keating hasnt a single friend left do you see why if one doesnt respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others to hell with peter keating im thinking of you and your friends roark smiled gail if this boat were sinking id give my life to save you not because its any kind of duty only because i like you for reasons and standards of my own i could die for you but i couldnt and wouldnt live for you howard what were the reasons and standards roark looked at him and realized that he had said all the things he had tried not to say to wynand he answered that you werent born to be a secondhander wynand smiled he heard the sentence and nothing else afterward when wynand had gone below to his cabin roark remained alone on deck he stood at the rail staring out at the ocean at nothing he thought i havent mentioned to him the worst secondhander of all the man who goes after power it was april when roark and wynand returned to the city the skyscrapers looked pink against the blue sky an incongruous shade of porcelain on masses of stone there were small tufts of green on the trees in the streets roark went to his office his staff shook hands with him and he saw the strain of smiles selfconsciously repressed until a young boy burst out what the hell why cant we say how glad we are to see you back boss roark laughed go ahead i cant tell you how damn glad i am to be back then he sat on a table in the drafting room while they all reported to him on the past three months interrupting one another he played with a ruler in his hands not noticing it like a man with the feel of his farms soil under his fingers after an absence in the afternoon alone at his desk he opened a newspaper he had not seen a newspaper for three months he noticed an item about the construction of cortlandt homes he saw the line peter keating architect gordon l prescott and augustus webb associate designers he sat very still that evening he went to see cortlandt the first building was almost completed it stood alone on the large empty tract the workers had left for the day a small light showed in the shack of the night watchman the building had the skeleton of what roark had designed with the remnants of ten different breeds piled on the lovely symmetry of the bones he saw the economy of plan preserved but the expense of incomprehensible features added the variety of modeled masses gone replaced by the monotony of brutish cubes a new wing added with a vaulted roof bulging out of a wall like a tumor containing a gymnasium strings of balconies added made of metal stripes painted a violent blue comer windows without purpose an angle cut off for a useless door with a round metal awning supported by a pole like a haberdashery in the broadway district three vertical bands of brick leading from nowhere to nowhere the general style of what the profession called bronx modern a panel of basrelief over the main entrance representing a mass of muscle which could be discerned as either three or four bodies one of them with an arm raised holding a screwdriver there were white crosses on the fresh panes of glass in the windows and it looked appropriate like an error xed out of existence there was a band of red in the sky to the west beyond manhattan and the buildings of the city rose straight and black against it roark stood across the space of the future road before the first house of cortlandt he stood straight the muscles of his throat pulled his wrists held down and away from his body as he would have stood before a firing squad no one could tell how it had happened there had been no deliberate intention behind it it had just happened first toohey told keating one morning that gordon l prescott and gus webb would be put on the payroll as associate designers what do you care peter it wont come out of your fee it wont cut your prestige at all since youre the big boss they wont be much more than your draftsmen all i want is to give the boys a boost it will help their reputation to be tagged with this project in some way im very interested in building up their reputation but what for theres nothing for them to do its all done oh any kind of lastminute drafting save time for your own staff you can share the expense with them dont be a hog toohey had told the truth he had no other purpose in mind keating could not discover what connections prescott and webb possessed with whom in what office on what terms among the dozens of officials involved in the project the entanglement of responsibility was such that no one could be quite certain of anyones authority it was clear only that prescott and webb had friends and that keating could not keep them off the job the changes began with the gymnasium the lady in charge of tenant selection demanded a gymnasium she was a social worker and her task was to end with the opening of the project she acquired a permanent job by getting herself appointed director of social recreation for cortlandt no gymnasium had been provided in the original plans there were two schools and a ymca within walking distance she declared that this was an outrage against the children of the poor prescott and webb supplied the gymnasium other changes followed of a purely esthetic nature extras piled on the cost of construction so carefully devised for economy the director of social recreation departed for washington to discuss the matter of a little theater and a meeting hall she wished added to the next two buildings of cortlandt the changes in the drawings came gradually a few at a time the others okaying the changes came from headquarters but were ready to start cried keating what the hell drawled gus webb set em back just a coupla thousand bucks more thats all now as to the balconies said gordon l prescott they lend a certain modern style you dont want the damn thing to look so bare its depressing besides you dont understand psychology the people wholl live here are used to sitting out on fireescapes they love it theyll miss it you gotta give em a place to sit on in the fresh air the cost hell if youre so damn worried about the cost ive got an idea where we can save plenty well do without closet doors what do they need doors for on closets its oldfashioned all the closet doors were omitted keating fought it was the kind of battle he had never entered but he tried everything possible to him to the honest limit of his exhausted strength he went from office to office arguing threatening pleading but he had no influence while his associate designers seemed to control an underground river with interlocking tributaries the officials shrugged and referred him to someone else no one cared about an issue of esthetics whats the difference it doesnt come out of your pocket does it who are you to have it all your way let the boys contribute something he appealed to ellsworth toohey but toohey was not interested he was busy with other matters and he had no desire to provoke a bureaucratic quarrel in all truth he had not prompted his protégés to their artistic endeavor but he saw no reason for attempting to stop them he was amused by the whole thing but its awful ellsworth you know its awful oh i suppose so what do you care peter your poor but unwashed tenants wont be able to appreciate the finer points of architectural art see that the plumbing works but what for what for what for keating cried to his associate designers well why shouldnt we have any say at all asked gordon l prescott we want to express our individuality too when keating invoked his contract he was told all right go ahead try to sue the government try it at times he felt a desire to kill there was no one to kill had he been granted the privilege he could not have chosen a victim nobody was responsible there was no purpose and no cause it had just happened keating came to roarks house on the evening after roarks return he had not been summoned roark opened the door and said good evening peter but keating could not answer they walked silently into the work room roark sat down but keating remained standing in the middle of the floor and asked his voice dull what are you going to do you must leave that up to me now i couldnt help it howard i couldnt help it i suppose not what can you do now you cant sue the government no keating thought that he should sit down but the distance to a chair seemed too great he felt he would be too conspicuous if he moved what are you going to do to me howard nothing want me to confess the truth to them to everybody no after a while keating whispered will you let me give you the fee everything and roark smiled im sorry keating whispered looking away he waited and then the plea he knew he must not utter came out as im scared howard roark shook his head whatever i do it wont be to hurt you peter im guilty too we both are youre guilty its i whove destroyed you peter from the beginning by helping you there are matters in which one must not ask for help nor give it i shouldnt have done your projects at stanton i shouldnt have done the cosmoslotnick building nor cortlandt i loaded you with more than you could carry its like an electric current too strong for the circuit it blows the fuse now well both pay for it it will be hard on you but it will be harder on me youd rather i went home now howard yes at the door keating said howard they didnt do it on purpose thats what makes it worse dominique heard the sound of the car rising up the hill road she thought it was wynand coming home he had worked late in the city every night of the two weeks since his return the motor filled the spring silence of the countryside there was no sound in the house only the small rustle of her hair as she leaned her head back against a chair cushion in a moment she was not conscious of hearing the cars approach it was so familiar at this hour part of the loneliness and privacy outside she heard the car stop at the door the door was never locked there were no neighbors or guests to expect she heard the door opening and steps in the hall downstairs the steps did not pause but walked with familiar certainty up the stairs a hand turned the knob of her door it was roark she thought while she was rising to her feet that he had never entered her room before but he knew every part of this house as he knew everything about her body she felt no moment of shock only the memory of one a shock in the past tense the thought i must have been shocked when i saw him but not now now by the time she was standing before him it seemed very simple she thought the most important never has to be said between us it has always been said like this he did not want to see me alone now hes here i waited and im ready good evening dominique she heard the name pronounced to fill the space of five years she said quietly good evening roark i want you to help me she was standing on the station platform of clayton ohio on the witness stand of the stoddard trial on the ledge of a quarry to let herself as she had been then share this sentence she heard now yes roark he walked across the room he had designed for her he sat down facing her the width of the room between them she found herself seated too not conscious of her own movements only of his as if his body contained two sets of nerves his own and hers next monday night dominique exactly at eleventhirty i want you to drive up to the site of cortlandt homes she noticed that she was conscious of her eyelids not painfully but just conscious as if they had tightened and would not move again she had seen the first building of cortlandt she knew what she was about to hear you must be alone in your car and you must be on your way home from some place where you had an appointment to visit made in advance a place that can be reached from here only by driving past cortlandt you must be able to prove that afterward i want your car to run out of gas in front of cortlandt at eleventhirty honk your horn theres an old night watchman there he will come out ask him to help you and send him to the nearest garage which is a mile away she said steadily yes roark when hes gone get out of your car theres a big stretch of vacant land by the road across from the building and a kind of trench beyond walk to that trench as fast as you can get to the bottom and lie down on the ground lie flat after a while you can come back to the car you will know when to come back see that youre found in the car and that your condition matches its condition approximately yes roark have you understood yes everything yes everything they were standing she saw only his eyes and that he was smiling she heard him say good night dominique he walked out and she heard his car driving away she thought of his smile she knew that he did not need her help for the thing he was going to do he could find other means to get rid of the watchman that he had let her have a part in this because she would not survive what was to follow if he hadnt that this had been the test he had not wanted to name it he had wanted her to understand and show no fear she had not been able to accept the stoddard trial she had run from the dread of seeing him hurt by the world but she had agreed to help him in this had agreed in complete serenity she was free and he knew it the road ran flat across the dark stretches of long island but dominique felt as if she were driving uphill that was the only abnormal sensation the sensation of rising as if her car were speeding vertically she kept her eyes on the road but the dashboard on the rim of her vision looked like the panel of an airplane the clock on the dashboard said she was amused thinking ive never learned to fly a plane and now i know how it feels just like this the unobstructed space and no effort and no weight thats supposed to happen in the stratosphere or is it the interplanetary space where one begins to float and theres no law of gravity no law of any kind of gravity at all she heard herself laughing aloud just the sense of rising otherwise she felt normal she had never driven a car so well she thought its a dry mechanical job to drive a car so i know im very clearheaded because driving seemed easy like breathing or swallowing an immediate function requiring no attention she stopped for red lights that hung in the air over crossings of anonymous streets in unknown suburbs she turned corners she passed other cars and she was certain that no accident could happen to her tonight her car was directed by remote control one of those automatic rays shed read about was it a beacon or a radio beam and she only sat at the wheel it left her free to be conscious of nothing but small matters and to feel careless and unserious she thought so completely unserious it was a kind of clarity being more normal than normal as crystal is more transparent than empty air just small matters the thin silk of her short black dress and the way it was pulled over her knee the flexing of her toes inside her pump when she moved her foot dannys diner in gold letters on a dark window that flashed past she had been very gay at the dinner given by the wife of some banker important friends of gails whose names she could not quite remember now it had been a wonderful dinner in a huge long island mansion they had been so glad to see her and so sorry that gail could not come she had eaten everything she had seen placed before her she had had a splendid appetite as on rare occasions of her childhood when she came running home after a day spent in the woods and her mother was so pleased because her mother was afraid that she might grow up to be anemic she had entertained the guests at the dinner table with stories of her childhood she had made them laugh and it had been the gayest dinner party her hosts could remember afterward in the drawing room with the windows open wide to a dark sky a moonless sky that stretched out beyond the trees beyond the towns all the way to the banks of the east river she had laughed and talked she had smiled at the people around her with a warmth that made them all speak freely of the things dearest to them she had loved those people and they had known they were loved she had loved every person anywhere on earth and some woman had said dominique i didnt know you could be so wonderful and she had answered i havent a care in the world but she had really noticed nothing except the watch on her wrist and that she must be out of that house by she had no idea of what she would say to take her leave but by it had been said correctly and convincingly and by her foot was on the accelerator it was a closed roadster black with red leather upholstery she thought how nicely john the chauffeur had kept that red leather polished there would be nothing left of the car and it was proper that it should look its best for its last ride like a woman on her first night i never dressed for my first night i had no first night only something ripped off me and the taste of quarry dust in my teeth when she saw black vertical strips with dots of light filling the glass of the cars side window she wondered what had happened to the glass then she realized that she was driving along the east river and that this was new york on the other side she laughed and thought no this is not new york this is a private picture pasted to the window of my car all of it here on one small pane under my hand i own it its mine now she ran one hand across the buildings from the battery to queensboro bridge roark its mine and im giving it to you the figure of the night watchman was now fifteen inches tall in the distance when it gets to be ten inches ill start thought dominique she stood by the side of her car and wished the watchman would walk faster the building was a black mass that propped the sky in one spot the rest of the sky sagged intimately low over a flat stretch of ground the closest streets and houses were years away far on the rim of space irregular little dents like the teeth of a broken saw she felt a large pebble under the sole of her pump it was uncomfortable but she would not move her foot it would make a sound she was not alone she knew that he was somewhere in that building the width of a street away from her there was no sound and no light in the building only white crosses on black windows he would need no light he knew every hall every stairwell the watchman had shrunk away she jerked the door of her car open she threw her hat and bag inside and flung the door shut she heard the slam of sound when she was across the road running over the empty tract away from the building she felt the silk of her dress clinging to her legs and it served as a tangible purpose of flight to push against that to tear past that barrier as fast as she could there were pits and dry stubble on the ground she fell once but she noticed it only when she was running again she saw the trench in the darkness then she was on her knees at the bottom and then stretched flat on her stomach face down her mouth pressed to the earth she felt the pounding of her thighs and she twisted her body once in a long convulsion to feel the earth with her legs her breasts the skin of her arms it was like lying in roarks bed the sound was the crack of a fist on the back of her head she felt the thrust of the earth against her flinging her up to her feet to the edge of the trench the upper part of the cortlandt building had tilted and hung still while a broken streak of sky grew slowly across it as if the sky were slicing the building in half then the streak became turquoise blue light then there was no upper part but only window frames and girders flying through the air the building spreading over the sky a long thin tongue of red shooting from the center another blow of a fist and then another a blinding flash and the glass panes of the skyscrapers across the river glittering like spangles she did not remember that he had ordered her to lie flat that she was standing that glass and twisted iron were raining around her in the flash when walls rose outward and a building opened like a sunburst she thought of him there somewhere beyond the builder who had to destroy who knew every crucial point of that structure who had made the delicate balance of stress and support she thought of him selecting these key spots placing the blast a doctor turned murderer expertly cracking heart brain and lungs at once he was there he saw it and what it did to him was worse than what it did to the building but he was there and he welcomed it she saw the city enveloped in light for half a second she could see window ledges and cornices miles away she thought of dark rooms and ceilings licked by this fire she saw the peaks of towers lighted against the sky her city now and his roark she screamed roark roark she did not know she screamed she could not hear her voice in the blast then she was running across the field to the smoking ruin running over broken glass planting her feet down full with each step because she enjoyed the pain there was no pain left ever to be felt by her again a spread of dust stood over the field like an awning she heard the shriek of sirens starting far away it was still a car though the rear wheels were crushed under a piece of furnace machinery and an elevator door lay over the hood she crawled to the seat she had to look as if she had not moved from here she gathered handfuls of glass off the floor and poured it over her lap over her hair she took a sharp splinter and slashed the skin of her neck her legs her arms what she felt was not pain she saw blood shooting out of her arm running down on her lap soaking the black silk trickling between her thighs her head fell back mouth open panting she did not want to stop she was free she was invulnerable she did not know she had cut an artery she felt so light she was laughing at the law of gravity when she was found by the men of the first police car to reach the scene she was unconscious a few minutes worth of life left in her body dominique glanced about the bedroom of the penthouse it was her first contact with surroundings she was ready to recognize she knew she had been brought here after many days in a hospital the bedroom seemed lacquered with light its that clarity of crystal over everything she thought that has remained it will remain forever she saw wynand standing by her bed he was watching her he looked amused she remembered seeing him at the hospital he had not looked amused then she knew the doctor had told him she would not survive that first night she had wanted to tell them all that she would that she had no choice now but to live only it did not seem important to tell people anything ever now she was back she could feel bandages on her throat her legs her left arm but her hands lay before her on the blanket and the gauze had been removed there were only a few thin red scars left you blasted little fool said wynand happily why did you have to make such a good job of it lying on the white pillow with her smooth gold hair and a white highnecked hospital gown she looked younger than she had ever looked as a child she had the quiet radiance presumed and never found in childhood the full consciousness of certainty of innocence of peace i ran out of gas she said and i was waiting there in my car when suddenly ive already told that story to the police so has the night watchman but didnt you know that glass must be handled with discretion gail looks rested she thought and very confident it has changed everything for him too in the same way it didnt hurt she said next time you want to play the innocent bystander let me coach you they believe it though dont they oh yes they believe it they have to you almost died i dont see why he had to save the watchmans life and almost take yours who howard my dear howard roark what has he to do with it darling youre not being questioned by the police you will be though and youll have to be more convincing than that however im sure youll succeed they wont think of the stoddard trial oh you did it then and youll always do it whatever you think of him youll always feel what i feel about his work gail youre glad i did it yes she saw him looking down at her hand that lay on the edge of the bed then he was on his knees his lips pressed to her hand not raising it not touching it with his fingers only with his mouth that was the sole confession he would permit himself of what her days in the hospital had cost him she lifted her other hand and moved it over his hair she thought it will be worse for you than if i had died gail but it will be all right it wont hurt you theres no pain left in the world nothing to compare with the fact that we exist he you and i youve understood all that matters though you dont know youve lost me he lifted his head and got up i didnt intend to reproach you in any way forgive me i wont die gail i feel wonderful you look it have they arrested him hes out on bail youre happy im glad you did it and that it was for him im glad he did it he had to yes and it will be the stoddard trial again not quite youve wanted another chance gail all these years yes may i see the papers no not until youre up not even the banner particularly not the banner i love you gail if you stick to the end dont offer me any bribes this is not between you and me not even between him and me but between you and god if you want to call it that but we wont discuss it not until after its over you have a visitor waiting for you downstairs hes been here every day who your lover howard roark want to let him thank you now the gay mockery the tone of uttering the most preposterous thing he could think of told her how far he was from guessing the rest she said yes i want to see him gail if i decide to make him my lover ill kill you both now dont move lie flat the doctor said you must take it easy youve got twentysix assorted stitches all over you he walked out and she heard him descending the stairs when the first policeman had reached the scene of the explosion he had found behind the building on the shore of the river the plunger that had set off the dynamite roark stood by the plunger his hands in his pockets looking at the remnants of cortlandt what do you know about this buddy the policeman asked youd better arrest me said roark ill talk at the trial he had not added another word in reply to all the official questions that followed it was wynand who got him released on bail in the early hours of the morning wynand had been calm at the emergency hospital where he had seen dominiques wounds and had been told she would not live he had been calm while he telephoned got a county judge out of bed and arranged roarks bail but when he stood in the wardens office of a small county jail he began to shake suddenly you bloody fools he said through his teeth and there followed every obscenity he had learned on the waterfront he forgot all the aspects of the situation save one roark being held behind bars he was stretch wynand of hells kitchen again and this was the kind of fury that had shattered him in sudden flashes in those days the fury he had felt when standing behind a crumbling wall waiting to be killed only now he knew that he was also gail wynand the owner of an empire and he couldnt understand why some sort of legal procedure was necessary why he didnt smash this jail with his fists or through his papers it was all one to him at the moment he wanted to kill he had to kill as that night behind the wall in defense of his life he managed to sign papers he managed to wait until roark was brought out to him they walked out together roark leading him by the wrist and by the time they reached the car wynand was calm in the car wynand asked you did it of course of course well fight it out together if you want to make it your battle at the present estimate my personal fortune amounts to forty million dollars that should be enough to hire any lawyer you wish or the whole profession i wont use a lawyer howard youre not going to submit photographs again no not this time roark entered the bedroom and sat down on a chair by the bed dominique lay still looking at him they smiled at each other nothing has to be said not this time either she thought she asked you were in jail for a few hours what was it like dont start acting about it as gail did gail took it very badly very i wont i might have to go back to a cell for years you knew that when you agreed to help me yes i knew that im counting on you to save gail if i go counting on me he looked at her and shook his head dearest it sounded like a reproach yes she whispered dont you know by now that it was a trap i set for you how what would you do if i hadnt asked you to help me id be with you in your apartment at the enright house right now publicly and openly yes but now you cant youre mrs gail wynand youre above suspicion and everyone believes you were at the scene by accident just let it be known what we are to each other and it will be a confession that i did it i see i want you to keep quiet if you had any thoughts of wanting to share my fate drop them i wont tell you what i intend to do because thats the only way i have of controlling you until the trial dominique if im convicted i want you to remain with gail im counting on that i want you to remain with him and never tell him about us because he and you will need each other and if youre acquitted then he glanced about the room wynands bedroom i dont want to say it here but you know it you love him very much yes enough to sacrifice he smiled youve been afraid of that ever since i came here for the first time yes he looked straight at her did you think that possible no not my work nor you dominique not ever but i can do this much for him i can leave it to him if i have to go youll be acquitted thats not what i want to hear you say if they convict you if they lock you in jail or put you in a chain gang if they smear your name in every filthy headline if they never let you design another building if they never let me see you again it will not matter not too much only down to a certain point thats what ive waited to hear for seven years dominique he took her hand he raised it and held it to his lips and she felt his lips where wynands had been then he got up ill wait she said ill keep quiet i wont come near you i promise he smiled and nodded then he left it happens upon rare occasions that world forces too great to comprehend become focused in a single event like rays gathered by a lens to one point of superlative brightness for all of us to see such an event is the outrage of cortlandt here in a microcosm we can observe the evil that has crushed our poor planet from the day of its birth in cosmic ooze one mans ego against all the concepts of mercy humanity and brotherhood one man destroying the future home of the disinherited one man condemning thousands to the horror of the slums to filth disease and death when an awakening society with a new sense of humanitarian duty made a mighty effort to rescue the underprivileged when the best talents of society united to create a decent home for them the egotism of one man blew the achievement of others to pieces and for what for some vague matter of personal vanity for some empty conceit i regret that the laws of our state allow nothing more than a prison sentence for this crime that man should forfeit his life society needs the right to rid itself of men such as howard roark thus spoke ellsworth m toohey in the pages of the new frontiers echoes answered him from all over the country the explosion of cortlandt had lasted half a minute the explosion of public fury went on and on with a cloud of powdered plaster filling the air with rust and refuse raining out of the cloud roark had been indicted by a grand jury had pleaded not guilty and had refused to make any other statement he had been released on a bond furnished by gail wynand and he awaited trial there were many speculations on his motive some said it was professional jealousy others declared that there was a certain similarity between the design of cortlandt and roarks style of building that keating prescott and webb might have borrowed a little from roark a legitimate adaptation theres no property rights on ideas in a democracy art belongs to all the people and that roark had been prompted by the vengeance lust of an artist who had believed himself plagiarized none of it was too clear but nobody cared too much about the motive the issue was simple one man against many he had no right to a motive a home built in charity for the poor built upon ten thousand years in which men had been taught that charity and selfsacrifice are an absolute not to be questioned the touchstone of virtue the ultimate ideal ten thousand years of voices speaking of service and sacrifice sacrifice is the prime rule of life serve or be served crush or get crushed sacrifice is noble make what you can of it at the one end or the other serve and sacrifice serve and serve and serve against that one man who wished neither to serve nor to rule and had thereby committed the only unforgivable crime it was a sensational scandal and there was the usual noise and the usual lust of righteous anger such as is proper to all lynchings but there was a fierce personal quality in the indignation of every person who spoke about it hes just an egomaniac devoid of all moral sense said the society woman dressing for a charity bazaar who dared not contemplate what means of selfexpression would be left to her and how she could impose her ostentation on her friends if charity were not the allexcusing virtue said the social worker who had found no aim in life and could generate no aim from within the sterility of his soul but basked in virtue and held an unearned respect from all by grace of his fingers on the wounds of others said the novelist who had nothing to say if the subject of service and sacrifice were to be taken away from him who sobbed in the hearing of attentive thousands that he loved them and loved them and would they please love him a little in return said the lady columnist who had just bought a country mansion because she wrote so tenderly about the little people said all the little people who wanted to hear of love the great love the unfastidious love the love that embraced everything forgave everything and permitted them everything said every secondhander who could not exist except as a leech on the souls of others ellsworth toohey sat back watched listened and smiled gordon l prescott and gus webb were entertained at dinners and cocktail parties they were treated with tender curious solicitude like survivors of disaster they said that they could not understand what possible motive roark could have had and they demanded justice peter keating went nowhere he refused to see the press he refused to see anyone but he issued a written statement that he believed roark was not guilty his statement contained one curious sentence the last it said leave him alone please cant you leave him alone pickets from the council of american builders paced in front of the cord building it served no purpose because there was no work in roarks office the commissions he was to start had been canceled this was solidarity the debutante having her toenails pedicured the housewife buying carrots from a pushcart the bookkeeper who had wanted to be a pianist but had the excuse of a sister to support the businessman who hated his business the worker who hated his work the intellectual who hated everybody all were united as brothers in the luxury of common anger that cured boredom and took them out of themselves and they knew well enough what a blessing it was to be taken out of themselves the readers were unanimous the press was unanimous gail wynand went against the current gail alvah scarret had gasped we cant defend a dynamiter keep still alvah wynand had said before i bash your teeth in gail wynand stood alone in the middle of his office his head thrown back glad to be living as he had stood on a wharf on a dark night facing the lights of a city in the filthy howling now going on all around us said an editorial in the banner signed gail wynand in big letters nobody seems to remember that howard roark surrendered himself of his own free will if he blew up that building did he have to remain at the scene to be arrested but we dont wait to discover his reasons we have convicted him without a hearing we want him to be guilty we are delighted with this case what you hear is not indignation its gloating any illiterate maniac any worthless moron who commits some revolting murder gets shrieks of sympathy from us and marshals an army of humanitarian defenders but a man of genius is guilty by definition granted that it is vicious injustice to condemn a man simply because he is weak and small to what level of depravity has a society descended when it condemns a man simply because he is strong and great such however is the whole moral atmosphere of our century the century of the secondrater we hear it shouted said another wynand editorial that howard roark spends his career in and out of courtrooms well that is true a man like roark is on trial before society all his life whom does that indict roark or society we have never made an effort to understand what is greatness in man and how to recognize it said another wynand editorial we have come to hold in a kind of mawkish stupor that greatness is to be gauged by selfsacrifice selfsacrifice we drool is the ultimate virtue lets stop and think for a moment is sacrifice a virtue can a man sacrifice his integrity his honor his freedom his ideal his convictions the honesty of his feelings the independence of his thought but these are a mans supreme possessions anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain they however are above sacrificing to any cause or consideration whatsoever should we not then stop preaching dangerous and vicious nonsense selfsacrifice but it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed it is the unsacrificed self that we must respect in man above all this editorial was quoted in the new frontiers and in many newspapers reprinted in a box under the heading look whos talking gail wynand laughed resistance fed him and made him stronger this was a war and he had not engaged in a real war for years not since the time when he laid the foundations of his empire amid cries of protest from the whole profession he was granted the impossible the dream of every man the chance and intensity of youth to be used with the wisdom of experience a new beginning and a climax together i have waited and lived he thought for this his twentytwo newspapers his magazines his newsreels were given the order defend roark sell roark to the public stem the lynching whatever the facts wynand explained to his staff this is not going to be a trial by facts its a trial by public opinion weve always made public opinion lets make it sell roark i dont care how you do it ive trained you youre experts at selling now show me how good you are he was greeted by silence and his employees glanced at one another alvah scarret mopped his forehead but they obeyed the banner printed a picture of the enright house with the caption is this the man you want to destroy a picture of wynands home match this if you can a picture of monadnock valley is this the man who has contributed nothing to society the banner ran roarks biography under the byline of a writer nobody had ever heard of it was written by gail wynand the banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men had been convicted by the majority prejudice of the moment the banner ran articles on man martyred by society socrates galileo pasteur the thinkers the scientists a long heroic line each a man who stood alone the man who defied men but gail for gods sake gail it was a housing project wailed alvah scarret wynand looked at him helplessly i suppose its impossible to make you fools understand that that has nothing to do with it all right well talk about housing projects the banner ran an expose on the housing racket the graft the incompetence the structures erected at five times the cost a private builder would have needed the settlements built and abandoned the horrible performance accepted admired forgiven protected by the sacred cow of altruism hell is said to be paved with good intentions said the banner could it be because weve never learned to distinguish what intentions constitute the good is it not time to learn never have there been so many good intentions so loudly proclaimed in the world and look at it the banner editorials were written by gail wynand as he stood at a table in the composing room written as always on a huge piece of print stock with a blue pencil in letters an inch high he slammed the g w at the end and the famous initials had never carried such an air of reckless pride dominique had recovered and returned to their country house wynand drove home late in the evening he brought roark along as often as he could they sat together in the living room with the windows open to the spring night the dark stretches of the hill rolled gently down to the lake from under the walls of the house and the lake glittered through the trees far below they did not talk of the case or of the coming trial but wynand spoke of his crusade impersonally almost as if it did not concern roark at all wynand stood in the middle of the room saying all right it was contemptible the whole career of the banner but this will vindicate everything dominique i know youve never been able to understand why ive felt no shame in my past why i love the banner now youll see the answer power i hold a power ive never tested now youll see the test theyll think what i want them to think theyll do as i say because it is my city and i do run things around here howard by the time you come to trial ill have them all twisted in such a way there wont be a jury wholl dare convict you he could not sleep at night he felt no desire to sleep go on to bed he would say to roark and dominique ill come up in a few minutes then dominique from the bedroom roark from the guest room across the hall would hear wynands steps pacing the terrace for hours a kind of joyous restlessness in the sound each step like a sentence anchored a statement pounded into the floor once when wynand dismissed them late at night roark and dominique went up the stairs together and stopped on the first landing they heard the violent snap of a match in the living room below a sound that carried the picture of a hand jerked recklessly lighting the first of the cigarettes that would last till dawn a small dot of fire crossing and recrossing the terrace to the pounding of steps they looked down the stairs and then looked at each other its horrible said dominique its great said roark he cant help you no matter what he does i know he cant thats not the point hes risking everything he has to save you he doesnt know hell lose me if youre saved dominique which will be worse for him to lose you or to lose his crusade she nodded understanding he added you know that its not me he wants to save im only the excuse she lifted her hand she touched his cheekbone a faint pressure of her fingertips she could allow herself nothing else she turned and went on to her bedroom and heard him closing the guestroom door is it not appropriate wrote lancelot clokey in a syndicated article that howard roark is being defended by the wynand papers if anyone doubts the moral issues involved in this appalling case here is the proof of whats what and who stands where the wynand papers that stronghold of yellow journalism vulgarity corruption and muckraking that organized insult to public taste and decency that intellectual underworld ruled by a man who has less conception of principles than a cannibal the wynand papers are the proper champions of howard roark and howard roark is their rightful hero after a lifetime devoted to blasting the integrity of the press it is only fit that gail wynand should now support a cruder fellow dynamiter all this fancy talk going round said gus webb in a public speech is a lot of bull heres the plain dope that guy wynands salted away plenty and i mean plenty by skinning suckers in the realestate racket all these years does he like it when the government muscles in and shoves him out sos the little fellows can get a clean roof over their heads and a modern john for their kids you bet your boots he dont like it not one bit its a putup job between the two of them wynand and that redheaded boy friend of his and if you ask me the boy friend got a good hunk of cash out of mr wynand for pulling the job we have it from an unimpeachable source wrote a radical newspaper that cortlandt was only the first step in a gigantic plot to blow up every housing project every public power plant post office and schoolhouse in the usa the conspiracy is headed by gail wynand as we can see and by other bloated capitalists of his kind including some of our biggest moneybags too little attention has been paid to the feminine angle of this case wrote sally brent in the new frontiers the part played by mrs gail wynand is certainly highly dubious to say the least isnt it just the cutest coincidence that it was mrs wynand who just so conveniently sent the watchman away at just the right time and that her husband is now raising the roof to defend mr roark if we werent blinded by a stupid senseless oldfashioned sense of gallantry where a socalled beautiful woman is concerned we wouldnt allow that part of the case to be hushed up if we werent overawed by mrs wynands social position and the socalled prestige of her husband whos making an utter fool of himself wed ask a few question about the story that she almost lost her life in the disaster how do we know she did doctors can be bought just like anybody else and mr gail wynand is an expert in such matters if we consider all this we might well see the outlines of something that looks like a most revolting design for living the position taken by the wynand press wrote a quiet conservative newspaper is inexplicable and disgraceful the circulation of the banner dropped week by week the speed accelerating in the descent like an elevator out of control stickers and buttons inscribed we dont read wynand grew on walls subway posts windshields and coat lapels wynand newsreels were booed off the theater screens the banner vanished from corner newsstands the news vendors had to carry it but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly only upon request the ground had been prepared the pillars eaten through long ago the cortlandt case provided the final impact roark was almost forgotten in the storm of indignation against gail wynand the angriest protests came from wynands own public from the womens clubs the ministers the mothers the small shopkeepers alvah scarret had to be kept away from the room where hampers of letters to the editor were being filled each day he started by reading the letters and his friends on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience fearing a stroke the staff of the banner worked in silence there were no furtive glances no whispered cuss words no gossip in washrooms any longer a few men resigned the rest worked on slowly heavily in the manner of men with life belts buckled waiting for the inevitable gail wynand noticed a kind of lingering tempo in every action around him when he entered the banner building his employees stopped at sight of him when he nodded to them their greeting came a second too late when he walked on and turned he found them staring after him the yes mr wynand that had always answered his orders without a moments cut between the last syllable of his voice and the first letter of the answer now came late and the pause had a tangible shape so that the answer sounded like a sentence not followed but preceded by a question mark one small voice kept silent about the cortlandt case wynand had summoned toohey to his office the day after the explosion and had said listen you not a word in your column understand what you do or yell outside is none of my business for the time being but if you yell too much ill take care of you when this is over yes mr wynand as far as your column is concerned youre deaf dumb and blind youve never heard of any explosion youve never heard of anyone named roark you dont know what the word cortlandt means so long as youre in this building yes mr wynand and dont let me see too much of you around here yes mr wynand wynands lawyer an old friend who had served him for years tried to stop him gail whats the matter youre acting like a child like a green amateur pull yourself together man shut up said wynand gail you are you were the greatest newspaperman on earth do i have to tell you the obvious an unpopular cause is a dangerous business for anyone for a popular newspaper its suicide if you dont shut your mouth ill send you packing and get myself another shyster wynand began to argue about the case with the prominent men he met at business luncheons and dinners he had never argued before on any subject he had never pleaded he had merely tossed final statements to respectful listeners now he found no listeners he found no indifferent silence half boredom half resentment the men who had gathered every word he cared to drop about the stock market real estate advertising politics had no interest in his opinion on art greatness and abstract justice he heard a few answers yes gail yes sure but on the other hand i think it was damn selfish of the man and thats the trouble with the world today selfishness too much selfishness everywhere thats what lancelot clokey said in his book swell book all about his childhood you read it saw your picture with clokey clokeys been all over the world he knows what hes talking about yes gail but arent you kind of oldfashioned about it whats all that great man stuff whats great about a glorified bricklayer whos great anyway were all just a lot of glands and chemicals and whatever we ate for breakfast i think lois cook explained it very well in that beautiful little whats its name yes the gallant gallstone yes sir your own banner plugged like blazes for that little book but look gail he shouldve thought of other people before he thought of himself i think if a mans got no love in his heart he cant be much good i heard that in a play last night that was a grand play the new one by ike what the hells his last name you ought to see it your own jules fougler said its a brave and tender stage poem you make out a good case gail and i wouldnt know what to say against it i dont know where youre wrong but it doesnt sound right to me because ellsworth toohey now dont misunderstand me i dont agree with tooheys political views at all i know hes a radical but on the other hand youve got to admit that hes a great idealist with a heart as big as a house well ellsworth toohey said these were the millionaires the bankers the industrialists the businessmen who could not understand why the world was going to hell as they moaned in all their luncheon speeches one morning when wynand stepped out of his car in front of the banner building a woman rushed up to him as he crossed the sidewalk she had been waiting by the entrance she was fat and middleaged she wore a filthy cotton dress and a crushed hat she had a pasty sagging face a shapeless mouth and black round brilliant eyes she stood before gail wynand and she flung a bunch of rotted beet leaves at his face there were no beets just the leaves soft and slimy tied with a string they hit his cheek and rolled down to the sidewalk wynand stood still he looked at the woman he saw the white flesh the mouth hanging open in triumphs the face of selfrighteous evil passersby had seized the woman and she was screaming unspeakable obscenities wynand raised his hand shook his head gesturing for them to let the creature go and walked into the banner building a smear of greenishyellow across his cheek ellsworth what are we going to do moaned alvah scarret what are we going to do ellsworth toohey sat perched on the edge of his desk and smiled as if he wished he could kiss alvah scarret why dont they drop the damn thing ellsworth why doesnt something break to take it off the front pages couldnt we scare up an international situation or something in all my born days ive never seen people go so wild over so little a dynamiting job christ ellsworth its a backpage story we get them every month practically with every strike remember the furriers strike the dry cleaners strike oh what the hell why all this fury who cares why do they care there are occasions alvah when the issues at stake are not the ostensible facts at all and the public reaction seems out of all proportion but isnt you shouldnt be so glum about it im surprised at you you should be thanking your stars

blasted it when it was full of people a few children blown to pieces then youd have something then id love it the movement could use it but this hell theyll send the fool to the clink and thats that

said its kind of you mr toohey said mrs keating humbly im glad you came i dont know what to do with petey he wont see anyone he wont go to his office im scared mr toohey forgive me i mustnt whine maybe you can help pull him out of it he thinks so much of you mr toohey yes im sure where is he right here in his room this way mr toohey the visit was unexpected toohey had not been here for years mrs keating felt very grateful she led the way down the hall and opened a door without knocking afraid to announce the visitor afraid of her sons refusal she said brightly look petey look what a guest i have for you keating lifted his head he sat at a littered table bent under a squat lamp that gave a poor light he was doing a crossword puzzle torn out of a newspaper there was a full glass on the table with a dried red rim that had been tomato juice a box containing a jigsaw puzzle a deck of cards a bible hello ellsworth he said smiling he leaned forward to rise but forgot the effort halfway mrs keating saw the smile and stepped out hastily relieved closing the door the smile went not quite completed it had been an instinct of memory then he remembered many things which he had tried not to understand hello ellsworth he repeated helplessly toohey stood before him examining the room the table with curiosity touching peter he said very touching im sure hed appreciate it if he saw it who not very talkative these days are you peter not very sociable i wanted to see you ellsworth i wanted to talk to you toohey grasped a chair by the back swung it through the air in a broad circle like a flourish planted it by the table and sat down well thats what i came here for he said to hear you talk keating said nothing well you mustnt think i didnt want to see you ellsworth it was only what i told mother about not letting anyone in it was on account of the newspaper people they wont leave me alone my how times change peter i remember when one couldnt keep you away from newspaper people ellsworth i havent any sense of humor left not any at all thats lucky or youd die laughing im so tired ellsworth im glad you came the light glanced off tooheys glasses and keating could not see his eyes only two circles filled with a metallic smear like the dead headlights of a car reflecting the approach of something from a distance think you can get away with it asked toohey with what the hermit act the great penance the loyal silence ellsworth whats the matter with you so hes not guilty is he so you want us to please leave him alone do you keatings shoulders moved more an intention than the reality of sitting up straight but still an intention and his jaw moved enough to ask what do you want the whole story what for want me to make it easier for you want a good excuse peter i could you know i could give you thirtythree reasons all noble and youd swallow any one of them but i dont feel like making it easier for you so ill just tell you the truth to send him to the penitentiary your hero your idol your generous friend your guardian angel i have nothing to tell you ellsworth while youre being shocked out of the last of your wits youd better hang on to enough to realize that youre no match for me youll talk if i want you to talk and i dont feel like wasting time who designed cortlandt i did do you know that im an architectural expert i designed cortlandt like the cosmoslotnick building what do you want from me i want you on the witness stand petey i want you to tell the story in court your friend isnt as obvious as you are i dont know what hes up to that remaining at the scene was a bit too smart he knew hed be suspected and hes playing it subtle god knows what he intends to say in court i dont intend to let him get away with it the motive is what theyre all stuck on i know the motive nobody will believe me if i try to explain it but youll state it under oath youll tell the truth youll tell them who designed cortlandt and why i designed it if you want to say that on the stand youd better do something about your muscular control what are you shaking for leave me alone too late petey ever read faust what do you want howard roarks neck hes not my friend hes never been you know what i think of him i know you goddamn fool i know youve worshipped him all your life youve knelt and worshipped while stabbing him in the back you didnt even have the courage of your own malice you couldnt go one way or the other you hated me oh dont you suppose i knew it and you followed me you loved him and youve destroyed him oh youve destroyed him all right petey and now theres no place to run and youll have to go through with it whats he to you what difference does it make to you you should have asked that long ago but you didnt which means that you knew it youve always known it thats whats making you shake why should i help you lie to yourself ive done that for ten years thats what you came to me for thats what they all come to me for but you cant get something for nothing ever my socialistic theories to the contrary notwithstanding you got what you wanted from me its my turn now i wont talk about howard you cant make me talk about howard no why dont you throw me out of here why dont you take me by the throat and choke me youre much stronger than i am but you wont you cant do you see the nature of power petey physical power muscle or guns or money you and gail wynand should get together you have a lot to tell him come on peter who designed cortlandt leave me alone who designed cortlandt let me go who designed cortlandt its worse what youre doing its much worse than what than what i did to lucius heyer what did you do to lucius heyer i killed him what are you talking about thats why it was better because i let him die stop raving why do you want to kill howard i dont want to kill him i want him in jail you understand in jail in a cell behind bars locked stopped strapped and alive hell get up when they tell him to hell eat what they give him hell move when hes told to move and stop when hes told hell walk to the jute mill when hes told and hell work as hes told theyll push him if he doesnt move fast enough and theyll slap his face when they feel like it and theyll beat him with rubber hose if he doesnt obey and hell obey hell take orders hell take orders ellsworth keating screamed ellsworth you make me sick cant you take the truth no you want your sugarcoating thats why i prefer gus webb theres one who has no illusions mrs keating threw the door open she had heard the scream get out of here toohey snapped at her she backed out and toohey slammed the door keating raised his head you have no right to talk to mother that way she had nothing to do with you who designed cortlandt keating got up he dragged his feet to a dresser opened a drawer took out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to toohey it was his contract with roark toohey read it and chuckled once a dry snap of sound then he looked at keating youre a complete success peter as far as im concerned but at times i have to want to turn away from the sight of my successes keating stood by the dresser his shoulders slumped his eyes empty i didnt expect you to have it in writing like that with his signature so thats what hes done for you and this is what you do in return no i take back the insults peter you had to do it who are you to reverse the laws of history do you know what this paper is the impossible perfect the dream of the centuries the aim of all of mankinds great schools of thought you harnessed him you made him work for you you took his achievement his reward his money his glory his name we only thought and wrote about it you gave a practical demonstration every philosopher from plato up should thank you here it is the philosophers stone for turning gold into lead i should be pleased but i guess im human and i cant help it im not pleased im just sick the others plato and all the rest they really thought it would turn lead into gold i knew the truth from the first ive been honest with myself peter and thats the hardest form of honesty the one you all run from at any price and right now i dont blame you it is the hardest one peter he sat down wearily and held the paper by the corners in both hands he said if you want to know how hard it is ill tell you right now i want to burn this paper make what you wish of that i dont claim too great a credit because i know that tomorrow ill send this to the district attorney roark will never know it and it would make no difference to him if he knew but in the truth of things there was one moment when i wanted to burn this paper he folded the paper cautiously and slipped it into his pocket keating followed his gestures moving his whole head like a kitten watching a ball on a string you make me sick said toohey god how you make me sick all you hypocritical sentimentalists you go along with me you spout what i teach you you profit by it but you havent the grace to admit to yourself what youre doing you turn green when you see the truth i suppose thats in the nature of your natures and thats precisely my chief weapon but god i get tired of it i must allow myself a moment free of you thats what i have to put on an act for all my life for mean little mediocrities like you to protect your sensibilities your posturings your conscience and the peace of the mind you havent got thats the price i pay for what i want but at least i know that ive got to pay it and i have no illusions about the price or the purchase what do you want ellsworth power petey there were steps in the apartment above someone skipping gaily a few sounds on the ceiling as of four or five tap beats the light fixture jingled and keatings head moved up in obedience then it came back to toohey toohey was smiling almost indifferently you always said keating began thickly and stopped ive always said just that clearly precisely and openly its not my fault if you couldnt hear you could of course you didnt want to which was safer than deafness for me i said i intended to rule like all my spiritual predecessors but im luckier than they were i inherited the fruit of their efforts and i shall be the one wholl see the great dream made real i see it all around me today i recognize it i dont like it i didnt expect to like it enjoyment is not my destiny i shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits i shall rule whom you the world its only a matter of discovering the lever if you learn how to rule one single mans soul you can get the rest of mankind its the soul peter the soul not whips or swords or fire or guns thats why the caesars the attilas the napoleons were fools and did not last we will the soul peter is that which cant be ruled it must be broken drive a wedge in get your fingers on it and the man is yours you wont need a whip hell bring it to you and ask to be whipped set him in reverse and his own mechanism will do your work for you use him against himself want to know how its done see if i ever lied to you see if you havent heard all this for years but didnt want to hear and the fault is yours not mine there are many ways heres one make man feel small make him feel guilty kill his aspiration and his integrity thats difficult the worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way kill integrity by internal corruption use it against itself direct it toward a goal destructive of all integrity preach selflessness tell man that he must live for others tell men that altruism is the ideal not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will his every living instinct screams against it but dont you see what you accomplish man realizes that hes incapable of what hes accepted as the noblest virtue and it gives him a sense of guilt of sin of his own basic unworthiness since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp he gives up eventually all ideals all aspiration all sense of his personal value he feels himself obliged to preach what he cant practice but one cant be good halfway or honest approximately to preserve ones integrity is a hard battle why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already his soul gives up its selfrespect youve got him hell obey hell be glad to obey because he cant trust himself he feels uncertain he feels unclean thats one way heres another kill mans sense of values kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it great men cant be ruled we dont want any great men dont deny the conception of greatness destroy it from within the great is the rare the difficult the exceptional set up standards of achievement open to all to the least to the most inept and you stop the impetus to effort in all men great or small you stop all incentive to improvement to excellence to perfection laugh at roark and hold peter keating as a great architect youve destroyed architecture build up lois cook and youve destroyed literature hail ike and youve destroyed the theater glorify lancelot clokey and youve destroyed the press dont set out to raze all shrines youll frighten men enshrine mediocrity and the shrines are razed then theres another way kill by laughter laughter is an instrument of human joy learn to use it as a weapon of destruction turn it into a sneer its simple tell them to laugh at everything tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue dont let anything remain sacred in a mans soul and his soul wont be sacred to him kill reverence and youve killed the hero in man one doesnt reverence with a giggle hell obey and hell set no limits to his obedience anything goes nothing is too serious heres another way this is most important dont allow men to be happy happiness is selfcontained and selfsufficient happy men have no time and no use for you happy men are free men so kill their joy in living take away from them whatever is dear or important to them never let them have what they want make them feel that the mere fact of a personal desire is evil bring them to a state where saying i want is no longer a natural right but a shameful admission altruism is of great help in this unhappy men will come to you theyll need you theyll come for consolation for support for escape nature allows no vacuum empty mans soul and the space is yours to fill i dont see why you should look so shocked peter this is the oldest one of all look back at history look at any great system of ethics from the orient up didnt they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy under all the complications of verbiage havent they all had a single leitmotif sacrifice renunciation selfdenial havent you been able to catch their theme song give up give up give up give up look at the moral atmosphere of today everything enjoyable from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive is considered depraved or sinful just prove that a thing makes men happy and youve damned it thats how far weve come weve tied happiness to guilt and weve got mankind by the throat throw your firstborn into a sacrificial furnace lie on a bed of nails go into the desert to mortify the flesh dont dance dont go to the movies on sunday dont try to get rich dont smoke dont drink its all the same line the great line fools think that taboos of this nature are just nonsense something left over oldfashioned but theres always a purpose in nonsense dont bother to examine a folly ask yourself only what it accomplishes every system of ethics that preached sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men of course you must dress it up you must tell people that theyll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy you dont have to be too clear about it use big vague words universal harmony eternal spirit divine purpose nirvana paradise racial supremacy the dictatorship of the proletariat internal corruption peter thats the oldest one of all the farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it yet the test should be so simple just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice run run faster than from a plague it stands to reason that where theres sacrifice theres someone collecting sacrificial offerings where theres service theres someone being served the man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of slaves and masters and intends to be the master but if ever you hear a man telling you that you must be happy that its your natural right that your first duty is to yourself that will be the man whos not after your soul that will be the man who has nothing to gain from you but let him come and youll scream your empty heads off howling that hes a selfish monster so the racket is safe for many many centuries but here you might have noticed something i said it stands to reason do you see men have a weapon against you reason so you must be very sure to take it away from them cut the props from under it but be careful dont deny outright never deny anything outright you give your hand away dont say reason is evil though some have gone that far and with astonishing success just say that reason is limited that theres something above it what you dont have to be too clear about it either the fields inexhaustible instinct feeling revelation divine intuition dialectic materialism if you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that your doctrine doesnt make sense youre ready for him you tell him that theres something above sense that here he must not try to think he must feel he must believe suspend reason and you play it deuces wild anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it youve got him can you rule a thinking man we dont want any thinking men keating had sat down on the floor by the side of the dresser he had felt tired and he had simply folded his legs he did not want to abandon the dresser he felt safer leaning against it as if it still guarded the letter he had surrendered peter youve heard all this youve seen me practicing it for ten years you see it being practiced all over the world why are you disgusted you have no right to sit there and stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked youre in on it youve taken your share and youve got to go along youre afraid to see where its leading im not ill tell you the world of the future the world i want a world of obedience and of unity a world where the thought of each man will not be his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the brain of his neighbor wholl have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor wholl have no thought and so on peter around the globe since all must agree with all a world where no man will hold a desire for himself but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor wholl have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor wholl have no desires around the globe peter since all must serve all a world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money but for that headless monster prestige the approval of his fellows their good opinion the opinion of men wholl be allowed to hold no opinion an octopus all tentacles and no brain judgment peter not judgment but public polls an average drawn upon zeroes since no individuality will be permitted a world with its motor cut off and a single heart pumped by hand my hand and the hands of a few a very few other men like me those who know what makes you tick you great wonderful average you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average the little the common you whove liked and accepted those names youll sit enthroned and enshrined you the little people the absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy the absolute the unlimited god and prophet and king combined vox populi the average the common the general do you know the proper antonym for ego bromide peter the rule of the bromide but even the trite has to be originated by someone at some time well do the originating vox dei well enjoy unlimited submission from men whove learned nothing except to submit well call it to serve well give out medals for service youll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more there will be no other distinction to seek no other form of personal achievement can you see howard roark in the picture no then dont waste time on foolish questions everything that cant be ruled must go and if freaks persist in being born occasionally they will not survive beyond their twelfth year when their brain begins to function it will feel the pressure and it will explode the pressure gauged to a vacuum do you know the fate of deepsea creatures brought out to sunlight so much for future roarks the rest of you will smile and obey have you noticed that the imbecile always smiles mans first frown is the first touch of god on his forehead the touch of thought but well have neither god nor thought only voting by smiles automatic levers all saying yes now if you were a little more intelligent like your exwife for instance youd ask what of us the rulers what of me ellsworth monkton toohey and id say yes youre right ill achieve no more than you will ill have no purpose save to keep you contented to lie to flatter you to praise you to inflate your vanity to make speeches about the people and the common good peter my poor old friend im the most selfless man youve every known i have less independence than you whom i just forced to sell your soul youve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself i want nothing for myself i use people for the sake of what i can do to them its my only function and satisfaction i have no private purpose i want power i want my world of the future let all live for all let all sacrifice and none profit let all suffer and none enjoy let progress stop let all stagnate theres equality in stagnation all subjugated to the will of all universal slavery without even the dignity of a master slavery to slavery a great circle and a total equality the world of the future ellsworth youre insane afraid to say it there you sit and the worlds written all over you your last hope insane look around you pick up any newspaper and read the headlines isnt it coming isnt it here every single thing i told you isnt europe swallowed already and were stumbling on to follow everything i said is contained in a single word collectivism and isnt that the god of our century to act together to think together to feel together to unite to agree to obey to obey to serve to sacrifice divide and conquer first but then unite and rule weve discovered that one at last remember the roman emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it people have laughed at him for centuries but well have the last laugh weve accomplished what he couldnt accomplish weve taught men to unite this makes one neck ready for one leash we found the magic word collectivism look at europe you fool cant you see past the guff and recognize the essence one country is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights that the collective is all the individual held as evil the mass as god no motive and no virtue permitted except that of service to the proletariat thats one version heres another a country dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights that the state is all the individual held as evil the race as god no motive and no virtue permitted except that of service to the race am i raving or is this the cold reality of two continents already watch the pincer movement if youre sick of one version we push you into the other we get you coming and going weve closed the doors weve fixed the coin heads collectivism and tails collectivism fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the individual give up your soul to a council or give it up to a leader but give it up give it up give it up my technique peter offer poison as food and poison as antidote go fancy on the trimmings but hang on to the main objective give the fools a choice let them have their fun but dont forget the only purpose you have to accomplish kill the individual kill mans soul the rest will follow automatically observe the state of the world as of the present moment do you still think im crazy peter keating sat on the floor his legs spread out he lifted one hand and studied his fingertips then put it to his mouth and bit off a hangnail but the movement was deceptive the man was reduced to a single sense the sense of hearing and toohey knew that no answer could be expected keating waited obediently it seemed to make no difference the sounds had stopped and it was now his function to wait until they started again toohey put his hands on the arms of his chair then lifted his palms from the wrists and clasped the wood again a little slap of resigned finality he pushed himself up to his feet thank you peter he said gravely honesty is a hard thing to eradicate i have made speeches to large audiences all my life this was the speech ill never have a chance to make keating lifted his head his voice had the quality of a down payment on terror it was not frightened but it held the advance echoes of the next hour to come dont go ellsworth toohey stood over him and laughed softly thats the answer peter thats my proof you know me for what i am you know what ive done to you you have no illusions of virtue left but you cant leave me and youll never be able to leave me youve obeyed me in the name of ideals youll go on obeying me without ideals because thats all youre good for now good night peter this is a test case what we think of it will determine what we are in the person of howard roark we must crush the forces of selfishness and antisocial individualism the curse of our modern world here shown to us in ultimate consequences as mentioned at the beginning of this column the district attorney now has in his possession a piece of evidence we cannot disclose its nature at this moment which proves conclusively that roark is guilty we the people shall now demand justice this appeared in one small voice on a morning late in may gail wynand read it in his car driving home from the airport he had flown to chicago in a last attempt to hold a national advertiser who had refused to renew a threemilliondollar contract two days of skillful effort had failed wynand lost the advertiser stepping off the plane in newark he picked up the new york papers his car was waiting to take him to his country house then he read one small voice he wondered for a moment what paper he held he looked at the name on the top of the page but it was the banner and the column was there in its proper place column one first page second section he leaned forward and told the chauffeur to drive to his office he sat with the page spread open on his lap until the car stopped before the banner building he noticed it at once when he entered the building in the eyes of two reporters who emerged from an elevator in the lobby in the pose of the elevator man who fought a desire to turn and stare back at him in the sudden immobility of all the men in his anteroom in the break of a typewriters clicking on the desk of one secretary in the lifted hand of another he saw the waiting then he knew that all the implications of the unbelievable were understood by everyone on his paper he felt a first dim shock because the waiting around him contained wonder in anyones mind about the outcome of an issue between him and ellsworth toohey but he had no time to take notice of his own reactions he had no attention to spare for anything except a sense of tightness a pressure against the bones of his face his teeth his cheeks the bridge of his nose and he knew he must press back against that keep it down hold it he greeted no one and walked into his office alvah scarret sat slumped in a chair before his desk scarret had a bandage of soiled white gauze on his throat and his cheeks were flushed wynand stopped in the middle of the room the people outside had felt relieved wynands face looked calm alvah scarret knew better gail i wasnt here he gulped in a cracked whisper that was not a voice at all i havent been here for two days laryngitis gail ask my doctor i wasnt here i just got out of bed look at me ive got a hundred and three fever i mean the doctor didnt want me to but i to get up i mean gail i wasnt here i wasnt here he could not be certain that wynand heard but wynand let him finish then assumed the appearance of listening as if the sounds were reaching him delayed after a moment wynand asked who was on the copy desk it it went through alien and falk fire harding allen falk and toohey buy off hardings contract but not tooheys have them all out of the building in fifteen minutes harding was the managing editor falk a copy reader alien the slot man head of the copy desk all had worked on the banner for more than ten years it was as if scarret had heard a news flash announcing the impeachment of a president the destruction of new york city by a meteor and the sinking of california into the pacific ocean gail he screamed we cant get out of here scarret got out wynand pressed a switch on his desk and said in answer to the trembling voice of the woman outside dont admit anyone yes mr wynand he pressed a button and spoke to the circulation manager stop every copy on the street mr wynand its too late most of them are stop them yes mr wynand he wanted to put his head down on the desk lie still and rest only the form of rest he needed did not exist greater than sleep greater than death the rest of having never lived the wish was like a secret taunt against himself because he knew that the splitting pressure in his skull meant the opposite an urge to action so strong that he felt paralyzed he fumbled for some sheets of clean paper forgetting where he kept them he had to write the editorial that would explain and counteract he had to hurry he felt no right to any minute that passed with the thing unwritten the pressure disappeared with the first word he put on paper he thought while his hand moved rapidly what a power there was in words later for those who heard them but first for the one who found them a healing power a solution like the breaking of a barrier he thought perhaps the basic secret the scientists have never discovered the first fount of life is that which happens when a thought takes shape in words he heard the rumble the vibration in the walls of his office in the floor the presses were running off his afternoon paper a small tabloid the clarion he smiled at the sound his hand went faster as if the sound were energy pumped into his fingers he had dropped his usual editorial we he wrote and if my readers or my enemies wish to laugh at me over this incident i shall accept it and consider it the payment of a debt incurred i have deserved it he thought its the heart of this building beating what time is it do i really hear it or is it my own heart once a doctor put the ends of his stethoscope into my ears and let me hear my own heartbeats it sounded just like this he said i was a healthy animal and good for many years for many years i have foisted upon my readers a contemptible blackguard whose spiritual stature is my only excuse i had not reached a degree of contempt for society such as would have permitted me to consider him dangerous i am still holding on to a respect for my fellow men sufficient to let me say that ellsworth toohey cannot be a menace they say sound never dies but travels on in space what happens to a mans heartbeats so many of them in fiftysix years could they be gathered again in some sort of condenser and put to use once more if they were rebroadcast would the result be the beating of those presses but i have sponsored him under the masthead of my paper and if public penance is a strange humiliating act to perform in our modern age such is the punishment i impose upon myself hereby not fiftysix years of those soft little drops of sound a man never hears each single and final not like a comma but like a period a long string of periods on a page gathered to feed those presses not fiftysix but thirtyone the other twentyfive went to make me ready i was twentyfive when i raised the new masthead over the door publishers dont change the name of a paper this one does the new york banner gail wynands banner i ask the forgiveness of every man who has ever read this paper a healthy animal and that which comes from me is healthy i must bring that doctor here and have him listen to those presses hell grin in his good smug satisfied way doctors like a specimen of perfect health occasionally its rare enough i must give him a treat the healthiest sound he ever heard and hell say the banner is good for many years the door of his office opened and ellsworth toohey came in wynand let him cross the room and approach the desk without a gesture of protest wynand thought that what he felt was curiosity if curiosity could be blown into the dimensions of a thing from the abyss like those drawings of beetles the size of a house advancing upon human figures in the pages of the banners sunday supplement curiosity because ellsworth toohey was still in the building because toohey had gained admittance past the orders given and because toohey was laughing i came to take my leave of absence mr wynand said toohey his face was composed it expressed no gloating the face of an artist who knew that overdoing was defeat and achieved the supreme of offensiveness by remaining normal and to tell you that ill be back on this job on this column in this building in the interval you will have seen the nature of the mistake youve made do forgive me i know this is in utterly bad taste but ive waited for it for thirteen years and i think i can permit myself five minutes as a reward so you were a possessive man mr wynand and you loved your sense of property did you ever stop to think what it rested upon did you stop to secure the foundations no because you were a practical man practical men deal in bank accounts real estate advertising contracts and giltedged securities they leave to the impractical intellectuals like me the amusements of putting the gilt edges through a chemical analysis to learn a few things about the nature and the source of gold they hang on to kreamo pudding and leave us such trivia as the theater the movies the radio the schools the book reviews and the criticism of architecture just a sop to keep us quiet if we care to waste our time playing with the inconsequentials of life while youre making money money is power is it mr wynand so you were after power mr wynand power over men you poor amateur you never discovered the nature of your own ambition or youd have known that you werent fit for it you couldnt use the methods required and you wouldnt want the results youve never been enough of a scoundrel i dont mind handing you that because i dont know which is worse to be a great scoundrel or a gigantic fool thats why ill be back and when i am ill run this paper wynand said quietly when you are now get out of here the city room of the banner walked out on strike the union of wynand employees walked out in a body a great many others nonmembers joined them the typographical staff remained wynand had never given a thought to the union he paid higher wages than any other publisher and no economic demands had ever been made upon him if his employees wished to amuse themselves by listening to speeches he saw no reason to worry about it dominique had tried to warn him once gail if people want to organize for wages hours or practical demands its their proper right but when theres no tangible purpose youd better watch closely darling how many times do i have to ask you keep off the banner he had never taken the trouble to learn who belonged to the union he found now that the membership was small and crucial it included all his key men not the big executives but the rank below expertly chosen the active ones the small indispensable spark plugs the best leg men the general assignment men the rewrite men the assistant editors he looked up their records most of them had been hired in the last eight years recommended by mr toohey nonmembers walked out for various reasons some because they hated wynand others because they were afraid to remain and it seemed easier than to analyze the issue one man a timid little fellow met wynand in the hall and stopped to shriek well be back sweetheart and then itll be a different tune some left avoiding the sight of wynand others played safe mr wynand i hate to do it i hate it like hell i had nothing to do with that union but a strikes a strike and i cant permit myself to be a scab honest mr wynand i dont know whos right or wrong i do think ellsworth pulled a dirty trick and harding had no business letting him get away with it but how can one be sure whos right about anything nowadays and one thing i wont do is i wont picket line no sir the way i feel is pickets right or wrong the strikers presented two demands the reinstatement of the four men who had been discharged a reversal of the banners stand on the cortlandt case harding the managing editor wrote an article explaining his position it was published in the new frontiers i did ignore mr wynands orders in a matter of policy perhaps an unprecedented action for a managing editor to take i did so with full realization of the responsibility involved mr toohey alien falk and i wished to save the banner for the sake of its employees its stockholders and its readers we wished to bring mr wynand to reason by peaceful means we hoped he would give in with good grace once he had seen the banner committed to the stand shared by most of the press of the country we knew the arbitrary unpredictable and unscrupulous character of our employer but we took the chance willing to sacrifice ourselves to our professional duty while we recognize an owners right to dictate the policy of his paper on political sociological or economic issues we believe that a situation has gone past the limits of decency when an employer expects selfrespecting men to espouse the cause of a common criminal we wish mr wynand to realize that the day of dictatorial oneman rule is past we must have some say in the running of the place where we make our living it is a fight for the freedom of the press mr harding was sixty years old owned an estate on long island and divided his spare time between skeetshooting and breeding pheasants his childless wife was a member of the board of directors of the workshop for social study toohey its star lecturer had introduced her to the workshop she had written her husbands article the two men off the copy desk were not members of tooheys union aliens daughter was a beautiful young actress who starred in all of ikes plays falks brother was secretary to lancelot clokey gail wynand sat at the desk in his office and looked down at a pile of paper he had many things to do but one picture kept coming back to him and he could not get rid of it and the sense of it clung to all his actions the picture of a ragged boy standing before the desk of an editor can you spell cat can you spell anthropomorphology the identities cracked and became mixed it seemed to him that the boy stood here at his desk waiting and once he said aloud go away he caught himself in anger he thought youre cracking you fool nows not the time he did not speak aloud again but the conversation went on silently while he read checked and signed papers go away we have no jobs here ill hang around use me when you want to you dont have to pay me theyre paying you dont you understand you little fool theyre paying you aloud his voice normal he said into a telephone tell manning that well have to fill in with mat stuff send up the proofs as soon as you can send up a sandwich any kind a few had remained with him the old men and the copy boys they came in in the morning often with cuts on their faces and blood on their collars one stumbled in his skull open and had to be sent away in an ambulance it was neither courage nor loyalty it was inertia they had lived too long with the thought that the world would end if they lost their jobs on the banner the old ones did not understand the young ones did not care copy boys were sent out on reporters beats most of the stuff they sent in was of such quality that wynand was forced past despair into howls of laughter he had never read such highbrow english he could see the pride of the ambitious youth who was a journalist at last he did not laugh when the stories appeared in the banner as written there were not enough rewrite men he tried to hire new men he offered extravagant salaries the people he wanted refused to work for him a few men answered his call and he wished they hadnt though he hired them they were men who had not been employed by a reputable newspaper for ten years the kind who would not have been allowed a month ago into the lobby of his building some of them had to be thrown out in two days others remained they were drunk most of the time some acted as if they were granting wynand a favor dont you get huffy gail old boy said one and was tossed bodily down two flights of stairs he broke an ankle and sat on the bottom landing looking up at wynand with an air of complete astonishment others were subtler they merely stalked about and looked at wynand slyly almost winking implying that they were fellow criminals tied together in a dirty deal he appealed to schools of journalism no one responded one student body sent him a resolution signed by all its members entering our careers with a high regard for the dignity of our profession dedicating ourselves to uphold the honor of the press we feel that none among us could preserve his selfrespect and accept an offer such as yours the news editor had remained at his desk the city editor had gone wynand filled in as city editor managing editor wire man rewrite man copy boy he did not leave the building he slept on a couch in his office as he had done in the first years of the banners existence goalless tieless his shirt collar torn open he ran up and down the stairs his steps like the rattle of a machine gun two elevator boys had remained the others had vanished no one knew just when or why whether prompted by sympathy for the strike fear or plain discouragement alvah scarret could not understand wynands calm the brilliant machine and that thought scarret was really the word which had always stood for wynand in his mind had never functioned better his words were brief his orders rapid his decisions immediate in the confusion of machines lead grease ink waste paper unswept offices untenanted desks glass crashing in sudden showers when a brick was hurled from the street below wynand moved like a figure in doubleexposure superimposed on his background out of place and scale he doesnt belong here thought scarret because he doesnt look modern thats what it is he doesnt look modern no matter what kind of pants hes wearing he looks like something out of a gothic cathedral the patrician head held level the fleshless face that had shrunk tighter together the captain of a ship known by all save the captain to be sinking alvah scarret had remained he had not grasped that the events were real he shuffled about in a stupor he felt a fresh jolt of bewilderment each morning when he drove up to the building and saw the pickets he suffered no injury beyond a few tomatoes hurled at his windshield he tried to help wynand he tried to do his work and that of five other men but he could not complete a normal days task he was going quietly to pieces his joints wrenched loose by a question mark he wasted everybodys time interrupting anything to ask but why why how just like that all of a sudden he saw a nurse in white uniform walking down the hall an emergency firstaid station had been established on the ground floor he saw her carrying a wastebasket to the incinerator with wadded clumps of gauze bloodstained he turned away he felt sick it was not the sight but the greater terror of an implication grasped by his instinct this civilized building secure in the neatness of waxed floors respectable with the strict grooming of modern business a place where one dealt in such rational matters as written words and trade contracts where one accepted ads for baby garments and chatted about golf had become in the span of a few days a place where one carried bloody refuse through the halls why thought alvah scarret i cant understand it he droned in an accentless monotone to anyone around him i cant understand how ellsworth got so much power and ellsworths a man of culture an idealist not a dirty radical off a soapbox hes so friendly and witty and what an erudition a man who jokes all the time is not a man of violence ellsworth didnt mean this he didnt know what it would lead to he loves people id stake my shirt on ellsworth toohey once in wynands office he ventured to say gail why dont you negotiate why dont you meet with them at least shut up but gail there might be a bit of truth on their side too theyre newspapermen you know what they say the freedom of the press then he saw the fit of fury he had expected for days and had thought safely sidetracked the blue irises vanishing in a white smear the blind luminous eyeballs in a face that was all cavities the trembling hands but in a moment he saw what he had never witnessed before he saw wynand break the fit without sound without relief he saw the sweat of the effort on the hollow temples and the fists on the edge of the desk alvah if i had not sat on the stairs of the gazette for a week where would be the press for them to be free on there were policemen outside and in the halls of the building it helped but not much one night acid was thrown at the main entrance it burned the big plate glass of the ground floor windows and left leprous spots on the walls sand in the bearings stopped one of the presses an obscure delicatessen owner got his shop smashed for advertising in the banner a great many small advertisers withdrew wynand delivery trucks were wrecked one driver was killed the striking union of wynand employees issued a protest against acts of violence the union had not instigated them most of its members did not know who had the new frontiers said something about regrettable excesses but ascribed them to spontaneous outbursts of justifiable popular anger homer slottern in the name of a group who called themselves the liberal businessmen sent wynand a notice canceling their advertising contracts you may sue us if you wish we feel we have a legitimate cause for cancellation we signed to advertise in a reputable newspaper not in a sheet that has become a public disgrace brings pickets to our doors ruins our business and is not being read by anybody the group included most of the banners wealthiest advertisers gail wynand stood at the window of his office and looked at his city i have supported strikes at a time when it was dangerous to do so i have fought gail wynand all my life i had never expected to see the day or the issue when i would be forced to say as i say now that i stand on the side of gail wynand wrote austen heller in the chronicle wynand sent him a note god damn you i didnt ask you to defend me g w the new frontiers described austen heller as a reactionary who has sold himself to big business intellectual society ladies said that austin heller was oldfashioned gail wynand stood at a desk in the city room and wrote editorials as usual his derelict staff saw no change in him no haste no outbursts of anger there was nobody to notice that some of his actions were new he would go to the pressroom and stand looking at the white stream shot out of the roaring giants and listen to the sound he would pick up a lead slug off the composing room floor and finger it absently on the palm of his hand like a piece of jade and lay it carefully on a table as if he did not want it to be wasted he fought other forms of such waste not noticing it the gestures instinctive he retrieved pencils he spent a halfhour while telephones shrieked unanswered repairing a typewriter that had broken down it was not a matter of economy he signed checks without looking at the figures scarret was afraid to think of the amounts each passing day cost him it was a matter of things that were part of the building where he loved every doorknob things that belonged to the banner that belonged to him late each afternoon he telephoned dominique in the country fine everything under control dont listen to panicmongers no to hell with it you know i dont want to talk about the damn paper tell me what the garden looks like did you go swimming today tell me about the lake what dress are you wearing listen to wlx tonight at eight theyll have your pet rachmaninoffs second concerto of course i have time to keep informed about everything oh all right i see one cant fool an exnewspaper woman i did go over the radio page of course we have plenty of help its just that i cant quite trust some of the new boys and i had a moment to spare above all dont come to town you promised me that good night dearest he hung up and sat looking at the telephone smiling the thought of the countryside was like the thought of a continent beyond an ocean that could not be crossed it gave him a sense of being locked in a besieged fortress and he liked that not the fact but the feeling his face looked like a throwback to some distant ancestor who had fought on the ramparts of a castle one evening he went out to the restaurant across the street he had not eaten a complete meal for days the streets were still light when he came back the placid brown haze of summer as if dulled sunrays remained stretched too comfortably on the warm air to undertake a movement of withdrawal even though the sun had long since gone it made the sky look fresh and the street dirty there were patches of brown and tired orange in the corners of old buildings he saw pickets pacing in front of the banners entrance there were eight of them and they marched around and around in a long oval on the sidewalk he recognized one boy a police reporter he had never seen any of the others they carried signs toohey harding alien falk the freedom of the press gail wynand tramples human rights his eyes kept following one woman her hips began at her ankles bulging over the tight straps of her shoes she had square shoulders and a long coat of cheap brown tweed over a huge square body she had small white hands the kind that would drop things all over the kitchen she had an incision of a mouth without lips and she waddled as she moved but she moved with surprising briskness her steps defied the whole world to hurt her with a malicious slyness that seemed to say she would like nothing better because what a joke it would be on the world if it tried to hurt her just try it and see just try it wynand knew she had never been employed on the banner she never could be it did not appear likely that she could be taught to read her steps seemed to add that she jolly well didnt have to she carried a sign we demand he thought of the nights when he had slept on the couch in the old banner building in the first years because the new presses had to be paid for and the banner had to be on the streets before its competitors and he coughed blood one night and refused to see a doctor but it turned out to be nothing just exhaustion he hurried into the building the presses were rolling he stood and listened for a while at night the building was quiet it seemed bigger as if sound took space and vacated it there were panels of light at open doors between long stretches of dim hallways a lone typewriter clicked somewhere evenly like a dripping faucet wynand walked through the halls he thought that men had been willing to work for him when he plugged known crooks for municipal elections when he glamorized redlight districts when he ruined reputations by scandalous libel when he sobbed over the mothers of gangsters talented men respected men had been eager to work for him now he was being honest for the first time in his career he was leading his greatest crusade with the help of finks drifters drunkards and humble drudges too passive to quit the guilt he thought was not perhaps with those who now refused to work for him the sun hit the square crystal inkstand on his desk it made wynand think of a cool drink on a lawn white clothes the feel of grass under bare elbows he tried not to look at the gay glitter and went on writing it was a morning in the second week of the strike he had retreated to his office for an hour and given orders not to be disturbed he had an article to finish he knew he wanted the excuse one hour of not seeing what went on in the building the door of his office opened without announcement and dominique came in she had not been allowed to enter the banner building since their marriage he got up a kind of quiet obedience in his movement permitting himself no questions she wore a coral linen suit she stood as if the lake were behind her and the sunlight rose from the surface to the folds of her clothes she said gail ive come for my old job on the banner he stood looking at her silently then he smiled it was a smile of convalescence he turned to the desk picked up the sheets he had written handed them to her and said take this to the back room pick up the wire flimsies and bring them to me then report to manning at the city desk the impossible the not to be achieved in word glance or gesture the complete union of two beings in complete understanding was done by a small stack of paper passing from his hand to hers their fingers did not touch she turned and walked out of the office within two days it was as if she had never left the staff of the banner only now she did not write a column on houses but kept busy wherever a competent hand was needed to fill a gap its quite all right alvah she said to scarret its a proper feminine job to be a seamstress im here to slap on patches where necessary and boy is this cloth ripping fast just call me when one of your new journalists runs amuck more than usual scarret could not understand her tone her manner or her presence youre a lifesaver dominique he mumbled sadly its like the old days seeing you here and oh how i wish it were the old days only i cant understand gail wouldnt allow a photo of you in the place when it was a decent respectable place and now when its practically as safe as a penitentiary during a convict riot he lets you work here can the commentaries alvah we havent the time she wrote a brilliant review of a movie she hadnt seen she dashed off a report on a convention she hadnt attended she batted out a string of recipes for the daily dishes column when the lady in charge failed to show up one morning i didnt know you could cook said scarret i didnt either said dominique she went out one night to cover a dock fire when it was found that the only man on duty had passed out on the floor of the mens room good job wynand told her when he read the story but try that again and youll get fired if you want to stay youre not to step out of the building this was his only comment on her presence he spoke to her when necessary briefly and simply as to any other employee he gave orders there were days when they did not have time to see each other she slept on a couch in the library occasionally in the evening she would come to his office for a short rest when they could take it and then they talked about nothing in particular about small events of the days work gaily like any married couple gossiping about the normal routine of their common life they did not speak of roark or cortlandt she had noticed roarks picture on the wall of his office and asked when did you hang that up over a year ago it had been their only reference to roark they did not discuss the growing public fury against the banner they did not speculate on the future they felt relief in forgetting the question beyond the walls of the building it could be forgotten because it stood no longer as a question between them it was solved and answered what remained was the peace of the simplified they had a job to do the job of keeping a newspaper going and they were doing it together she would come in unsummoned in the middle of the night with a cup of hot coffee and he would snatch it gratefully not pausing in his work he would find fresh sandwiches left on his desk when he needed them badly he had no time to wonder where she got things then he discovered that she had established an electric plate and a stock of supplies in a closet she cooked breakfast for him when he had to work all night she came in carrying dishes on a piece of cardboard for a tray with the silence of empty streets beyond the windows and the first light of morning on the rooftops once he found her broom in hand sweeping an office the maintenance department had fallen apart charwomen appeared and disappeared no one had time to notice is that what im paying you for he asked well we cant work in a pigsty i havent asked you what youre paying me but i want a raise drop this thing for gods sake its ridiculous whats ridiculous its clean now it didnt take me long is it a good job its a good job she leaned on the broom handle and laughed i believe you thought like everybody else that im just a kind of luxury object a highclass type of kept woman didnt you gail is this the way you can keep going when you want to this is the way ive wanted to keep going all my life if i could find a reason for it he learned that her endurance was greater than his she never showed a sign of exhaustion he supposed that she slept but he could not discover when at any time in any part of the building not seeing him for hours she was aware of him she knew when he needed her most once he fell asleep slumped across his desk he awakened and found her looking at him she had turned off the lights she sat on a chair by the window in the moonlight her face turned to him calm watching her face was the first thing he saw lifting his head painfully from his arm in the first moment before he could return fully to control and reality he felt a sudden wrench of anger helplessness and desperate protest not remembering what had brought them here to this remembering only that they were both caught in some vast slow process of torture and that he loved her she had seen it in his face before he had completed the movement of straightening his body she walked to him she stood by his chair she took his head and let it rest against her she held him and he did not resist slumped in her arms she kissed his hair she whispered it will be all right gail it will be all right at the end of three weeks wynand walked out of the building one evening not caring whether there would be anything left of it when he returned and went to see roark he had not telephoned roark since the beginning of the siege roark telephoned him often wynand answered quietly just answering originating no statement refusing to prolong the conversation he had warned roark at the beginning dont try to come here ive given orders you wont be admitted he had to keep out of his mind the actual form which the issue of his battle could take he had to forget the fact of roarks physical existence because the thought of roarks person brought the thought of the county jail he walked the long distance to the enright house walking made the distance longer and safer a ride in a cab would pull roark too close to the banner building he kept his glance slanted toward a point six feet ahead of him on the sidewalk he did not want to look at the city good evening gail roark said calmly when he came in i dont know whats a more conspicuous form of bad discipline said wynand throwing his hat down on a table by the door to blurt things right out or to ignore them blatantly i look like hell say it you do look like hell sit down rest and dont talk then ill run you a hot bath no you dont look that dirty but it will be good for you for a change then well talk wynand shook his head and remained standing at the door howard the banner is not helping you its ruining you it had taken him eight weeks to prepare himself to say that of course said roark what of it wynand would not advance into the room gail it doesnt matter as far as im concerned im not counting on public opinion one way or the other you want me to give in i want you to hold out if it takes everything you own he saw that wynand understood that it was the thing wynand had tried not to face and that wynand wanted him to speak i dont expect you to save me i think i have a chance to win the strike wont make it better or worse dont worry about me and dont give in if you stick to the end you wont need me any longer he saw the look of anger protest and agreement he added you know what im saying well be better friends than ever and youll come to visit me in jail if necessary dont wince and dont make me say too much not now im glad of this strike i knew that something like that had to happen when i saw you for the first time you knew it long before that two months ago i promised you the one promise i wanted to keep youre keeping it dont you really want to despise me i wish youd say it now i came here to hear it all right listen you have been the one encounter in my life that can never be repeated there was henry cameron who died for my own cause and youre the publisher of filthy tabloids but i couldnt say this to him and im saying it to you theres steve mallory whos never compromised with his soul and youve done nothing but sell yours in every known way but i couldnt say this to him and im saying it to you is that what youve always wanted to hear from me but dont give in he turned away and added thats all we wont talk about your damn strike again sit down ill get you a drink rest get yourself out of looking like hell wynand returned to the banner late at night he took a cab it did not matter he did not notice the distance dominique said youve seen roark yes how do you know heres the sunday makeup its fairly lousy but itll have to do i sent manning home for a few hours he was going to collapse jackson quit but we can do without him alvahs column was a mess he cant even keep his grammar straight any more i rewrote it but dont tell him tell him you did go to sleep ill take mannings place im good for hours they went on and the days passed and in the mailing room the piles of returns grew running over into the corridor white stacks of paper like marble slabs fewer copies of the banner were run off with every edition but the stacks kept growing the days passed days of heroic effort to put out a newspaper that came back unbought and unread in the glasssmooth mahogany of the long table reserved for the board of directors there was a monogram in colored wood g w reproduced from his signature it had always annoyed the directors they had no time to notice it now but an occasional glance fell upon it and then it was a glance of pleasure the directors sat around the table it was the first meeting in the boards history that had not been summoned by wynand but the meeting had convened and wynand had come the strike was in its second month wynand stood by his chair at the head of the table he looked like a drawing from a mens magazine fastidiously groomed a white handkerchief in the breast pocket of his dark suit the directors caught themselves in peculiar thoughts some thought of british tailors others of the house of lords of the tower of london of the executed english king or was it a chancellor who had died so well they did not want to look at the man before them they leaned upon visions of the pickets outside of the perfumed manicured women who shrieked their support of ellsworth toohey in drawingroom discussions of the broad flat face of a girl who paced fifth avenue with a placard we dont read wynand for support and courage to say what they were saying wynand thought of a crumbling wall on the edge of the hudson he heard steps approaching blocks away only this time there were no wires in his hand to hold his muscles ready its gone beyond all sense is this a business organization or a charitable society for the defense of personal friends three hundred thousand dollars last week never mind how i know it gail no secret about it your banker told me all right its your money but if you expect to get that back out of the sheet let me tell you were wise to your smart tricks youre not going to saddle the corporation with that one not a penny of it you dont get away with it this time its too late gail the days past for your bright stunts wynand looked at the fleshy lips of the man making sounds and thought youve run the banner from the beginning you didnt know it but i know it was you it was your paper theres nothing to save now yes slottern and his bunch are willing to come back at once all they ask is that we accept the unions demands and theyll pick up the balance of their contracts on the old terms even without waiting for you to rebuild circulation which will be some job friend let me tell you and i think thats pretty white of them i spoke to homer yesterday and he gave me his word care to hear me name the sums involved wynand or do you know it without my help no senator eldridge wouldnt see you aw skip it gail we know you flew to washington last week what you dont know is that senator eldridge is going around saying he wouldnt touch this with a tenfoot pole and boss craig suddenly got called out to florida did he to sit up with a sick aunt none of them will pull you out of this one gail this isnt a roadpaving deal or a little wateredstock scandal and you aint what you used to be wynand thought i never used to be ive never been here why are you afraid to look at me dont you know that im the least among you the halfnaked women in the sunday supplement the babies in the rotogravure section the editorials on park squirrels they were your souls given expression the straight stuff of your souls but where was mine ill be damned if i can see any sense to it now if they were demanding a raise in wages that i could understand id say fight the bastards for all were worth but whats this a goddamn intellectual issue of some kind are we losing our shirts for principles or something dont you understand the banners a church publication now mr gail wynand the evangelist were over a barrel but weve got ideals now if it were a real issue a political issue but some fool dynamiter whos blown up some dump everybodys laughing at us honest wynand ive tried to read your editorials and if you want my honest opinion its the lousiest stuff ever put in print youd think you were writing for college professors wynand thought i know you youre the one whod give money to a pregnant slut but not to a starving genius ive seen your face before i picked you and i brought you in when in doubt about your work remember that mans face youre writing for him but mr wynand one cant remember his face one can child one can it will come back to remind you it will come back and demand payment and ill pay i signed a blank check long ago and now its presented for collection but a blank check is always made out to the sum of everything youve got the situation is medieval and a disgrace to democracy the voice whined it was mitchell layton speaking its about time somebody had some say around here one man running all those papers as he damn pleases what is this the nineteenth century layton pouted he looked somewhere in the direction of a banker across the table has anybody here ever bothered to inquire about my ideas ive got ideas weve all got to pool ideas what i mean is teamwork one big orchestra its about time this paper had a modem liberal progressive policy for instance take the question of the sharecroppers shut up mitch said alvah scarret scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples he didnt know why he wanted the board to win there was just something in the room its too hot in here he thought i wish somebodyd open a window i wont shut up shrieked mitchell layton im just as good as please mr layton said the banker all right said layton all right dont forget who holds the biggest hunk of stock next to superman here he jerked his thumb at wynand not looking at him just dont forget it just you guess whos going to run things around here gail said alvah scarret looking up at wynand his eyes strangely honest and tortured gail its no use but we can save the pieces look if we just admit that we were wrong about cortlandt and and if we just take harding back hes a valuable man and maybe toohey no one is to mention the name of toohey in this discussion said wynand mitchell layton snapped his mouth open and dropped it shut again thats it gail cried alvah scarret thats great we can bargain and make them an offer well reverse our policy on cortlandt that weve got to not for the damn union but weve got to rebuild circulation gail so well offer them that and well take harding alien and falk but not to not ellsworth we give in and they give in saves everybodys face is that it gail wynand said nothing i think thats it mr scarret said the banker i think thats the solution after all mr wynand must be allowed to maintain his prestige we can sacrifice a columnist and keep peace among ourselves i dont see it yelled mitchell layton i dont see it at all why should we sacrifice mr a great liberal just because i stand with mr scarret said the man who had spoken of senators and the voices of the others seconded him and the man who had criticized the editorials said suddenly in the general noise i think gail wynand was a hell of a swell boss after all there was something about mitchell layton which he didnt want to see now he looked at wynand for protection wynand did not notice him gail asked scarret gail what do you say there was no answer god damn it wynand its now or never this cant go on make up your mind or get out ill buy you out shrieked layton want to sell want to sell and get the hell out of it for gods sake wynand dont be a fool gail its the banner whispered scarret its our banner well stand by you gail well all chip in well pull the old paper back on its feet well do as you say youll be the boss but for gods sake act like a boss now quiet gentlemen quiet wynand this is final we switch policy on cortlandt we take harding alien and falk back and we save the wreck yes or no there was no answer wynand you know its that or you have to close the banner you cant keep this up even if you bought us all out give in or close the banner you had better give in wynand heard that he had heard it through all the speeches he had heard it for days before the meeting he knew it better than any man present close the banner he saw a single picture the new masthead rising over the door of the gazette you had better give in he made a step back it was not a wall behind him it was only the side of his chair he thought of the moment in his bedroom when he had almost pulled a trigger he knew he was pulling it now all right he said its only a bottle cap thought wynand looking down at a speck of glitter under his feet a bottle cap ground into the pavement the pavements of new york are full of things like that bottle caps safety pins campaign buttons sink chains sometimes lost jewels its all alike now flattened ground in it makes the pavements sparkle at night the fertilizer of a city someone drank the bottle empty and threw the cap away how many cars have passed over it could one retrieve it now could one kneel and dig with bare hands and tear it out again i had no right to hope for escape i had no right to kneel and seek redemption millions of years ago when the earth was being born there were living things like me flies caught in resin that became amber animals caught in ooze that became rock i am a man of the twentieth century and i became a bit of tin in the pavements for the trucks of new york to roll over he walked slowly the collar of his topcoat raised the street stretched before him empty and the buildings ahead were like the backs of books lining a shelf assembled without order of all sizes the comers he passed led to black channels street lamps gave the city a protective cover but it cracked in spots he turned a corner when he saw a slant of light ahead it was a goal for three or four blocks the light came from the window of a pawnshop the shop was closed but a glaring bulb hung there to discourage looters who might be reduced to this he stopped and looked at it he thought the most indecent sight on earth a pawnshop window the things which had been sacred to men and the things which had been precious surrendered to the sight of all to the pawing and the bargaining trash to the indifferent eyes of strangers the equality of a junk heap typewriters and violins the tools of dreams old photographs and wedding rings the tags of love together with soiled trousers coffee pots ash trays pornographic plaster figures the refuse of despair pledged not sold not cut off in clean finality but hocked to a stillborn hope never to be redeemed hello gail wynand he said to the things in the window and walked on he felt an iron grate under his feet and an odor struck him in the face an odor of dust sweat and dirty clothing worse than the smell of stockyards because it had a homey normal quality like decomposition made routine the grating of a subway he thought this is the residue of many people put together of human bodies pressed into a mass with no space to move with no air to breathe this is the sum even though down there among the packed flesh one can find the smell of starched white dresses of clean hair of healthy young skin such is the nature of sums and of quests for the lowest common denominator what then is the residue of many human minds put together unaired unspaced undifferentiated the banner he thought and walked on my city he thought the city i loved the city i thought i ruled he had walked out of the board meeting he had said take over alvah until i come back he had not stopped to see manning drunk with exhaustion at the city desk nor the people in the city room still functioning waiting knowing what was being decided in the board room nor dominique scarret would tell them he had walked out of the building and gone to his penthouse and sat alone in the bedroom without windows nobody had come to disturb him when he left the penthouse it was safe to go out it was dark he passed a newsstand and saw late editions of the afternoon papers announcing the settlement of the wynand strike the union had accepted scarrets compromise he knew that scarret would take care of all the rest scarret would replate the front page of tomorrows banner scarret would write the editorial that would appear on the front page he thought the presses are rolling right now tomorrow mornings banner will be out on the streets in an hour he walked at random he owned nothing but he was owned by any part of the city it was right that the city should now direct his way and that he should be moved by the pull of chance corners here i am my masters i am coming to salute you and acknowledge wherever you want me i shall go as im told im the man who wanted power that woman sitting on the stoop of an old brownstone house her fat white knees spread apart the man pushing the white brocade of his stomach out of a cab in front of a great hotel the little man sipping root beer at a drugstore counter the woman leaning over a stained mattress on the sill of a tenement window the taxi driver parked on a corner the lady with orchids drunk at the table of a sidewalk cafe the toothless woman selling chewing gum the man in shirt sleeves leaning against the door of a poolroom they are my masters my owners my rulers without a face stand here he thought and count the lighted windows of a city you cannot do it but behind each yellow rectangle that climbs one over another to the sky under each bulb down to there see that spark over the river which is not a star there are people whom you will never see and who are your masters at the supper tables in the drawing rooms in their beds and in their cellars in their studies and in their bathrooms speeding in the subways under your feet crawling up in elevators through vertical cracks around you jolting past you in every bus your masters gail wynand there is a net longer than the cables that coil through the walls of this city larger than the mesh of pipes that carry water gas and refuse there is another hidden net around you it is strapped to you and the wires lead to every hand in the city they jerked the wires and you moved you were a ruler of men you held a leash a leash is only a rope with a noose at both ends my masters the anonymous the unselected they gave me a penthouse an office a yacht to them to any one of them who wished for the sum of three cents i sold howard roark he walked past an open marble court a cave cut deep into a building filled with light spurting the sudden cold of airconditioning it was a movie theater and the marquee had letters made of rainbows romeo and juliet a placard stood by the glass column of the box office bill shakespeares immortal classic but theres nothing highbrow about it just a simple human love story a boy from the bronx meets a girl from brooklyn just like the folks next door just like you and me he walked past the door of a saloon there was a smell of stale beer a woman sat slumped breasts flattened against the table top a juke box played wagners song to the evening star adapted in swing time he saw the trees of central park he walked his eyes lowered he was passing by the aquitania hotel he came to a corner he had escaped other corners like it but this one caught him it was a dim corner a slice of sidewalk trapped between the wall of a closed garage and the pillars of an elevated station he saw the rear end of a truck disappearing down the street he had not seen the name on it but he knew what truck it was a newsstand crouched under the iron stairs of the elevated he moved his eyes slowly the fresh pile was there spread out for him tomorrows banner he did not come closer he stood waiting he thought i still have a few minutes in which not to know he saw faceless people stopping at the stand one after another they came for different papers but they bought the banner also when they noticed its front page he stood pressed to the wall waiting he thought it is right that i should be the last to learn what i have said then he could delay no longer no customers came the stand stood deserted papers spread in the yellow light of a bulb waiting for him he could see no vendor in the black hovel beyond the bulb the street was empty a long corridor filled by the skeleton of the elevated stone paving blotched walls the interlacing of iron pillars there were lighted windows but they looked as if no people moved inside the walls a train thundered over his head a long roll of clangor that went shuddering down the pillars into the earth it looked like an aggregation of metal rushing without human driver through the night he waited for the sound to die then he walked to the stand the banner he said he did not see who sold him the paper whether it was a man or a woman he saw only a gnarled brown hand pushing the copy forward he started walking away but stopped while crossing the street there was a picture of roark on the front page it was a good picture the calm face the sharp cheekbones the implacable mouth he read the editorial leaning against a pillar of the elevated we have always endeavored to give our readers the truth without fear or prejudice charitable consideration and the benefit of the doubt even to a man charged with an outrageous crime but after conscientious investigation and in the light of new evidence placed before us we find ourselves obliged honestly to admit that we might have been too lenient a society awakened to a new sense of responsibility toward the underprivileged we join the voice of public opinion the past the career the personality of howard roark seem to support the widespread impression that he is a reprehensible character a dangerous unprincipled antisocial type of man if found guilty as seems inevitable howard roark must be made to bear the fullest penalty the law can impose on him it was signed gail wynand when he looked up he was in a brightly lighted street on a trim sidewalk looking at a wax figure exquisitely contorted on a satin chaise longue in a shop window the figure wore a salmoncolored negligee lucite sandals and a string of pearls suspended from one raised finger he did not know when he had dropped the paper it was not in his hands any longer he glanced back it would be impossible to find a discarded paper lying on some street he did not know he had passed he thought what for there are other papers like it the city is full of them you have been the one encounter in my life that can never be repeated howard i wrote that editorial forty years ago i wrote it one night when i was sixteen and stood on the roof of a tenement he walked on another street lay before him a sudden cut of long emptiness and a chain of green traffic lights strung out to the horizon like a rosary without end he thought now walk from green bead to green bead he thought these are not the words but the words kept ringing with his steps mea culpa mea culpa mea maxima culpa he went past a window of old shoes corroded by wear past the door of a mission with a cross above it past the peeling poster of a political candidate who ran two years ago past a grocery store with barrels of rotting greens on the sidewalk the streets were contracting walls drawing closer together he could smell the odor of the river and there were wads of fog over the rare lights he was in hells kitchen the facades of the buildings around him were like the walls of secret backyards suddenly exposed decay without reticence past the need of privacy or shame he heard shrieks coming from a saloon on a corner he could not tell whether it was joy or brawling he stood in the middle of a street he looked slowly down the mouth of every dark crevice up the streaked walls to the windows to the roofs i never got out of here i never got out i surrendered to the grocery man to the deck hands on the ferryboat to the owner of the poolroom you dont run things around here you dont run things around here youve never run things anywhere gail wynand youve only added yourself to the things they ran then he looked up across the city to the shapes of the great skyscrapers he saw a string of lights rising unsupported in black space a glowing pinnacle anchored to nothing a small brilliant square hanging detached in the sky he knew the famous buildings to which these belonged he could reconstruct their forms in space he thought youre my judges and witnesses you rise unhindered above the sagging roofs you shoot your gracious tension to the stars out of the slack the tired the accidental the eyes one mile out on the ocean will see none of this and none of this will matter but you will be the presence and the city as down the centuries a few men stand in lonely rectitude that we may look and say there is a human race behind us one cant escape from you the streets change but one looks up and there you stand unchanged you have seen me walking through the streets tonight you have seen all my steps and all my years its you that ive betrayed for i was born to be one of you he walked on it was late circles of light lay undisturbed on the empty sidewalks under the lampposts the horns of taxis shrieked once in a while like doorbells ringing through the corridors of a vacant interior he saw discarded newspapers as he passed on the pavements on park benches in the wire trashbaskets on corners many of them were the banner many copies of the banner had been read in the city tonight he thought were building circulation alvah he stopped he saw a paper spread out in the gutter before him front page up it was the banner he saw roarks picture he saw the gray print of a rubber heel across roarks face he bent his body folding itself down slowly with both knees both arms and picked up the paper he folded the front page and put it in his pocket he walked on an unknown rubber heel somewhere in the city on an unknown foot that i released to march i released them all i made every one of those who destroyed me there is a beast on earth dammed safely by its own impotence i broke the dam they would have remained helpless they can produce nothing i gave them the weapon i gave them my strength my energy my living power i created a great voice and let them dictate the words the woman who threw the beet leaves in my face had a right to do it i made it possible for her anything may be betrayed anyone may be forgiven but not those who lack the courage of their own greatness alvah scarret can be forgiven he had nothing to betray mitchell layton can be forgiven but not i i was not born to be a secondhander it was a summer day cloudless and cool as if the sun were screened by an invisible film of water and the energy of heat had been transformed into a sharper clarity an added brilliance of outline for the buildings of the city in the streets scattered like scraps of gray foam there were a great many copies of the banner the city read chuckling the statement of wynands renunciation thats that said gus webb chairman of the we dont read wynand committee its slick said ike id like one peek just one peek at the great mr gail wynands face today said sally brent its about time said homer slottern isnt it splendid wynands surrendered said a tightlipped woman she knew little about wynand and nothing about the issue but she liked to hear of people surrendering in a kitchen after dinner a fat woman scraped the remnants off the dishes onto a sheet of newspaper she never read the front page only the installments of a love serial in the second section she wrapped onion peelings and lambchop bones in a copy of the banner its stupendous said lancelot clokey only im really sore at that union ellsworth how could they doublecross you like that dont be a sap lance said ellsworth toohey what do you mean i told them to accept the terms you did yep but jesus one small voice you can wait for one small voice another month or so cant you ive filed suit with the labor board today to be reinstated in my job on the banner there are more ways than one to skin a cat lance the skinning isnt important once youve broken its spine that evening roark pressed the bell button at the door of wynands penthouse the butler opened the door and said mr wynand cannot see you mr roark from the sidewalk across the street roark looked up and saw a square of light high over the roofs in the window of wynands study in the morning roark came to wynands office in the banner building wynands secretary told him mr wynand cannot see you mr roark she added her voice polite disciplined mr wynand has asked me to tell you that he does not wish ever to see you again roark wrote him a long letter gail i know i hoped you could escape it but since it had to happen start again from where you are i know what youre doing to yourself youre not doing it for my sake its not up to me but if this will help you i want to say that im repeating now everything ive ever said to you nothing has changed for me youre still what you were im not saying that i forgive you because there can be no such question between us but if you cant forgive yourself will you let me do it let me say that it doesnt matter its not the final verdict on you give me the right to let you forget it go on just on my faith until youve recovered i know its something no man can do for another but if i am what ive been to you youll accept it call it a blood transfusion you need it take it its harder than fighting that strike do it for my sake if that will help you but do it come back there will be another chance what you think youve lost can neither be lost nor found dont let it go the letter came back to roark unopened alvah scarret ran the banner wynand sat in his office he had removed roarks picture from the wall he attended to advertising contracts expenses accounts scarret took care of the editorial policy wynand did not read the contents of the banner when wynand appeared in any department of the building the employees obeyed him as they had obeyed him before he was still a machine and they knew that it was a machine more dangerous than ever a car running downhill without combustion or brakes he slept in his penthouse he had not seen dominique scarret had told him that she had gone back to the country once wynand ordered his secretary to telephone connecticut he stood by her desk while she asked the butler whether mrs wynand was there the butler answered that she was the secretary hung up and wynand went back to his office he thought he would give himself a few days then hed return to dominique their marriage would be what she had wanted it to be at first mrs wynandpapers he would accept it wait he thought in an agony of impatience wait you must learn to face her as you are now train yourself to be a beggar there must be no pretense at things to which you have no right no equality no resistance no pride in holding your strength against hers only acceptance now stand before her as a man who can give her nothing who will live on what she chooses to grant him it will be contempt but it will come from her and it will be a bond show her that you recognize this there is a kind of dignity in a renunciation of dignity openly admitted learn it wait he sat in the study of his penthouse his head on the arm of his chair there were no witnesses in the empty rooms around him dominique he thought i will have no claim to make except that i need you so much and that i love you i told you once not to consider it now ill use it as a tin cup but ill use it i love you dominique lay stretched out on the shore of the lake she looked at the house on the hill at the tree branches above her flat on her back hands crossed under her head she studied the motion of leaves against the sky it was an earnest occupation giving her full contentment she thought its a lovely kind of green theres a difference between the color of plants and the color of objects this has light in it this is not just green but also the living force of the tree made visible i dont have to look down i can see the branches the trunk the roots just by looking at that color that fire around the edges is the sun i dont have to see it i can tell what the whole countryside looks like today the spots of light weaving in circles thats the lake the special kind of light that comes refracted from water the lake is beautiful today and its better not to see it just to guess by these spots i have never been able to enjoy it before the sight of the earth its such great background but it has no meaning except as a background and i thought of those who owned it and then it hurt me too much i can love it now they dont own it they own nothing theyve never won i have seen the life of gail wynand and now i know one cannot hate the earth in their name the earth is beautiful and it is a background but not theirs she knew what she had to do but she would give herself a few days she thought ive learned to bear anything except happiness i must learn how to carry it how not to break under it its the only discipline ill need from now on roark stood at the window of his house in monadnock valley he had rented the house for the summer he went there when he wanted loneliness and rest it was a quiet evening the window opened on a small ledge in a frame of trees hanging against the sky a strip of sunset light stretched above the dark treetops he knew that there were houses below but they could not be seen he was as grateful as any other tenant for the way in which he had built this place he heard the sound of a car approaching up the road at the other side he listened astonished he expected no guests the car stopped he walked to open the door he felt no astonishment when he saw dominique she came in as if she had left this house half an hour ago she wore no hat no stockings just sandals and a dress intended for back country roads a narrow sheath of dark blue linen with short sleeves like a smock for gardening she did not look as if she had driven across three states but as if she were returning from a walk down the hill he knew that this was to be the solemnity of the moment that it needed no solemnity it was not to be stressed and set apart it was not this particular evening but the completed meaning of seven years behind them howard he stood as if he were looking at the sound of his name in the room he had all he had wanted but there was one thought that remained as pain even now he said dominique wait till he recovers you know he wont recover have a little pity on him dont speak their language he had no choice he could have closed the paper it was his life this is mine he did not know that wynand had once said all love is exceptionmaking and wynand would not know that roark had loved him enough to make his greatest exception one moment when he had tried to compromise then he knew it was useless like all sacrifices what he said was his signature under her decision i love you she looked about the room to let the ordinary reality of walls and chairs help her keep the discipline she had been learning for this moment the walls he had designed the chairs he used a package of his cigarettes on a table the routine necessities of life that could acquire splendor when life became what it was now howard i know what you intend to do at the trial so it wont make any difference if they learn the truth about us it wont make any difference when you came that night and told me about cortlandt i didnt try to stop you i knew you had to do it it was your time to set the terms on which you could go on this is my time my cortlandt explosion you must let me do it my way dont question me dont protect me no matter what i do i know what youll do you know that i have to yes she bent one arm from the elbow fingers lifted in a short backward jolt as if tossing the subject over her shoulder it was settled and not to be discussed she turned away from him she walked across the room to let the casual ease of her steps make this her home to state that his presence was to be the rule for ail her coming days and she had no need to do what she wanted most at this moment stand and look at him she knew also what she was delaying because she was not ready and would never be ready she stretched her hand out for his package of cigarettes on the table his fingers closed over her wrist and he pulled her hand back he pulled her around to face him and then he held her and his mouth was on hers she knew that every moment of seven years when she had wanted this and stopped the pain and thought she had won was not past had never been stopped had lived on stored adding hunger to hunger and now she had to feel it all the touch of his body the answer and the waiting together she didnt know whether her discipline had helped not too well she thought because she saw that he had lifted her in his arms carried her to a chair and sat down holding her on his knees he laughed without sound as he would have laughed at a child but the firmness of his hands holding her showed concern and a kind of steadying caution then it seemed simple she had nothing to hide from him she whispered yes howard that much and he said it was very hard for me all these years and the years were ended she slipped down to sit on the floor her elbows propped on his knees she looked up at him and smiled she knew that she could not have reached this white serenity except as the sum of all the colors of all the violence she had known howard willingly completely and always without reservations without fear of anything they can do to you or me in any way you wish as your wife or your mistress secretly or openly here or in a furnished room ill take in some town near a jail where ill see you through a wire net it wont matter howard if you win the trial even that wont matter too much youve won long ago ill remain what i am and ill remain with you now and ever in any way you want he held her hands in his she saw his shoulders sagging down to her she saw him helpless surrendered to this moment as she was and she knew that even pain can be confessed but to confess happiness is to stand naked delivered to the witness yet they could let each other see it without need of protection it was growing dark the room was indistinguishable only the window remained and his shoulders against the sky in the window she awakened with the sun in her eyes she lay on her back looking at the ceiling as she had looked at the leaves not to move to guess by hints to see everything through the greater intensity of implication the broken triangles of light on the angular modeling of the ceilings plastic tiles meant that it was morning and that this was a bedroom at monadnock the geometry of fire and structure above her designed by him the fire was white that meant it was very early and the rays came through clean country air with nothing anywhere in space between this bedroom and the sun the weight of the blanket heavy and intimate on her naked body was everything that had been last night and the skin she felt against her arm was roark asleep beside her she slipped out of bed she stood at the window her arms raised holding on to the frame at each side she thought if she looked back she would see no shadow of her body on the floor she felt as if the sunlight went straight through her because her body had no weight but she had to hurry before he awakened she found his pyjamas in a dresser drawer and put them on she went to the living room closing the door carefully behind her she picked up the telephone and asked for the nearest sheriffs office this is mrs gail wynand she said i am speaking from the house of mr howard roark at monadnock valley i wish to report that my starsapphire ring was stolen here last night about five thousand dollars it was a present from mr roark can you get here within an hour thank you she went to the kitchen made coffee and stood watching the glow of the electric coil under the coffee pot thinking that it was the most beautiful light on earth she set the table by the large window in the living room he came out wearing nothing but a dressing gown and laughed at the sight of her in his pyjamas she said dont dress sit down lets have breakfast they were finishing when they heard the sound of the car stopping outside she smiled and walked to open the door there were a sheriff a deputy and two reporters from local papers good morning said dominique come in mrs wynand said the sheriff thats right mrs gail wynand come in sit down in the ludicrous folds of the pyjamas with dark cloth bulging over a belt wound tightly with sleeves hanging over her fingertips she had all the poised elegance she displayed in her best hostess gown she was the only one who seemed to find nothing unusual in the situation the sheriff held a notebook as if he did not know what to do with it she helped him to find the right questions and answered them precisely like a good newspaper woman it was a starsapphire ring set in platinum i took it off and left it here on this table next to my purse before going to bed it was about ten oclock last night when i got up this morning it was gone yes this window was open no we didnt hear anything no it was not insured i have not had the time mr roark gave it to me recently no there are no servants here and no other guests yes please look through the house living room bedroom bathroom and kitchen yes of course you may look too gentlemen the press i believe do you wish to ask me any questions there were no questions to ask the story was complete the reporters had never seen a story of this nature offered in this manner she tried not to look at roark after her first glance at his face but he kept his promise he did not try to stop her or protect her when questioned he answered enough to support her statements then the men departed they seemed glad to leave even the sheriff knew that he would not have to conduct a search for that ring dominique said im sorry i know it was terrible for you but it was the only way to get it into the papers you should have told me which one of your star sapphires i gave you ive never had any i dont like star sapphires that was a more thorough job of dynamiting than cortlandt yes now gail is blasted over to the side where he belongs so he thinks youre an unprincipled antisocial type of man now let him see the banner smearing me also why should he be spared that sorry howard i dont have your sense of mercy ive read that editorial dont comment on this dont say anything about selfsacrifice or ill break and and im not quite as strong as that sheriff is probably thinking i didnt do it for you ive made it worse for you ive added scandal to everything else theyll throw at you but howard now we stand together against all of them youll be a convict and ill be an adulteress howard do you remember that i was afraid to share you with lunch wagons and strangers windows now im not afraid to have this past night smeared all over their newspapers my darling do you see why im happy and why im free he said ill never remind you afterward that youre crying dominique the story including the pyjamas the dressing gown the breakfast table and the single bed was in all the afternoon papers of new york that day alvah scarret walked into wynands office and threw a newspaper down on his desk scarret had never discovered how much he loved wynand until now and he was so hurt that he could express it only in furious abuse he gulped god damn you you blasted fool it serves you right it serves you right and im glad damn your witless soul now what are we going to do wynand read the story and sat looking at the paper scarret stood before the desk nothing happened it was just an office a man sat at a desk holding a newspaper he saw wynands hands one at each side of the sheet and the hands were still no he thought normally a man would not be able to hold his hands like that lifted and unsupported without a tremor wynand raised his head scarret could discover nothing in his eyes except a kind of mild astonishment as if wynand were wondering what scarret was doing here then in terror scarret whispered gail what are we going to do well run it said wynand its news but how in any way you wish scarrets voice leaped ahead because he knew it was now or never he would not have the courage to attempt this again and because he was caught here he was afraid to back toward the door gail you must divorce her he found himself still standing there and he went on not looking at wynand screaming in order to get it said gail youve got no choice now youve got to keep whats left of your reputation youve got to divorce her and its you who must file the suit all right will you at once will you let paul file the papers at once all right scarret hurried out of the room he rushed to his own office slammed the door seized the telephone and called wynands lawyer he explained and went on repeating drop everything and file it now paul now today hurry paul before he changes his mind wynand drove to his country house dominique was there waiting for him she stood up when he entered her room she stepped forward so that there would be no furniture between them she wished him to see her whole body he stood across the empty space and looked at her as if he were observing them both at once an impartial spectator who saw dominique and a man facing her but no gail wynand she waited but he said nothing well ive given you a story that will build circulation gail he had heard but he looked as if nothing of the present were relevant he looked like a bank teller balancing a strangers account that had been overdrawn and had to be closed he said i would like only to know this if youll tell me that was the first time since our marriage yes but it was not the first time no he was the first man who had me i think i should have understood you married peter keating right after the stoddard trial do you wish to know everything i want to tell you i met him when he was working in a granite quarry why not youll put him in a chain gang or a jute mill he was working in a quarry he didnt ask my consent he raped me thats how it began want to use it want to run it in the banner he loved you yes yet he built this house for us yes i only wanted to know he turned to leave god damn you she cried if you can take it like this you had no right to become what you became thats why im taking it he walked out of the room he closed the door softly guy francon telephoned dominique that evening since his retirement he had lived alone on his country estate near the quarry town she had refused to answer calls today but she took the receiver when the maid told her that it was mr francon instead of the fury she expected she heard a gentle voice saying hello dominique hello father youre going to leave wynand now yes you shouldnt move to the city its not necessary dont overdo it come and stay here with me until the cortlandt trial the things he had not said and the quality of his voice firm simple and with a note that sounded close to happiness made her answer after a moment all right father it was a girls voice a daughters voice with a tired trusting wistful gaiety ill get there about midnight have a glass of milk for me and some sandwiches try not to speed as you always do the roads arent too good when she arrived guy francon met her at the door they both smiled and she knew that there would be no questions no reproaches he led her to the small morning room where he had set the food on a table by a window open to a dark lawn there was a smell of grass candles on the table and a bunch of jasmine in a silver bowl she sat her fingers closed about a cold glass and he sat across the table munching a sandwich peacefully want to talk father no i want you to drink your milk and go to bed all right he picked up an olive and sat studying it thoughtfully twisting it on a colored toothpick then he glanced up at her look dominique i cant attempt to understand it all but i know this much that its the right thing for you this time its the right man yes father thats why im glad she nodded tell mr roark that he can come here any time he wants she smiled tell whom father tell howard her arm lay on the table her head dropped down on her arm he looked at the gold hair in the candlelight she said because it was easier to control a voice dont let me fall asleep here im tired but he answered hell be acquitted dominique all the newspapers of new york were brought to wynands office each day as he had ordered he read every word of what was written and whispered in town everybody knew that the story had been a selfframeup the wife of a multimillionaire would not report the loss of a fivethousanddollar ring in the circumstances but this did not prevent anyone from accepting the story as given and commenting accordingly the most offensive comments were spread on the pages of the banner alvah scarret had found a crusade to which he devoted himself with the truest fervor he had ever experienced he felt that it was his atonement for any disloyalty he might have committed toward wynand in the past he saw a way to redeem wynands name he set out to sell wynand to the public as the victim of a great passion for a depraved woman it was dominique who had forced her husband to champion an immoral cause against his better judgment she had almost wrecked her husbands paper his standing his reputation the achievement of his whole life for the sake of her lover scarret begged readers to forgive wynand a tragic selfsacrificing love was his justification it was an inverse ratio in scarrets calculations every filthy adjective thrown at dominique created sympathy for wynand in the readers mind this fed scarrets smear talent it worked the public responded the banners old feminine readers in particular it helped in the slow painful work of the papers reconstruction letters began to arrive generous in their condolences unrestrained in the indecency of their comment on dominique francon like the old days gail said scarret happily just like the old days he piled all the letters on wynands desk wynand sat alone in his office with the letters scarret could not suspect that this was the worst of the suffering gail wynand was to know he made himself read every letter dominique whom he had tried to save from the banner when they met in the building scarret looked at him expectantly with an entreating tentative halfsmile an eager pupil waiting for the teachers recognition of a lesson well learned and well done wynand said nothing scarret ventured once it was clever wasnt it gail yes have any idea on where we can milk it some more its your job alvah shes really the cause of everything gail long before all this when you married her i was afraid then thats what started it remember when you didnt allow us to cover your wedding that was a sign shes ruined the banner but ill be damned if i dont rebuild it now right on her own body just as it was our old banner yes got any suggestions gail what else would you like me to do anything you wish alvah a tree branch hung in the open window the leaves moved against the sky implying sun and summer and an inexhaustible earth to be used dominique thought of the world as background wynand thought of two hands bending a tree branch to explain the meaning of life the leaves drooped touching the spires of new yorks skyline far across the river the skyscrapers stood like shafts of sunlight washed white by distance and summer a crowd filled the county courtroom witnessing the trial of howard roark roark sat at the defense table he listened calmly dominique sat in the third row of spectators looking at her people felt as if they had seen a smile she did not smile she looked at the leaves in the window gail wynand sat at the back of the courtroom he had come in alone when the room was full he had not noticed the stares and the flashbulbs exploding around him he had stood in the aisle for a moment surveying the place as if there were no reason why he should not survey it he wore a gray summer suit and a panama hat with a drooping brim turned up at one side his glance went over dominique as over the rest of the courtroom when he sat down he looked at roark from the moment of wynands entrance roarks eyes kept returning to him whenever roark looked at him wynand turned away the motive which the state proposes to prove the prosecutor was making his opening address to the jury is beyond the realm of normal human emotions to the majority of us it will appear monstrous and inconceivable dominique sat with mallory heller lansing enright mike and guy francon to the shocked disapproval of his friends across the aisle celebrities formed a comet from the small point of ellsworth toohey well in front a tail of popular names stretched through the crowd lois cook gordon l prescott gus webb lancelot clokey ike jules fougler sally brent homer slottern mitchell layton even as the dynamite which swept a building away his motive blasted all sense of humanity out of this mans soul we are dealing gentlemen of the jury with the most vicious explosive on earth the egotist on the chairs on the window sills in the aisles pressed against the walls the human mass was blended like a monolith except for the pale ovals of faces the faces stood out separate lonely no two alike behind each there were the years of a life lived or half over effort hope and an attempt honest or dishonest but an attempt it had left on all a single mark in common on lips smiling with malice on lips loose with renunciation on lips tight with uncertain dignity on all the mark of suffering in this day and age when the world is torn by gigantic problems seeking an answer to questions that hold the survival of man in the balance this man attached to such a vague intangible such an unessential as his artistic opinions sufficient importance to let it become his sole passion and the motivation of a crime against society the people had come to witness a sensational case to see celebrities to get material for conversation to be seen to kill time they would return to unwanted jobs unloved families unchosen friends to drawing rooms evening clothes cocktail glasses and movies to unadmitted pain murdered hope desire left unreached left hanging silently over a path on which no step was taken to days of effort not to think not to say to forget and give in and give up but each of them had known some unforgotten moment a morning when nothing had happened a piece of music heard suddenly and never heard in the same way again a strangers face seen in a bus a moment when each had known a different sense of living and each remembered other moments on a sleepless night on an afternoon of steady rain in a church in an empty street at sunset when each had wondered why there was so much suffering and ugliness in the world they had not tried to find the answer and they had gone on living as if no answer were necessary but each had known a moment when in lonely naked honesty he had felt the need of an answer a ruthless arrogant egotist who wished to have his own way at any price twelve men sat in the jury box they listened their faces attentive and emotionless people had whispered that it was a toughlooking jury there were two executives of industrial concerns two engineers a mathematician a truck driver a bricklayer an electrician a gardener and three factory workers the impaneling of the jury had taken some time roark had challenged many talesmen he had picked these twelve the prosecutor had agreed telling himself that this was what happened when an amateur undertook to handle his own defense a lawyer would have chosen the gentlest types those most likely to respond to an appeal for mercy roark had chosen the hardest faces had it been some plutocrats mansion but a housing project gentlemen of the jury a housing project the judge sat erect on the tall bench he had gray hair and the stern face of an army officer a man trained to serve society a builder who became a destroyer the voice went on practiced and confident the faces filling the room listened with the response they granted to a good weekday dinner satisfying and to be forgotten within an hour they agreed with every sentence they had heard it before they had always heard it this was what the world lived by it was selfevident like a puddle before ones feet the prosecutor introduced his witnesses the policeman who had arrested roark took the stand to tell how he had found the defendant standing by the electric plunger the night watchman related how he had been sent away from the scene his testimony was brief the prosecutor preferred not to stress the subject of dominique the contractors superintendent testified about the dynamite missing from the stores on the site officials of cortlandt building inspectors estimators took the stand to describe the building and the extent of the damage this concluded the first day of the trial peter keating was the first witness called on the following day he sat on the stand slumped forward he looked at the prosecutor obediently his eyes moved once in a while he looked at the crowd at the jury at roark it made no difference mr keating will you state under oath whether you designed the project ascribed to you known as cortlandt homes no i didnt who designed it howard roark at whose request at my request why did you call on him because i was not capable of doing it myself there was no sound of honesty in the voice because there was no sound of effort to pronounce a truth of such nature no tone of truth or falsehood only indifference the prosecutor handed him a sheet of paper is this the agreement you signed keating held the paper in his hand yes is that howard roarks signature yes will you please read the terms of this agreement to the jury keating read it aloud his voice came evenly well drilled nobody in the courtroom realized that this testimony had been intended as a sensation it was not a famous architect publicly confessing incompetence it was a man reciting a memorized lesson people felt mat were he interrupted he would not be able to pick up the next sentence but would have to start all over again from the beginning he answered a great many questions the prosecutor introduced in evidence roarks original drawings of cortlandt which keating had kept the copies which keating had made of them and photographs of cortlandt as it had been built why did you object so strenuously to the excellent structural changes suggested by mr prescott and mr webb i was afraid of howard roark what did your knowledge of his character lead you to expect anything what do you mean i dont know i was afraid i used to be afraid the questions went on the story was unusual but the audience felt bored it did not sound like the recital of a participant the other witnesses had seemed to have a more personal connection with the case when keating left the stand the audience had the odd impression that no change had occurred in the act of a mans exit as if no person had walked out the prosecution rests said the district attorney the judge looked at roark proceed he said his voice was gentle roark got up your honor i shall call no witnesses this will be my testimony and my summation take the oath roark took the oath he stood by the steps of the witness stand the audience looked at him they felt he had no chance they could drop the nameless resentment the sense of insecurity which he aroused in most people and so for the first time they could see him as he was a man totally innocent of fear the fear of which they thought was not the normal kind not a response to a tangible danger but the chronic unconfessed fear in which they all lived they remembered the misery of the moments when in loneliness a man thinks of the bright words he could have said but had not found and hates those who robbed him of his courage the misery of knowing how strong and able one is in ones own mind the radiant picture never to be made real dreams selfdelusion or a murdered reality unborn killed by that corroding emotion without name fear need dependence hatred roark stood before them as each man stands in the innocence of his own mind but roark stood like that before a hostile crowd and they knew suddenly that no hatred was possible to him for the flash of an instant they grasped the manner of his consciousness each asked himself do i need anyones approval does it matter am i tied and for that instant each man was free free enough to feel benevolence for every other man in the room it was only a moment the moment of silence when roark was about to speak thousands of years ago the first man discovered how to make fire he was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light he was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a demon mankind dreaded but thereafter men had fire to keep them warm to cook their food to light their caves he had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth centuries later the first man invented the wheel he was probably torn on the rack he had taught his brothers to build he was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory but thereafter men could travel past any horizon he had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had opened the roads of the world that man the unsubmissive and first stands in the opening chapter of every legend mankind has recorded about its beginning prometheus was chained to a rock and torn by vultures because he had stolen the fire of the gods adam was condemned to suffer because he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge whatever the legend somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew that its glory began with one and that that one paid for his courage throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision their goals differed but they all had this in common that the step was first the road new the vision unborrowed and the response they received hatred the great creators the thinkers the artists the scientists the inventors stood alone against the men of their time every great new thought was opposed every great new invention was denounced the first motor was considered foolish the airplane was considered impossible the power loom was considered vicious anesthesia was considered sinful but the men of unborrowed vision went ahead they fought they suffered and they paid but they won no creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers for his brothers rejected the gift he offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine of their lives his truth was his only motive his own truth and his own work to achieve it in his own way a symphony a book an engine a philosophy an airplane or a building that was his goal and his life not those who heard read operated believed flew or inhabited the thing he had created the creation not its users the creation not the benefits others derived from it the creation which gave form to his truth he held his truth above all things and against all men his vision his strength his courage came from his own spirit a mans spirit however is his self that entity which is his consciousness to think to feel to judge to act are functions of the ego the creators were not selfless it is the whole secret of their power that it was selfsufficient selfmotivated selfgenerated a first cause a fount of energy a life force a prime mover the creator served nothing and no one he had lived for himself and only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind such is the nature of achievement man cannot survive except through his mind he comes on earth unarmed his brain is his only weapon animals obtain food by force man has no claws no fangs no horns no great strength of muscle he must plant his food or hunt it to plant he needs a process of thought to hunt he needs weapons and to make weapons a process of thought from this simplest necessity to the highest religious abstraction from the wheel to the skyscraper everything we are and everything we have comes from a single attribute of man the function of his reasoning mind but the mind is an attribute of the individual there is no such thing as a collective brain there is no such thing as a collective thought an agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts it is a secondary consequence the primary act the process of reason must be performed by each man alone we can divide a meal among many men we cannot digest it in a collective stomach no man can use his lungs to breathe for another man no man can use his brain to think for another all the functions of body and spirit are private they cannot be shared or transferred we inherit the products of the thought of other men we inherit the wheel we make a cart the cart becomes an automobile the automobile becomes an airplane but all through the process what we receive from others is only the end product of their thinking the moving force is the creative faculty which takes this product as material uses it and originates the next step this creative faculty cannot be given or received shared or borrowed it belongs to single individual men that which it creates is the property of the creator men learn from one another but all learning is only the exchange of material no man can give another the capacity to think yet that capacity is our only means of survival nothing is given to man on earth everything he needs has to be produced and here man faces his basic alternative he can survive in only one of two ways by the independent work of his own mind or as a parasite fed by the minds of others the creator originates the parasite borrows the creator faces nature alone the parasite faces nature through an intermediary the creators concern is the conquest of nature the parasites concern is the conquest of men the creator lives for his work he needs no other men his primary goal is within himself the parasite lives secondhand he needs others others become his prime motive the basic need of the creator is independence the reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion it cannot be curbed sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever it demands total independence in function and in motive to a creator all relations with men are secondary the basic need of the secondhander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed he places relations first he declares that man exists in order to serve others he preaches altruism altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self no man can live for another he cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share his body but the secondhander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation and reversed the base of mankinds moral principles men have been taught every precept that destroys the creator men have been taught dependence as a virtue the man who attempts to live for others is a dependent he is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves the relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption it is impossible in concept the nearest approach to it in reality the man who lives to serve others is the slave if physical slavery is repulsive how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit the conquered slave has a vestige of honor he has the merit of having resisted and of considering his condition evil but the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of creatures he degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love but this is the essence of altruism men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve but to give yet one cannot give that which has not been created creation comes before distribution or there will be nothing to distribute the need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary yet we are taught to admire the secondhander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who made the gifts possible we praise an act of charity we shrug at an act of achievement men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others but suffering is a disease should one come upon it one tries to give relief and assistance to make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life then man must wish to see others suffer in order that he may be virtuous such is the nature of altruism the creator is not concerned with disease but with life yet the work of the creators has eliminated one form of disease after another in mans body and spirit and brought more relief from suffering than any altruist could ever conceive men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others but the creator is the man who disagrees men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current but the creator is the man who goes against the current men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together but the creator is the man who stands alone men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil and selflessness the ideal of virtue but the creator is the egotist in the absolute sense and the selfless man is the one who does not think feel judge or act these are functions of the self here the basic reversal is most deadly the issue has been perverted and man has been left no alternative and no freedom as poles of good and evil he was offered two conceptions egotism and altruism egotism was held to mean the sacrifice of others to self altruism the sacrifice of self to others this tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain his own pain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self when it was added that man must find joy in selfimmolation the trap was closed man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal under the threat that sadism was his only alternative this was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind this was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as fundamentals of life the choice is not selfsacrifice or domination the choice is independence or dependence the code of the creator or the code of the secondhander this is the basic issue it rests upon the alternative of life or death the code of the creator is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which allows man to survive the code of the secondhander is built on the needs of a mind incapable of survival all that which proceeds from mans independent ego is good all that which proceeds from mans dependence upon men is evil the egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others he is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner he does not function through them he is not concerned with them in any primary matter not in his aim not in his motive not in his thinking not in his desires not in the source of his energy he does not exist for any other man and he asks no other man to exist for him this is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men degrees of ability vary but the basic principle remains the same the degree of a mans independence initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his worth as a man independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value what a man is and makes of himself not what he has or hasnt done for others there is no substitute for personal dignity there is no standard of personal dignity except independence in all proper relationships there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone an architect needs clients but he does not subordinate his work to their wishes they need him but they do not order a house just to give him a commission men exchange their work by free mutual consent to mutual advantage when their personal interests agree and they both desire the exchange if they do not desire it they are not forced to deal with each other they seek further this is the only possible form of relationship between equals anything else is a relation of slave to master or victim to executioner no work is ever done collectively by a majority decision every creative job is achieved under the guidance of a single individual thought an architect requires a great many men to erect his building but he does not ask them to vote on his design they work together by free agreement and each is free in his proper function an architect uses steel glass concrete produced by others but the materials remain just so much steel glass and concrete until he touches them what he does with them is his individual product and his individual property this is the only pattern for proper cooperation among men the first right on earth is the right of the ego mans first duty is to himself his moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others his moral obligation is to do what he wishes provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men this includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty his thinking his work but it does not include the sphere of the gangster the altruist and the dictator a man thinks and works alone a man cannot rob exploit or rule alone robbery exploitation and ruling presuppose victims they imply dependence they are the province of the secondhander rulers of men are not egotists they create nothing they exist entirely through the persons of others their goal is in their subjects in the activity of enslaving they are as dependent as the beggar the social worker and the bandit the form of dependence does not matter but men were taught to regard secondhanders tyrants emperors dictators as exponents of egotism by this fraud they were made to destroy the ego themselves and others the purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators or to harness them which is a synonym from the beginning of history the two antagonists have stood face to face the creator and the secondhander when the first creator invented the wheel the first secondhander responded he invented altruism the creator denied opposed persecuted exploited went on moved forward and carried all humanity along on his energy the secondhander contributed nothing to the process except the impediments the contest has another name the individual against the collective the common good of a collective a race a class a state was the claim and justification of every tyranny ever established over men every major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism does the fault lie in mens hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle the most dreadful butchers were the most sincere they believed in the perfect society reached through the guillotine and the firing squad nobody questioned their right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose it was accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men actors change but the course of the tragedy remains the same a humanitarian who starts with declarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood it goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish that permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it the leaders of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves but observe the results the only good which men can do to one another and the only statement of their proper relationship is hands off now observe the results of a society built on the principle of individualism this our country the noblest country in the history of men the country of greatest achievement greatest prosperity greatest freedom this country was not based on selfless service sacrifice renunciation or any precept of altruism it was based on a mans right to the pursuit of happiness his own happiness not anyone elses a private personal selfish motive look at the results look into your own conscience it is an ancient conflict men have come close to the truth but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy the savages whole existence is public ruled by the laws of his tribe civilization is the process of setting man free from men now in our age collectivism the rule of the secondhander and secondrater the ancient monster has broken loose and is running amuck it has brought men to a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth it has reached a scale of horror without precedent it has poisoned every mind it has swallowed most of europe it is engulfing our country i am an architect i know what is to come by the principle on which it is built we are approaching a world in which i cannot permit myself to live now you know why i dynamited cortlandt i designed cortlandt i gave it to you i destroyed it i destroyed it because i did not choose to let it exist it was a double monster in form and in implication i had to blast both the form was mutilated by two secondhanders who assumed the right to improve upon that which they had not made and could not equal they were permitted to do it by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the building superseded all rights and that i had no claim to stand against it i agreed to design cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as i designed it and for no other reason that was the price i set for my work i was not paid i do not blame peter keating he was helpless he had a contract with his employers it was ignored he had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as designed the promise was broken the love of a man for the integrity of his work and his right to preserve it are now considered a vague intangible and an unessential you have heard the prosecutor say that why was the building disfigured for no reason such acts never have any reason unless its the vanity of some secondhanders who feel they have a right to anyones property spiritual or material who permitted them to do it no particular man among the dozens in authority no one cared to permit it or to stop it no one was responsible no one can be held to account such is the nature of all collective action i did not receive the payment i asked but the owners of cortlandt got what they needed from me they wanted a scheme devised to build a structure as cheaply as possible they found no one else who could do it to their satisfaction i could and did they took the benefit of my work and made me contribute it as a gift but i am not an altruist i do not contribute gifts of this nature it is said that i have destroyed the home of the destitute it is forgotten that but for me the destitute could not have had this particular home those who were concerned with the poor had to come to me who have never been concerned in order to help the poor it is believed that the poverty of the future tenants gave them a right to my work that their need constituted a claim on my life that it was my duty to contribute anything demanded of me this is the secondhanders credo now swallowing the world i came here to say that i do not recognize anyones right to one minute of my life nor to any part of my energy nor to any achievement of mine no matter who makes the claim how large their number or how great their need i wished to come here and say that i am a man who does not exist for others it had to be said the world is perishing from an orgy of selfsacrificing i wished to come here and say that the integrity of a mans creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor those of you who do not understand this are the men whore destroying the world i wished to come here and state my terms i do not care to exist on any others i recognize no obligations toward men except one to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society to my country i wish to give the ten years which i will spend in jail if my country exists no longer i will spend them in memory and in gratitude for what my country has been it will be my act of loyalty my refusal to live or work in what has taken its place my act of loyalty to every creator who ever lived and was made to suffer by the force responsible for the cortlandt i dynamited to every tortured hour of loneliness denial frustration abuse he was made to spend and to the battles he won to every creator whose name is known and to every creator who lived struggled and perished unrecognized before he could achieve to every creator who was destroyed in body or in spirit to henry cameron to steven mallory to a man who doesnt want to be named but who is sitting in this courtroom and knows that i am speaking of him roark stood his legs apart his arms straight at his sides his head lifted as he stood in an unfinished building later when he was seated again at the defense table many men in the room felt as if they still saw him standing one moments picture that would not be replaced the picture remained in their minds through the long legal discussions that followed they heard the judge state to the prosecutor that the defendant had in effect changed his plea he had admitted his act but had not pleaded guilty of the crime an issue of temporary legal insanity was raised it was up to the jury to decide whether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his act or if he did whether he knew that the act was wrong the prosecutor raised no objection there was an odd silence in the room he felt certain that he had won his case already he made his closing address no one remembered what he said the judge gave his instructions to the jury the jury rose and left the courtroom people moved preparing to depart without haste in expectation of many hours of waiting wynand at the back of the room and dominique in the front sat without moving a bailiff stepped to roarks side to escort him out roark stood by the defense table his eyes went to dominique then to wynand he turned and followed the bailiff he had reached the door when there was a sharp crack of sound and a space of blank silence before people realized that it was a knock at the closed door of the jury room the jury had reached a verdict those who had been on their feet remained standing frozen until the judge returned to the bench the jury filed into the courtroom the prisoner will rise and face the jury said the clerk of the court howard roark stepped forward and stood facing the jury at the back of the room gail wynand got up and stood also mr foreman have you reached a verdict we have what is your verdict not guilty the first movement of roarks head was not to look at the city in the window at the judge or at dominique he looked at wynand wynand turned sharply and walked out he was the first man to leave the courtroom roger enright bought the site the plans and the ruins of cortlandt from the government he ordered every twisted remnant of foundations dug out to leave a clean hole in the earth he hired howard roark to rebuild the project placing a single contractor in charge observing the strict economy of the plans enright budgeted the undertaking to set low rentals with a comfortable margin of profit for himself no questions were to be asked about the income occupation children or diet of the future tenants the project was open to anyone who wished to move in and pay the rent whether he could afford a more expensive apartment elsewhere or not late in august gail wynand was granted his divorce the suit was not contested and dominique was not present at the brief hearing wynand stood like a man facing a courtmartial and heard the cold obscenity of legal language describing the breakfast in a house of monadnock valley mrs gail wynand howard roark branding his wife as officially dishonored granting him lawful sympathy the status of injured innocence and a paper that was his passport to freedom for all the years before him and for all the silent evenings of those years ellsworth toohey won his case before the labor board wynand was ordered to reinstate him in his job that afternoon wynands secretary telephoned toohey and told him that mr wynand expected him back at work tonight before nine oclock toohey smiled dropping the receiver toohey smiled entering the banner building that evening he stopped in the city room he waved to people shook hands made witty remarks about some current movies and bore an air of guileless astonishment as if he had been absent just since yesterday and could not understand why people greeted him in the manner of a triumphal homecoming then he ambled on to his office he stopped short he knew while stopping that he must enter must not show the jolt and that he had shown it wynand stood in the open door of his office good evening mr toohey said wynand softly come in hello mr wynand said toohey his voice pleasant reassured by feeling his face muscles manage a smile and his legs walking on he entered and stopped uncertainly it was his own office unchanged with his typewriter and a stack of fresh paper on the desk but the door remained open and wynand stood there silently leaning against the jamb sit down at your desk mr toohey go to work we must comply with the law toohey gave a gay little shrug of acquiescence crossed the room and sat down he put his hands on the desk surface palms spread solidly then dropped them to his lap he reached for a pencil examined its point and dropped it wynand lifted one wrist slowly to the level of his chest and held it still the apex of a triangle made by his forearm and the long drooping fingers of his hand he was looking down at his wrist watch he said it is ten minutes to nine you are back on your job mr toohey and im happy as a kid to be back honestly mr wynand i suppose i shouldnt confess it but i missed this place like all hell wynand made no movement to go he stood slouched as usual his shoulder blades propped against the doorjamb arms crossed on his chest hands holding his elbows a lamp with a square shade of green glass burned on the desk but there was still daylight outside streaks of tired brown on a lemon sky the room held a dismal sense of evening in the illumination that seemed both premature and too feeble the light made a puddle on the desk but it could not shut out the brown halfdissolved shapes of the street and it could not reach the door to disarm wynands presence the lamp shade rattled faintly and toohey felt the nimble under his shoe soles the presses were rolling he realized that he had heard them for some time it was a comforting sound dependable and alive the pulse beat of a newspaper the newspaper that transmits to men the pulse beat of the world a long even flow of separate drops like marbles rolling away in a straight line like the sound of a mans heart toohey moved a pencil over a sheet of paper until he realized that the sheet lay in the lamplight and wynand could see the pencil making a water lily a teapot and a bearded profile he dropped the pencil and made a selfmocking sound with his lips he opened a drawer and looked attentively at a pile of carbons and paper clips he did not know what he could possibly be expected to do one did not start writing a column just like that he had wondered why he should be asked to resume his duties at nine oclock in the evening but he had supposed that it was wynands manner of softening surrender by overdoing it and he had felt he could afford not to argue the point the presses were rolling a mans heartbeats gathered and rebroadcast he heard no other sound and he thought it was absurd to keep this up if wynand had gone but most inadvisable to look in his direction if he hadnt after a while he looked up wynand was still there the light picked out two white spots of his figure the long fingers of one hand closed over an elbow and the high forehead it was the forehead that toohey wanted to see no there were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows the eyes made two solid white ovals faintly discernible in the angular shadows of the face the ovals were directed at toohey but there was nothing in the face no indication of purpose after a while toohey said really mr wynand theres no reason why you and i cant get together wynand did not answer toohey picked up a sheet of paper and inserted it in the typewriter he sat looking at the keys holding his chin between two fingers in the pose he knew he assumed when preparing to attack a paragraph the rims of the keys glittered under the lamps rings of bright nickel suspended in the dim room the presses stopped toohey jerked back automatically before he knew why he had jerked he was a newspaperman and it was a sound that did not stop like that wynand looked at his wrist watch he said its nine oclock youre out of a job mr toohey the banner has ceased to exist the next incident of reality toohey apprehended was his own hand dropping down on the typewriter keys he heard the metal cough of the levers tangling and striking together and the small jump of the carriage he did not speak but he thought his face was naked because he heard wynand answering him yes you had worked here for thirteen years yes i bought them all out mitchell layton included two weeks ago the voice was indifferent no the boys in the city room didnt know it only the boys in the pressroom toohey turned away he picked up a paper clip held it on his palm then turned his hand over and let the clip fall observing with mild astonishment the finality of the law mat had not permitted it to remain on his downturned palm he got up he stood looking at wynand a stretch of gray carpet between them wynands head moved leaned slightly to one shoulder wynands face looked as if no barrier were necessary now it looked simple it held no anger the closed lips were drawn in the hint of a smile of pain that was almost humble wynand said this was the end of the banner i think its proper that i should meet it with you many newspapers bid for the services of ellsworth monkton toohey he selected the courier a paper of wellbred prestige and gently uncertain policy in the evening of his first day on the new job ellsworth toohey sat on the edge of an associate editors desk and they talked about mr talbot the owner of the courier whom toohey had met but a few times but mr talbot as a man asked ellsworth toohey whats his particular god what would he go to pieces without in the radio room across the hall somebody was twisting a dial time blared a solemn voice marches on roark sat at the drafting table in his office working the city beyond the glass walls seemed lustrous the air washed by the first cold of october the telephone rang he held his pencil suspended in a jerk of impatience the telephone was never to ring when he was drawing he walked to his desk and picked up the receiver mr roark said his secretary the tense little note in her voice serving as apology for a broken order mr gail wynand wishes to know whether it would be convenient for you to come to his office at four oclock tomorrow afternoon she heard the faint buzz of silence in the receiver at her ear and counted many seconds is he on the wire asked roark she knew it was not the phone connection that made his voice sound like that no mr roark its mr wynands secretary yes yes tell her yes he walked to the drafting table and looked down at the sketches it was the first desertion he had ever been forced to commit he knew he would not be able to work today the weight of hope and relief together was too great when roark approached the door of what had been the banner building he saw that the sign the banners masthead was gone nothing replaced it a discolored rectangle was left over the door he knew the building now contained the offices of the clarion and floors of empty rooms the clarion a thirdrate afternoon tabloid was the only representative of the wynand chain in new york he walked to an elevator he was glad to be the only passenger he felt a sudden violent possessiveness for the small cage of steel it was his found again given back to him the intensity of the relief told him the intensity of the pain it had ended the special pain like no other in his life when he entered wynands office he knew that he had to accept that pain and carry it forever mat there was to be no cure and no hope wynand sat behind his desk and rose when he entered looking straight at him wynands face was more than the face of a stranger a strangers face is an unapproached potentiality to be opened if one makes the choice and effort this was a face known closed and never to be reached again a face that held no pain of renunciation but the stamp of the next step when even pain is renounced a face remote and quiet with a dignity of its own not a living attribute but the dignity of a figure on a medieval tomb that speaks of past greatness and forbids a hand to reach out for the remains mr roark this interview is necessary but very difficult for me please act accordingly roark knew that the last act of kindness he could offer was to claim no bond he knew he would break what was left of the man before him if he pronounced one word gail roark answered yes mr wynand wynand picked up four typewritten sheets of paper and handed them across the desk please read this and sign it if it meets with your approval what is it your contract to design the wynand building roark put the sheets down he could not hold them he could not look at them please listen carefully mr roark this must be explained and understood i wish to undertake the construction of the wynand building at once i wish it to be the tallest structure of the city do not discuss with me the question of whether this is timely or economically advisable i wish it built it will be used which is all that concerns you it will house the clarion and all the offices of the wynand enterprises now located in various parts of the city the rest of the space will be rented i have sufficient standing left to guarantee that you need have no fear of erecting a useless structure i shall send you a written statement on all details and requirements the rest will be up to you you will design the building as you wish your decisions will be final they will not require my approval you will have full charge and complete authority this is stated in the contract but i wish it understood that i shall not have to see you there will be an agent to represent me in all technical and financial matters you will deal with him you will hold all further conferences with him let him know what contractors you prefer chosen for the job if you find it necessary to communicate with me you will do it through my agent you are not to expect or attempt to see me should you do so you will be refused admittance i do not wish to speak to you i do not wish ever to see you again if you are prepared to comply with these conditions please read the contract and sign it roark reached for a pen and signed without looking at the paper you have not read it said wynand roark threw the paper across the desk please sign both copies roark obeyed thank you said wynand signed the sheets and handed one to roark this is your copy roark slipped the paper into his pocket i have not mentioned the financial part of the undertaking it is an open secret that the socalled wynand empire is dead it is sound and doing as well as ever throughout the country with the exception of new york city it will last my lifetime but it will end with me i intend to liquidate a great part of it you will therefore have no reason to limit yourself by any consideration of costs in your design of the building you are free to make it cost whatever you find necessary the building will remain long after the newsreels and tabloids are gone yes mr wynand i presume you will want to make the structure efficiently economical in maintenance costs but you do not have to consider the return of the original investment theres no one to whom it must return yes mr wynand if you consider the behavior of the world at present and the disaster toward which it is moving you might find the undertaking preposterous the age of the skyscraper is gone this is the age of the housing project which is always a prelude to the age of the cave but you are not afraid of a gesture against the whole world this will be the last skyscraper ever built in new york it is proper that it should be so the last achievement of man on earth before mankind destroys itself mankind will never destroy itself mr wynand nor should it think of itself as destroyed not so long as it does things such as this as what as the wynand building that is up to you dead things such as the banner are only the financial fertilizer that will make it possible it is their proper function he picked up his copy of the contract folded it and put it with a precise gesture into his inside coat pocket he said with no change in the tone of his voice i told you once that this building was to be a monument to my life there is nothing to commemorate now the wynand building will have nothing except what you give it he rose to his feet indicating that the interview was ended roark got up and inclined his head in parting he held his head down a moment longer than a formal bow required at the door he stopped and turned wynand stood behind his desk without moving they looked at each other wynand said build it as a monument to that spirit which is yours and could have been mine on a spring day eighteen months later dominique walked to the construction site of the wynand building she looked at the skyscrapers of the city they rose from unexpected spots out of the low roof lines they had a kind of startling suddenness as if they had sprung up the second before she saw them and she had caught the last thrust of the motion as if were she to turn away and look again fast enough she would catch them in the act of springing she turned a corner of hells kitchen and came to the vast cleared tract machines were crawling over the torn earth grading the future park from its center the skeleton of the wynand building rose completed to the sky the top part of the frame still hung naked an intercrossed cage of steel glass and masonry had followed its rise covering the rest of the long streak slashed through space she thought they say the heart of the earth is made of fire it is held imprisoned and silent but at times it breaks through the clay the iron the granite and shoots out to freedom then it becomes a thing like this she walked to the building a wooden fence surrounded its lower stories the fence was bright with large signs advertising the names of the firms who had supplied materials for the tallest structure in the world steel by national steel inc glass by ludlow electrical equipment by wellsclairmont elevators by kessler inc nash dunning contractors she stopped she saw an object she had never noticed before the sight was like the touch of a hand on her forehead the hand of those figures in legend who had the power to heal she had not known henry cameron and she had not heard him say it but what she felt now was as if she were hearing it and i know that if you carry these words through to the end it will be a victory howard not just for you but for something that should win that moves the world and never wins acknowledgment it will vindicate so many who have fallen before you who have suffered as you will suffer she saw on the fence surrounding new yorks greatest building a small tin plate bearing the words howard roark architect she walked to the superintendents shed she had come here often to call for roark to watch the progress of construction but there was a new man in the shed who did not know her she asked for roark mr roark is way up on top by the water tank whos calling maam mrs roark she answered the man found the superintendent who let her ride the outside hoist as she always did a few planks with a rope for a railing that rose up the side of the building she stood her hand lifted and closed about a cable her high heels poised firmly on the planks the planks shuddered a current of air pressed her skirt to her body and she saw the ground dropping softly away from her she rose above the broad panes of shop windows the channels of streets grew deeper sinking she rose above the marquees of movie theaters black mats held by spirals of color office windows streamed past her long belts of glass running down the squat hulks of warehouses vanished sinking with the treasures they guarded hotel towers slanted like the spokes of an opening fan and folded over the fuming matchsticks were factory stacks and the moving gray squares were cars the sun made lighthouses of peaked summits they reeled flashing long white rays over the city the city spread out marching in angular rows to the rivers it stood held between two thin black arms of water it leaped across and rolled away to a haze of plains and sky flat roofs descended like pedals pressing the buildings down out of the way of her flight she went past the cubes of glass that held dining rooms bedrooms and nurseries she saw roof gardens float down like handkerchiefs spread on the wind skyscrapers raced her and were left behind the planks under her feet shot past the antennae of radio stations the hoist swung like a pendulum above the city it sped against the side of the building it had passed the line where the masonry ended behind her there was nothing behind her now but steel ligaments and space she felt the height pressing against her eardrums the sun filled her eyes the air beat against her raised chin she saw him standing above her on the top platform of the wynand building he waved to her the line of the ocean cut the sky the ocean mounted as the city descended she passed the pinnacles of bank buildings she passed the crowns of courthouses she rose above the spires of churches then there was only the ocean and the sky and the figure of howard roark
