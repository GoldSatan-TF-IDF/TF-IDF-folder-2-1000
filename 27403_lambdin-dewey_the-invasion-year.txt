woe to the vanquished history book x titus livius livy bc ad chapter one damme but i do despise the bloody french understandably sir the first lieutenant softly agreed their bloody general rochambeau captain alan lewrie rn further gravelled hed surrender tthat murderous general dessalines and his black rebel army but hes too damned proud tstrike to us well dessalines did give them ten days truce to make an orderly exit sir lt westcott pointed out else it would have been a massacre another really if they dont come out and surrender to us soon itll be all frogs legs flambe and dessalines truce bedamned captain lewrie said with a mirthless laugh as he extended his telescope to its full length for another peek into the harbour of cap francois and at the ships anchored inside on which the french now huddled driven from the last fingernail grasp of their west indies colony evidently the black victors of the long savage insurrection were getting anxious over when the french would depart too for those solid stone forts which had guarded the port from sea assault showed thin skeins of smoke rising not from cookfires but from forges where iron shot could be heated redhot amberhot to set afire those ships and all the beaten french survivors aboard themsoldiers civilians sailors women and children root and branch damn their eyes lewrie thought burn em all root and branch he lowered his glass and grimaced as he turned to face his first officer lt geoffrey westcott is it askin too much dye imagine sir that the frogs could face facts which is the greater failure or shame admittin the rebel slaves beat em like a rug and surrenderin tthem or strikin to a civilised foe like us theyve done the first so what matters the second perhaps its the matter of commodore lorings terms sir lt westcott supplied inclining his head towards their senior officers flagship idling under reduced sail further out to seaward he will not let them disarm and sail for france on their parole be a fool if he did lewrie said with a dismissive snort and admiraltyd never forgive him for it if he did wed escort them to jamaica intern their civilians make the women and kiddies comfortable rochambeau and all his officersd be offered parole quarters and funds til theyre exchanged of course wed sling all their sailors and soldiers into the prisoner hulks lt westcott added with a touch of whimsy then in a tongueincheek manner said and surely some of those french jeunes filles or fetching young widows surely some of them are sir might find themselves in need of a british officers protection hmm well capt lewrie allowed rocking on the balls of his feet making his hessian boots creak they were new from a cobbler at kingston still in need of breaking in i expect youd be one to make such an offer mister westcott i warrant youre a generous soul he said with a leer since their first acquaintance fittingout their new frigate at the renewal of the war with france a little after easter lewrie had discovered that geoffrey westcott was a buckofthefirsthead when it came to putting the leg over biddable young ladies almost himself to the tee in his younger frivolous days well i hope to be sir lt westcott replied shrugging in false modesty or piety it was hard to tell which and flashing a brief teethbaring grin before turning sober and salty once more wish ye joy of it lewrie said turning to probe the harbour with his telescope once more cap francois casually known as le cap in better days had at one time been the richest entrepot on the french colony of saint domingue rivalling jacmel mole st nicholas or portauprince itself nigh a thousand ships had put in there each year with all the luxuries of europe and the orient and had cleared laden deep with sugar rice molasses and rum making saint domingue the richest prize of all the sugar islands richer than all the british possessions put together cap francois and mole st nicholas further west out towards the extreme norwestern cape of saint domingue were well placed for tradeon the north side of the colony accessible to the passages out into the broad atlantic which made for shorter voyages to american or european markets give the frogsa little credit lewrie thought at least they made something of their half of hispaniola the eastern half of hispaniola was held by the spanish but san domingo had never produced a pittance of wealth compared to the french half cattle herding sheep and pigs subsistence farming along with the boucaniers who dressed in hides and had become the dreaded buccaneers of pirate lore now though it was all lost to both france and any other nation which might try to possess it as great britain had in those early days of the french revolution when theyd landed an army ashore and had been fought back to the beaches and piers by the rebel slaves when they werent fighting their former grands blancs masters or the petits blancs and halfbloods or each other for dominance that brute general dessalines had once been an aide to the former house slave toussaint louverture whod turned out to be a much more brilliant general than any that the french had sent to fight and die here over thirty generals lewrie had heard tell and over fourty thousand french soldiers had perished including napoleons brotherinlaw general leclerc oh leclerc had managed to lure louverture to a parley and had enchained him then shipped him to die in an alpine prison in francedead of cold hunger and heartbreak that napoleon bonaparte would betray him the napoleon of the west and break all the promises of the french revolution of liberte fraternite and egalite of the heady vows of abolishing slavery anywhere in every french colony in hopes that without louverture the rebellion would end it wasnt even saint domingue anymore either now the rebel slaves had begun to call it haiti or hayti whichso far as lewrie could tell from the many battlestothedeath the ambushes of whole battalions at a whack the massacres of masters mistresses and overseers and prettymuch anyone else of the former ruling castes and the betrayals that had taken place heretranslated from creole patois as hell on earth the last desperate refuges for the surviving french of saint domingue were the ships in harbour anchored as far out as they could from the shore guns but still be in the port proper to venture out further would put them at risk of being raided and boarded at night by the blockading british squadron oned hope that rochambeau had wits enough tspike his coast artillery before he abandoned the forts mister westcott captain lewrie said to his waiting first lieutenant well he is french sir so theres no telling their frigate hms reliant along with the rest of the squadron that had sailed from portsmouth in may on an independent mission lay three miles to seaward of the coast right at the edge of what had come to be accepted as the limits of a nations or islands sovereignty the three mile limit three miles because that was the rangetorandom shot of the largest fortress gun then in use the pounder had the french ever had pounders emplaced on saint domingue lewrie didnt know but just to err on the side of caution that was how far out commodore loring had decided they would come to anchor he couldnt be that huge a fool as tleave em in place then anchor right under em lewrie commented as i said sir he is french after all westcott said mostlike the rebels have only field guns regimental guns of six eight or twelvepound shot lewrie speculated twelvepounders firing heated shot would more than suffice at that range from the shore to the anchored french sir lt westcott opined as he briefly doffed his hat to swab his forehead with a faded handkerchief almost the last day of november in the year of our lord or not it was a bright sunny and almost windless day mmmhmm lewrie agreed intent again on the ships yonder there appeared to be at least two large compagnie des indies threemasted ships as big as east indiamen perhaps another brace of similarlysized french national ships of the line that seemed to be crammed from bilges to poop decks with humanity en flute or completely disarmed lewrie judged them else theyd be completely elbows tarseholes if theyre still armed and of a mind tresist us he told himself with a wry grin with no place tput the women and children if they tried there were a couple of frigates one of them a very handsome and big one of at least guns or better there were some lighter smaller twomasted brigs even some locallybuilt schooners did the french see the sense of it and strike to lorings squadron thered be a nice pot of prizemoney due even if it had to be shared by every british warship then in sight at the moment of their striking their colours dont half mind the french perishin in flames but we all could use some tin lewrie thought be a shame tlose those ships beyond the ships ashore lewrie had seen cap francois back in at the tailend of the american revolution when he had had his brief actingcommand of the shrike brig for a few weeks it had looked prosperous then he had trailed his colours before it in the s in hms proteus his first frigate during his first postcaptaincy when the slave rebellion had burst aflame and cap francois had even then seemed safe secure and ordered as if the french had kept the uprising and slaughter at bay deep inland and well away from the port now it was dowdy charred and filthy the looted mansions and goods warehouses broken and gaping and the harbourside streets and piers teeming with taunting jeering exslaves what possessions the french had abandoned in their haste to flee made a colourful sea of silks and satins being haggled or fought over by the victors and draped the native women there was street dancing some very faint snatches of music making lewrie think that he was watching some feral carnivale and when the gentle seabreeze faltered he could almost make out the dread rhythmic thud of voudoun drumming the sort that had made him prickle with fear his one night ashore long ago at portauprince the drumming that had presaged the evacuation of the british army to cut their losses to battle poisonings smallparty ambushes and the everpresent malaria and yellow jack if there were any french left ashore for lack of room aboard the anchored ships then god help them theyd have been hunted down torn from even the deepest hidings then butchered raped and tortured or burned alive or beheadedperhaps guillotined in proper french fashionas the last to atone for centuries of slavery and all of the cruelties that came with it or he imagined for the vindictive victorious fun of it one more day and upon the th of november the french would sail and surrender or burn in hell and haiti or hayti would become an independent black republic the only one of its kind in the world born in a decade or more of bloodrain monsoons signal from the flag midshipman entwhistle piped up from the taffrails aft of lewrie and the first lieutenant our number sir captain repair on board sir what the devil lewrie wondered aloud ill pass word for your coxn and boat crew sir lt westcott said in a crisper tone with a doff of his hat aye but whatever for lewrie muttered to himself chapter two when one was summoned by a senior officer it was a given that it would be with all despatch with no time frittered in shaving sponging off or primping pettus had come up from his greatcabins with lewries everyday sword belt and hanger and a clean uniform coat to replace a cotton one long ago gone bad a sorry experiment in tropical clothing that had faded and bled darkblue dye to the point that it had gone a spotty sky blue the gilt lace trim verdisgris green and sickmaking but it was comfortable was so bleached it could ruin no more shirts waistcoats or breeches and it was cool unlike the requisite broadcloth wool coat liam desmond his coxswain strokeoar patrick furfy desmonds longtime mate and the rest of the boat crew had been ready below the entryport by the time lewrie had taken reliants ritualist departure honours and within minutes they were off for a long mile row out to the twodecker flagship plenty of time for lewrie to fret that on the one hand he and the other officers of their wee fourship squadron had won fame and a pot of prizemoney back in september when they had succeeded in chasing down a french squadron that had sailed from frenchoccupied holland for saint domingue then new orleans they had met them off the chandeleur islands east of the passes into the mississippi and had fought a spirited hours action resulting in the capture of one twodecker a frigate and two corvettes and an east indiaman that had been reputed to carry a battalion of troops and government officials for the ceremonial handover of new orleans and all the louisiana territory to the united states after recovering them by treaty from spain that fame had come with a tinge of scandal for lewrie for he had run down the indiaman alone then decided to let the french civiliansrefugees from saint domingue for the most partbe put ashore from lake borgne to make the fifteenmile trek to new orleans and freedom some newspaper accounts thought it an honourable gesture of christian magnanimity the act of a proper british hero fellow officers in the west indies had deemed it daft and softhearteddash it all but hadnt napoleon bonaparte ordered lewries death over some insult during the peace of amiens and the ogres men had killed his wife with a cowardly shot in the back at the very moment they had almost made a clean escape by boat damme if the french hadnt so why would a chap like lewrie show a whit of mercy to the frogs had they been in his boots theyd have not by god raised from the cradle to hate the french like the very devil as all good englishmen should with anger and grief over carolines murder to stoke his hatred whitehot still lewrie could not make war on helpless civilians on women or children hed had a moment admittedly when ordering a broadside had been so tempting but he had not he could have taken them all back to jamaica with the navy crews of the other prizes but had they not suffered enough they were innocent of carolines death and new orleans had been so close by which camps loring in i wonder lewrie thought as the oarsmen set a powerful stroke seaward am i saint or sinner to him ah captain lewrie welcome sir commodore loring said with all evident delight as lewrie entered the greatcabins a glass will you sir aye thatd be fine sir lewrie replied looking about at the gathering of officers a steward came with a glass of cool rhenish for him and lewrie took a tentative sip captain john bligh of theseus loring went on doing the introductions captain barre captain lewrie of reliant pardons for my brevity but french pride and their touchy sense of honour force me to be brief i am sending a delegation to general rochambeau once more his last warning does he not sail out and strike his colours i will leave him to the doubtful mercies of the rebel blacks at the same time i am despatching another delegation ashore to speak with this socalled general dessalines and his cohorts bligh and barre are to speak for me lewrie but given your long experience with the colony of saint domingue i thought it useful to send you along with them lewrie to supply these gentlemen with your insights what lewrie thought gawping his mouth dropped agape at the idea his eyes went wide what bloody experience what insights beg pardon sir lewrie said once hed got his breath back in a previous commission i came tknow the coasts mainwell but as for what passes ashore did you not enter mole saint nicholas loring snapped peering at him owlishly spend some time ashore at portauprince when our army was here one night in a whorehouse lewrie recalled we were close ashore at mole saint nicholas sir providing indirect fire for our troops lewrie explained i did go ashore for a day to visit a friend at his regiment and dined ashore that night in portauprince the night the city was invested by louverture and his army and we began the evacuation sir those damned drums he remembered how theyd thudded like bloody beating hearts ripped from the chests of the massacred they scared the piss outta me for certain and put my highyellow girl into pluperfect shits tboot dont see how thats useful no fluency in their creole lingo captain barre asked a brow up in doubt no background information i doubt anyone speaks their private patois sir lewrie told him but they deal with the outside world in french dont they as for background information well i did pick up on whohateswho and how much the various massacres and betrayals but know much of dessalines do you captain barre pressed now with a faint sneer of disappointment christophe petion and clairveaux all four of em have been betrayed betrayed each other even turned on louverture more times than ive had hot suppers captain barre lewrie replied he had no wish to go ashore and deal with the rebel generals no wish to put himself at that much risk but the way barre spoke to him rankled none of em have a shred o trust for any europeans at this point he added after a sip of his coolish wine and with good reason commodore loring interjected after what the late unlamented general leclerc and this chap rochambeau did to them they came with a plan for complete extermination of any blacks living on the island and thought to repopulate it with fresh slaves unaffected by thoughts of independence or liberty that is the only way that saint domingue could be returned to profitability loring said with a shrug their principal exports depend upon slave labour rochambeau deliberately rounded up blacks and mulattoes and drowned them by the umpteenthousands right here in le cap bay not a year past theyll burn the ships and the survivors to hell captain john bligh said with a sigh with very good cause unless we arrange for the french departure i will offer rochambeau and his naval officers rescue from that fate loring told them but only if they sail out by the deadline he has agreed to with dessalines tomorrow i will allow them to fire broadsides as honourable tokens before striking their colours but that is all i will allow for the sake of humanity i wish the rebel generals to accede to that arrangement you gentlemen will deliver to dessalines the full meaning of my terms to rochambeau and extract from him an agreement that he will not fire upon the french ships if they obey you sir and leave harbour lewrie pointed out if rochambeau does not fort picolets forges are already kindled then let us pray that general rochambeau has seen that too and will be convinced that departing cap francois is in his best interests hmm commodore loring replied all of us sir captain barre ever a skeptic enquired with a cuttyeyed glance at lewrie aye all of you loring told the man with a shrug cocking his head to one side as if thinking that three was more impressive than two or that seeing as how they were already up and dressed well then lets be about it hey lewrie said tossing off his wine and plastering a confident smile on his phyz no matter the gurgly qualms in his nether regions that threatened to make themselves known to one and all aye ill go he told himself if only to rankle barre chapter three they landed at the quays in commodore lorings barge a rather more impressive conveyance than any of their captains gigs with her oarsmen tricked out in snowy white sloptrousers shirts and stockings flat tarred hats with fluttering long ribbons painted with the name of lorings flagship in freshblacked shoes with silverplated buckles and darkblue short jackets with polished brass buttons and just in case with cutlasses muskets and pistols stowed out of sight under waterproof tarred tarpaulins in the boats sole they and their white flag of truce were met by a guard of honour and a fellow who introduced himself as a colonel who spoke fluent almost parisian french and heavily accented english the soldiers of the guard warm though it was were accoutred as well as any soldiers that lewrie had seen in paris during the peace of amiens from their brasstrimmed shakoes to their trousers with dark blue tailcoats and white waistcoats whiteleather crossbelts with brass plates shining none wore stockings or shoes though the colonel by name of mirabois wore a foreandaft bicorne hat with an egret plume and lots of gold lace a snug doublebreasted uniform coat with lavish gilt acanthus leaves embroidered on pocket flaps his sleeve cuffs and the stiff standing collars of the coat sweat himself tdeath in all that wool lewrie thought bonjour messieurs vous ave come to surrender to us oui er ehm what captain bligh gawped taken by surprise ze tout petite plaisanterie ha ha ze wee jest oh ha ha i see ehm bligh flummoxed commodore loring ehm our commodore in command of his britannic majestys squadron now lying off cap francois has directed us to deliver a proposal to your general dessalines and a request to speak with him should that be possible bligh explained in halting schoolboy french as nighilliterate as me lewrie thought noting how captain barre their resident critic pursed his lips and almost grimaced to hear it bligh was surely senior to him else barre would have been the one to conduct the negotiations and was certain that he wouldve been more effective at it he was frowning like an irate tutor at his students lack of fluency bligh introduced them all then waited his document held out in expectation that it would be accepted and whisked off to dessalines instanter in the short period of their landing and introductions a substantial crowd of the curious had gathered poor field slaves still in the cheap nankeen short trousers and loose smocks of slavery their women in shapeless longer smocks and the children in barely any garments at all many of them had canecutter knives or machetes shoved into rough rope belts or in their hands ominously some of the bettergarbed looters in incongruous finery and betterarmed with captured muskets or pistols joined them muttering and scowling french english bloody russians lewrie thought with a bit of rising dread were white their blood enemies this could get very ugly messieurs i leave ze guard pour votre boat oui et i will escort vous au le tigre is own face colonel mirabois offered then turned and barked orders to his men a round dozen of his soldiers formed a protective line to protect the barge its wideeyed midshipman coxswain and oarsmen at the head of the quay and another dozen formed to either side of their party like prisoners off tthe guillotine or firin squad lewrie imagined with it must be admitted a bit of a chill shudder a black sergeant gleefully called a fast heepheep pace as they were marched off to see le tigre dessalines facetoface think theydve laid on some horses captain bligh whispered from the side of his mouth panting a bit at the pace already ate em mostlike lewrie whispered back unable to quell his sense of humour no matter the risk they faced and how come theres still so many whites ashore i wonder he pointed out it was uncanny it was downright eerie that long march through the littered streets now they were under official escort the blacks and lighter mulattoes stood and scowled at the strange officers with no sound no jeering or hooting as theyd heard at the quays around the edges of the crowds stood white french colonists men women and children lewrie could pick out the ones he imagined had been wealthy planters and slave owners rich traders and exporters by the finery of their clothing the grands blancs lewrie recalled their being called the others though the ones in humbler suits or workingmens garb with their women in simpler drabber gowns and the children in the same sort of handmedown shabby one could see in poorer neighbourhoods in england were the artificers the shopkeepers the greengrocers fruiterers and skilled labourers the petits blancs who might never have been able to aspire to owning slaves what had jemmy peel told him when in the west indies on foreign office secret branch doings in the s and sniffing about how to undermine the french the slave rebellion or both saint domingue or hayti was a bubbling cauldron of rebellion poor whites versus their betters mulattoes versus darker illiterate field hands house servants siding with masters in some cases murdering them in others petits blancs then siding with mulattoes like general rigaud down south round jacmel to fight louverture dessalines and the others and all wrenched from time to time by siding with the french if theyd seemed to have the upper hand with the british when their own army had landed even looking for shelter and security by allying themselves with the spanish in the other half of hispaniola if that looked better uhm colonel mirabois lewrie asked at last his curiosity aroused i note a fair number of blancs still in the city were they not able to find space aboard the ships mais oui msieur capitaine le pardon seulement votre name i cannot say ees tres difficile nestce pas mirabois laughed rather drolly as he explained zey refuse place in ze ships msieur ave been born hereave property et business interests comprend hayti ees open to ze trade so zey make accommodation wis ze ozzer blancs oo go away hayti ave need of zem so he said shrugging in very gallic fashion incredible was all that lewrie could think to say ze blancs oo stay zey know zings we pauvre noirs do not mirabois said further ave ze education ze dealing wis ze outside world he admitted with another of those pearlywhite smiles then sobered quickly to look almost feral until we learn zese zings zenoo knows moi i desire blanc servants ha ha ha i make ze pauvre plaisanterie again nestce pas aw ha ha ha their escorts led them from the looted charred shabbiness of the harbour front to wide streets leading inland to a mansion district of substantial houses what lewrie took for banks and perhaps government buildings all smoothly stuccoed and painted once in white and gay tropical pastels all with even more substantial double doors and impressive sets of iron bars on the tall windows most were shut tight against the victorious slave armies their window shutters doublebarred some had been nailed shut perhaps years before as their prosperous owners fled the colony some of those were now in the process of being torn open with crowlevers or smashed open with heavy mauls though it seemed an orderly process not a looting by a jeering mob the deeds were done by workgangs or companies of black troops supervised by their officers their escort halted in front of a pale yellowpainted government office building with blue doors and shutters and spanishlooking roof tiles soldiers in neat clean uniforms stood guard over the entrance though they made no moves to stop the stream of officers runners and idling gawkers both military and civilian who wandered in with pipes or cigaros fuming chatting and pointing at their former masters splendours as gay as magpies colonel mirabois left them for a long time standing in direct sunlight and steamy heat before returning and gesturing them inside across the high and spacious lobby and up a long curving flight of stairs to the upper floor then into a receiving room large enough to accommodate a goodsized hunt ball of two hundred or more very energetic couples at a contredance messieurs mon generals colonel mirabois loftily began as he introduced the british delegation then made introductions for the splendidly uniformed men who stood behind a massive oakandmarble desk general dessalines mirabois said as that worthy glared at them a big tough brutallooking man illiterate i heard lewrie whispered to bligh and barre general christophe once a british slave brought here hotel waiter here in cap francois lewrie further whispered speaks english christophe was not as big as the rest and didnt look quite as threatening general clairveaux mirabois said of a solid mulatto man betrayals his meat an drink lewrie related play any side gainst the other captain barre turned his head slightly to look at lewrie with an eyebrow up the sort of look one gave to a talking dog damme lewrie thought i mustve picked up more than i thought i had from the last time i was here useful insights gossip after that lewrie stood aside having no role to play as bligh presented his formal written proposal from commodore loring colonel mirabois took it and handed it to general dessalines which was fruitless since he was illiterate a former field slave grudgingly that worthy had to pass it to either christophe or the bettereducated general clairveaux glowering even darker and fiercer first at the british delegation which had put him in that embarrassment then at his two compatriots who mostlikely were scheming to become the supreme leader of their new nation clairveauxs a schemer barre muttered from the corner of his mouth barely moving his lips supposedly loyal to france and sonthonax when he was here then rigaud and his mulattoes down south then louverture and the spanish slippery as an eel lewrie whispered back mightve backed leclerc fore he died of yellow jack you puny lying white bastards general christophe barked angrily after hed read the letter and heard bligh out go back to europe the rest of the indies and slaughter each other but do not dare to dabble in haytis affairs any longer damn all you british but if not for your presence the french would already be gone that was shouted in english christophe turned to his compatriots dessalines and clairveaux and repeated himself in rapid slurred french windmilling his arms and going so far as to spit on the floor and pound a fist on the marble table top so hard that he made it jump massive and heavy as it was about the size of a jollyboat to lewries lights general dessalines rumbled out an equal flood of bile in a deep basso glaring at the trio of british officers and gripping the hilt of his elegant sword so hard that his dark fingers changed colour clairveaux not to be outdone barked out his own flood of threats not exactly nelsons band o brothers are they lewrie told himself he found it amusing until the roars for slaughter and blood bath reached the ears of the many revolutionaries beyond those double doors and lewrie heard a bloodchilling chant he hadnt heard in years eh eh bomba heu heu canga bafio te canga moune de le canga do ki la canga li sound in good spirits captain barre commented turning about to cock an ear with a confident smile false mostlike given their hosts attitude it means we swear to destroy all the whites and all that they possess let us die rather than fail to keep this vow lewrie nervously translated in a low mutter this is gettin serious sir mon general dessalines e say messieurs zat you british are ze so despicable ze grasping beasts as bad as ze french mirabois translated looking a tad nervous himself you killed zousands of notre pauvre soldiers came to saint domingue to conquer and enslave e say e despise all of you and vish every white devil to die seulemente also say if rochambeau surrender to you and leave ze harbour tomorrow e will not fire on zeir ships zey stay une hour longer e will fire upon zem and burn zem all to hades e agree wiz votre commodore loring in ziz you ave ees word of honnour e say votre commodore mus be satisfyed vis zat not ze correspondent letter maintenant you go i see you to ze port in safety or pay vis my life vite vite go captain bligh opened his mouth as if to say something further but clapped it shut as colonel mirabois began urgent shovingherding motions backing them ignominously towards the doors and looking back over his shoulder to see if any of the bile the british had engendered from the victorious generals would stick to him for bringing them in a trice they were down the stairs across the grand lobby and out into the sunshine with their escorting soldiers guarding them even closer with bayonetmounted muskets held out to fence off and deter the chanting fistshaking weaponshaking mob picking up on their officers nervousness and the hostile mood in the building they left behind those soldiers set a wicked pace back to the quays and their waiting barge forcing bligh barre and lewrie to trot doubletime once the barge was shoved off and under oars with a wee union jack in the bows and a large white flag of truce stood up by the midshipman in the sternsheets they finally got their breaths back and broke out a small barrico of stale water from beneath the seat for the barges coxswain they took turns gulping from a battered pewter mug and swabbing their reddened faces ruddy from being unused to so much exertion after the restrictions of shipboard life and the embarrassing manner of their departure they had almost been shoved aboard the boat bit iffy there for a moment bligh commented be back in ten years captain barre breezily opined now that he was in calmer takings can you gentlemen imagine that those three jackanapes or their other generals petion and moise can really run a country he scoffed morelike it will be a decade of civil war between them before the country is so devastated and depopulated that it will be ripe for the plucking we had hopes that the americansd beg tbe back in the fold too when we left in lewrie pointed out barbaric as are our american cousins sir captain barre rejoined they dont hold a candle to those savages back yonder and the yankee doodles are white and civilised after all different kettle of fish captain bligh stuck in with a mirthless laugh i say let us take a slant to starboard and look over our future prizes assuming general rochambeau has a lick of sense aye sir their midshipman in charge of the barge agreed and the tiller was put over to angle their boat closer to the french ships indiamen there a brace of em dont see any guns in their ports lewrie pointed out thatun though shes a twodecker a third rate seventyfour and still armed all the gunports on each beam of the were hinged open for desperately needed ventilation any wisp of a breeze that could sweep through both her overcrowded gundecks to relieve the panting of the hundreds of pale faces pressed close to the openings those people had no other place to go for the weather decks gangways poops and forecastles and quarterdecks of all the french vessels were already teeming with refugees almost arseholestoelbows lovely pair of frigates there captain bligh said with an avid note in his voice as they passed the twodecker chlorinde and surv surveillante he read off their nameboards on the transoms as big as our frigates of the fifth rate thirtyeights or better the frigate closest to them had her single row of gunports open too with children and teenagers sitting on the barrels of her guns to be close to the fresher air and haloes of faces round every edge might be nigh a thousand people aboard thisun alone sirs lewrie said with a grim shake of his head were i a frog id be onboard one of em too lewrie thought beats bein murdered all hollow be a shame does dessalines set them ablaze captain bligh told them sounding sad yon brace of frigates would fetch us fifteen or twenty thousand pounds each perhaps thirty thousand for that third rate and about the same for the indiamen each head and gun money for all the sailors and soldiers captured to boot captain barre pointed out well perhaps but half that much sir lewrie told bligh i think our prize courts would mostlike steal half for themselves oh tosh barre said with a chuckle they aint cut up from a drubbin and wont need serious refits like most french warships weve made prize even so aye it would be a pity do those apes ashore burn them up dessalines might just do it for spite bligh suggested to show us how little he cares for us or the french or any whites beg pardon sirs but theres a breeze coming up their midshipman hesitantly interjected pointing an arm to the windrippled patch of water off their barges larboard bows are your observations done sirs id care to steer for it and hoist the lugsl might be enough wind to carry us beyond the harbour mole and out to a decent seabreeze aye captain bligh seniormost of their party agreed spare your oarsmen three or four miles of rowing hey you left your gig at the flagship captain lewrie captain barre casually enquired sent her back to reliant not knowing how long wed be away sir lewrie told him shes closer inshore than the flag well now our duty has been done theres no reason to detain you any longer barre said as the barge crossed the millpond flat water for that disturbed patch now as big as a lake and growing larger as the breeze picked up two of their oarsmen stowed away their oars and began to fetch up the lugsail which with its simple running rigging was wrapped about its upper gaff boom make for the reliant frigate once under sail captain barre directed the midshipman well spare captain lewrie here the long time itd take him to send for his gig twiddle his thumbs aboard the flag and another hour or two to return to his ship thats most kind of ye sir thankee lewrie told barre as he pulled out his pocketwatch to note the time it was already almost a quarter to one pm aboard reliant theyd soon be sounding two bells of the day watch and her commission officers sailing master lieutenant of marines and surgeon would be sitting down to take their midday dinner now that the ships people had had their own mess if barre had not made the offer even with a decent wind it would have been at least pm before they would have fetched the flagship and perhaps two more hours before he could expect to sit down to a meal of his own there might have been some leftovers from commodore lorings table if he begged properly but even this quick return to his ship would result in whatever cold collation that his personal cook yeovill had athand the ships cook would be just beginning to boil up victuals for the crews supper with nothing to offer him itll be wormy cheese and ships bisquit lewrie bemoaned some jam or a slicer two off last nights roast the cats sausages and lewrie was feeling most peckish by then chapter four the appointed morning dawned cooler than the day before though the seabreezes that had blown light but steadily throughout the night began to fade and clock round the compass by the start of the forenoon watch at am if anything it was replaced by a faint landbreeze as the island of hispaniola was heated by the risen sun the waters about hms reliant dropped to a slight twofoot chop and long rolling wave sets that slatted the remaining wind from her foreandaft sails and spanker and fluttered her square sails to the accompaniment of slapping rigging and the loose squeal of blocks to the basso of the hull as it rocked heaved and scended her timbers groaning the tide ebbs from the harbour when mister caldwell her captain enquired a tad impatiently pacing about the freshly cleaned quarterdeck from the starboard bulwarks facing cap francois to the binnacle cabinet and doublewheel helm and back by my ephemeris sir it should have turned half an hour ago reliants sailing master informed him after another quick peek at his book of tide tables and a sidelong glance at the gathered officers mean they aint coming out marine lt simcock complained the landbreeze seems to be strengthening a bit lieutenant spendlove the second officer noted that and the ebbing tide should carry them out nicely if theyre of a mind the reliants people from her captain to her commission sea officers to her midshipmen warrants petty officers able and ordinary seamen her landsmen idlers and waisters her marines and ships boys and servants were all on deck half were on watch of course but the rest were there to satisfy their curiosity and to see if their prizemoney would actually sail out and surrender or if they did not their burning would be a raree wagers slyly made during the night rode on the results even lewries cats toulon the older stockier blackandwhite and chalky the greysplotched whiteun were on deck this morning and when not perched atop the canvas coverings of the quarterdeck hammock nettings were scampering about in pursuit of a champagne cork with a length of ribbon tied round it footballing it from one end of the quarterdeck to the other hopping up on their hind legs in mock battle to play tailchase when the champagne cork toy palled yed think someone slipped em some fresh catnip last night lewrie grumbled forced to halt his pacing as chalky chased toulon aft right through his booted legs damn my eyes ye little they do seem very spry today sir lt westcott the first officer agreed watching them go flashing his teeth in a brief grin as toulon fluffed up turned sideways and hopped in warning at his playmate one paw lifted and his bottledup tail lashing deck there midshipman rossyngton called down from his wee seat on the main mast crosstrees the french are making sail the youngster pealed out each word distinct come on yer beauties a sailor on the starboard gangway was heard to hoot come out an fetch us yer guineas which raised a great cheer and laughter lewrie went to the binnacle cabinet to fetch his telescope just in time for chalky to be the pursued and take bottledup refuge atop the cabinet toulon always the lessagile since he was a kitten could only stand on his hind legs with his front paws on the woodwork and make moaning sounds whilst chalky hissed back and spat everbodys celebratin seems like quartermaster hook at the helm chuckled many a slip twixt the crouch and the leap though lewrie said with a grin keep yer fingers crossed he cautioned as he went to the bulwarks for a better view yes by god lewrie crowed once hed had a looksee faded patched and sunworn parchmenttan canvas was sprouting aboard every remaining vessel in harbour closer to shore several british barges or cutters were loafing with idled oars or furled lugsails waiting with small boarding parties from various ships to go aboard them once their honourable broadsides were fired and their colours struck to oversee their disarming lewrie lowered his telescope a trifle just in time to see one of the boats hold up a single signal flag from the new popham code to weigh excuse me sir but should we beat to quarters lt westcott asked close by lewries side with a telescope of his own in case they mean tmake a fight of it lewrie asked back with a grin ye didnt see how many people theyve taken aboard mister westcott theyre beyond overcrowded without enough room to swing a cat much less serve their guns dear as id desire it lewrie told himself if it was just us and their sailors and such without the civilians id love to lay into them the murderin bastards deck there midshipman rossyngton called down again the french are under way a seventyfour is leading took their own sweet time lewrie said with a snort now he was satisfied that they would come out the tide will help fetch them out but they have waited a bit too late sir the landbreeze wont last long westcott said with just the tide aye theyll be boxin the compass in an hour lewrie agreed unmanageable perhaps the smaller of them could employ sweeps lt westcott posed tongueincheek were it me id paddle a log with my hands to get out of port their third officer lt george merriman added with a guffaw the leading ship the twodecker came on as ponderously and as slowly as treacle poured on porridge on a winters day even under all her course sails and topsls and with her jibs and staysails loosely sheeted and bellied out she barely was making steerage way a vessel so heavy and deepdraughted found it hard to overcome her own inertia even on a good day with a following or beam wind lewrie pulled out his pocketwatch stuck an upright thumb against her to measure with and growled under his breath as he realised that the twodecker was not making much more than two or three knots and was still no larger than his thumbnail after a full halfhour under sail it would take her another halfhour just to pass the breakwater to the open sea with her potentially swifter and lighter consorts bunched up astern of her and their own sails trapping and stealing the wind of the landbreeze which was slowly fading shouldve let the weeuns sail first lewrie thought but hey theyre french and they will do it orderly tlook proud at long bloody last lt westcott muttered as the flagship of the french squadron passed through the breakwater and reached open waters as a weak gust of wind arose and soughed cross their frigates decks the noreast trades were coming back to life and over yonder the french twodeckers sails shivered and rustled in gross disorder for a moment before being sheeted home and braced round to adapt to it slowly bearing up roughly westnorwest presenting her larboard side to reliant and finally showing a tiny mustachio of foam under her forefoot as she put on another knot or two and when she was about a mile offshore still two miles short of reliant her guns began to roar down her larboard side first the spewing of gunpowder smoke then seconds later the flat thuds of the explosions a full broadside i say lt clarence spendlove the second officer exclaimed her pair of bow chase guns would have sufficed showy marine lt simcock commented and to hell with you perfidious britons lt westcott added with a laugh ve show vous ow to surrender vis panache and once the last after guns of her upper and lower batteries had shot their bolts and the immense pall of spent powder smoke was drifting leeward enough to see the twodecker again the bluewhitered tricolour of france was hauled down to drape over her taffrails and transom a lugsailed cutter flying a british jack quickly made its way alongside her to take possession next came the indiamen large merchant ships or former ships of the line employed as troop transports they mounted many fewer guns than the warship that had preceded them so they fired off only a halfdozen for their honourable broadsides perhaps only bowchasers and some light quarterdeck pieces before striking their colours as well one of those impressively big frigates passed through the breakwater after and found her wind rapidly gathering an impressive turn of speed before firing her final broadside and striking her colours followed by a gaggle of brigs snows or locallybuilt schooners all overloaded and clumsy on the ebbing tide and the scant wind but making decent progress to freedom and safety the second frigate however damn my eyes but has she taken the ground yonder lieutenant spendlove declared a telescope to his eye she doesnt seem to be moving there sir yawing all over creation before that aye clarence lieutenant merriman was quick to agree with him good god it appears that she has just past the breakwater the landbreeze failed her before she got much way upon her it appears sir lt westcott said turning to lewrie she looks aground on the eastern breakwater must have been crowded onto the shallows or carried there by the tide with no steerage way lewrie supposed aloud mister caldwell uhm theres a rocky shoal upon which they built the breakwater sir the sailing master quickly supplied with no need to refer to his harbour chart and a wide field of spoil rock and sand either side of it and if not dredged properly has encroached on the entrance channel do the trades turn brisk shell pound herself open poor devils a british rowing boat one waiting to take possession of a prize was wheeling about and stroking hard towards the french frigate now to render what assistance she could another the flagships barge that had borne lewrie and the others to the cap francois quays the day before was approaching her too now displaying a long signal flag held up by her midshipman assistance now hes come prepared for anything lewrie japed is there any aid we might give them sir lt spendlove ever a generous soul asked hmm was lewries reply as he mulled the matter the frogs could row their anchors out and warp themselves off he reckoned in his head or we could rig towlines of the stern anchor cables but thatd put us on a lee shore in those rocks mister caldwell how close could we anchor to her lewrie asked the sailing master near enough to pass her towin cables sadly no sir caldwell told him none of our cables are as long as would be needed less the warps taken round the mizen mast or capstan one hundred twenty fathoms was the length of the fleet and the bower anchor cables feet and reliant would put herself in that french frigates predicament did they try to get that close lewrie took another long look with his telescope pondering and measuring she might need a lateral haulin off in addition to what forward haul they might get with their own anchors we enter the harbour tack round then come to anchor abreast of her he schemed aloud no he decided lowering his glass did he sail reliant in it was good odds that dessalines and christophe would misinterpret it as a bloody raid and fire all that waiting heated shot at them even if they could dash in swing wide and tack round to try and anchor in the entrance channel by the second starboard bower would leave their stern swinging souwest driven by the noreast trade wind and no good for the french would result from that signal from the flag sir midshipman grainger called from the taffrails right aft our number sir and its render assistance oh fuck me lewrie groaned we would be nearest loring wont give up better than fifteen thousand pounds o prizemoney that easily very well mister grainger lewrie replied with a false air of enthusiasm hoist a positive reply mister westcott mister caldwell haul our wind and shape a course for the main channel i wish to come to anchor a safe distance from the frigate but within decent rowing distance mister spendlove ready the second bower for dropping once weve come about mister merriman see that all our ships boats are brought up from towin astern and ready tbe manned aye sir bosun sprague lt westcott called out ill see two hands on the fore channel platforms with sounding leads why couldnt commodore loring call on somebody tarryhanded stead o me lewrie gloomed ive never done this in me life chapter five hms reliant obeyed the flagships order but cautiously feeling her way shoreward under reduced sail with lewrie fretting over a chart pinned to the traverse hoard by the compass binnacle cabinet a ruler and a pair of brass dividers handy do we come about here mister caldwell lewrie posed about two cables off the breakwater in the middle of the channel then clew evrything up quick in spanish reefs uhmhmm sir caldwell replied already sounding dubious wed glide forrud for a bit perhaps half a cable more as the sails are taken in still in six fathoms o water lewrie went on let go the second bower and lay out but a fourtoone scope wed be about here he said tapping a tiny circled x in the middle of the entrance channel just outside the breakwaters in my professional opinion captain id not risk it caldwell said with a quick shake of his head does the anchor not get purchase at once well drag astern god knows how far and does it get a firm grip it would be the departure just as bad streaming bows onto the trades our stern aslant the channel without a kedge anchor laid out to keep her head due north or norwest sir soon as we broke the bower loose wed drift aground on the western breakwater shallows id not recommend it sir strongly then theres not much we can do to aid them is there mister caldwell lewrie gravelled standing fully erect and looking forward over the dipping jibboom and bowsprit at the stranded frigate that was now only a mile off come about and fetchto in ten fathoms of water a mile off and launch our boats is all sadly that would be best sir caldwell grimly allowed very well then relate that to mister westcott and advise him to when you wish us to put the helm over lewrie directed damme if the frogs cant get themselves warped off do i end up with all her people crowded aboard my ship lewrie thought if all else failed the french refugees had to be saved even if the valuable frigate was lost to the rebel slaves and what the commodore would make of that didnt bear thinking about im deep enough in the quag already over refugees lewrie lamented to himself french refugees in particular almost there mister caldwell westcott enquired rocking on the balls of his feet and his eyes dashing to take in everything that could affect their ship at once uhmm about half a minute more sir caldwell told him once were fetchedto mister westcott you will have the ship til i return lewrie announced of a sudden just after the idea came to his mind ill take my gig over tsee what needs doin ah aye aye sir ahem from caldwell ready about from lt westcott in a quarterdeck bellow with the aid of a speakingtrumpet ill save you a jeune fille lewrie told westcott with a smirk ready all ready all helms alee and round reliant swept even under reduced sail rapidly going about rise tacks and sheets and she kept on swinging cross the eyes of the trade wind sails rustling and slatting like musket fire her jibs and stays and spanker whooshing over to larboard and quickly hauled taut to keep forward drive on her on the starboard tack whilst the square sails were wheeled about pivotting on their ropeandball parrels about the masts most clewed up into untidy bag shapes spanish reefed and the forecourse and fore topsl braced flat aback to keep her from driving forward under the jibs pressure she ghosted on for a bit slowing slowing then do the trades pipe up mister westcott use the second bower if you think it truly necessary and well use our boats to haul her bows offwind enough to get way back on her lewrie said readying himself to debark if we cant get that frog frigate off then well we may end up with a horde o guests aboard til we parcel em out to the rest of the squadron aye aye sir lt westcott said nodding in surprise teeth bared in a news to me grin that way you can choose your own young lady without trustin my taste lewrie said leaning close to mutter lewrie took all four of reliants boats his gig the cutter the launch and the jollyboat each with a midshipman aboard mister houghton his competent but dull twentyoneyearold mister entwhistle the honourable nineteenyearold mister warburton their cheeky sixteenyearold and lastly mister munsell only thirteen but shaping mainwell as a tarryhanded tarpaulin lad all his most experienced the french frigate chlorinde lewrie noted from her nameboard seemed to be in decent shape so far she sat fully upright on an even keel and did not seem to have taken the ground so jarringly that her masts had sprung her upper masts and yards still stood her lower mast trunks were pictureperfect vertical she just wasnt going anywhere and though she was solidly aground and seemingly at rest her hull gave off alarming groans of timbers and thumping strained scantling planking as her outer hull rose and thudded on the rocky bottom hoy the ship lewrie called as his gig came alongside of her larboard entryport irritatingly no one paid him any mind instead he could hear rhythmic chanting of french pulleyhauley then noted that chlorindes main course yard was being used as a crane slowly a pounder or pounder gun was hoisted clear above her starboard bulwarks even more slowly swung clear of the hull and lowered they were lightening ship by jettisoning all her artillery overside to the shallow side there were more basso grunts as more of her crew laboured on the capstan her best bower anchor had been rowed out towards the channel depths and the cable was now bartaut in an effort to drag her bows free no matter how strongly her people breasted to the capstan bars though dug their shoes or bare toes into the deck and pressed forward with all their strength that didnt seem to be of any avail so far bugger their sideparty lewrie muttered his bow man had a good grip with a gaff on the frigates main chain platform and his gig was close alongside lewrie stood and made his way through his oarsmen stepped onto the boats gunnl and hopped onto the platform with me desmond furfy aye sor his irish coxn replied the battens were not sanded and the manropes strung loose on either hand of the battens were old and grey but they held lewrie made his way upwards step at a time thinking that stringing the manropes through the battens to make taut handrails as his own navy did made a lot more sense anybody home lewrie asked once hed gained the larboard gangway anybody bloody care as hed judged the day before there were at least a thousand people aboard the chlorinde sailors soldiers of infantrie de marine survivors of infantry regiments from shore and civilians everywhere all intent on heaving things overside on the far side of the ship qui vive msieur a french midshipman asked him eyes wide in surprise uhm msieur le capitaine lewrie royal navy here to pourvoir assistance or secours he answered pointing out towards his fetchedto frigate ah mais oui lieutenant veeloughby msieur the midshipman said with a relieved smile then turned to bellow what the bloody aha a royal navy officer his hat off and his waistcoat undone barked crossing the quarterdeck through a throng of furiously labouring people to lewrie josiah willoughby sir of the hercule seventyfour alan lewrie the reliant frigate lewrie replied sorry we cant get her close aboard you but wed end up in the same predicament ive four boat crews and some spare hands with me so what needs doing first mister willoughby just about everything sir lt willoughby quickly replied with a disarming grin cast her guns and carriages overboard and may the rebels have joy of them all her roundshot weve started her water butts gotten a bower out no joy there yet but were trying and the french sailors are doing their best my cutter could take her kedge out to midchannel to wrench her stern free if theres something that could serve as a capstan or a purchase lewrie offered thatd be grand sir though shes already beat off her rudder so do we manage to get her off before the rebels open fire on her theres no telling of how shell handle well get right to it desmond summon all our boats under her transom and tell mister houghton to be ready to take aboard a kedge right away sor a chorus of axes rang out as a gun carriage too heavy to bear up in one piece was being hacked to bits below on her gundeck with the resulting chunks heaved out open gunports ive cut away her second bower sir and jettisoned its cable and was just about to jettison the kedge and its cable before your arrival willoughby related taking a second to mop his streaming face with a handkerchief and allow himself a rueful grin dont quite know if we can get her afloat before the forts set us all afire for a fellow in his straits lt willoughby was in a damnably good mood as if danger and difficulties were his meat and drink if you cant i spose we could ferry her people out to my ship lewrie offered women and children first though i dont know how the rest would feel about standin passive and takin heated shot as we do so its a wonder the rebels havent already sir willoughby said with another of those beaming grins the deadlines long past well you keep on doin what youre doin mister willoughby and ill see to her kedge lewrie told him tapping the brim of his hat as lt willoughby knuckled his own brow in shared salutes once back in his gig lewrie had himself rowed aft to the tuckunder of chlorindes squaredoff stern where midshipman houghton and his cutter were waiting a leather hawsebuckler was torn free then a kedge cable was passed through the hawsehole then taken back onto the deck to be seized to the upper ring of the sofarunseen anchor long minutes later and the kedge appeared suspended from its cable with handling lines bound to its upper crossarms to ease the thing down midshipman houghton an excellent boathandler chivvied the cutter forward a foot or so aft a foot or so then starboard for a few feet til the kedgenowhere as monstrousheavy as a bower but still a weight to be reckoned withcould be lowered into the midships of his boat no after capstan sorry captain lewrie but theyve a fairheavy windlass for purchase lt willoughby called down sticking his head and shoulders over the taffrails for a second now coatless to boot pass me two more lighter lines mister willoughby and well see what we can do towards haulin her stern off lewrie said back done and done sir willoughby rightcheerfully shouted yed think he relishes this lewrie sarcastically thought as two more fourinch lines were heaved over through after gunports as if by magic one for you mister entwhistle and one for you mister warburton lewrie ordered lash down and haul away eight oarsmen in the launch only six oarsmen in the smaller jollyboat could not generate much effort with those lighter lines once extended to their full length the boats remained in one place no matter how hard reliants people strained it was the kedge cable that bore the bulk of the draw once midshipman houghton let it go over the side at midchannel at rightangles to chlorindes hull the cable went bartaut rising from the water dripping water then spraying droplets and groaning as it was wrung like a washrag by the strain put on it by the lowerdeck windlass aboard the french frigate i could take one of those light lines sir houghton offered once hed returned from deploying the anchor ive more hands aboard than the jollyboat aye go close aboard her and call for lieutenant will lewrie began to say before he spotted what he took for an abandoned admirals barge being rowed out to them from shore by a crew of shirtless dark brown oarsmen willoughby he bellowed aloft instead trouble coming ive seen them sir willoughby shouted down to him what should we do begin evacuation ill try to stall them lewrie replied wondering just how hed pull that off hold on a bit i know that bugger in the sternsheets of that gaudy barge was colonel mirabois their interpreter of the day before row us out to the barge desmond meet her as far from the frog ship as you can lewrie urged standing up in his own sternsheets a hand on midshipman munsells shoulder he waved his hat and dug a white handkerchief from his breeches pocket to wave too in lieu of a proper flag of truce hallo colonel mirabois comment allezvous ce apresmidi ah bonjour capitaine le capitaine colonel mirabois said back as his barge slowed the barge was commanded by a young fellow in the uniform of an aspirant of the french navy its coxn a cigarochomping brute in a sleeveless shirt two bandoliers for cartridge boxes and a cutlass his phyz as asquint as a pissedoff pirate let us talk colonel lewrie offered with a false grin on his face once hed determined that they could confer at least an hundred yards short of the frigate easy all on yer oars hey capitaine le luray pardon soulement zere ees une difficile nestce pas mirabois said seated amidships of his padded thwart booted feet planted primly together and his hands gripping the edge of the thwart in a deathgrip even his dark complexion looked ashen as if he was terrified to be out in a boat on the water a difficulty colonel lewrie genially asked as the oarsmen of the barge and his gig tossed their oars so the two boats could come gunnltogunnl what sort zis ship ees still in ze arbour capitaine et eet ees long pas ze deadline for departure colonel mirabois said his smile the sort of rictus seen on a corpse whod died terrified mon generals dessalines christophe petion zey send me to deman eets surrender et ze surrender of all blancs in er if zey do not ze surrender ze forts are prepared wiz ze eated shot comprendre if zey do not ze surrender immediatement i weel signal for such to be done zat ees ze difficile msieur capitaine shes aground colonel were tryin t warp her free lewrie told him its not their fault they havent left harbour zat ees of no matter capitaine mirabois told him somewhat firmer than before there are british sailors aboard her rendering assistance lewrie rejoined stiffening his back and turning grimmer himself i must protest royal navy sailors of his britannic majesty aboard her comprendre colonel his majesty king george the third would deem such an action on your part as an act of war against great britain weve been here before colonel do you want another ten years of foreigners in hayti vous vould perish as ze french ave perished mirabois shot back getting his own back up we get her warped off and under way this little emmerdement is solved colonel lewrie suggested give us til sundown if we cant save the ship then we are determined to rescue the frenchmen aboard her defendu colonel mirabois barked of a sudden it was a word that lewrie had never encountered zat ees forbidden ve mus ave zem all eef zey weel not sail away non non got the stewpots lit already have ye lewrie sourly told himself sure that everyone ashore was looking forward to one last hearty massacre of white people for the moment colonel mirabois i intend to return aboard her and see what progress is being made lewrie temporised now if you wish to open fire upon her whilst im there well one might consider the consequences of any rash action once ive ascertained our progress ill come back to speak with you if youll wait here killing british sailors killing gentlemenofficers and one of them a postcaptain evidently seemed to check miraboiss ardour for blood there mostlike could be a very long war with great britain if he waved his signal a war his masters surely would wish to avoid he agreed to the delay illmannered and as petulant as any frenchman hoy mister willoughby lewrie shouted up to the chlorindes quarterdeck once his gig was back alongside whatho shes coming sir inch by inch but shes coming free that energetic worthy called back down still sporting that joyous beamish grin of his might i enquire what the rebels said to you sir surrender her and all her people for massacre perhaps as the entree for the celebration supper instanter or theyll fire heated shot into her sir ive warned him that there are british sailors aboard and that hed best give it a long think if he dont wish a new war with us lewrie called back grinning in spite of things himself let us work her off cut their losses call it a bad that gives me a marvellous idea sir if you will indulge me for a moment lt willoughby interrupted be back in a trice hell inflate the hotair balloons the womenve made from their silk gowns and hes ready tfly her off lewrie thought several hundred voices male and female began to sing of all the daft things it was the french national anthem that boisterous bloodthirsty martial tune there came the sharp crack of a swivelgun a light pounder then the tricolour was fluttering down from the after staff and cut free to drape the entire stern up went a british union jack in its place willoughby came back to the bulwarks with a french officer in a foreandaft bicorne hat and gilt epaulets captain lewrie sir instead of waiting til shes made her offing to strike her colours her captain here has agreed to strike now making chlorinde a british prize and unofficially a ship now to be reckoned a warship in the royal navy lt willoughby cried down to lewrie do they open on her it surely will be a war oh very good lieutenant willoughby mine arse on a bandbox but thats good lewrie congratulated him i will relate the news to colonel mirabois and hope he chokes on it it was late afternoon before chlorinde many tons lighter finally hauled her hull off the rocks despite the loss of her rudder and some stovein underwater planking resulting in several leaks that could be patched with fothering and spare canvas she floated shed not sink once youve made your offing signal me if you need towing lewrie offered ready to depart for reliant and a celebratory glass of something cool and alcoholic one hellishfine piece of work ye did mister willoughby should your captain need a seconding to your report of the day hes but to ask thank you for saying so captain lewrie and i expect we will need a tow lt willoughby replied looking exhausted but immensely pleased with an arduous job well done ehm i wonder if were related or not mister willoughby lewrie hesitantly asked making the younger officer cock his head in expectation of a pleasing coincidence my father is sir hugo saint george willoughby his familys estate was in kent was once with the fourth regiment of foot the kings own then with the john company army in india commanding the nineteenth native infantry uhm lt willoughby replied looking as if he fought a grimace or a beetle had just pinched his testicles sir hugo you say and might his father have been one stanhope willoughby who once resided near linton heard of us lewrie sadly realised i believe he is though he didnt talk of him much lewrie told him and with damned good reason he told himself father cant hold a candle tthat old scoundrels sins the both of us are pikers in comparison eligible ttake holy orders oh that would be the ehm that would make us kin sir of a sort though lt willoughby hemmed and hawed nigh to blushing well i wont mention the connexion if you wont no sense lettin on youre related tthat old rogue or us bein the son and grandson to em is bad enough quite understood sir thank you willoughby said with a very relieved smile the french wish to give you departing honours sir after the assistance you rendered them and me they appear grateful for frenchmen an admirals sideparty minus the muskets and ill accept gladly lewrie said grinning chapter six commodore loring took his prizes his prisoners and his waiflike refugees back to kingston jamaica as quick as he could quit the coast escorting or guarding the french and their vessels with his entire squadron well almost all of his squadron the much smaller fourship squadron of which hms reliant was a part which had been despatched under independent orders to pursue the french ships that had sailed from holland back in may had never been lorings favourites from the time they had entered the gulf of mexico and lorings bailiwick his patch without the usual courtesy call at kingston to announce their presence it hadnt helped to form good relations with the senior officer on the jamaica station that they had hunted down their quarry off the chandeleur islands of louisiana and had brought them to action and beaten them taking four prizes in honourable battle either the royal navy in the west indies had been successful at taking islands but that sort of knockdowndragout sea fight had so far eluded them most pointedly commodore loring their assigned duty done captain stephen blandings four shipsthe gun modeste reliant and a brace of older gun frigates cockerel and pyladeshad been sent to loiter off the other harbours of hispaniola both the bloody saint domingue and the spanish santo domingo even though the spanish showed no signs of becoming belligerents and french allies again the almost total elimination of their overseas trade and hundreds of merchant ships the drubbing they had gotten at the battle of cape st vincent in and the general ineffectiveness of their navy in european waters might have made the dons leery of taking another shot at war and so it was again commodore lorings last orders before he danced over the horizon with a fine following wind was for blandings little clutch of ships to make a final reconnoiter of saint domingues or haytis lesser seaports and report back to kingston after the welcomes and celebration balls ah well such is navy politics captain blanding told them all with a dramatic heave of his broad shoulders punctuating those words with so loud and trailing a sigh that he sounded much like a montague skewered by a capulet sword in romeo and juliet and eating all the scenery as he overdramatically expired lewrie hid his smirk at captain blandings antics the man was one of the most eccentric officers ever hed met in his whole naval career it was uncanny how boisterous loud and excitable blanding could be a glass with you all gentlemen blanding proposed as both of his cabin stewards bustled about to top up their wine there were only six of them dining this evening as the squadron stood off and on the coast out into deeper open water then back captain blanding liked to dine his captains in quite often and over the months since theyd first gotten orders to serve together had for the most part formed a chummy association in addition to lewrie there was captain parham a younger fellow with a single gilt epaulet on his right shoulder denoting that he was a postcaptain of less than three years seniority parham had served in hms jester lewries first major command as a midshipman and now had hms pylades parham was a very likable and pleasant fellow hms cockerels captain stroud was also new to his post rank once the first officer of myrmidon a sloop of war that lewries jester had been teamed with in the mediterranean and adriatic in stroud was the oddmanout he was workmanlike immensely competent but immensely dull in social situations yet at the same time if he wasnt included in offduty things he took it as a slight and was ever pressing for his cockerel to be given the lead to prove what he and she could accomplish they all walked small round stroud and with their host came captain blandings first lieutenant james gilbraith jemmy the one as blanding sometimes teasingly called him in point of fact he and blanding were both much alike big bluff hearty and stout extremely fond of their tucker and it did not do to get between them and the sideboard or dining table jemmy gilbraith was also one of those poor fellows whose hide did not agree with harsh tropic sunlight he was forever red and peeling lastly there was blandings chaplain and a rarity aboard most royal navy ships the reverend stanley brundish for the very good reason that most padres willing to ship aboard were the equivalent of the church of englands neerdowells its drunks and failures with so few of the vitally necessary connexions and interest that could not land a rectory or curacy even in the poorest london stew brundish however was from captain blandings own parish and was a distant catercousin an erudite and wellread fellow in his midthirties who could actually put together a sensible logical homily instead of droning through bought sheafs of sermons written by others and could cite correct chapter and verse off the top of his head quite unlike the martext reverends lewrie had come across brundish also had a voice like a bosuns that could reach the beakheads from the quarterdeck nettings could stir up a crew with the enthusiasm of leaping methodists tailored his homilies with nautical references and encouraged all with loud lustilysung hymns of the muscular sort chaplain brundish was a constant presence by captain blandings side if only to keep him from cursing and blaspheming i give you a duty most honourably done at long last their senior officer intoned seconded by a hearty hear him from lieutenant gilbraith and they all emulated captain blanding by tossing back goodly gulps though they skipped licking their lips and smacking as he did well sirs supper is laid and a toothsome repast i assure you it will be blanding promised let us take seats what a fine meal it was too and a most jovial one when close on the haitian shore the day before one of modestes midshipmen had come across a sea turtle and it made for a thick and meaty soup i saved some turtle meat for your blasted cats captain lewrie haw haw the squadron commander joshed both blanding and brundish fancied themselves talented anglers and whilst modeste had sat fetchedto off cap francois or cruised at bare steerageway they had hauled in a large red snapper and a small grouper captain blandings personal cook had turned the grouper into breaded tarts using dust from the bottom of the bread bags and flour a puree of portable pea soup paprika and fresh lemon juice those tarts came as a second appetiser on a large platter for all to share whilst the red snapper made their first entree following those dishes came a roast quail for each guest captain blanding insisted on quail and squabs along with ducklings and chicks to be stocked in modestes forecastle manger along with the usual piglets and goat kids since they are so little and matured so quickly captain blanding was right high on rabbits too for like reasons their removes were boiled potatoes somewhat fresh from the chandleries at kingston and mixed beans in sweet oil and vinegar with finediced onion captain blanding was very fond of beans of all sorts next came a pork roast with cracklings a bordeaux replaced the sauvignon blanc to accompany it last before the nuts cheese and port bottle came an approximation of an apple pie split six ways the apples were from england shrivelled and old but stretched out with soaked ships bisquit with extra sugar and goats milks sweetness to disguise the lack of actual fruit through the meal there had been a great deal of relieved japing and chitchat now the french had surrendered and struck their flags without casualties with lewries tale of going ashore to beard those devils dessalines christophe and clairveaux in their own den one of the highpoints then the rescue of chlorinde for yet another source of amusement i must say captain lewrie you have developed quite a talent for rescuing french people in their most desperate moments brundish said leaning forward on the table with a glint of glee in his eyes a tad canted by drink and the glint might have been a bit unfocussed confusion to the french parham proposed which prompted all to upend their glasses and wait for refills man of many parts is captain lewrie gilbraith said loudly just as the good lord has bestowed upon you sir the talent for making war brundish went on perhaps he also blessed you with an innate skill which only now emerges war implacable then mercy in wars aftermath perhaps as befits a christian gentleman an english gentleman young parham stuck in hear hear id rather not make a habit of it though reverend lewrie replied trying to shrug a serious moment off with humour god also gifted mankind with the joy of music an ear for its enjoyment and a talent for makin it but look what ive made o thatun his tootling on his humble pennywhistle was legendarily bad saving the dashed french from the results of the folly they get into is one thing brundish captain blanding told him saving the french from overweening pride popery or that heretical napoleon bonaparte and his global ambitions is quite another successful war cures some of those problems sir lieutenant gilbraith pointed out pride ambitions we can handle that and you may convert them from popery sir lewrie suggested to chaplain brundish or are they outright atheists lead them to salvation now thatd be as hard as making them humble haw captain blanding hooted just so sir well said lt gilbraith seconded toady lewrie thought him still it worked for gilbraith and for blanding too who laid back his head and bellowed laughter to the overhead a glass later and the tablecloth was whisked away and the cheese nuts sweet bisquits and the port with fresh glasses were laid for them as the bottle circulated larboardly round the table captain blanding got a speculative look on his phyz i wonder gentlemen do we discuss our orders for a moment in well i cannot term it sobriety haw haw but could any of you tell me the value of making yet another circumnavigation of the island of hispaniola and peeking into every little dam blasted harbour that thought didnt sober them up but it did shut them up for a bit til captain stroud whod been mostly quiet during supper silently appreciating the camaraderie hesitantly spoke up well sir i expect we could forgo portauprince the french lost it long ago he said anything in the gulf of gonaives parham seconded looking a tad squiffy himself pieeyed in point of fact and sure to need the bosuns sling to get back aboard his own ship later perhaps into his gig from modeste gonaives saint marc leogane lewrie recalled off the top of his head the isle gonave too i blieve we can safely determine the rebels hold all those after we peek into port de paix and mole saint nicholas tomorrow the last place a french detatchment could yet be holding out would be at jeremie on the souwest peninsulas tip and that would just about do it as far as the french half of hispaniola goes we know jacmel on the southern coast is rebelheld lieutenant gilbraith supplied explore the spanish half blanding asked gesturing impatiently for the port bottle well sir stroud cautiously replied looking suspiciously sober in comparison to his suppermates theres general kerverseau and his regiment taken over santo domingo from the spanish and that general ferrand at santiago with the few troops he was able to evacuate but commodore loring already had us look into their situation before we rejoined him here off cap francois and i cant see anything changing in the last week dont know whether those two blasted scoundrels are setting up their own little empires or have interned themselves with the dons captain blanding grumbled he took a sip of port smacked his lips and added and its not as if there will be any other deuced french ships coming to rescue them any time soon hey did they not flee in local luggers and such deuced hes found another substitute for bloody lewrie thought with a grin or damned we saw no seagoing vessels in either port sir lt gilbraith reminded him theyre surely stuck til next epiphany couldnt have gotten away with much in the way of victuals so when they run short they will have to start requisitioning from the local spanish parham supposed aloud best not have landed short of ammunition then lewrie stuck in with a snicker once they start in stealin hmm or mess with the spanish women lt gilbraith hooted dont quite know if our superiors ordered those ports watched captain blanding grumbled on sounding querulous but i think we may consider our orders fulfilled by looking into port de paix mole saint nicholas then jeremie before sailing for jamaica to rejoin the commodore captain stroud aye sir stroud perked up eager for any duty to show what he was made of and make a name after so many years in the background id admire did you and cockerel look into port de paix in the morning blanding instructed and though its good odds that those rebel slaves have invested the old buccaneer haunt the isle of tortuga cross the strait from port de paix you might go in as close inshore as you may for a looksee as well of course sir delighted stroud replied trying to hide a grin and maintain his serious facade ill place modeste off the coast halfway twixt port de paix and mole saint nicholas blanding went on within signalling range of all ships fetch to stand offandon under topsls get some more fishing in hey reverend haw haw oh haul in a large grouper this time aye sir the reverend enthused nigh as toothsome as lobster flesh ha ha lewrie you and captain parhams pylades are to sail into the mole saint nicholas close enough to determine if that bast ahem sir chaplain brundish gently chid him if that worthy general noailles still holds the port and determine how many and what sort of vessels he still possesses their squadron commander grumpily amended make a show of force for whomsoever still is there seagulls crabs the french or the blacks if noailles is there make him the same offer commodore loring made general rochambeau im in no mood to fartarse about shillyshally rather ahem sail out fire off a gun for his honour then strike to us and if hes made a similar accommodation with whichever black generals in charge of the siege lewrie replied with a touch of worry damme that means ill have tgo ashore and deal with one o those devils too ahem chaplain brundish admonished his damme too oh buggery lewrie thought if a sailor cant curse whats the bloody world comin to i ask ye itll be no drinkin next hmm he drummed his fingers on the dining table considering that once a fellow was made post it was understood that the only way his lieutenants juniors and favoured proteges could advance their own careers would be for them to go off and perform something neckornothing dangerous to get favourable notice in reports at admiralty be gazetted in a london paper which would be read everywhere and have the reports from their captains reprinted in the novel chronicle whilst said postcaptains sat back and fretted in relative comfort and a lot more safety i could send westcott his french is bags better than mine he silently speculated he seems hellisheager tstand out yet another opportunity to exercise your newfound talent for rescuing frenchmen captain lewrie chaplain brundish told him or palaver with the saint domingues parham added twice in two days well i was just there for show mostly lewrie had to admit it was captain john bligh number two and captain barre who did the most of the negotiations their french was better i just stood by and got cussed at yet if the black generals round mole saint nicholas have much the same skill with proper french sir stead of creole patois then youd be on a part with them parham teased or perhaps i should delegate and send you parham lewrie said in mockwarning with a leering grin directed downtable and here i always thought you liked me sir parham exclaimed laughing uproariously in which all joined in lewrie too just to show that he really didnt mean it much just so long as none of my officers end up on a platter with an apple in his mouth sizzlin on a bed of rice by jove captain blanding bellowed slamming a meaty fist on the dining table and laughing so hard that he had to lay hold of his middle to prevent his shaking to pieces sirs if i may captain stroud asked in his ponderous and sober way once that amusement had petered out wiggling his glass in suggestion a toast to the morrow aye stroud charge your glasses sirs blanding agreed gentlemen i give you confusion and cowardice to the french stroud grimly intoned and they tipped their heads and their port glasses back to heeltaps at that worthy sentiment chapter seven how deep into the harbour past the mole is a show of force dye think mister westcott lewrie asked his first lieutenant as hms reliant followed by parham and pylades stood in towards the middle of the entrance channel to mole st nicholas oh chalky ye wee bloody pest not now the greyblotched white cat had been loafing on the canvas covers of the quarterdeck nettings now full of rolledup seamans hammocks and took lewries nearness with a dayglass to his eye a grand time to board him right atop lewries left gilt epaulet and dig his back claws in deep so he could pluck the giltlaced coat collar with a free paw and snuffle lewries left ear pleased with yerself are ye lewrie muttered his head turned and his eyes almost crossed nosetonose with the cat ill take him sir and fetch a whisk lewries chief cabin steward pettus offered reaching out to take chalky down and away aloft there lewrie bellowed to midshipman warburton in the mainmast crosstrees anything to report no vessels in port sir warburton shouted back a telescope to his own eye small boats at the quays and drawn up onto the beach sir no french flags flying chalky was not taking his removal well he made closemouthed mrrs of displeasure at pettus as he was set down on the deck planking then leapt back atop the hammock nettings to join toulon nosetonose as if to complain or pick a fight its early enough sir that we still have the landbreeze mr caldwell the sailing master pointed out it may prevail for an hour more before the trades take over or less depending deck there midshipman warburton called down anew theres a cutter under sail coming out towards the moles sir what flag lewrie shouted to him flag of truce sir signal to pylades mister grainger lewrie snapped over his shoulder to the signals midshipman of the watch put about to fetchto ready about as well mister westcott soon as the hoist is down soon as the ways off her id admire was my gig ready trow over to speak whoever it is in that cutter aye aye sir westcott replied then began to snap out orders to helmsmen bracetenders and the duty watch to prepare the ship for a slight wheelabout to put her bows into the wind off the hills and bring her to relative rest pylades shows acknowledged sir grainger announced very well strike the hoist for the execute lewrie told him looking aft to squint at pylades which had already swung off to reliants larboard quarter about half a mile astern standing in on the early morning landbreeze almost close hauled already yet gliding slow and swanlike on such a weak wind it would not take much to bring both frigates to a halt lewrie paced over to the starboard ladderway to the main deck peering over the side to assure himself that his coxn liam desmond had the gig manned and waiting for him fetchedto sir lt westcott reported im off then mind the shop mister westcott lewrie said as he made his way to the entryport where a sideparty was hastily assembling to see him off with trilling bosuns calls marine muskets at present arms and doffed hats from the ondeck crew well row over just outside the breakwaters and speak that cutter desmond lewrie said once settled in the sternsheets of the gig cat hair an all sor desmond whispered from the corner of his mouth ive a damp scrap o rag thatd do hed not waited for pettus to fetch up his handwhisk to remove chalkys fur with toulon a whitetrimmed black cat it wasnt quite as bad a chore but with the littlun even hanging his coat in the quartergallery toilet overnight did not save his uniforms from appearing spotty in broad daylight he took off his cocked hat to inspect it as desmond put the tiller over and called the stroke expecting a parley with general noailles lewrie had had his bestdress laid out for the morning his best hat left in the japanned wood box til the very last moment yet aye give me your rag desmond he said with a sigh as he began to sponge down his hat and coat uhm flag o truce sor desmond asked in a soft voice we dont have one aboard well damme lewrie snapped spose this rag aint big enough or white enough either lewrie thought he dug out his own clean somewhat larger white handkerchief and handed it forward sykes stick this on your gaff if ye please aye sir the bowman replied uglylookin brutes they is sor desmond commented as they neared the stone breakwaters and the oncoming cutter saint domingue hayti breeds em like mosquitoes desmond lewrie told him with a faint grin havent seen any other sort on this island not in six years since i first clapped eyes on the bloody place the oarsmen in the rebel cutter lolling at ease as long as its lugsail was up were the usual ferociouslooking bullybucks garbed in loose tan shirts worn unbuttoned for the breeze most with sleeves cut off at the armpits so their muscular bare arms could show and the most of them sported raggedbrimmed nighshapeless plaited straw hats on their heads against the sun most also wore cartridgebox straps or cutlass bandoliers crossed over their chests astern at the tiller sat a younger frailerlooking fellow of much lighter complexion a mulatto in shirt waistcoat and kneetop breeches with some dead french officers sword and a foreandaft bicorne beside him sat an even larger darker man who scowled at them as if willing this party of strange blancs to drop down and die that instant he too wore giltlaced cavalry officers breeches sword a captured officers coat and little else but for a small cocked hat crammed down on his head so hard that the corners drooped towards his shoulders arret the man snapped his voice a deep menacing basso it was unclear whether he referred to his own boat or lewries close enough i think lewrie muttered to his coxn easy all lads desmond ordered toss yer oars the cutters sail was quickly lowered its tiller put over and it swung as if to lay its beam open for a ramming amidships desmond heaved on his own tiller to parallel the rebel boat bon matin msieur lewrie called out smiling comment allezvous he introduced himself then waited for a response ehm any of you speak english parle langlais va te faire foutre vous blanc fumier the big man snarled a physical impossibility msieur quel appellezvous i speak en peu capitaine the young fellow at the tiller hesitantly almost fearfully said his gaze flitting twixt lewrie and his superior as if expecting a blow for making the offer there was a quick rumbling palaver between them before the bigger man shoved the other as if prodding him to speak for him colonel coupjarret e ask what ees you business ere colonel cutthroat damme lewrie thought appalled we have come to see if all the french have fled your country sir lewrie replied as calmly as he could or if there are still some french we can kill they are our enemies as well dont ye know the young fellow relayed that to colonel cutthroat who gave lewrie a most distrustful glower and spat overside before replying in a growl more slave patois than french garblegarblegarble as far as lewrie could make out ze rochambeau e flee le cap uhm yesterday the young fellow informed them noailles e ave uhm demidouzaine demidouzaine the fellow looked terrified that he didnt know what that was in english as if his superior would beat him for not knowing a halfdozen oui lewrie offered mais oui demidouzaine petit navires ships small ships noailles e go to havana as departed the scared young man said in a rush port de paix lewrie prompted no francaise aucun none umph as the bigger man gave him a thump on the shoulder colonel e say you go away now no more blanc diables mus come to haiti ever you go now he said taking on his superiors urgency and ferocity ze whe white devils oo come zey will all die ere colonel coupjarret e swears zis to punctuate the last the colonel pulled out a long poignard or dagger pointedly licked down the length of its blade and grinned so evilly that lewrie felt his blood chill well ehm thankee for the information msieur and well be going back to our ship lewrie replied performing a slight bow from the waist and doffing his cocked hat enjoy your new country ta ta au voir rather desmond got the gig under way and pointed out seaward the oarsmen bending the ash looms perhaps a touch more strenuously than usual which suited lewrie right down to his toes noailles had already fled well dash it i say blanding said with a sigh as lewrie and stroud delivered their reports to him aboard modeste now the squadron was reunited and striding sousouwest for cape dame marie and jeremie from what i gathered sir stroud contributed not wanting to stand about like a useless fartinatrance port de paixs garrison were forced into cap francois long ago and the rebels indeed have invested the isle of tortuga as well to keep the french from taking shelter there where their small boats could not get at them with any hope of well vengeance id suppose noailles didnt sail away all that long ago sir lewrie pointed out with a brow up it would seem that commodore loring did not maintain a constant blockade over any port but cap francois where all the valuable prizes were if ye get my meanin he thought and waited for the shoe to drop with blanding noailles so i gather had half a dozen vessels all schooners luggers or such with barely the capacity ttake off what little was left of his troops god knows if he had room for women and children too i did not get ashore to see if the rebels had white prisoners they met me by the breakwaters and most like wouldve cut all our throats had we tried sorry they say discretions the better part of valour captain lewrie no fault of yours blanding said harumphing a bit even so at the disappointment of missing the french havana did they tell you aye sir well da blast my eyes blanding said and kerverseau and ferrand were allowed to sail away as well for want of watching cant put that in my report to admiralty dear as i wish to wasnt our fault the work was but halfdone and poorly at that by jove well theres still guadeloupe martinique a few other isles still in french possession sir lewrie tried to cheer him up the french colony of surinam down below barbados i just missed the expedition ttake it back in is our commodore or admiral sir john duckworth still aspiring and acquisitive perhaps we will be part of the next venture well be blockading empty ports lewrie captain blanding rejoined with some heat consigned to vague fardistant bloody uselessness out of sight out of mind and dont come back til our rums run out and the waters brown with corruption god mean to say heavens above but this is what success brings if you aint a wellknown favourite spiteandjealousy spiteandjealousy pah well sir the bald facts of our reconnoiters the escape of the french whilst cap francois was blockaded lewrie hinted do we state all of us that per orders we discovered that the foe had managed to escape with no blame laid on anyone it might take admiralty a year or two tmull it over but such reportsd raise a large question wouldnt they bedad lewrie but youre a sly one blanding exclaimed come over all beamish of a sudden as he grasped the eventual result bedad lewrie thought almost grimacing to stifle a smile he will end up with a whole new slate o odd curses fore his commission is done and captain stroud sagely reminded them weve our prizemoney from the chandeleurs and our share of the commodores prizes to boot plus the greater glory stout fellow stroud dam stap me if you aint blanding congratulated book i the rank is but the guinea stamp the mans the gowd for a that is there for honest poverty robert burns chapter eight walking the streets of kingston jamaica or hiring a prad for a bracing ride in the near countryside was a lot safer for captain alan lewrie since the beauman clan had dissolved with hugh beaumans icily beautiful young widow now residing in portugal having inherited all and sold up every last stick of the familys jamaican plantationsand all their slavesthere was no one to hire bullybucks to cut his throat in a dark alley as theyd once threatened soon after lewrie and his old friend former lieutenant colonel christopher kit cashman had participated in that scandalous duel with former colonel ledyard beauman and his cousin captain george sellers over who had been at fault for the shameful showing of their islandraised regiment near portauprince when the british army was still trying to conquer saint domingue ledyard and his cousin had cheated cashman lewrie and the duel judges had shot them down and hugh beauman had been after lewries hearts blood ever since as a further insult those slaves that he had appropriated had come from one of the beauman plantations on portland bight with hugh beauman drowned in a shipwreck in the tagus river entrances in portugal the parents longbefore retired to england with all their wealth the beaumans little empire had collapsed absorbed by an host of indifferent others their newspaper defunct and their shipping business owned by others oh there were still some distant kin on the island along with forner employees and business partners but without hugh beauman to direct the hatred lewrie was almost as safe as houses the beauman syndicate had evaporated so lewrie could dare to depart reliant for shopping and a shore breakfast as he had this morning in a rare and brief respite from blockading duties modeste reliant cockerel and pylades still cruised together as a squadron there had been a week at anchor following the french surrender at cap francois then a threemonth stint at sea prowling round the isle of hispaniola whilst the ships of the line and frigates of the jamaica station stayed busy invading more french island colonies hoping for an encounter with a relieving french squadron christmas and boxing day had come and gone then new years day of then epiphany plough monday hilary term days for courts and colleges and candlemas and after all the excitement of the previous year it was all rather pacific and deadlyboresome the newly independent haitians did not try to export their slave rebellion to the rest of the west indies the weak french lodgements in the spanish half of hispaniola seemed to have given up on any attempt to flee to france and the spanish the dons were behaving like their usual selves that is to say moribund after getting stung rather badly as french allies they had drawn in their horns and showed no signs of wanting any more to do with war with hurricane season over the weather in the west indies was delightful with the heat of summer dissipated fever season was also gone for a while and it was all claret and cruising through steady trade winds clear sunny days and only now and then a halfgale or afternoon squall it was so very pleasant that alan lewrie was of two moods either bored nigh to tears or fretful that dame fortune would remember that it was her job to kick him in his arse now and again every time he felt smug and satisfied or had too much idle time during such lulls as this without the heady spur of adventure and action lewrie could become well distracted it was said that idle hands are the devils workshop and well lewrie knew it given a week or so in port for revictualling replenishment and rearming with the pleasures of a thriving harbour town a short row off in both earshot and eyeshot and given how little a frigate captain had to do when said frigate was both at anchor and flying the easy pendant to show that she was out of discipline to allow her people to rut with their temporary wives or prostitutes when aboard able to see it and hear it as sailors and doxies coupled between the guns on the oak deck planks danced cavorted and sang well it did not help lewries restless feelings to know that lieutenant geoffrey westcott his first officer had indeed discovered for himself a most lissome jeune fille from among the horde of civilian french refugees whether she was truly the penniless daughter of one of the most distinguished and wealthiest families of saint domingue as was alleged a corporals widow or a whore tainted with the one in parts of negro blood a sang mele and still considered black in the old regime she was hellishhandsome light brown almost chestnut hair enormous brown eyes a fine brow and a swanlike neck pouty lips and a face nigh gamin or elfin in its lovelieness which put lewrie dangerously in mind of his former mistress in the mediterranean phoebe aretino or that murderous pirateminx charite de guilleri phoebe had been a teen prostitute in the port city of toulon during the british invasion of but was now contessa phoebe in paris the queen of perfumes charite de guilleri had been a french creole belle who with her brothers and cousin and some old privateers had turned both pirates and revolutionaries with the purpose of freeing new orleans and louisiana from the spanish she had shot lewrie in the chest once when hed run them down and ended their game on grand terre isle at the mouth of barataria bay before that they had been lovers and damned if both of them had not been grand lovers which remembrance did lewries equilibrium no good at all how could one still evince a lusty itch for a young woman whod hunted him down and tried to kill him for good and had might as well have fired the shot that had slain his wife caroline during the peace of amiens in france in lewrie returned aboard reliant just as three bells of the forenoon were struck the sideparty was mostly the fullyuniformed marines the requisite number of sailors in shoregoing finery and those midshipmen unfortunate enough to stand harbour watch officers in port did not and what lieutenants spendlove and merriman were doing below in the gunroom to while away their idle time lewrie could have cared less the crewmen of the harbour watch those on the gangways and the weather decks doffed their hats and stood facing him for a minute or so then went back to their few duties envying their mates below on the gundeck where they sported with their women anything out of the ordinary to report mister grainger he asked the seniormost of the pair of mids who stood the watch a lad of fifteen two two of the ehm women got into an argument sir grainger reported with a blush bosuns mate mister wheeler separated them and ordered them off the ship at one bell sir slashing away with belaying pins they did sir midshipman rossyngton who was only thirteen piped up stark naked both sir sorry i missed it lewrie said with a grin well ehm neither of them were what one would call fetching sir mr rossyngton ventured to say with a precocious leer rather old and fubsy they were not tyer taste mister rossyngton lewrie teased well ehm the lad flummoxed turning as red as grainger beg pardons young gentlemen capm but theres a signal hoist aboard modeste one of the masters mates eldridge interrupted reminding them of their proper duties he his mate nightinggale and the sailing master mr caldwell were their primary tutors in navigation and an host of other seamanly work sorry sir grainger gawped turning even redder if that was possible hurriedly raising his telescope to read it it is have mail sir he crowed with an expectant christmas is coming glee and our number and captain repair on board buggery lewrie muttered half to himself he had hoped for a quiet morning to digest his succulent shore breakfast sip on some of his cold tea collation catch up with naval paperwork play with the cats perhaps read a chapter or two of a new book and take a good long nap but mister rossyngton pass word for my coxn and boat crew smartly now will they be in any shape trow me over to modeste he had to wonder as he waited he had taken his gig ashore at seven bells of the morning watch assuring desmond and the others that he would hire a bumboatman for his return so they could join in the sport belowdecks sure enough here came liam desmond his coxn still donning his short dark blue jacket his tarred hat askew and his longtime mate patrick furfy right behind him still trying to do up the buttons of his sloptrousers and reeling a bit sorry lads but im called away to the flagship lewrie told them as they hurriedly filed down the manropes and battens to the gig hope i didnt interrupt anything too much fun that apology raised a stricken smile or two most of them had been in fullthroated song nipping at smuggled halfpints of rum and halfway to connubial bliss with their wives when called to duty all three frigates had sent boats to modeste to lay hands upon their precious letters newspapers and packages pyladess boat was commanded by a midshipman but cockerels bore captain stroud himself mornin captain stroud lewrie greeted him once they had been piped aboard modeste in order of seniority good morning to you captain lewrie stroud replied looking excited for a rare once at the prospect of news from home most of the time he was stiffnecked and taciturn taking himself and his very first captaincy most seriously mail at last hah he added that was perhaps too much joy to show the world so he quickly sobered his face and tone wouldve sent a middy or first officer but but news from england is just too temptin aye lewrie finished for him secretly brimming with excitement and curiosity but where is captain parham young sir and you are allow me to name myself to you sir im poole sir the mid from pylades said with a doff of his hat and a short bow our captain is ashore sir at a tailors and the chandleries captain lewrie lt gilbraith modestes first lieutenant said as he came forward to join them doffing his cocked hat and making a leg to them all businesslike to stroud and the midshipman as he addressed them by name but oddly more deeply to lewrie we have begun to separate each ships mail into bags sirs if you will attend me aft in captain blandings cabins the marine sentry announced their presence and blanding shouted a merry and loud enter to them they filed into the cabins hats under their arms and bowed greetings to the squadron commander lt gilbraith went over to stand with blanding chaplain brundish and blandings clerk and cabin servants all of whom stood peering at the new arrivals with what looked like cat that ate the canary expressions and a stiffness normally reserved for greeting an admiral tis a bit early in the day gentlemen but given the celebratory nature of the occasion allow me to offer you all a cool glass of rhenish captain blanding said beaming like a cherub rocking or nighhopping on his toes over something lewrie knew him by then as a boisterous mercurial fellow but this was quite uncanny hes a handkerchief has he been cryin lewrie asked himself by the look of his red eyes damme if he hasnt what at a moment like this id have wished that captain parham would have been able to join us captain blanding went on as cabin servants scurried round with glasses and a bottle of wine damned if he didnt dab at his eyes and blow his nose rather loudly to boot he will be at the supper surely sir chaplain brundish was quick to assure him and damned if brundish scholarly erudite and languidly calm in all weathers didnt peer at lewrie with a mixture of what seemed like awe and sly secret amusement ive come into a fortune and he wants ttouch me up for a loan lewrie was forced to think wishing he could touch himself all over to make sure his breeches buttons were done up his shoes were on or his neckstock still in place captain blanding crossed to his desk and returned with a large parchment document which he held out for them to see there was a gilt seal rather large with a large blob of red wax a seal pressed into it and a red ribbon beneath the wax this came to me by post from london captain blanding said with a tremble to his voice from saint jamess palace from our sovereign his majesty king george blanding sounded as if he was about to croak like a frog in awe the king has seen fit to reward me for our victory over the french at the chandeleur islands by making me a knight of the bath and a baronet my word sir captain stroud exclaimed huzzah lt gilbraith who was already in on the secret said loudly an honour long overdue congratulations sir lewrie cried stunned you we fought and won the only significant action with the french last year after all sir chaplain brundish pointed out with a laugh though hed known all about the announcement for several minutes already of course the crown would reward the victor and by god if it wasnt lewrie thought the naval chronicle london papers which reached them such as the times or the gazette had not featured anything approaching a fleet action since the war began again in may of last year there were many reports of single actions against french national ships some smallsquadron encounters that had not resulted in any significant losses to either side or many prizes taken it was french merchantmen that had suffered the most but they were profitable and lacking in glory and honour their squadron and their fight at the chandeleurs which had resulted in all four french ships defeated and taken as prizes had been the highpoint of to captain sir stephen blanding baronet lt gilbraith proposed now their glasses were full and they seconded him with to sir stephen gave out loud growls of approval and knocked their glasses back to drain them congratulations sir captain stroud told him going to shake hands hear hear lewrie added happy to see the cabin servants go round to refill their glasses for a second toast well earned hey ehm were not quite done sirs captain blanding tried to shush them theres something else to celebrate stanley he prompted reverend brundish with a significant nod and wink ehm captain lewrie brundish said fetching forth a very large letter from reliants heap of mail this has come for you brundish held it by pressing the tips of his fingers to two of its corners waving it teasingly and grinning widely it was a heavy cremecoloured bond the calligraphy for sender and addressee large and copperplate elegant there was a red wax seal the size of a spanish piece of eight coin to join the corners of the foldedover letter together uh for me lewrie gawped no captain stroud cried really lewrie couldnt tell if he was astonished at what the letter might hold or objecting for you sir brundish assured him stepping forward to place it in lewries hands taking his wine glass to free both it was from the crown lewrie started to snag a fingernail under the wax seal to rip it free then looked up appalled in need of help allow me to apply my penknife captain blanding offered with a snort of delight a thing like that you only receive once and it would be a shame to ruin the seal by tearing it free insult to the crown what brundish said snickering its really a lewrie could only gawp going to the desk in the daycabin to watch captain blanding carefully lift the seal from three of the four corners once folded open the cremecoloured paper proved to be but a protective sheath for the parchment inside which blanding let lewrie open and read once twice then an even more disbelieving third time mine arse on a bandbox lewrie exclaimed at last theyve made me a knight of the bath oh huzzah sir huzzah young poole cried cant wait to tell captain parham congratulations sir captain blanding said taking his hand and giving it a vigourous shake whilst the rest of them cheered and hooted as if urging their choice of race horse in the last furlong of the ascot or the derby why though lewrie asked himself though shuddering with glee and sheer stupefying surprise after a successful victory such as theirs it was customary for one officer the seniormost to be honoured at cape st vincent it had been viceadmiral sir john jervis old jarvy rewarded with the title of earl st vincent after camperdown it was only admiral duncan whod been made a peer and at the nile it was nelson who had been rewarded the rewards for captains of the participating warships and the junior officers usually was promotion or command of one of the prize ships taken the fellow whod carried word of the glorious first of june battle in the frigate captain whod carried word of cape st vincent had been knighted but why him and blanding for the same battle cause im saint alan the liberator black alan lewrie he sourly thought hero of the abolitionists like wilberforce or i got knighted cause somebody in governments feelin sorry for me for carolines murder by the french it was hard not to grimace in anger and pain and keep a sheepish grin of proper modesty on his face after that realisation even as he shook hands with the others and got pounded on the back while the honour turned to ashes in his mouth was it because he was wellknown for a time the abolitionists had showered papered london and the nation with praiseful tracts of his theft of a dozen black slaves from the beaumans long before the trial in kings bench which had acquitted him his blackandwhite portrait had been on sale selling almost as briskly as horatio nelsons for a month or two after and god only knew how many of those how many of the cartoons how many illustrated tracts hed had to autograph for the adoring and supportive he had been turned into a commodity by the abolitionist society to further enthusiasm for the end of negro slavery throughout the empire a largerthanlife symbol and in the autumn of then in the spring of in the runup to the renewal of war with france though he knew little of it on his tenant farm in anglesgreen there had been fresh tracts and portraits sketches meant to horrify common people that the corsican ogre napoleon bonaparte would order the murder of a british naval hero and his wife over a trivial insult or misunderstanding taken as an insult by the first consul for life of france someone in his majestys government had cynically found him useful again aye im wellknown lewrie miserably considered as he took a fresh glass of wine he was a successful frigate captain he was a rogue a rakehell too and known for that to some the latter repute should have cancelled out any fame from the first so who had put the idea of knighting him in the sovereigns ear if he ever had an honest shot at knighthood it should have come in when hed had proteus and had fought an equallymatched enemy frigate in the south atlantic a twohour broadsidetobroadside slugfest in the midst of a howling gale to save an east india company trade homebound for england but the earl spencer had been first lord of the admiralty at the time sir evan nepean his first secretary and both of them knew of his peccadilloes with other women so there had been no hope then well i do have allies lewrie told himself sponsors patrons and influence no one could hope to rise in english society or a military or naval career without interest not politics or the church or trade or there was his old school chum whod been expelled at the same time as he had peter rushton now lord draywick in lords in the commons there was william wilberforce sir samuel whitbread of the beer fortune and many others of the progressive stripe there was sir malcolm shockley married to lucy beauman and in spite of her connexions to his old nemesis friendly and supportive too admiral the earl st vincent he was now first lord of admiralty and he had always seemed welldisposed towards him since the battle that had made him a peer when lewrie had been on halfpay begging for a ship before the expedition sailed for the baltic to swat the russians swedes and danes under parker and nelson it had been old jarvy whod allowed him an interview then surprised him with command of hms thermopylae and her solo scouting mission into the baltic before the battle of copenhagen lewrie suspected a reason even more distasteful that somehow some agateeyed manipulators in secret branch of the foreign office people very much like zachariah twigg found him useful to the crown and to the country once more and were even now playing up his name and carolines death to enthuse the populace wonder if anyone ever refused one lewrie thought at least his knighthood was for a legitimate reason he could tell himself perhaps for cumulative duty they handed the damned things out to poets playwrights painters town mayors when a new bridge or town hall was opened for gods sake brewers iron barons and woolspinning tsars might as well go along with it he decided they wont offer twice and wont this put my fathers nose outta joint think o what harry embletonll make of it or my brotherinlaw governour wet him down instanter lt gilbraith was crying calling for more wine wont be official til your presentations at court but perhaps we could make a start at modest celebration what i believe we could jemmy captain blanding heartily agreed lifting his glass in lewries direction sir alan sir stephen lewrie responded though he lacked the twinkle that danced in blandings eyes chapter nine a few more celebratory glasses of rhenish put paid to lewries plans for his late morning in addition to the routine paperwork of a fighting ship there was a new pile of directives from the admiralty to be read through initialed filed away or answered he and almost every midshipman he had ever known from his early days had been laid over a gun to kiss the gunners daughter for the sin of reading ones personal mail first and neglecting words from on high even were those words corrected sailing directives for the safe navigation of the yellow sea which percent of the royal navy would never even get close to much less transit to his cats dismay lewrie and his clerk james faulkes spent the rest of the forenoon sorting it all out and penning responses too intent to play with them shooing them off the day cabin desk and protecting faulkess feathered quill pens the musicians had struck up the bowld soldier boy at half past eleven at seven bells and the purser mr cadbury marine lieutenant simcock and the pursers assistantclerk bewley better known as the jackinthebreadroom had escorted the painted rum cask on deck for the midday issue faulkes had gone antsy to miss it forcing lewrie to suspect that it was not just rejected love that had driven faulkes to sea well i think that should do it faulkes lewrie said at last as the very last reply was sanded to dry the ink carefully folded and sealed then addressed sorry it took so long you might visit the galley and see mister cooke hes always a pint of something hidden away did you miss the issue hell allow you a nip thank you sir and i shall faulkes said departing well lads lewrie invited to his cats who sprang atop the desk to prowl bow their backs yawn and stretch then nuzzle at his hands you just cant play with the pretty feathered pens it isnt hands is being piped to mess sir pettus his cabin servant said cocking an ear to the silver calls on deck a glass of wine sir cold tea lewrie decided ive done that this morning aye sir alan sir pettus said with a tight pleased grin hey lewrie scowled back welltis all over the ship sir pettus told him soon as your boat crew was dismissed they were all bragging on it its not official til we get back to england pettus lewrie pointed out to him til then captain or a plain sir will suit and for a long time after damned silliness he scoffed well sir ive served a vicar and a bishop but they dont hold a candle to a knight of the bath pettus said almost sulking to be denied you served a parcel o drunks at that inn in portsmouth fore you came away trejoin too lewrie said with a wry grin and mostlike oner two o them were titled so it dont signify unless itd look good on yer references do ye ever wish tleave my service why would i wish to do that sir pettus rejoined in merry takings being a knights man puts me a leg up over most other gentlemens servants capms cook sah the marine sentry bawled smashing his musket butt and boots on the deck outside enter lewrie called back rising to go to the diningcoach and his table come on catlins tucker yeovill bustled in with a large shallow wooden boxlike tray covered with a cloth good mornin to you sir alan weve somethin special to celebrate and somethin special for the cats to boot dammit lewrie groused this could get irksome all this sir shit itll be bowin an scrapin next he would have fired off a bit of temper a swivelguns worth perhaps not an pounder of damn yer eyes but when he beheld his dinner he let it slide all fresh from shore this mornin sir yeovill boasted a parcel of shrimp grilled in lemon and butter drippy bacon salad boiled field peas andyeovill pointed to each as he named them revealing the best for lastspicy jerked guinea fowl sir oh ive a mango custard for a sweet too sir with vanilla nutmeg cinnamon and cream well now this is a grand treat yeovill lewrie agreed as he sat down jerked ye say thats an island style of seasonin sir alan sir yeovill beamed peppers and chilies sweet spices all together zestiest tangiest saucin ever i put in my own mouth a white wine sir pettus suggested youve still most of a crate of sauvignon blanc cool tea lewrie reiterated long before in the west indies a neglected pot of tea an unlit warming candle had forced him to sip the rest that or toss it out the transom sashwindows and have his old cabin servant aspinall brew up another with lemon and sugar it had proved refreshing and lewrie had had aspinall make up half a gallon each morning til the tropic sun was below the yardarms and he could switch to wine before his supper yeovill had even laid aside some unseasoned shrimp detailed and peeled for the cats along with strips of guinea fowl toulon and chalky did not stand on seniority naval or social and dug into their bowls with gusto chalky had the odd tendency to purr while he ate and after a few sampled bites from each dish so did lewrie after such a fine repast it was even harder for lewrie to keep his eyes open but there was personal mail to be read he sorted it out into the mostlikely agreeable first saving those from tradesmen and his least favourite kin for last his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy assured him that he owed no debts with a long column of doubleentry incomes and outgoes to tailors chandlers cobblers hatters and grocers showing that all his notesofhand turned in by them to mountjoy had been redeemed to the hapence there was profit too now deposited to his account at coutts bank admiralty prizecourt had finally awarded him his twoeighths for the luranie frigate that hed taken in the south atlantic in she had not been bought in by the navy right away but laid up inordinary for survey and inspection for years before going into the graving docks and the idle time had not been kind to her material condition there had been another british twodecker in sight when shed struck so he only got for her but still but there was captain speaks and his furious demands for his bloody franklinpattern coal stoves that hed purchased with his own funds for hms thermopylae before hed come down with pneumonia in the baltic and north sea winter and lewrie had relieved him of command thermopylae was now in the bay of bengal and might be for the next five years her purser who had offered to ship them off to good captain speaks had not and was still aboard her any letter speaks sent in search of his ironmongery took six months to reach her with no guarantee that the letter might not be eaten by termites or indian ants at calcutta or bombay before thermopylae returned to port after a fourmonth cruiselonger if she could revictual in a foreign portand even a prompt reply would take six more months to make its way back to england since captain speaks very much doubted if the frigate needed heating stoves in the east indies he was raving to discover where they might have been offloaded did he not get satisfaction he threatened legal action had retained a serjeant to press his case in common pleas and etc amp etc liberally sprinkled with dire suspicions that lewrie was up to his eyebrows in collusion with a crooked purser he would not be brushed aside in such a brusque manner the value of the stoves captain speaks estimates at each and intends to seek a sum of plus his legal expenses do please write me on this head sir at your earliest convenience aw shit lewrie muttered strongly considering his crock of aged american corn whisky for a moment he didnt know what herbert pridemore had done with the bloody stoves but thermopylae had paid off in december of and theyd have been damned welcome for the standing officers kiddies and wives who would live aboard her whilst she was laid up in the sheerness ordinary in winter of which the purser mr pridemore was a part perhaps hed meant to ship them to the north of england but had put it off til the summer and bugger em lewrie growled the cats woke from their naps on the starboardside settee table the large round brass hindoo tray that was so cool to sprawl on during a tropic afternoon with no invitation to play forthcoming they closed their eyes again next a letter from his father sir hugo his rented farm was gone the twostorey house he and caroline had built in for the brickandtimber barn theyd erected to replace an ancient tumbledown wattleanddaub one with a roof of strawbug and ratinfested since the war of the roses mostlikethe storage towers for silage and grain and the brick stables and coach house were now the property of his favourite brotherinlaw major burgess chiswick and his bride theadora as were all his former livestock except for a few favourite saddle horses and what crops had been reaped before the transfer of ownership no more pigshit no more sheepshit lewrie muttered with a touch of glee good less the payment of your last quitrents phineas chiswick that sixtoothed miser offered a paltry as recompence for all your improvements as your agent in this matter i insisted that we would take no less than and since i learned that phineas had valued the property at for the outright sale of it to the trenchers who would be footing the bill for their daughters country estate forced him at the last to accept our terms since you delegated to me the negotiations whilst you were away at sea i subtracted a sum of as my commission and deposited the rest to your account at coutts trust that my share will be spent joyfully if not wisely haw and when did i agree tten percent damn his eyes lewrie fumed sir hugo went on for several more pages the winter was a raw one though the thames had not frozen quite so solid as to allow the proper sort of frost fair zachariah twigg had wintered at his rural estate spyglass bungalow in hampstead and had suffered several bouts with the ague he was now fully retired from even his consulting work at the foreign office good lewrie exclaimed loud enough to wake the cats again hed been twiggs pet gun dog since getting roped into neckornothing harumscarum deviltry overseas time and again and if that arrogant toplofty and sneering old cutthroat had retired lewrie could look forward to a somewhat safer career from now on sir hugo had heard from lewries sons both now serving aboard their respective ships in the navy hugh his youngest was a midshipman aboard hms pegasus under an old friend captain thomas charlton a stolid steady and seasoned professional though charlton had a sly and puckish sense of humour and a fond tolerance for the antics of midshipmen hugh had taken to the sea like a cow to clover and was having a grand time sewallis well his oldest boy and heirapparent had slyly amassed enough money to kit himself out had forged a draft of one of lewries early letters to another old friend and compatriot captain benjamin rodgers and had finagled himself a seaberth aboard aeneas a twodecker ship of the line his one brief letter to his granther told a soberer tale of his selfchosen naval career so far but sewallis had always been the serious one he was learning all of the cautions all the ropes but said little of his fellow midshipmen confessing that times were hard on a johnny new come til he began to fit in sir hugo suspected that he was coping mainwell but did not sound quite so joyful as hugh had lewrie gotten a letter from him yet no he had not and there was not one in his latest pile he expected that sewallis would summon up the gumption to explain sooner or later thatll prove damned intrestin lewrie thought on a happier note lewries former ward sophie de maubeuge now wed to lewries old first officer commander anthony langlie had been delivered of a lusty baby boy whom she had named charles august to honour her late older cousin baron charles auguste de crillart a french navy officer who had been lewries prisoneronparole in the caribbean during the american revolution and lewries royalist ally during the siege of toulon the both of them being blown skyhigh in the old razeeturnedmortar battery zele at the siege of toulon charles had gotten his shrunken family aboard the captured frigate radicale to flee when the port was taken by the french republicans avoiding the massacre of the royalists but had died when three french ships had chased her down on her way to gibraltar he had died not knowing that his younger brother and his mother had been slain too leaving sophie his last orphaned kin and extracting a promise from lewrie to see them safe with his dying breath anthony langlie and his brigsloop orpheus were so sophie told it raising merry hell in the mediterranean and had captured several merchant prizes london had been grandly entertaining that winter with several new plays and exhibits sir hugo related daniel wigmores peripatetic extravaganze had put on a winter season cross the thames in southwark and had staged their comic plays and farces in a rented hall in drury lane the delightful bareback ridercrack bow shotingenue actress eudoxia durschenkothe delectable cossack minx that had been hot for lewrie sir hugo teasedwas now about the town in the company of lord percy stangbourne a dashing buckofthefirsthead rich as a walpole intimate of the prince of wales and a lieutenantcolonel of his familys homeraised yeomanry light dragoons they were both as horsemad as if they were cossacks or mongols good for her lewrie muttered though with a tinge of loss had it not been for eudoxias murderous eyepatched expert marksmanlion tamer father arslan artimovich and his oath that the girl would die a virgin if he had to kill half the males in great britain lewrie might have given her a go there was a letter from his other brotherinlaw governour chiswick who with his longsuffering but sweet wife millicent was now boarding his daughter charlotte at their estate in anglesgreen talk about cool and standoffish governours letter was as formal as a boarding school proctors endofterm summation on a students progress governour rated her on her ladylike deportment her advancing skills at singing at playing the harpsichord and violin her seat and bottom when riding her horsepony and the courage she showed on opencountry rides at trot canter lope and gallop charlotte played well with other girls though she did insist on having her way if not strictly reined back her table manners were exquisite for a girl her age and she kept a scrupulously neat room without the assistance of her maid and she kept her clothes in good order charlotte dearly missed her brothers and did not understand why her father would so cruelly send sewallis off to sea when he was the eldest who should have still been in school preparing for a civilian career she missed her old house though she quite enjoyed to have her uncle burgess and theadora living there worst of all she would still weep when thinking of how much she missed her dear mother caroline though the sunny days now outnumbered the glum ones charlotte had adored her christmas presents from sir hugo when hed come down briefly from london of missing her father there was not one ward at all though lewrie had written her several times there was no acknowledgement of her reading them or receiving them and there was no letter from her to him enclosed the handwriting changed on the next page to millicents finer and more graceful hand giving him a perky recital of all that burgess and theadora were doing with his old house what colours they chose to repaint the rooms which pieces of furniture they had retained and an inventory of what theyd been given or purchased and how they had rearranged his officecumlibrary with its many french doors and windows was now such a delightful such a splendid garden room awash in potted or hanging ferns exotic indian flowers and palmettos from the carolinas in america and one magnificent palm tree so reminiscent of burgesss service with the east india company army and lewrie tossed it aside in disgust and sadness as eager as he had been to flee the place and escape carolines ghost to be shot of all the hurtful memories it still irked that what had been his sheetanchor was now turned so topsyturvy if there had been some way for the children to have stayed on there when home from school first offcer sah his marine sentry bellowed enter lewrie glumly called back my god sir lt westcott barged in his hatchet face glowing with delight and his usual brief flashgrin replaced with one that nighreached to his ears captain sir alan lewrie good god above sir mister spendlove and merriman both told me of it soon as i set foot on the gangway my heartiest congratulations sir oh dont you start lewrie gravelled back blanding earned his i didnt really and ive no idea why i was included its all so damned silly but will you say the same at the shore supper tonight sir westcott teased what bloody shore supper midshipman bailey of modeste sah the marine bellowed thatll be the invitation id think westcott said chuckling care to lay a wager on it sir enter lewrie barked more forcefully and a midshipman from the flagship came in hat under his arm and bowing as if to a duke christ they are bowin an scrapin lewrie sulkily thought captain blandings respects sir and i am to extend to you an invitation to you and all your officers an invitation that is to join captain blanding and his officers at a f fete champetre this evening at two bells of the dog watch the lad haltingly said losing his rehearsed place several times it is to be held ashore sir at a restaurante by name of the rookery and any ladies allowed lad lt westcott asked tongueincheek ehm i do not know sir no mention was made the midshipman sneaked a peek at the written invitation to see whether ladies were to be included the rookery mister bailey lewrie asked im not familiar with it why not the grapes they do naval parties just fine and the grapes had been a dockside fixture handily near the boat landings since long before lewries midshipman days and they were used to rowdy behaviour and vomit i am not familiar with it myself sir midshipman bailey confessed looking as if hed like to scuff his youthful shoetoes together in embarrassment but the directions to it are here on the invitation sir ehm harbourside further east along the high street a brick building with a courtyard and a curtain wall before the entrancestis said the rear dining rooms offer a splendid harbour view god lewrie breathed knowing exactly where this rookery was he and christopher cashman his friends and some obliging doxies had celebrated his victory and survival after the beauman duel the breakfast turning into a highspirited drunken battle of flying food and rolls and long long before it had had another owner in he had gone there once a shinynew lieutenant baltasars lewrie suddenly recalled an emigre frenchmans fancy place baltasars i know it ehm the invitation sir sorry midshipman bailey said as he stepped forward and laid it on lewries desk so timorously that he appeared to fear being bitten for being remiss or hesitant to approach a man newly exalted thankee mister bailey my deepest respects to good captain blanding and inform him that i and my officers look forward to the fete champetre with great delight also express my thanks for his kindness lewrie told the lad aye aye sir bailey said stepping back all but clicking his heels or stamping shoes like a marine before turning to go once he was beyond the door lewrie turned to westcott giving him a wink and a lookingover id think after a whole morning with your young lady mister westcott ye might wish tgive her a rest give yourself one too lewrie teased all that and supper would be more than plenty twas an entrancing plentitude sir and thank you for asking westcott replied chuckling in reverie mademoiselle du plessis was her usual delightful self yet one always longs for just a bit more dont we just lewrie thought grinning tautly id expect youd change shirts before the supper sir lewrie said with mock sternness there seems to be some reddish coralcoloured powder on your collar rouge lip paste coloured powder sir westcott was glad to inform him she mademoiselle sylvie dabs it on to ah enhance her breasts specifically the areoli thats a newun on me lewrie thought then it is indeed a pity that theres no mention of invitin any ladies tthis celebration of ours tonight lewrie japed referring to the paper midshipman bailey had left just as well i spose shed be bored ttears with all the salty talk then scared when the bread rolls and pudding start flyin well that is a pity sir westcott said looking a tad downcast or very very tired after his energetic morning besides sir why drag your sylvie to such a tarry gatherin where yed have tshare her attentions with all the other young unmarried and deprived lieutenants lewrie pointed out to listen to their teeth grind sir lt westcott shot back with glee well even if ladies were invited the bulk of emd be a pack o fubsy chickabiddies lewrie said with a sigh and there is the matter of whether mademoiselle sylvie would be suitable for our dash it bedad captain blanding acceptable to chaplain brundish more to the point always tomorrow then do you allow me more shore liberty sir westcott said shrugging or perhaps tomorrow evening after duties are done is the rookery an elegant place we could dine there an allnight in mister westcott lewrie leered oh god please yes sir go mister westcott lewrie ordered with a laugh wipe yerself down and warn the others tshine cant let the repute of the ship down best kit all that aye aye sir going westcott said snapping to a loose sort of attention and bowing his head before turning to depart with a brief pause to ruffle the fur of the cats who were napping like a pair of plum puddings atop the map board in the chart space over the months toulon and chalky had taken to him like a house afire once alone lewrie had to dig at his crotch hed met the stunning sylvie du plessis once and found himself risible at the recollection and envious of westcotts hellishgood luck ive become a tarryhanded seagoin monk he told himself so there he sat vaguely listening to the sound of copulation and revelry on the gundeck with the ship out of discipline then recalling that lt westcott the lucky bastard had made an offhanded comment that mademoiselle sylvie was a venus on the halfshell in private if one changed the hair colour from blonde to brunette of the model for that painting by some bloody italian high culture was not lewries strong suit he couldnt recall which renaissance dago had done it but hed always panted over it and would have bought a copy if his late wife would have allowed in point of fact his last brief intimacy had happened the night before he and caroline had fled paris midsummer of and he had lived an ascetic existence since afloat or ashore a grieving widower who shouldnt at anglesgreen then a sea officer who couldnt in this seagoing monastery of a royal navy frigate im a man a natural man he thought and it aint natural tgo without i never have before by god suddenly he found that he could entertain the idea of female company again yet what sort jamaica was nighawash in grass widows whose husbands neglected them but that would take entree to kingston society and take too bloody long to boot courtesans like mister westcotts sylvie to take some woman like her under his protection would be expensive and hed be moreoften at sea than in her company almost as expensive as taking a second wife with just as little sport resulting whores sadly his last episode in london in his halfpay months following the trial with no hope of gaining any new command ever had been depressing poor little irish tess who was so naive and hopeful mostlike his old friend peter rushtons new mistress if god was just at least he had money a title and a standoffish wife who had presented him with two sons and had no desire to risk another pregnancy so have at dear in point of fact lewrie was at that stage where he could almost squirt semen from his ears if he sneezed i could ask westcott if sylvie has a friend he mused aloud oh god no thatll never do but what will it was a quandary chapter ten hms reliants brief idyll ended shortly after that fete champetre which indeed did feature flung food as the squadron prepared to sail off to prowl round hispaniola once more the easy pendant was lowered the outright whores and declared temporary wives were sent ashore in their jobbers bumboats and the frigate scoured with vinegar then smoked with clumps of smouldering tobacco to cleanse her of smuts odours and shore bugs the last fresh water was pumped aboard from the clumsy arklike hoys the last livestock and saltmeat casks stowed away on the orlop and the officers gunroom stores and captains personal stores were replenished to the final crock of jam and the last pot of ink as with all the holidays reliant and the others would be at sea for easter as well though the reverend brundish assured the captains that hed planned a bangup series of homilies for the occasion not three weeks later though barely at the end of their second circumnavigation of hispaniola a group of three warshipsone lighter frigate and two brigsloopsintercepted them off cape st nicholas with fresh orders any idea what theyre speaking of sir lt westcott wondered aloud as lewrie stood by the starboard mizen shrouds one arm hooked round a stay to steady his dayglass the frigate made modestes number after the private signals then have despatches lewrie replied intent on the mute flagplay between ships modeste then made captain repair on board to her and the frigates gig is settin out to her other than that there was a shrug to show his ignorance of matters beyond that oh heres a newun general to all ships course sousouwest and make all sail conformable to the weather no wait a bit here comes another captain blanding runs off at the halliards again sir lieutenant westcott dared to jape in a low voice meant for the two of them afraid so lewrie said with a snicker its form two columns and i spose thats the frigates number take station to leeward ready to come about to sousouwest mister westcott i assume were tbe the windward column aye aye sir bosun pipe hands to stations helmsmen ready to come about to sousouwest westcott ordered man the braces and sheets the frigate and her consorts had already hauled their wind for the meeting to leeward of modestes column of four warships so the evolution was easily performed reliant the leading ship swung her bows no more than three points more sutherly braced the yards round and eased the tautness of jibs spanker and staysls to take the trade winds on her larboard quarters a reef in the main course sir westcott asked looking aft to see pylades falling astern a bit further than the required cable of separation were striding away from pylades were conformable to the weather mister westcott lewrie laughed hands on his hips and looking up at the set of reliants sails let captain parham clap on more canvas its a nice day tlet her step lively permission to mount the quarterdeck sir pettus asked lieutenant westcott who had the watch cool teas up aye pettus come westcott agreed oh good sailing master caldwell chimed in rubbing his paws together in expectation that hed get a glass too as was the custom that had developed aboard as spring and its heat advanced in this manner nearly fourtyfive minutes elapsed the ships bell struck seven bells of the forenoon and marine lt simcocks favourite tune the bowld soldier boy was heard as the rum keg came from below the masters mates and the midshipmen came up with their sextants and slates to prepare for noon sights to be taken when the bell struck eight bells to end the forenoon and begin the official noontonoon ships day one hopes youll place us in the west indies today mister munsell lewrie teased the thirteenyearold middy should be very easy what with cape saint nicholas still in plain sight and not in the middle of the caicos bank hey closer than usual sir hes improving mr caldwell said with a wink mr munsell was an eager and tarry lad but still iffy when it came to the mysteries of celestial navigation and sun sights signal from modeste sir midshipman warburton piped up it is general sure enough two guns were fired aboard modeste to all to gather their attention and precede a new signal to all seven ships ehm the frigate captains gig is rowing back to her sir warburton added swinging his telescope down from the peak of the signal halliards to modestes side oh here it is sir windward column to alter course to westsouwest half west leeward column thats wordy even for captain blanding lewrie commented the leeward column will wear about to due south sir warburton read out slowly confusing too sir westcott pointed out do both columns alter course together when the hoist is hauled down the lee column yonder had better be quick about it or it will be us who tangle our bowsprit with yon lead sloop hoist the query mister warburton not acknowledged and be quick lewrie snapped aye sir lord sir he cant explain with a fresh hoist without he lowers the one now flying and thatd be sign for execute lieutenant westcott further worried aloud it appeared that captain blanding realised his unclear error for yet another series of flags went up probably the last spare halliard aboard the flagship it was leeward column first now you may reply with acknowledged mister warburton lewrie directed letting out a whoosh of relieved wind and thank god he had enough spares in his taffrail lockers tsay leeward column twice the frigate captains back alongside his ship sir warburton reported a minute later and he could inform them that that worthy whoever he was was back on his quarterdeck and his gig led round to be towed astern mister westcott just tbe on the safe side well continue on this course perhaps a whole minute after the execute lewrie said to his first officer in a close mutter get a bit more separation to the south as they wear about the rest of our ships should stand on in lineahead astern of us mister warburton send to modeste submit then alter course in succession lead ship first and query aye aye sir he wont like me for that lewrie told himself peering aft to see what the flagship would reply if she could at that moment id not care tbe secondguessed publicly either but signals struck sir warburton cried even before he could sort out the proper flags and bend them onto the halliards he and his signalmen jumped to hasten it along the lead sloop is wheeling to leeward sir wescott said sure enough the brigsloop was swinging to take the noreast trades right up her stern then swinging even wider to the west with the winds on her starboard quarters whilst the frigate and the trailing sloop stood on the leading sloop could not complete a full turn over her own wake but would harden up on almost due north for a bit so the others could wear in succession putting their helms over as they reached her disturbed patch of water where shed begun her turn all would stand on for a spell then tack in succession again to end up with their bows pointed sutherly for jeremie and cape dame marie and passing well astern of modestes column of ships new hoist sir our number alter course in succession lets give it yet another minute mister westcott then well come about lewrie directed one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand it was only when the second ship in the lee column swung away to wear about that lewrie ordered his frigate to alter course like a pack of those strange beasts elephants pylades cockerel and modeste changed course in reliants swash as if holding the tail of the first with their trunks and plodding singlefile round a bend of a narrow juggle trail your sextant sir pettus said after getting permission to mount the quarterdeck again his assistant the fourteenyearold waif of a cabin servant jessop carried the precious box which contained lewries personal harrison chronometer clutching it with both arms close to his chest as if it was part of king georges royal paraphernalia almost forgot all about it lewrie admitted as his chronometer was set beside the sailing masters and those of the few officers who could afford their own he barely got his sextant out and held up to his eye and drew the image of the sun down to the horizon when the ships bell began to chime at the last trickle of sand through all the hour halfhour and quarterhour glasses up forward by the belfry time mr caldwell snapped lock and record sirs with sextants stowed away the people on the quarterdeck broke apart into singletons or syndicates of two to figure out their readings with chalk on small slates or with pencils on scrap paper the midshipmen huddled together helping each other or cadging solutions on the sly when they seemed more probable to show the sailing master when summoned uhm about here sir mr caldwell said making a mark on a chart pinned to the traverse board by the binnacle cabinet lewrie compared his own as did westcott spendlove and merriman to the latitude and longitude discovered captain alan lewrie he had to admit to himself was only a fair navigator the mathematics involved had not come to him as easily as it had to his contemporaries aboard his first ships his feelings and his bottom had suffered daily during his time as a midshipman til the right way had been beaten into his brain today he was pleased to note that he was only a few minutes off in both longitude and latitude nonetheless he quickly folded up his scribbled cyphering and shoved it into a coat pocket nodding and harrumphing as if pleased to be in agreement with caldwell who was indeed a dabhand navigator worthy of trinity house mister munsell caldwell asked the lad offered up his slate with the air of a puppy about to be whipped for leaving piddles on the best turkey carpet oh now this is novel young sir your latitude is right but my word sir you have us nigh ashore on the coast of cuba round the bay of guantanamo better than yesterday but mister westcott sir i relieve you sir lt spendlove was intoning as he took over the watch mister spendlove sir i stand relieved westcott replied both doffing their hats ill be below lewrie announced once pettus and jessop had his instruments secured signal from modeste sir midshipman rossyngton who had replaced warburton on watch reported all numbers and captains repair on board well no i wont lewrie said with a sigh be careful with em lads mister spendlove pass word for desmond and my boat crew hell tear a strip off mine arse see if he wont lewrie told himself in public too with all of us present if youll come this way sirs lt james gilbraith bade them once all had been piped aboard lewrie had learned in the span of almost eleven months in captain blandings squadron that gilbraith was a weather vane for his superiors moods and intentions so he watched him closely and was relieved to note that gilbraith was grinning so much like a merry andrew that it might mean there would be no storm of petulance coming his way welcome gentlemen welcome aboard captain blanding said as they were led into his cabins below the poop he stood swaying to the motion of his ship with a glass of wine in hand beaming most cherubic and happy and reverend brundish stood off to one side grinning too a glass for all if you please blanding said to his leading steward and take seats all weve wonderful news an arduous new task before us but wonderful news all the same gentlemen were bound for kingston blanding went on once wine had been supplied captain farquwar and his three ships are to replace us on the hispaniola coasts and we are to replenish then sail for england well ill be parham began to cheer then thought better of ill be damned and clapped his mouth shut huzzah came from captain stroud at last was lewries contribution dont be too excited sirs blanding went on for on our way we shall be the escort for a sugar trade of better than an hundred merchantmen some will make for american ports of course but most will make for home a thankless business but the great trades usually departed the caribbean near the end of february or the first week of march two hundred three hundred ships or more it depended on the end of hurricane season the richness of the sugarcane harvests and pressings for sugar molasses and rum the indigo and dyewood were second thoughts as were the various spices of the west indies like nutmeg and allspice and the ground peppers of various heat this would mostlike be the last late trade assembled before the weather turned hot and the fever season began nowhere as grand as the first but it would still be a bugger to manage as all convoys from the smallest to the largest were the merchant ships must be corraled together all sailing from various ports to a preannounced rendezvous all must be herded into a loose pack round which the escorting ships had to prowl with some serving as bulldogs and whipperins to keep them together and in sight of each other with all ships limited to the best speed of the slowest even before then those ships departing jamaica would have to be bonded each master putting up the refundable sum and signing articles promising to obey all instructions from the escort vessels swearing that they would not break away and swan off until they were near their destinations the route would be arduous too beating into the wind through one of the passages out into the atlantic then heading northerly to run up the east coast of america taking advantage of the gulf stream current and the prevailing winds that swept clockwise round the basin of the atlantic some ships would break away at the latitude of savannah or charleston to enter the chesapeake for baltimore or delaware bay for philadelphia whilst others would be bound for boston or new york to trade their cargoes for yankee goods cotton tobacco and rice predominated along with hemp tar pitch turpentine and naval stores once a ship left a trade it was on its own whilst the rest would still be under escort all the way to various irish scottish or english ports it would be weeks and weeks of frustration anger and the urge to fire into the lot of them for most merchant ship masters were used to going about their own ways second only to god in their authority once out of sight of land all as intractibly stubborn as mules it was worse than herding witless sheep or cats merchant masters would balk at the restrictions the slow going and act as if there werent a war on that required the royal navy that would always come to be thought of as tyrants oppressors martinets or bulliestil some french privateer or warship hove up over the horizon at which point theyd follow their instincts to scatter like headless chickens and blame their capture on the navys failings despite how many french island colonies that had been taken after their return to french possession during the peace of amiens there were still a few french warships lurking round the west indies and many privateers which sheltered in neutral harbours revictualled and fitted out before sortying for fresh plunder with spain neutral french privateers could operate from puerto rico santo domingo cuba and spanish florida with impunity and the americans the damned yankee doodles still thought that the french hung the moon years after theyd helped them win their revolution despite the brief quasiwar between france and the united states over the us right of free trade with any nation favouring none and despite the bloody excesses of the french revolution which should have appalled them there were many americans who counted their years by the french directory calendar with as the year one and harboured a jacobin sans culottes wish to address the inequities between common men and their richer patrician leaders the yankee doodles nursed a continuing dislike for anything british except for luxury goods long after their freedom and independence had been won too and there were many who would turn a blind eye to a french privateer in their harbours between raiding voyages after all america had cut its baby teeth on privateering their own captains and seamen might be envious of french privateersmens success perhaps a blind eye might even be turned to prizes brought in and the cargoes sold as legitimate imports and the ships auctioned off outside of the jurisdiction of formal prize courts thisll be a bastard lewrie gloomed has anyone an estimate of how large a trade it may be sir captain stroud enquired looking ready to be energetic all things considered perhaps prowlin hispaniola wasnt all that bad lewrie japed its very picturesque oh tosh sir captain blanding gleefully disagreed weve been away far too long and none of us have any real wish to stay through fever season whether your suggestions for citronella candles and oil lamps counter the fever miasmas or not as to your question captain stroud id not expect much over an hundred ships or so they tossed round the placement of their ships would blandings larger and heaviergunned modeste lead or trail would it be best for reliant or one of the gunned frigates to serve as whipperin astern was the seaward flank of the convoy the place of most threat or was the land side should french privateers lurk in american ports as they sailed up that coast and would there be any reenforcement to their fourship squadron perhaps even a brigsloop it appeared that captain blanding would not be offering them a midday meal this time after a last glass of wine in celebration the meeting broke up and the frigate captains prepared to depart oh captain lewrie bide a moment would you blanding bade him aye sir blanding waited til the others had gone paced behind his desk in the daycabin and sat himself down resting his elbows on the top dash your eyes sir captain blanding angrily growled that was such a change from his usual humourous temperament that it rocked lewrie back on his boot heels just dash your bloody eyes sir lewrie gawped standing before the desk hat in hand and feeling like a schoolboy about to be tonguelashed then caned our manoeuvring today sir i expected that we had drilled enough over the better part of a year that you would sense my intentions and act accordingly which you did in a way in that you stood on realising that the newcome column must go about astern of us to get clear for their course down towards jeremie and cape dame marie but for you to hoist query and submit and make us look clumsy and cackhanded and foolish in the eyes of contemporaries well ill not have it sir i didnt know whether the newcome column would wear about as they did sir lewrie rejoined or whether theyd luff up and lie bows to the wind to wait for us tpass or were they the windward column your signal hoists made me look foolish more the point sir blanding snapped cutting him off now perhaps i did err in placing them to loord for our rendezvous and perhaps my instructions were a touch confusing but a sensible course of action would have been to deem yourself the burdened vessel and hold your course no matter and let the other fellows figure out the best way round us without impeding us since i had no clue that captain farquwar would be relieving us on station and would have to be the windward column to carry out his orders it only made perfect sense to take them under our lee on the most direct course from jamaica you take too much upon yourself captain lewrie blanding admonished with a grave shake of his head sorry sir was all lewrie could say in response it would be pointless and insubordinate to belabour the issue too many years of independent orders and oneship missions i expect captain blanding mused suddenly sounding as if that was a sorrowful lack just pay attention to my signals from now on sir and intuit my intentions from your experience of me some obedience prompt obedience would be preferable to discussion especially after we pick up our trade its protection is vital and i intend that not a single ship shall be lost to enemy action right sir aye aye sir lewrie could only say hed found that the navy preferred dumb reassurance with that phrase i will second a pair of my lieutenants and my clerk to aid you once we reach kingston captain lewrie blanding said his anger gone in an eyeblink as if the matter hadnt arisen i will place you and reliant as the principal vessel to whom the merchant masters pay their bonds and sign agreements ive also a brace of midshipmen who possess legible handwriting skills should you have need of them you have but to ask very good sir thats all captain lewrie you may depart blanding told him remaining in his seat of power as lewrie hoisted his hat aloft in a salute looking in vain for acknowledgement of his gesture wasnt too bad lewrie told himself once seated in the sternsheets of his gig near coxn desmond not too much was torn off mine arse cause i can still sit on it it still felt galling though he hadnt been reprimanded like that in years no matter how mild damme his signals were confusin in blandings place lewrie admitted to himself that he wouldve let the newcomers take station to leeward too but when the time came he would have ordered them to cross his columns stern in a very simple hoist he shook his head showing a grim smile should i have tugged my forelock to the lord of the manor like a cottager he asked himself or fluttered my sleeves and banged my head on the floor in a chinee kowtow like the coralbuttonmen did in canton to the emperors trade minister lewrie imagined that being made knight of the bath and baronet might have put paid to captain blandings grand sense of humour and boisterous bonhomie he was beginning to take himself seriously was he in danger of doing the same thing lewrie rather doubted it not even if hed been elevated to the peerage he had always had a feeling that he could stand outside himself and sneer at the poses that society demanded of him knowing that he was a fraud and suspecting that sooner or later he would be caught out at it he knew himself too well warts and all and was able to be frank about his lacks and was able to laugh at his pretensions trouble was could captain blanding it would be a pity if he could not for even after his reprimand lewrie still liked him book ii langleterre est une nation de boutiquiers england is a nation of shopkeepers napoleon bonaparte chapter eleven the trade ended up consisting of merchant ships some of them arriving from the minor renewed traffic with the neutral spanish empire in the americas from new granada on the northern shoulder of south america and from the portuguese empire of brazil from new spains ports of tampico and veracruz and from the nowamerican port of new orleans in addition to the merchant ships departing jamaica and the other british islands the route chosen was tortuous leaving jamaica on the noreast trades westwards for the yucatan channel round the westernmost tip of cuba into the gulf of mexico then beating up eastwards through the florida straits strung out like a long weaving python and tacking to either beam for days on end making no more than five or six knots an hour hobbled by the smallest and slowest at the tailend there was absolutely no way to protect them if a privateer sortied out of havana or a florida bay in the straits and later on going north on a beam reach in the even narrower deepwater channel between spanish florida and the british bahamas the trade extended over five miles long and if a foe attacked the tailend it would be only captain william parhams hms pylades that would be able to respond and hours before any of the others could come about and dash to her aid once north of the bahama banks the trade made its best effort to stand noreasterly to get as far out into deep waters as possible where yet another parcel of merchant ships joined them from island colonies in the windwards and the leewards ships from trinidad and tobago barbados st vincent and st lucia ships from antigua and st kitts and nevis they had been escorted by a lone frigate and a much older threemasted sloop of war but damned if those two didnt turn round and toddle off home once theyd delivered their charges to captain blandings and the squadrons care those new arrivals had to have their bona fides certified that their bonds had been paid and their signed agreements to the rules of convoying had been stamped and initialed all tiddly by lewrie and his officers it appeared that captain blandings revenge was endless had alan lewrie had his druthers and had reliant been sailing alone hed have preferred the much shorter route easterly and northeasterly through the windward passage but that decision had been made by the trades commodore the seniormost and most experienced civilian master elected by all the rest and given the titular rank just a step below captain blanding for the length of the voyage and for each of those new arrivals reliants people had to make up fresh signals books to replace the ones they had been issued by the former escorts from antigua which kept lewries clerk faulkes mister cadbury the pursers clerk and the midshipmen with good penmanship scribbling away til every ship had a copy of captain blandings orders what was her problem lewrie asked lt westcott as he returned from one of the slower vessels at the tailend of the convoy modeste had hoisted reliants number then sent number directing her to enquire the reason for the ships astern or those whose distinguishing signal is shown herewith why they do not make sail agreeable to their situation number also directed them to impress a man from each of the offending ships as punishment but lt westcott had returned alone oh well sir the turtledoves main topsl split right down the middle and they had to bend a new one on westcott reported calling for a measure of water from the scuttlebutt not that the new one is a whit younger but thats not their only trouble sir shes a slow leak below and with only a dozen hands aboard two of them boys she cant spare too many from manning the pumps good god who let her try a transatlantic voyage lewrie had to wonder aloud the turtledove was a short and bluff hermaphrodite brig not over eighty feet on the range of the deck with foreandaft sails on her foremast and squaresls on her main and frankly looked as dowdy and illused as a newcastle coal coaster oh shes not sir lt westcott pointed out chuckling shes leaving us when we get level with charleston south carolina saint lucia to there and back again shell probably be a runner for the return passage if she survives this one that is and the reason ye didnt press a man lewrie asked after he shook his head at her masters madness not a one of them worth the trouble sir westcott told him laughing outright the boys some toothless gammers and a spavined oldster or three her captain was the likeliest but hes not a day under sixty call it christian charity sir before being accepted into a convoy as the trades assembled in quarantine they were supposed to be surveyed for seaworthiness for a sufficiency of crew spare spars and sails and for defences but evidently the leeward islands station knowing that such a decrepit old barge would not be bound for europe had let her off easy not if they get attacked it aint mister westcott lewrie said with a mirthless bark of a laugh does she have the defences to qualify as a runner half a dozen pistols ditto for muskets ditto for cutlasses and boarding pikes and three very old twopounder swivel guns sir westcott told him with a grim look though i expect the discharges would deafen half the crew and cause at least two of the gammers to drop stonecold dead lewrie paced to the taffrails of the quarterdeck to hoist his telescope to give turtledove a good lookingover all her sails were now back in place the ripped topsl only slightly lighter in colour than the rest a freshcured deer hide tan against the aged parchment of her other sails at least she now had a mustachio under her forefoot an evident wake creaming down her starboard side though her angle of heel to the winds revealed a strip of sickly green underwater growth on her quickwork as if her coppering had fallen off years ago and her master and owners hadnt bothered to heave her over on a beach to scrape off and burn off the weed and barnacles built slow and losin ground ever since lewrie decided as he shut his telescope and shook his head in wonder at least shes hoistup a main tgallant and an extra staysl up forrud she seems tkeep up now the last cast of the log that midshipman grainger had done had shown a meagre seven knots and reliant had had to take in canvas else she would have strode away from her sternmost charges she wallowed and sloughed unused to such slow progress and once it became dark the merchantmen would take in sail for the night making them bunch up and sheer away in fear of collisions slowing the pace even further at dawn captain blanding in modeste would mount to his poop deck scan about with a glass and go into his daily apoplexy upon seeing how far the ships in the outer columns the ships astern had strayed and then there would be hell to pay and half the morning wasted in chivvying them back into the fold christ what a shitten business lewrie groaned could be worse sir lt westcott said chuckling do we not get a good lift as we pass through the belt of variables we could end set upon cape hatteras he rapped his knuckles on the caprails atop the larboard bulwarks to ward off such a fate you are such a joy mister westcott lewrie said groaning in mock dread turning to cock a brow at his first officer as all the ladies say sir westcott quickly replied with an impish expression on his hatchet face baring his brief style of grin as mademoiselle du plessis said sir lewrie teased oh well sir for a time then tears tears and lamentations westcott said with a dismissive shrug i fear my purse was all but empty after our last short bout and all i had to leave her was a fivepound note but shell find another protector her sort will always survive another reason lieutenants should not marry or lewrie began to say marry sir perish the thought westcott said shivering with mock terror and uttering a brring noise tis the ruin of many a man in the navy or not no no sir not til ive been made post even then id give it a long look and a hard try before committing myself to the one mort well at least i can keep you out of woman trouble so long as were at sea mister westcott lewrie said chuckling at his secondincommands irrepressible lust once in england though a temporary wife in every port sir thank jesus and admiralty lewrie reminded him the watch bells interrupted them eight of them struck in four pairs to signal the end of the day watch and the start of the first dog watch at pm up forward in the limited open space between the crossdeck hammock nettings at the forward edge of the quarterdeck and the binnacle cabinet and doublewheeled helm lt george merriman was relieving lt clarence spendlove of watchstanding duties happy spendlove who would only have to stand a twohour watch til the beginning of the second dog and then have all night in and a long rest this evening if the weather cooperated and no crisis arose you have the middle lewrie asked westcott i swapped with merriman sir just the one night westcott replied if you have no more need of me sir i would wish to take a nap til supper is served out carry on mister westcott lewrie allowed him once he was alone lewrie peered over the taffrails to see if the cutter had been secured to a towing line along with the launch and his gig convoying demanded the ships boats be ready for service at all hours if a merchantman needed warning or assistance blanding more to the point demanded prompt and plentiful use of the boats lewrie put his hands in the small of his back chiding himself to look stern and captainly as he paced forward up the starboard side of the quarterdeck then further onwards up the starboard sailtending gangway towards the bows only halfway noting the neatness of the yard braces that were belayed and hung on the pinrails how the excess rope was flemished in neat coils on the gangway planking his right hand idly rapped the mainmast stays as he passed them satisfying himself that they were properly taut and fighting a grin of pleasure as he told himself that he was fortunate to have mr sprague as bosun and bosuns mate mr wheeler who were so particular and attentive to such things lewrie went onto the forecastle and peered round the tautly bellowed inner outer and flying jibs at their convoy their awful and bloodyminded convoy they had left kingston jamaica with eightyodd merchant ships for the yucatan passage arranged in eight columns of roughly ten apiece with a cable of separation between ships inlineahead and a cable of separation between columns a nice neat travelling box that to your lubberly layman meant once he was told that a cable was fathoms in lengththe convoy spanned a width of civilian yards and extended yards from front to back easily guarded if only it was that simple merchant masters naturally despised other ships getting anywhere close to their own vessels and the tendency was to shy off widening the gaps between columns to nigh two cables and the distance between ships incolumn about twice the desired space as well going west from jamaica had been the easy part with all ships riding a stern wind or a wind on their starboard quarters but once they had turned northerly to beam reach round the tip of cuba it was the leewardlying columns and the ones in the centre that had begun to fall behind for the very good reason that the columns lying closest to the wind stole it from the others and made better speed pulling ahead despite frantic signals to reduce sail to conform with the rest and the laggards ordered to crack on then had come the long slow slog to windward cross the top of cuba and into the florida straits and it was a wonder that captain blanding or any officer in the escort had a hair left on their heads or voices left after screaming all the daylight hours in frustration to make way against the wind a sailing vessel had to make long boards to either side of the prevailing breeze and none but the few foreandaft rigged schooners or hermaphrodite brigs could point into the winds closer than sixtysix degrees off true any closer to the eyes of the wind and squarerigged ships risked luffing up and coming to a ruinous stop with their yards flung aback the trades were funnelled down the straits from roughly the eastnoreast the convoy had to stand on larboard tack to the soueast to make progress but sooner or later there was the cuban coast and its shallows and shoals to consider requiring that the ships come about tacking to take the winds on starboard tack and steering north by east til the equally dangerous shallows of the florida keys loomed up and they would have to go about again in a perfect world experienced merchant mariners could perform that trick all at the same time as soon as the preparative was struck but first one had to get their bloody attention make sure that every ship acknowledged that they were paying attention and was ready to come about then do it together which half of them were not and did not the resulting stampede and chaos would have been hilarious were it not hellishdangerous even the roar of one of modestes pounders would not arouse some of them all escorts had to fire off guns in concert to awaken the worst offenders once in the straits captain blanding had thought that he had the solution to the problem his sailing directions issued to all merchant masters dictated that the eight columns would be narrowed to but four and there had been several long paragraphs devoted to the evolution which the civilian captains had not bothered to read til the very last moment or were too illiterate to grasp in the first place it was like telling the village idiot how to reassemble a clock and hoping for the best the order of sailing had gone to a width of yards and the length from the lead ships to the tailends of the columns to yards and to get them all sorted out into the four columns had taken the better part of a day with ships swanning off on opposing tacks to avoid the ones astern ahead or to either beam to avoid collisions with one column of twentyodd ships thrashing along on starboard tack noreast the outermost column to the north making a board to the soueast on larboard tack and the two columns in the middle not sure whether to shit or go blind lewrie was sure that chaplain brundish had taken himself below aboard modeste heartsick that he had not cured captain blanding of his blaspheming perhaps with wads of oakum and candle wax stuck into his ears so he could not hear the screams of the very best billingsgate curses and imprecations bellowed by merchantmen and navy officers to boot amplified by brass speakingtrumpets a measure of relative calm had been restored once the trade had swung north up the narrow channel between spanish florida and the british bahamas it was only fourtyodd miles wide from the tiny biminis and great isaac and little isaac to the florida shores so blanding had left the convoy in four columns too fearful perhaps of what further calamities would ensue should he try to put them back in the original sailing order and when the leeward islands merchant ships had joined them above the bahama banks in deeper and more open waters they had been shepherded behind ordered to take stations astern of the existing columns lewrie extended his telescope again to look up those four long columns then swung to the right to espy hms modeste out on the eastern flank of the convoy that was where the greatest threat usually would come from seaward and from windward so a hostile warship or a privateer could use the wind to dash in nip at the outer column and snatch up a prize or two before the escorts could react usually lewrie muttered under his breath as he swung about to look for the other two frigates parham and his pylades stood far ahead of the convoy and a bit to seaward searching for trouble and a first glimpse of strange sail stroud and his cockerel guarded the larboard side of the trade about midway down the left flank and a good two miles or more landward a glance aloft at the angle of the yards and the streaming of the long commissioning pendant confirmed that the convoy had found a a slight lift the winds which had blown mildly but steadily from the east now had a touch of eastsoueasting to them two or three days more and lewrie could expect them to come from the soueast and allow all ships to alter course to the eastnoreast giving them all the searoom in the world hundreds of miles off cape hatteras and its shoals for a long curving passage to england far from any searching foes and here i am heres reliant the whipperin at the ariseend lewrie told himself as he collapsed his telescope and took a last look about before heading aft to the quarterdeck once more just ploddin along like a sheepherder this wind continues tback the danger may come off our starboard quarters than abeam itll be a long damn night chapter twelve the second rum issue of the day had been served out evening quarters had been stood til the end of the second dog watch at pm and the evening watch took their stations on deck for the to midnight the tarpaulins were cast off the hammock nettings and the offwatch crews bedding was taken below sunset a rather pleasing one replete with all the ambers and reds and golds of semitropic seas was rapidly fading and the ocean was turning inkblack to seaward still glittering with ebbing forgelight to leeward and the winds after a rather warm day were cooling and most refreshing a nice time to be at sea sir the sailing master mr caldwell commented with a smile as he strolled the quarterdeck puffing away on a short clay pipe the marine lieutenant simcock was taking the air as well and enjoying one of his cigaros indeed it is mister caldwell mister simcock lewrie was glad to agree as he paced about by the windward bulwarks he had shed his uniform coat and his cocked hat to savour the freshness and coolness of the evening and to sprawl in his collapsible woodandcanvas deck chair to enjoy the sunset so far so good with our henheaded charges too nothings gone smash no ones strayed off and none of them have rammed each other early hours sir mr caldwell laughed our merchant captains are possessed of a ton of foolishness its rather pretty sir even so lt simcock commented and pointed with his chin forward and to starboard where the convoy lay and so it was four long strings of sunsettinted sails with each sporting a pair of large taffrail lanthorns winking and rocking as the snailslow hundredodd ships gently hobbyhorsed along those lights casting shimmery patches of yellowgold on the wavetops and at the change of the watch when all ships navy or merchantman had struck eight bells the sound had come down to them like a faint and tinkly carillon much like their situation anent the bloodymindedness of civilians not onetenth of their hour glasses or chronometers had agreed with each other of course so it had gone on for a while well be losing some of our charges on the morrow the sailing master was telling their marine lieutenant privateers youre sure sir lt simcock asked with a gasp the thirtysecond latitude sir mr caldwell told him with a chuckle savannah georgia lies almost directly on the thirtysecond line of latitude and port royal beaufort and charleston south carolina lie a bit to the north of it and thank god for their departure lt spendlove now standing the watch heartily stated which made all three gentlemen laugh with delight the fewer the merrier to my lights ships bound for savannah may run down the line of latitude as they who cross the atlantic for the west indies do the fifteenth latitude in search of the peaks of dominica mr caldwell prosed on glad to puff on his clay pipe and lecture as he did with the midshipmen at their lessons the lazy mans way that does one know ones latitude and holds the compass bearing ones longitude is the only thing to be determined at noon sights and one can spot the mountains of dominica from better than sixty miles given a clear day and the ones bound for charleston get in sight of the coast then turn north til they find it lt simcock further asked he was not one of those clever fellows who were quick with figures that was why his family had purchased him a marine officers commission and discouraged his wish to attend woolwich and earn a commission in the royal artillery at least aboard a warship lt simcock could still indulge in his enthusiasm for cannon and loud bangs oh id suppose some of the leastskilled may grope their way to port in such fashion but the experienced mariner would shape his course directly theres many a master in the coasting trade back home who find their way from one seamark to the next lt spendlove contributed to the conversation people in the fisheries they go out quite a ways to the good grounds but all they require is a compass and a chiplog for dead reckoning theres many a merchant captain who navigates that way lewrie spoke up from his collapsible chair with a snort of displeasure we have met a fair parcel of them the last weeks that raised another round of agreeable laughter lewrie rose from his chair as the last of the sunset guttered out and only a top sliver of the sun lingered above the clear horizon you have the ship mister spendlove he told his second lieutenant im bound below for supper send for me should any more of those yankee ships turn up to terrify our charges aye sir though modeste may alert us first should one of them lurch up spendlove said in parting just in time sir pettus told him as lewrie walked over to his dining table to take a seat pausing to pet toulon and chalky who were already atop it waiting for their evening meal to arrive from the galley a drop of something sir a claret it will be rabbit tonight yeovill tells me aye thankee pettus lewrie agreed noting that a bottle of claret already stood in the tall fiddles of the sideboard breathing yeovill feels unappreciated sir the nights you dont invite others in pettus rambled on as he inspected a shortstemmed glass for smuts for the third time before pouring lewrie a measure likes to show off his culinary skills he does sorry that i disappoint him lewrie said after a first sip of his wine id best have four or five guests tomorrow night else he goes pettish hungry are ye lads lookin forward to rabbit he teased the cats that set them off to quivery delight they knew a few sounds or words like sausage or jerky and treats that would presage food as well as they recognised their own names and would come running well some of the time when called rabbit in particular when fitting out and victualling in portsmouth the year before captain blanding had suggested that rabbits and quail pigeons and guinea fowl made a tasty alternative to saltmeats even before in anglesgreen there were several large rabbit warrens on lewries rented farm so many that theyd get into the truck gardens and eat themselves silly in a single night it was not allowed to hunt or snare them for the land belonged to uncle phineas chiswick lewries late wifes relative but patrick furfy was a hellishclever poacher and somehow the rabbit population was reduced to a manageable level and grilled rabbit or jugged hare turned up on lewries table and in the cats bowls with regularity oh yes they knew rabbit when they heard it capms cook sah the marine sentry outside the doors to the greatcabins bellowed stamping his boots and musket butt on the decks in breezed yeovill with the large oval metal barge in his hands good evening sir yeovill said perfunctory that and equally sketchy was his greeting smile no he aint happy lewrie thought good evening yeovill lewrie replied with forced enthusiasm something smells delightful im bound rabbit sir yeovill answered sounding a tad glum as he took the lid off the barge and began setting out smaller pots a one big enough for you and the kitties first off though sir a hearty bean soup toulon and chalky were teetering on the edge of the table whiskers laid far forward and their tails twitching as yeovill got within pawing distance as he served from the sideboard they stretched paws out to remind him that they were famished too excellent lewrie exclaimed as he sat down and whipped his napkin over his lap though thinking the old saw therell be foul winds from astern by morning a lot of pepper sauce the way you like it sir yeovill added as he set a bowl of soup before him from toulon and chalky came hungry trills and outright wails of demand if youll pardon me sir ill see to the eats whilst you eat your soup yeovill asked and lifted out a small pot from which he spooned shredded rabbit rice and unseasoned beans into their bowls aye go right ahead yeovill theyre starving lewrie said between spoonfuls always glad tsee you they are er thankee sir yeovill replied with a tad more warmth than before and a slightly broader grin the rabbit sir i roasted with salt pepper and a dash of jamaican seasonings then topped off with a large dollop of red plum jam as you might with venison theres sweet potato with butter boiled peas and baked cornmeal pones to boot sir yeovill boasted what mister cooke showed me how to make without milk or eggs one would go handsomely with the soup this minute aye it would lewrie agreed as yeovill took the cloth cover off the separate bread barge and placed one on the side of his plate by the soup bowl uhm hot and fresh youre a wonder yeovill christ hes worse than dealin with a wife lewrie thought as he bit into the pone what the ships freed slave black cook called a hotwaterdrop pone it was good though thankee for saying so sir yeovill replied pleased that his efforts had garnered praise yeovill had come aboard from an inn that had burned down losing his position and fancied himself a chef in the french restaurateur style hed even come with a large chest containing his own pots pans knives and an host of sauces and seasonings for a man who knew his way with victuals yeovill was a thinun with a rough complexion and a shock of light brown hair so curly that it looked like friz especially so since he had let it grow out into a seamans queue the hair bound back at the nape of his neck stood out like a bottle brush or a frightened cats tail oh ill be having five supper guests tomorrow night yeovill lewrie told him first officer purser lieutenant simcock and two mids thought id warn ye now not wait til breakfast supper for six sir yeovill said perking up devilishglad depend on me sir excellent lewrie rejoined i knew i could well i will leave you to it sir yeovill said with a satisfied sniff and a slight bow from the waist if jessop can return the servers to the galley when youre done oh forgot to mention but theres a wee apple turnover to go with your port and cheese sir you spoil me yeovill deed ye do lewrie praised further once yeovill had left lewrie cast a wry grin at pettus who was filling a plate with his entree aye sir pettus agreed with a roll of his eyes but he is a wonder even so sir lewrie had dined later than usual later than his officers as was the custom barely had he finished a single glass of port and a meagre slice of cheddar that had not gone redwormy yet than the ships master at arms mr appleby and the ships corporals scammell and keetch began their rounds to assure that all lanthorns and glim candles were doused for the night at pm as soon as two bells of the evening watch were struck he took himself on deck for one last turn with his coat on this time against the cool wind and damp captains on deck midshipman houghton warned the others lt spendlove shifted from the windward bulwarks to amidships of the quarterdeck to accommodate lewries presence evening sir he said alls quiet mister spendlove lewrie asked once settled by the mainmast shrouds mostly sir though i was about to send for you to ask if i might post a lookout aloft spendlove hesitantly said the lookouts on deck weve spotted several lights the last few hours sir ships passing sutherly inshore of the convoy at least three for sure and there was one ship bound south on the windward horizon more american merchantmen lewrie asked with a scowl and one lifted brow how far off the inshore ones very possibly sir spendlove replied shrugging as to the ones to leeward of us they seemed to be at least ten or twelve miles off right on the horizon the one up to windward sir spendlove added sweeping an arm out to starboard aye lewrie said stepping up onto the slide of a carronade carriage then atop the barrel to the top of the bulwarks clinging to the thick tarry cables of the shrouds and of half a mind to go outboard and clamber up the ratlines for a better view for that mysterious set of ships lights was still visible from the quarterdeck and a higher vantage point might tell them more about the strange ship that displayed them no signal from modeste lewrie asked chiding himself for the uselessness of his question at once if the flagship had been worried there would have been bluelight fusees burning in her main tops and signal rockets whooshing skywards by the dozen alerting guns would be roaring and ruining his supper none so far sir lt spendlove told him in a neutral voice mostlike hes bitin his cheek not tlaugh at such a henhead question lewrie thought coming down was harder than going up in the dark lewrie went at it gingerly so he didnt crack an ankle by jumping down he was not as spry as hed been in his midshipman days aye post lookouts aloft in the fore and mizen tops lewrie directed rubbing his hands with a cheap calico handkerchief to remove the cold tar that had stuck to him from the shrouds have we nightglasses to spare do i lend mine sir aye spendlove volunteered mister westcott will be taking the middle for mister merriman tonight lewrie remembered when he relieves you my compliments to him and hes to post lookouts aloft as well aye sir carry on mister spendlove pay me no mind lewrie bade him i only came for the air he paced aft down the starboard bulwarks right to reliants own glowing taffrail lanthorns shielding his eyes from the brightness to peer seaward at the strange set of lights with his hands cupped to either side of his brows those lights were faint and very far off and about four or five points abaft of amidships it was too dark to spot her sails to determine if the strange vessel was bound south or was idling under reduced sail on a course matching their own waiting for a chance to crack on and dash up to the convoy during the dull hours of the midle watch still shielding his eyes lewrie crossed over to larboard and peered out at the other lights from the height of the quarterdeck above the ebonyblack sea all he could determine of them was that one set of lights was only a point or two abaft and the two south of her were even further astern of reliant and far astern of the bulk of the convoy the newlyposted lookouts aloft might be able to see more of them but only a little more as lewrie watched the sutherlymost set of lights winked out making him stiffen had she doused them no they winked to life one deep breath laterboth that distant vessel and reliant had sloughed into wave troughs at the same time he realisedthen winked out again and did not reappear even as the frigate rose atop the waves hopefully over the horizon and innocent as a baby chick lewrie thought with fingers crossed damme forget a decent hour or three o sleep ill be up half the night in fret chapter thirteen oh dear lord what a bloody lt westcott began to shout then thought better of it theyre all a pack of ninnies and all i ask is you dont let us be rammed or trampled mister westcott lewrie said with his fingers crossed again and a look of sheer stupefaction on his phyz a quarterhour before the start of the forenoon watch at am modeste had put up a flag hoist that would release the merchant vessels bound for georgian or carolinian ports unfortunately civilian shipmasters were in the main not used to the customs of the royal navy the flag signal twoblocked at the peak of the halliards should have been taken as the preparative put up early enough for even the dullest sleepiest lookouts or mates of the watch aboard the trading vessels to have time to one see it two look up what it meant in their signals book and read it three grasp what the devil it meant and four act upon it when it was struck down not before as soon as the signal went aloft however and two guns were fired to direct all ships attention to it some of the americasbound vessels hauled their wind that instant going broader on the breeze some with the winds fine on their starboard quarters some others settling on a soldiers wind to the norwest with the breeze square on their sterns and both sheets aft yet a few others wore about to take the soueasterly wind on their larboard quarters bound due west for savannah port royal and beaufort two bloody hours to herd them back together for this lt westcott grumbled some more astounded by the chaos that that preparative hoist had engendered just fire into the most threatening sir lewrie told him with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek as the somewhat orderly nature of the convoy shredded in an eyeblink it was regrettable that those americasbound merchantmen werent all in the landward columns they were scattered throughout the convoy like raisins in a duff to obey that signal assuming they had seen it or paid the slightest bit of attention they had to wheel about onto a new course whilst the bulk of the ships bound for ports further north or for england stood on to the nornoreast well they did til the ship that was waddling along two cables to windward decided to haul her wind and come down or the ship wallowing ahead altered course forcing the vessel down for the long voyage to wheel about to avoid a collision too which wheelabout frightened the ship astern or to starboard to duck away as well which laid her on a collision course with one of those departing ships that had come swanning leeward in dumbvery dumbobedience to that signal harden up windward two points mister westcott lewrie snapped as that idiotic halfrotten turtledove which had been lagging astern all through the night put her helm over to wear to due west as slow as she was she would be beamon to reliant in another minute as good as shouting hit me amidships i dare you another two points lewrie ordered half a minute later as the turtledoves sorry collection of gammers and clueless teens took an age to complete their wearabout to larboard tack and was making as much a rate of knots as a drifting log thankee for the escort reliant her aged captain whinnied as the frigate shaved past her at long musketshot we will take it from here i hope ye bloo lewrie began to shout back through a brass speakingtrumpet but forebore i hope you have a safe passage he said instead you cunnythumbed cackhanded clown he muttered to himself oh god i cant stand it lt merriman said holding his arms round his middle and wheezing with laughter what an idiot i say now dont the columns look rather queer marine lt simcock on the quarterdeck to take the morning air pointed out one would think theyd seen a privateer or something normal is it reliant indeed had a fine view of sheer terror aftermost of the escorts at the tailend of those four long columns which were now haring off in pennypackets no larger than two or three and all on disparate courses they could witness it all modeste has struck her signal sir midshipman munsell reported the execute is ordered about bloody time lewrie snorted mister westcott well spanish reef the main course and topsl for a bit and get a way off her else well tangle with the aftermost ship of the windward column she was a large threemaster nigh the size of an indiaman and had ended up at the end of her column due to her lack of speed and was looming up quickly her master and mates on her quarterdeck were peering astern with their eyes so blared open that lewrie fancied that he could see the whites of their eyes at a full cable hands aloft quickly clewed up reliants main course and main topsl to reduce the spread of canvas and her own speed turning the windfull sails into lubberly bags even as the merchantmans sailors scrambled aloft to shake reefs from her own sails and get a way on it would make her fast enough to avoid collision with the frigate but it would also push her along a knot faster than the ship ahead of her in column which would put the wind up that one forcing her to spread more canvas or turn alee threatening whichever vessel lay ahead or to leeward of her and it was like watching an overly hopeful childs stack of wooden blocks come crashing down ehm should someone have planned for lt simcock hesitantly asked looking about completely clueless isnt there anything to be done cross your fingers arnold lt merriman said tittering with nowsubdued amusement say a prayer if you like cross your legs and guard your nutmegs too sir the sailing master mr caldwell guffawed gawd i havent seen the like in all my born days like a pack of headless chickens about all we can do is sit back and watch it play out lewrie decided aloud and if no one goes aboard another and if we dont have to render assistance i expect itll take til midafternoon to herd em back into proper order i could send blanding a signal with a humble submit but i dont think hed be very receptive lewrie thought trying very hard not to laugh out loud its all up to him just an obedient old sailor me yarr and belike har har were safe sir lt westcott opined well be clear of yon threemaster in a minute and up to windward of her a bit very well mister westcott lewrie replied once clear we will shake the spanish reefs out and stand to windward of the convoy tkeep the most of em from dashin off for bloody africa ooh that was a closeun lt merriman groaned aah i was sure theyd tangle lt spendlove drawn on deck by the commotion said of another close call ahead of them aha signal rockets in the daytime mr caldwell pointed out mmm pretty midshipman munsell enthused it was a miracle that all ships came through without a scratch in their paint or a scrape down their hull scantlings twentyfive vessels left the convoy wheezing with relief cursing like billingsgate fishmongers or fanning with their hats in shuddery damme ive cheated death again laughter that left eightyfour bemused or frightenedoutoftheirwits ships remaining which captain blanding in modeste tried to reassemble lots of powder was expended in alerting guns and every signal flag was employed from modestes taffrail lockers before it was managed blanding ordered the remaining ships to fetchto and await his new directives reliant cockerel and pylades were ordered to send boatsnot captains repair on board their senior officer was mostlike too abashed to face his juniors at that pointwhich took at least an hour or more were to what lewrie asked once midshipman houghton returned were ah to enquire of all vessels their ports of call sir houghton told him captain blanding has supplied us with the names and numbers hes assigned to each and were to sort them out in their order of departure from the trade sir he will reassemble the convoy with all ships due to leave us for american ports into the leemost column or columns sir so they may haul their wind and peel off as we approach the latitude of their destinations sir avoiding another ah oh aye avoidin that again lewrie scoffed dubious wish hed thought o that beforehand lewrie thought damme i bet he does too or i shouldve if no one else did captain blanding had vowed that not one of the merchantmen entrusted to his care would be lost and despite that mornings debacle none had been what happened to the lightlyarmed runners that left the convoy was not the navys responsibility of course but it looked as if keeping that vow would take several tons of luck and lewrie strongly suspected that theyd used a fair parcel of that luck up bosun mister sprague all ships boats in the water and manned lewrie called down to the frigates waist ill send you in one mister houghton mister entwhistle and mister warburton pass the word for them pray and ill explain their duties once here ehm captain blanding also wishes that the trade be ordered into eight columns sir mr houghton went on shambling his feet at being remiss in mentioning it lewrie just goggled at him for a bit well thatll keep ye busy til sundown mister houghton oh take joy of it do young sir lewrie could not help from saying and laughing right out loud after a long moment christ what a shitten potmess he thought theyd been given a list of names of the remaining ships and the names of their masters and would have to go aboard each one that was within sight in the rear of the convoy assign them their proper new numbers then tell them to assemble to leeward if they were down for wilmington north carolina the james river or the chesapeake or ports further north lewrie was mortalcertain that his mids would be greeted with goggleeyed astonished stares and splutters asking how they were to work their way leeward through the others then they would have to shepherd them to their new placings then report to captain blanding in modeste the names and numbers of the ships sent to the leeward columns so some clerkishsoul likely chaplain brundish could write it all down with little ovals representing each ship with ship names numbers and destinations jotted in tiny script beside each to be checked off like landed crates from a cargo manifest as each departed them hell it might be dawn tomorrow fore were back under way and in proper order lewrie groaned to himself it would be yet another very long night and the chance of an enemy privateer showing uplewrie had let that threat escape his mind for some timedid not even bear imagining and what some curious and bemused american merchant ship that stumbled onto them during all that sorting out thought of the efficiency of the royal navy didnt bear thinking about either reliant was fetchedto along with their convoy rolling and wallowing most sickly lewries cook yeovill came onto the larboard gangway from the galley up forward he was not a good sailor with a castiron constitution if the ship was not under way he cast his accounts to neptune overside damme that says it all dont it lewrie cynically thought chapter fourteen lewrie had overestimated the time it would take to shake their convoy into its new sailing order eight columns of ten merchantmenwith the last odd four tacked onto the tailendgot formed by sunset at the end of the second dog the efforts of the escort ships had been aided by the boats from lady of swansea the civilian commodore of the trades ship and several of that worthys old friends who captained some of the bigger threemasters that regularly voyaged from the west indies and back lewrie suspected that what those experienced masters said among themselves and passed along to every other vessel they could reach went something very much like listen mates this giltlaced navy popinjay has less of a clue than a fart in a trance so heres what well do and bugger him but then captain alan lewrie had been a cynical and sarcastic sort for years on end this sunset was not as spectacular as the one he had enjoyed the evening before the wind was gathering strength from the soueast and the seas were a tad more boisterous though the skies were piled with white cloud during the afternoon and the sunset was still pacificlooking despite the building thickness to the west to leeward there was a suspicious odour of fresh damp to the air presaging rain somewhere around them sooner or later hms reliant still prowled the rear of the convoy swanning from its larboard quarter to its starboard corner continually making shortening sail as it ran up close to the laggards dashing off to investigate why a trailing ship did not press on then quartering back to spur another to keep upfor the third or fourth time the ships boats were still in the water being towed astern by long painters with tarpaulin covers to keep out the rain and splashed waves sure to come from swamping them lewrie took note as he made one last stroll round the quarterdeck before going below for his supper he looked forward once he fetched up at the crossdeck hammock nettings studying their convoy and shaking his head it was now more manageable to escort with two cables between each of the eight long columns it now spanned almost a full two miles in width and with ten ships in each columnless the four oddunswith two cables separation between those it was about two and a half miles long each of its flanks could be watched more closely by captain strouds cockerel to leeward or captain blanding in modeste to windward and pylades at the head of the box and reliant at its rear had much shorter distances to go to confront any threat that loomed up in the night as slow as the convoy sailed mr caldwell the sailing master estimated that they were now close to the th degree of north latitude and about miles east of the cape fear in north carolina the winds had backed sufficiently and now came from the soueast allowing all of the ships to reach across them on a noreasterly heading assuring them good clearance of cape hatteras and the dangerous outer banks and pray god the winds stayed out of the soueast so that the bulk of the trade could reach the th latitudewhere the new englandbound vessels would leave themand steer easterly across the north atlantic itll be dark as a boot tonight lewrie said to lt spendlove who had the watch aye sir and smells very much like rain spendlove agreed though there was no sign of it to windward before sunset the clouds were darkest to leeward of us keep a sharp lookout lewrie cautioned as he went below aye sir tis a perfect night for raiders his supper guests were already in his cabins and his steward pettus had opened the wine cabinet for them lt westcott was sipping rhenish as was the sailing master mr caldwell marine lt simcock had a brandy and the mids warburton and grainger were smacking their lips over sweeter sherries when lewrie greeted them wed best not irk the master at arms so lets take our seats and dine lewrie suggested with luck we may be done by the time he orders all lights extinguished hey you may serve yeovill aye sir his cook perkily replied eager to show off what he had cobbled together good ho lt simcock enthused at the soup a hearty beef and shredded bacon broth quite zesty indeed lewrie agreed after a first spoonful i wonder if captain blanding sups this well tonight sir mr caldwell slyly said with a broad grin above his napkin which was tucked into his shirt collar captain blanding always dines well lt westcott added if he has the appetite this evening though i doubt well discover whether he does or not lewrie told them grinning himself youll note that invitations to dine aboard the flagshipve dropped off next to nothing of late perhaps when were in an english port sir westcott hinted with a wink one last gettogether before the squadrons broken up if only lt simcock wished aloud with a dramatic sigh you wish such mister simcock lewrie asked convoying is not as exciting as our previous duties sir lt simcock said with a shrug but do we discharge the duty well there is a chance that admiralty will find us so useful at it that well be doing it forever oh god westcott said cringing heaven forbid we could lose a few merchantmen perhaps and midshipman warburton cheekily posed half to his messmate grainger and half to the table grainger looked ready to choke on his titters though it does seem to have its amusing moments westcott said with a snicker the last two days at least with enough forethought though that chaos could have been avoided mr caldwell supposed with a frumpy disapproving air i didnt think of it lewrie told them my one experience at convoying was with a john company trade to cape town and they were all going to calcutta then canton together so it never entered my mind that departing ships had tbe placed to leeward well know better next time if there is a next time lt westcott said with another mockshiver and gaggrimace which expression set midshipman grainger off again or formed in more than four columns sir mr caldwell asked with a derisive tone to his voice everready to lecture they were simply too hard to guard in such a formation and we were very fortunate that no privateers popped up so far well id imagine that captain blanding thought that only four columnsd make our convoy more manageable in the straits weve passed through lewrie countered finding himself defending blanding though he secretly agreed with caldwell especially on those legs of our passage requiring an hundred or more ships to beat to weather as bad as they had to tack so often think how much more catastrophic things could have been with eight or ten columns bearing down on each other now that would have been a picture lt westcott laughed out loud wed surely have lost a few as mister warburton wishes and then wed never be saddled with convoy duty again ha ha my thoughts exactly lewrie thought with a taut little smile pettus topped up their glasses whilst jessop and yeovill fetched out the next courses there was a sliced ham smoked in the rural american fashion and purchased ashore in kingston from a yankee trader each guest got a fairly fresh baked potato and green beans the beans dried for longterm storage on long strands that the ships cook had laced from the overhead beams in the galley what americans from south carolina that lewrie had met in had called leather britches a good soak and boiling with a ham hock or square of bacon fat brought them back to life and served with shreds of scalded onion well to liven up the meal there was mustard worcestershire sauce the usual salt and pepper and a liquid pepper sauce that yeovill had discovered on jamaica as well as a creamy gravy and some relatively fresh globs of butter for the potatoes all the seasonings were more than welcome after a few weeks at sea on a diet consisting mainly of saltmeats beans peas and dry ships bisquit anything that could add zest and tang to rations temporarily relieved the boredom lingering on the tongue long after the meal was done lastly came a rice custard sweetened with honey and sugar and with some lemon juice so sweet and tangy that the midshipmen lapped theirs up in an eyeblink and looked longingly for seconds midshipman grainger swearing that it was as good as his mothers lemonade now had i more time this afternoon sirs yeovill bragged as he spooned out more for the youngsters i would have done you all an omelet apiece for a second course with bacon cheese and a spanish salsa all peppers tomatoes and such they put up in stone crocks with vinegar there was some in the soup sirs and i hope you found it savoury indeed i did yeovill lt simcock assured him the gunrooms chickens or mine yeovill lewrie asked with one brow up in jest eggs is eggs sir what bankers on the change in london call fungible once laid and moved from nest to nest yeovill replied with an inscrutable expression three cheers for mister yeovill a most excellent chef lt westcott urged lifting his glass on high hear hear the sailing master seconded a glass with him lt simcock proposed well sirs yeovill demurred with false modesty aye a glass with mister yeovill lewrie agreed nodding to pettus to pour the fellow a glass of something yeovill chose brandy and knocked it back quickly smiling fit to bust as if hed just had congratulations for the meal from the king himself as they all joined him in a celebration drink yeovills job was done for the night it was pettus and jessop who cleared the table of plates glasses and utensils snatched away the dampened tablecloth and set out the port bottle fresh glasses and smaller barges containing sweet bisquit nuts and cheeses once all their glasses had been charged with port lewrie looked down the table to midshipman grainger the youngest that evening who was seated at the foot of the table he raised his glass of port and intoned gentlemen the king grainger paid no notice busy stuffing sweet bisquit into his mouth in a squirrelcheek contest with warburton ahem warburton elbowed grainger what grainger objected gentlemen the king lewrie repeated more sternly oh lord grainger said with a gulp realising his error and quickly grabbing his glass to raise on high gentlemen i give you the king sooner or later lt westcott japed once the toast had been drunk to heeltaps dined ashore with some army officers once the sailing master recalled they stood for the kings toast of course but when a senior officer proposed it their vice was too foxed and distracted and when the president of the mess repeated it louder the poor chap looked round and said the king here well show him in haw haw i give you thursdays toast sirs lewrie went on heres to a bloody war or a sickly season the best and quickest way to promotion and advancement that and a sentiment shared by all the mids most especially thank you for the invitation to supper sir warburton said as the port bottle made its larboardly way to him again the memory of it may carry me through tomorrows banyan day on mondays wednesdays and fridays cheese pease bisquit and oatmeal were the main victuals and hellishdisappointing no matter how liberal were the portions there was no mustard no other sauce that could make a banyan day tangy for which we have queen elisabeth to thank mr caldwell said god bless her miserly nature kept the fleet aboard after beating the spanish armada too lt westcott added scurvy and fevers made a hellish reaping before they were released and paid dye see the fewer heroes the greater the glory lewrie japed with a cynical leer dont believe there were any spanish prizes taken so there wasnt a larger share awarded to the survivors either so bang of a musket stock slamslam of the marine sentrys boots and a louderthannormal shout of midshipman houghton sah enter lewrie bade cocking an ear to the sounds of the ship and not liking what he heard bosuns calls were already shrilling mister spendloves duty sir and theres a strange ship attacking the lee columns cockerels fired off signal rockets heres your excitement mister simcock lewrie said rising quickly and dashing his napkin to the deck all hands and beat to quarters chapter fifteen the night was black as a boot but sprinkled with the firefly tiny gleams from taffrail lanthorns gleams that seemed to be swinging more easterly as the leeward columns of merchant ships shied from the threat of a raider in their midst the cockerel frigate was filling the air with upswooshing pinpricks of bright amber lights of warning rockets and her mainmasts uppermost tip showed a series of fusees burning bright blue in a diamond pattern as lewrie gained the deck cockerel fired off two guns their discharges eyeblink spurts of white powder smoke shot through with amber and yellow is she taking something under fire lt spendlove was worrying aloud making the general signal to the convoy more like sir midshipman houghton commented as a marine drummer began the long roll mister westcott lewrie called out aye sir steer due north for the convoys larboard quarter and crack on sail lewrie ordered very good sir quartermasters come about to due north mister spendlove i relieve you westcott snapped drawing a breath for his next shout to the bracetenders on either gangway aye and thank you sir spendlove said before dashing to his post at quarters in the waist to supervise the guns reliant rode the inkblack seas on a beam wind at that moment rising and surging forward then sloughing into a wave trough and butting through with a brief loss of momentum the frigate trembled with what felt like a stallions impatience at the startline of a race as offwatch sailors thundered up from their mess and berthing deck for their posts some in shoes but most unshod gun tools were dealt out the arms chests were unlockedthat took a moment for lewrie had come to the quarterdeck without the keys and had to send pettus to fetch themand the dull red battle lanthorns were lit down each battery between the guns reflecting hellisheerie from the tubs of swabbing water even more tiny lights flickered to life as the slowmatch fuses were coiled round the tops of the tubs and the ends lit to ignite the primer quills should the newer flintlock strikers fail cast off your guns lt spendlove was loudly ordering as the hands mustered by their pieces your sword and pistols sir pettus asked from behind lewrie almost making him jump pistolsll be more useful tonight pettus lewrie told him if theres need tboard anything ill snatch up a spare cutlass be back in a trice sir then ill see the cats to the orlop pettus promised then ghosted away at a dash for the greatcabins as reliant altered course the convoys many lights swung away to starboard even quicker tautening up to the wind at full and by to beat their way to weather and safety god just look at em lewrie muttered groaning as bad as a flock o witless sheep the somewhat orderly columns that had stretched ahead of reliant when she had sailed along astern of them were now seen from a new angle and what lewrie could see wasnt pretty viewed from the convoys larboard quarter and all ships scurrying away he could make out no order to it and was put in mind of the thousands of floating lotuses and tiny oil lamps wafting down the hooghly river during some hindoo festival when he had been at calcutta so long ago the ship is at quarters sir lt westcott crisply reported a minute later all his earlier gaiety vanished very well mister westcott lewrie replied now does anyone see anything out there he put his hands on his hips and looked up to the mizen and the main fighting tops which were now manned by spry younger topmen sharpshooters marines and lookouts aloft there sing out do you spot something lt westcott shouted to them with a speakingtrumpet lewrie walked to the forward edge of the quarterdeck for a looksee of his own there was the gaggle of the convoy to starboard and there was captain strouds cockerel a mile or so off the larboard bows and there was a set of lights that he took for captain parhams pylades much further off fine on the starboard bows but other than those he could make out nothing deuced odd sir lewrie heard the sailing master say to lieutenant westcott how could a privateer or frigate approach from alee windwards the preferred method is our raider a big fast schooner mister caldwell striking from loord though shed be knots faster than any of the tubs were guarding and can go much closer to the eyes of the wind a schooner could come up to us closehauled your pistols sir pettus announced as he popped up ghostlylike once more primed and loaded thankee pettus lewrie said like to jump out of his skin again as he accepted his doublebarrelled pistols and stuck them onto the waistband of his breeches by the spring clips how the hell does he do that lewrie wondered as pettus vanished into the dark deck there a lookout on the foremast shouted cockerels turnin twindward lewrie peered and squinted forward sure enough he could make out a change in cockerels lights her taffrail lanthorns were coming together the starboard one overlapping the laboard and the distance between her stern lights and her mainmast fusees becoming greater by the glow of her fusees he could barely spot some of her upper sail canvas whatevers out there its got past her lewrie barked and to windward of us harden up to windward mister westcott lay her head noreast again were a mile up to windward more than cockerel lewrie schemed hoping that reliant might stumble upon whatever stroud had discovered first if theres a privateer tween us and the convoy deck there the mainmast lookout shouted this time signal rockets to starboard rockets four points off the starboard bows make for the ship launching rockets mister westcott lewrie snapped aye sir the first officer replied lt westcott pointed out to the noreast as he spotted the merchantman in distress thus quartermaster he directed the helmsmen chopping his hand to indicate the course harden up for a close reach bosun reliant turned up closer to the winds her yards braced up for more speed and the decks canting over to leeward a few more degrees barely had she settled on the new course than the lookouts raised the alarm again more distress rockets were being launched by other ships further up to the noreast two of em damn their eyes lewrie snapped pounding a fist on the crossdeck railings thatunll be cockerels pigeon we can only deal with the one off our bows and since the convoy had turned away to flee so precipitously the merchant ship that lewrie could aid was more than a mile away and if she had let fly all her canvas it would take reliant more than half an hour to catch her and the raider up shes not firing any more rockets mr caldwell commented i expect shes run out of them by now or shes taken sir lt westcott speculated whoops i was wrong the sailing master said theres more from the same ship or yet another one lewrie wondered in rising frustration theres so many stern lights its hard to tell which one launched them which ones launching now poor modeste lewrie heard midshipman houghton snigger she will be no help at all aye mister houghton caldwell agreed chuckling a bit too shes not so much leading the stampede as she is being chased and cant come about without the risk of colliding with one of them or causing a whole series of collisions the midshipman further supposed that wont do captain blandings choler any good sir lieutenant westcott standing closer to lewrie muttered it wouldnt do mine any good either mister westcott lewrie replied wryly grinning and shaking his head i expect well hear all about it come tomorrow hark gunfire sir westcott said of a sudden head lifted as if sniffing the air like a hound no one aloft or on deck had seen the gun flashes and the sound came down seconds later after the flashes guttered out where away the gunfire lewrie yelled aloft but no one had a clue i think it came from larboard sir up to the north of us westcott said with his head cocked over in puzzlement and shrugging among the stragglers from the leemost column mostlike gunfire a lookout cried at last deck there gun flashes tlarboard two points off th larboard bows i see it sir midshipman houghton cried there sirs one of the leading ships of the lee column that was even further away than the two merchantmen that theyd seen firing distress rockets making lewrie frown in concern damme could there be three privateers out there he griped if there are lets hope that parham and pylades are close enough to help her pray jesus we get to grips with somebody marine lt simcock fretted from his place by the starboard entryport on the sailtending gangway where a file of his marines stood swaying with their muskets ready and loaded well try tfind you some amusement sir lewrie snapped back sorry sir simcock all but whispered much abashed it took nearly that estimated half an hour to catch up with the trailing ships of the fleeing convoy and to get close enough to one of them to speak her hoy there this is reliant lewrie shouted to her from his starboard bulwarks hoy the reliant her master called back from the larboard side of his quarterdeck this is the avon captain quarles here were you the one firin distress rockets lewrie asked him aye a big schooner come up from loord and went aboard the ship astern of us the peacock captain quarles shouted poor old capm venables was boarded and took before he could signal for help i cracked on sail and started firing off rockets to warn the others but there was nothing i could do for them what took you so long eat shit and die lewrie muttered and took a deep breath to calm himself before replying where is peacock now sir last we could see of her she and the schooner put about onto larboard tack and headed off sousouwest didnt you see her sir god dammit lewrie spat realising that the peacock was lost for good it had been the better part of an hour since avons first rockets had been launched since the privateer schooner had ghosted in and pounced then tacked as soon as the boarding party had secured their prize peacock was a fullrigged threemasted ship and could sail no closer to the wind than six points about sixtysix degrees slow as that process could be she would now be miles astern of the convoy and to dash off to rescue her would involve a very long sternchase if her lights were doused lewrie could only hope to lay his frigate on the same course of sousouwest and thrash blindly after her in the utter darkness but he could not do that once clear of the vicinity of the convoy the privateer surely would head west for some american port to sell her off quickly and trying to cut a course westerly in hopes of stumbling across her and the privateer by midday tomorrow would be equally bootless besides were there other privateers waiting to strike he could not abandon the other helpless ships he had to stay with the trade thankee captain quarles if the privateer schooners gone ye may be safe for the night lewrie called over aint you going after her quarles demanded i must stay with the convoy lewrie shouted back and damned well ye know it or should he whispered for his own benefit oh too bad the sailing master said with a sigh but we aint like that chap from the bible the good shepherd if we arent mister caldwell you can be damned sure that our chaplain reverend brundish will remind us of it in his next homily lewrie said with a groan how did it go caldwell maundered on he went after the last wee lamb instead of being satisfied with protecting the rest of his flock a parable sir midshipman houghton supplied it was one of lord jesus parables bugger parables lewrie snarled stomping off aft before he fed his urge to strangle someone when it came time to round up the convoy at dawn and chivvy them back into their proper columns after a long and fruitless night of wary patrolling with the hands at quarters and everyone sleepless and reeling they could count up their losses three ships had been plucked from the convoy during the night by what was evidently a full three privateers all of them schooners the masters of a few ships that had escaped close encounters and had manoeuvred clear related breathless tales of being hailed and ordered to fetchto by men who had declared their ships sailed with letters of marque and reprisal issued by france some of those who had demanded surrender sounded french but some sounded as english as plum duff those losses had been galling enough but to add to the misery there were the ones that had been damaged during the convoys panicky stampede to windward the columns had shredded wheeling away from the threat bearing up towards the next column to starboard and order had turned to shambles another six vessels had gone aboard each other tangling bowsprits and jibbooms in anothers shrouds or slamming hulls together and smashing chain platforms which loosed tension on upper masts and bringing them down in rats nests of sails rigging and spars those halfdozen not only had to be found limping along astern of the rest but rendered aid from sounder ships or from the escort ships stores as well a very rum show by jove captain blanding mournfully said to his gathered captains early that next afternoon a rum show i must say and just how the deuce did they ever find us comments no one wanted to touch that one the sound of captain blanding stirring his cup of tea that metal on china tinkling was the loudest thing in modestes greatcabins lewrie stroud and parham sat primly on collapsible chairs round blandings settee where their commander sprawled in untidy and uncharacteristic gloom ehm captain stroud finally broke the silence with a hesitant noise might they have known to be on the lookout for a summer trade sir uhm possible but blanding rejoined with a long sigh possibly the runners sir lewrie felt just bold enough to add they were cruisin the likely course a traded take somewhat close to hatteras and mostlike stumbled into one of our ships that had broken away for savannah or charleston asked a few questions of her master and stood out seaward tfind us from leeward on a night as black as my boots blanding mused most miserably tinkletinkletinkle went his spoon though he had yet to lay it aside and take a sip his cup and saucer rested on his substantial midriff and not one of our ships laid eyes on any of them not even once well sir once theyd taken a prize they doused her lights captain stroud said as they had come in with all their lights out now i thought i caught a glimpse of something standing norwesterly but by then i was caught up close to the convoy too busy searching for a much closer threat and it was only a fleeting glimpse of something darker than the night far off oh i doubt that lewrie sarcastically thought about to snort and scoff out loud stroud would have something to say that would make him look industrious and alert even if the others werent after all the honour and glory weve won since sailing from portsmouth last spring too captain blanding said with another of those long theatrical sighs it is just too bad well sir stroud spoke up again weve taken rather a long jog eastrd since last evening forced to captain parham stuck in grimacing and our convoy will be east of the usual track so if any more privateers are lurking about that will make their hunt for more prizes much harder stroud soldiered on with a quick squint of impatience directed at parham its good odds that we may escort the rest all the way to england with no more loss sir bloody toady lewrie thought he had to have been tbe first officer under that twit fillebrowne in myrmidon that very likely may be true captain blanding said perking up a bit thank you for the thought captain stroud stroud bowed his head in acknowledgement with a taut pleased grin on his face lewrie couldnt abide that there is the problem though sir lewrie countered for our runners bound for new england ports if there are any more privateers on the hunt for prizes our eastrd jog means the ships leaving the protection of the convoy have further tsail on their own to reach the safety of an american port theres that aye william parham was quick to grasp he all but winked at lewrie as he continued might it be necessary sir for the runners wholl be leaving us given the circumstances to provide at least one frigate to see them safe break up the escorting force captain blanding exclaimed in surprise sitting erect and thumping his boots on the deck cover loud as a gun detatch a fourth of our hardpressed squadron no no it is simply not done should more privateers find us where would we be then sir admiraltyd lop off my testi ahem chaplain brundish admonished with a wee cough the task of keeping blanding from blasphemy billingsgate language and scandalous foul words surely had been a chore the last few weeks brundishs warning sounded as if he sleepwalked through his watchfulness you know what i mean sir blanding said instead harumphing and slurping tea to cover his slip no one eared for convoying the navy most of all and there was many an officer charged with the thankless task who had become so frustrated and impatient with the snails pace and the unending herding and droving that they had just flown a bit more sail than their wallowing charges and sprinted clear of them if only for a few precious hours of dash and wind in their faces some few had actually kept on over the horizon leaving their convoys undefended and had been put before a board of courtmartial bedad those dashed americans captain blanding grumbled and slumped back into his settee lewrie you say the one privateer was reported to you she put about and hared off souwest aye sir for savannah charleston or a port in spanish florida dash it blanding decided where with the collusion of the dons or the yankee doodles her prize will be sold where the french privateer may revictual perhaps rearm herself in perfect safety bah damn all conniving neutrals i say captain stroud snarled ahem came a lazy admonishment from brundish pardons from stroud equally perfunctory bless me for i do not understand the sea and the ways of a ship upon it as thoroughly as you gentlemen reverend brundish said with a shake of his head but was there no way to chase after the privateer privateers pirates whichever and reclaim those three vessels they took from us sirs not without abandoning the rest to what could have been even greater loss reverend blanding said for them all best would be some of our cruisers to lurk off every neutral port to stop and search inbound ships parham suggested inspect their papers and seize every ship revealed as an enemy privateer or a british ship theyve made prize impossible unfortunately blanding told him sounding as if he was about to sink back into the bluedevils that would require a fleet twice as large as our present one and would risk war with every nation that takes umbrage theres risk enough of that already sir lewrie added we stop and search every ship we come across that sails independent and press suspected britons from their crews oh that is simply too bad reverend brundish said with a sigh i expect shepherds and drovers the wide world over face this sadness over the loss of their cattle their camels or sheep no dont let him speak o sheep lewrie qualled inside and puts me in mind of one of our lord and saviours bestknown parables damme here it comes lewrie thought i bloody knew it the one about the good shepherd who do i throw something at him will that stop his gob best not captain blanding said making lewrie gawp at him as if blanding could read his thoughts such can only assure me all the more of our failure oh my pardons sir brundish said demurring thankee blanding lewrie gratefully thought by jove and by jingo and bedad but bless ye for it dash ye well lose no more gentlemen captain blanding sternly told them we will keep all our ships together with no detatchments for any reasons and we will see all our charges safely to port in england or else that promised an arduous sleepless and long task and i wont have a speck o fun til its over lewrie thought though he still had his cats and his pennywhistle book iii let us be master of the straits of dover for six hours and we shall be masters of the world napoleon bonaparte baby baby naughty baby hush you squalling thing i say hush your squalling or it may be bonaparte may pass this way baby baby he will hear you as he passes by the house and he limb from limb will tear you just as pussy tears a mouse british nursery rhyme circa chapter sixteen lewrie felt like breaking out his stock of champagne when some of the merchantmen departed the trade for the new england ports of new york boston and philadelphia or the mouth of the st lawrence river to land their goods in british north america and when those vessels resumed passage to great britain he was cheered by the thought that it would be warships of the north american station based in st johns or halifax that would be the ones to herd them the ships remaining were whittled down to a somewhat more manageable numberif the merchant masters kept what little wit they had together for longer than a fourhour watchand the rest of the way was cross the open rolling north atlantic in midsummer which passage wasnt all that bad really for the weather and the seas though boisterous at times cooperated nicely to speed the trade eastwards if hms reliant had been voyaging under admiralty orders the winds and the gulf stream would have let her reel off nine or ten knots per hour and she would have bowled along like a diligence coach logging nigh miles from one noon to the next with their many slow merchant tubs though six or seven knots after a time began to seem a giddy pace then came ireland and the old head of kinsale the harbours of queenstown dublin and belfast and more ships departed for a run into the irish sea most making for liverpool or bristol and lewrie hooted cheery tatas to them namaste in hindoo adieu in frog auf wiedersehen in german and dasveedanya in russian mostly followed by bugger off and die ye bleak bastards the trade reached soundings as they bore up the channel and it was then falmouth plymouth and portsmouth for more of the merchantmen with the number of columns and the numbers of ships incolumn shrinking ever further til they could espy the dover cliffs stand out to sea a bit further to avoid the risks of the goodwin sands then finally sail up to the mouth of the thames and let the trade make its way upriver to the london docks the squadron bore away and made for the nore and sheerness coming at last to weary peaceful anchor your bloody turn better you than me lewrie pretended to call to a frigate that was hauled to shortstays ready to bring up her anchor and was already shaking loose canvas to make sail there was nigh an armada of merchantmen an hundred or better preparing for departure for overseas all ships flying the horizontal yellowandblue flags indicating that it was a trade bound for america may ye have joy of it ye poor bastard lewrie gaily called out the captain of the departing frigate held a hand behind an ear but it was too far for him to hear he waved and smiled as if lewrie had bade him good wishes and lewrie doffed his own hat and plastered on his best shiteeating grin beg pardon sir but the bosun admires to have a boat lowered so he can see to the squaring of the yards lt westcott said at his elbow aye mister westcott lewrie agreed come tthink upon it they all need a good soak tkeep their plankings swelled lower em all and give the purser mister cadbury word that theyre available hell be wishin tfetch fresh meat off from shore for the men when he does give him my boat crew for it and your choice of mid aye sir westcott agreed turning away to direct the raising of a boat from the crossdeck tiers with the main course yard yeovill sir midshipman grainger announced at the top of the larboard gangway ladder permission for him to mount the quarterdeck aye come lewrie bade weve run rather short of staples sir his cook told him i expect the purser will be going ashore and was wondering if i might be allowed to go with him sir coffee tea sugar cocoa beans mustard and such sir along with spices sauces and and bootblacking and stationery ink and sealing wax along with raisins currants jams eggs and you have a list lewrie added i do sir yeovill assured him see pettus before you go then for hes my list as well if you think twenty poundsd cover it lewrie said better yet pettus can go with you too very good sir yeovill beamed and ill be laying on something special tonight for your supper sir uhmm best wait til we see if captain blanding is of a mood ttreat us aboard modeste lewrie cautioned it had been weeks since blanding had admonished him and weeks since the early disasters with the order of the convoy maybe hes over his pet by now lewrie hoped to himself oh aye sir yeovill replied crestfallen that he might be upstaged the jollyboat was in the water by then and mr sprague was going down the manropes into it to assure himself that reliant would present a mathematically exact picture to any scrupulous observer all yards perfectly horizontal and even with each other all stays all of the running rigging taut at the proper tarry angle deuced odd mister caldwell midshipman grainger was saying to the sailing master as he took the air amidships of the quarterdeck its so quiet and still i could swear my head is swimming just you wait til you set foot ashore young sir haw haw mr caldwell assured him theres nothing like better than two month at sea to discumbobulate your equilibrium dont you know lt spendlove and lt merriman were supervising the hoistingoff of the gig now with bosuns mate mr wheeler doing most of the louder barking lewrie looked up at the commissioning pendant at the set of the yards and the neatness of how the sails were furled and harbourgasketed it made his head swim a bit too and forced him to go over to the larboard bulwarks for a reassuring grip ahem sir the purser wishes to mount the midshipman grainger said come mister cadbury lewrie bade i expected you earlier if i could have a boat sir i will deal with the victualling board people ashore cadbury offered my gig sir and my boat crew lewrie allowed see the first officer for his choice of midshipman thank you kindly sir you read my mind i swear cadbury replied most pleased yeovill and pettus tgo with you tsee tmy needs lewrie ordered get the best bullock ye can and warn your clerk that once we have the boats in the water i intend to splice the mainbrace while youre still ashore keep a sharp eye on the boat crew mind even if theres prizemoney due em theres sure tbe at least one of a mind to run aye and i shall sir cadbury promised him doffing his hat and heading briskly towards the starboard gangway housekeepin lewrie thought with a sniff looking over all the great lengths of running rigging that now lay on the sailtending gangways in round flemishes or was hung from the belayingpin rails in equally symmetrical loops the guns and their carriages were bowsed snug against the bulwarks at right angles to the stout timbers and all the tackle associated with them stowed neatly beside them the roundshot in the rope garlands beside each piece the roundshot stowed in wooden racks round each hatchway in their hemispherical dimples were scaled free of rust and freshly blacked as if ready for an admirals inspection what was worn or faded would be put right over the next day or two of labour by all hands reliant would require fresh paint to make her newpenny shiny assuming the dockyards had any or would give them enough to get the job done without a letter from the king himself frayed stays and rigging would have to be rerove or replaced in full what gilt trim round her entryports taffrails and transom nameboard that needed touchingup would have to come from lewries own pockets the boats would have to be inspected and soft or wormed strakes would require fresh bosuns stores and new wood along with even more paint the manropes strung through the outer ends of the boarding battens and deadeyed with fancy turks head knots must be whitened or replaced then would come even more housekeeping to replenish her with rum small beer and wines with livestock and fresh fodder and clean straw for the forecastle manger with tons of bisquit kegs of salted meat freshscrubbed and refilled water casks expended powder and shot had to be replaced from gun wharf and all that would be followed by the pursers wares his new bales of trousers stockings shirts or neckerchiefs short sailors jackets and buckled shoes new blankets and bedding hammocks and small rope tobacco mustard jams sauces for each eightman mess to purchase from their pay and lewrie reckoned it would be at least three days of work before he could even think to allow the ship to hoist the easy pendant and put the ship out of discipline for the crews leisure and if orders came on the fourth day the reliant frigate would be ready to answer them and put to sea instanter her peoples rest and ease bedamned mine own bedamned lewrie told himself at the moment though all he really wished was the freedom to go below roll into his hanging bedcot and be left to sleep in peace til this time tomorrow had reliant been sailing alone or had their squadron been sailing inlineahead at night lewrie could reasonably assume that not too much could go wrong and could snatch as many as four hours at a stretch til the next change of watch but as escort to their convoy well it had been so much like herding sheep that their gambolling and straying hadnt allowed him more than a catnap between summons to the deck they had done all but leap over each other in alarm or crowd up to each other for security then shy away to the far horizons bleating like billyo ready to go ashore sir pettus reported from the entryport youve my list and my latest letters lewrie asked aye sir and your funds pettus replied looking very eager to set foot on solid land and prowl the chandleries and shops of sheerness the bleak naval town wasnt london but off ye go then lewrie said with a cheerful wave lewrie paced over to the starboard bulwarks fighting the urge to reel like a drunken sailor the ship was anchored and still moving not an inch from deadlevel and what slight rising and falling from a harbour scend was negligible what solid land would be like he didnt dare contemplate pettus would be taking ashore letters penned during the last two days onpassage upchannel there was that continuing fuss over the franklinpattern stoves that captain speaks had left aboard thermopylae in left with her purser when laid up inordinary and vanished might lewries solicitor mr matthew mountjoy have news of them or whether speaks would be suing him in a court of common pleas had his late wifes uncle paid him for the house and improvements of his rented farm yet and if he had what was his latest balance at coutts bank and would mountjoy remit him an hundred pounds to replenish his purse there was also his report of the voyage to admiralty as well as notice that reliant was now in a british homeport and what prizemoney shed reaped would be paid out to her crew when there were long sealetters penned a little bit each day during the long passage to be sent off to admiralty to forward to his sons sewallis and hugh a letter to his father sir hugo a warning to the madeira club in london that he might be up to the city for a few days and would be needing lodging they couldnt turn him down sir hugo was one of the founding members and financial backers there were letters to his brothersinlaw governour and burgess chiswick with news of his arrival home for his daughter charlotte who still lodged with governour and his wife millicent in anglesgreen perhaps in a few days he would have replies from some of them with fresh news of doings at home and newspapers pettus lewrie cried leaning out over the bulwark to shout down to the gig which was already a pistolshot off lots of newspapers every one you can lay hands on ill get them for you sir pettus promised with a cheery wave of his own dig in tgither lads his coxn liam desmond ordered his oarsmen a hot stroke pat he urged his longtime mate furfy and well show these sheerness lubbers man o warsman fashion fr good old reliant hey lads beer ale an porter in th offin furfy was heard to grunt stroke and stroke and stroke better not be lewrie thought with a smile or not too much chapter seventeen the bumboats had been circling like buzzards for several days before reliants necessities had been seen to and lewrie had allowed her to be put out of discipline as soon as the easy pendant soared aloft and was twoblocked every hand and marine raised a great cheer and gathered on the gangways to await the arrival of temporary wives and doxies ready mister mainwaring lewrie asked the ships surgeon well theres few signs of early cases of the pox sir so mr mainwaring cautiously replied then shrugged he and his surgeons mates lloyd and durbin would inspect the women as they boarded for a hint of being diseased though unless some girls nose was rotting off and caving in it was good odds theyd miss most of the symptoms of the pox and a week or so later after reliant was back in discipline there would be hands aplenty in need of the dubious mercury cure tis fifteen shillings the man youll earn mister mainwaring lewrie reminded him tongueincheek if some of our people arent poxed already therell surely be a parcel of em for you to treat and profit from by next sunday divisions oh im certain there are hands already poxed sir the surgeon rejoined with a wry grin its just that they dread presenting to me fifteen shillings is dear to them and mercury clysters forced up the urethra are painful even after your talks lewrie asked hed ordered mainwaring to give all hands a lecture on the perils of the pox and its signs and had nudged the purser to think of purchasing sheepgut cundums for the men to buy and use theyd not be as good as the ones from the green lantern in half moon street in londonas protective as the round dozen stowed away in lewries seachestbut perhaps theyd prevent some later sickness mainwaring and cadbury were dubious that the ships people would even be interested in purchasing or employing them just as they had been when lewrie had ordered them to obtain the citronella candles and citronella oils for lamps in place of the navyissue glims for lighting belowdecks in the west indies to counter the nighttime miasmas and tropical damps that were thought to be the cause of yellow jack and malaria at least citronella cut down the swarms of pesky mosquitoes so the crew offwatch could sleep soundly at night and the lamps on the weather decks kept most of them at bay too the ship had suffered very few sicknesses during their year in the fever isles though mr mainwaring put that down to their arrival in early autumn and their departure before the height of fever season it never hurt though for junior officers to humour the eccentricities of a ships captain no matter how daft captain cooks surgeon might have thought lemons limes apples and pickled german sauerkraut daft too but endeavour had had no scurvy on her long voyages of discovery and well have no gross smuggling of spirits either will we mister appleby lewrie turned to enquire of the ships master at arms who along with his ships corporals scammell and keetch were to keep good orderor as much as could be enforcedduring the riotous doings belowdecks count on it sir appleby barked as eager as a bulldog theres only so many places a doxy can hide a pint o rum or gin so perhaps mister mainwaring may find some for you hey mister appleby lewrie japed raising a snigger from them all as they contemplated how large a womans calibre would have to be to accommodate that no more than a dram vial surely sir mr mainwaring countered blushing a bit else else you find the reins tyour carriage and ride out lewrie hooted before turning away for the quarterdeck to leave them to it and take a gentlemanly separation from the debauchery to come the bumboats were butting up against the hull on both beams despite the bosuns warning that only the larboard entryport was open to business that the pimps and dealers in shoddy goods should already know that and they should row round and queue up proper or else it became a scramble among the boats to be first to board for the doxies to be first chosen and tradesmen to be first with their wares causing mild arguments the sounds of which were quickly overcome with sailors cheers and the giggles titters shrieks and crude shouts of the women lewrie took himself a bit further aft towards the taffrails and flag lockers putting on a grim disinterested expression as if all of it was beneath him though he did take more than one peek or two at the whores the younger and prettier especially he was the only officer on deck officers did not stand harbour watches as a matter of course and if his subordinates were not pretending disinterest below in the gunroom they were off ashore to pursue the same sort of pleasures as the hands but more discretely midshipmen grainger and rossyngton their youngest paced the quarterdeck that morning gawping redfaced and gapejawed their wee heads aswim at the sights in prepubescent lust it was distantly possible that one or two of the arriving polls were real wives who had found a way to travel to sheerness once informed of where their husbands ship had put in or the lucky sailor was a sheerness man to begin with and it was possible that some women had come aboard only to sell their meat pies sweet baked goods and fruit but the bulk of them were local whores hoy you on the quarterdeck there a woman loudly bawled from the larboard gangway just after passing the surgeons and the master at armss inspections izzat you capm lewrie bugger me if ye aint capn alan lewrie tth life by christ lewrie whirled about to peer at a blowsy busty bawd with strawblonde hair beneath a prim little blue bonnet her name had been nancy he cried back with a wide grin proteus durin the mutiny in damn my eyes how dye keep girl he made a quick way forward to say his howdydos when the north sea fleet had mutinied in lewries first frigate hms proteus had been fitting out and manning here at the nore and had been caught up in it the committee of the floating republic had taken over a dockside tavern for their shore headquarters then decreed that the bumboat trade could continue and as many women who wished could come board the rebelling warships perhaps theyd wished for the lesswilling sailors to be kept mellow and pliant with the smuggled spirits and sex theyd hired bands and paraded with their bloodred flags through the streets of sheerness hoping to spread frenchstyle jacobin revolution throughout england to overthrow the king and house of lords disenfranchise the aristocracy beggar the landed gentry whatever odd notions that had come into their addled heads but when they ordered that no women would be allowed to return ashore the mutineers had given lewrie and his loyal men new allies when the sailors had run out of money for the doxies socketfees when the authorities had cut off the bumboat trade and had run the parading mutineers from shore when the army had shown up nancy and her sisters had struck a bargain to help lewrie take back his ship and free the women to get back to earning a living they had dealt with those mutineers who had laid aside their weapons and their sloptrousers to be pleasured on the mess deck with what came to hand a long hat pin a dagger a sand or shotfilled cosh and other assorted protections natural to their trade had done for most of the offwatch mutineers with no mercy for people who could not or would not pay them or even share their rum ration with them or feed them a decent portion of their rations that bargain had been struck with guineas from lewries purse and the promise of more from his london bank over an hundred pounds sterling in the account books to prostitutes for services rendered had sent his wife into a snarling huff and his requests to both crown and admiralty to issue letters of official thanks had raised an host of senior eyebrows to boot but hed gotten his ship back grudgingly the doxies had gotten letters from admiralty even if the patriotic efforts had been worded most marvellously vague nancy had put on a few pounds but she was still a fetching mort she took a short clay pipe from her mouth as he got close and flung her arms round him almost lifting him off his feet oh tis been a long time since ye been tsheerness capm she enthused after setting him back down and ant ye a caution i spect yere a senior postcaptain by now thave such a fine big frigate its good tsee youre still alive and prosperin nancy he replied the navy still treatin ye good and hows sally blue la a wars always good tmy sort capm lewrie nancy bragged then turned more sombre as for sally blue well ye know how th trade can be capm lewrie winced at that news recalling the little minx with the large bright blue eyes of such a startling shade and her long mane of glossy ravenblack hair a coltish teen whod worked with an older woman whod claimed to be her mother and had possessed the unfortunate skill of being as fine a pickpocket as any in the british isles threehanded jenny of london included passed away lewrie asked oh la no sir nancy countered sally lifted the purse of a richun shed tumbled with and got took up for theft it was a close thing her hangin for it but the richun pled fr mercy and she got transported for life tnew south wales er mammember her got a letter last year sayin hit werent half as bad as they say bout hit like ye skeered her with tales o seasnakes as long as yer ship and all and shes married a trooper sergeant well good for her lewrie exclaimed delighted that she had not died as most poor whores did even if she cussed like a bosun and couldnt help herself from liftin everything in sight hoy the boat midshipman grainger was calling overside to starboard followed by bosun muster the sideparty thankee fr remembrin me capm nancy said as she turned to go about her business coyly fiddling with her hair and rolling her hips good fr busness ye greetin me so warm she winked good enough for a postcaptain then good enough for a sailor with money hey lewrie whispered winking back uhm sir midshipman grainger intruded i think the arrival is i dont know what to do about him sir how many men to muster and the bosun an officer mister grainger lewrie asked dont know sir grainger said with a helpless shrug lewrie crossed over to the starboard side bosun sprague was peering at him shrugging confusion lewrie leaned out to look down into the eightoared barge that was ghosting up to the mainchains at its sole passenger what the devil is that lewrie gawped under his breath turnout for a postcaptain might suit mister sprague maybe he it wont know the diffrence it wasnt a navy officer nor was it an army man either though the visitor was garbed in a red coat adrip with gilt lace as profusely as a turkish sultan there were some few marines on watch in full kit with pipeclay white belts and accoutrements but they were posted in the bows and on the gangways to prevent desertion they were under arms but not available for a sideparty neither were any officers with drawn swords neither was lewrie ready for punctilio for he had had no need for his sword belt even with a long intricate bosuns call their arrivals welcome would be sketchy hope he likes informal lewrie thought whoever he is he took comfort some anyway in the thought that court bailiffs and attorneys didnt wear such clothing and he wasnt going to be served papers it took an age for the visitor to make his way from the barge to the chain platform then up the boarding battens uttering grumbles all the way and cursing under his breath as his cocked hat with all the egret feathers appeared over the lip of the entryport the calls began sprague had to blow it twice before the fellow managed to get all the way up and stagger inboard with a whoosh of surly breath and a sour grimace of distaste as he peered about owleyed welcome aboard sir lewrie offered i am come to speak with captain alan lewrie the very tall and lean older fellow announced nosehigh and in a very plummy and clenchjawed oxonian accent might he be aboard mister im lewrie sir and you might be lewrie casually rejoined with a mystified grin the visitor seemed to start at that and gave lewrie one of those long headtofoot lookovers then another as if in disbelief it did not help that lewrie was wearing his thirdbest hat suitable only for stormy weather his shirt sleeves and neckstock and sailcloth waistcoat and breeches white cotton stockings and an old pair of buckled shoes whilst the visitor was dressed in silk and satin his coat was red satin with the aforementioned square yard of gilt lace a white silk shirt and waistcoat white satin breeches white silk stockings and shoes as light and insubstantial as a ladys dancing slippers under his oversized cocked hat with all those feathers he sported a formal powdered wig and upon his chest and coat breast he showed the sash and device of the order of the garter to top off his appearance he held a long walkingstick with a large gold top more like a lord mayors ceremonial mace i am sir sir harper strachan baron ludlow and equerry to the court of saint jamess and his majesty king george the third the visitor said as he made a particularly showy leg with a flourish of his hat cross his breast hows he keep the wig on lewrie wondered glue bugger that show us yer tits a sailor cried over the mild din of music and chatter oh was all lewrie could say in response and whipped off his own hat to make a bow in kind welcome aboard reliant milord your servant i have just spoken with captain blanding sir strachan went on once hed plopped his hat back on his wig and straightened back up to arrange with him his presentation at court for his investiture in the order of the bath and his baronetcy the crown would find it convenient did you be available to present yourself at the same time sir oh that lewrie gawped for it had completely flown his ken the last few months or so and he had never really considered a knighthood earned id almost forgotten oh that sir slipped your mind did it sir sir harper bristled his turkeywattle jowls quivering and his drinkveined cheeks reddening you hold a knighthood to be of so little moment sir meanin that it was so long ago that captain blanding and i were informed of the honour and weve been so busy of late convoyin a west indies trade the last two months lewrie managed to babble in quick explanation think of the expression herdin cats sir and thatll give ye the best impression of it back o the mind that he said with a helpless shrug might i offer you some refreshment in my cabins sir and do your quarters reek less than your ship captain lewrie which i must say you keep in a slovenly nigh mutinous manner their haughty caller enquired producing a large paisley silk handkerchief from a side pocket of his coat and pressing it to his nose were out of discipline sir lewrie goggled at him cant allow the people shore liberty or theyd take leg bail and run off so this is their liberty short as itll be as for the smells all ships stink sir milord even though we repaint scrub and scour with vinegar smoke her with tobacco torches he explained heaving another shrug after a time though stink happens hmpf was sir harper strachans comment on that looking about with amazement and outrage to see halfgowned women dancing with tars in the waist the nanny goat half up on a gun carriage to get at one of the bread bags full of bisquit hung underneath the larboard gangway and the assorted livestock in the forecastle manger even the musicians and the lusty songs seemed to irk him it didnt help that lewries cats took that moment to arrive on the quarterdeck chalky the younger and spryer whiteun patted at lewries breeches for attention then sprang aloft and scaled his leg and waistcoat to perch teetering on his right shoulder just as sir harper returned his gaze to lewrie his mouth plopped open this is chalky milord lewrie lamely told him as chalky put his cheek against lewries to nuzzle and playnip came off a french brig in the west indies in nice puss lewrie said as he halfturned his head towards the cat feeling ignored toulon wandered up to paw at lewries leg too mewing most plaintively the crown equerry stiffened in even greater distaste this is not goin well lewrie told himself thats toulon milord evacuated with me when he was a kitten in so hes of an age by now lewrie further explained toulon looked sir harper over and ambled over to see if hed be more amenable to wubbies you were sayin milord something about a convenient date lewrie prompted as toulon began to sniff at sir harpers ankles ah yayss strachan drawled captain blanding has promised to make himself available for the weekly levee next tuesday which will begin at ten of the damme he yelped as toulon laid a tentative paw on his silk stockings get your creature away from me here toulon here lad lewrie bade clucking and snapping his fingers this coming tuesday milord yes this tuesday next strachan snapped shuffling away from toulon gently shoving with a dainty slipper to shoo him off at ten in the morning in full uniform and court dress uniform and court dress sir theres a diffrence lewrie asked he was beginning to enjoy rankling the toplofty shit you will have lodgings in london captain lewrie strachan said a letter with the particulars could await you the madeira club milord at the corner of duke and wigmore streets might i bring someone along with me as a guest hoy capm lewrie these look familiar nancy took that unfortunate moment to open her bodice and shake her impressive poonts in his direction to the cheers of his sailors as they hustled her below not one of your sir harper began aghast cats sir lewrie supplied whores i meant to say such as that that merely an old acquaintance and ally sir lewrie told him wincing and wondering how much worse it could get i dare say strachan sneered with another disdainful sniff theres my father sir majorgeneral sir hugo saint george willoughby retired lewrie said who resides in london at such short notice i rather doubt one of my brothersinlaw and his wife could attend but if he could get away from his regiment in time lewrie would not invite his other brotherinlaw governour chiswick not this side of hell anyway even if he and his wife millicent could bring his daughter charlotte from anglesgreen in a day she was too young to appreciate it he didnt need his disreputable old school chums like clotworthy chutewhod mostlike fleece a naive peer of his years rents or grope up a ladyinwaitingor even peter rushton now viscount draywick who sat in lords and got drunk and diddled regularly and was prone to giggle at the most inappropriate moments both his sons were at sea mores the pity the levee will include a great many who are to be ennobled or knighted and will be bringing guests of their own so it would be best did you limit your own sir hugo saint george willoughby did you say sir strachan looked as stunned as if hed just been poleaxed at the knackers yard so stunned that he did not notice toulon standing up to paw at his silk breeches him stachan goggled damme but my father does get that reception whenever his names mentioned lewrie thought with a wry smirk hes heard of him has he strachan lord ludlow gave lewrie another of his disdainful upanddown looks as if to say that the acorn didnt fall far from the tree and was the crown aware of what a bad bargain they would be making by knighting the son of that rakehell the formal notice and the requirements in our dress shall be waiting at your lodgings at the madeira club when you arrive in london captain lewrie strachan intoned hard to understand though with his handkerchief to his nose and mouth i would advise you come up to the city early enough to consult a tailor for the necessary items thankee for the kind suggestion milord good day to you captain lewrie strachan said performing a graceful and languid leg in conge sweeping off his hat again that was too much temptation to toulon who though of an age still liked to play with strange things and the egret feathers were simply too tempting so he pounced at the perigee of the sweep damn my eyes good day to you milord lewrie said making a leg too so he could hide his grin and stifle his laughter hed quite forgotten chalky still teetering like a wren on a grass stem on his shoulder with a petulant yowl chalky leaped for the deck and found the hat and feathers intriguing too sideparty departing honours lewrie snapped gaah you hellish damned strachan snarled as he put his hat back on his head now minus an egret plume that chalky had tugged loose and scampered away with closely followed by toulon who wanted a bat at it too baron ludlow sir harper strachan glared hotblooded murder at lewrie his shallow chest heaving in anger before turning away for the starboard entryport whilst the bosuns call trilled and trilled he could not quite fathom how to leave though peering over to determine that the boarding battens were much too steep and shallow for a downthehousestairs descent strachan tucked his walkingstick mace of honour or whatever it was under his left armpit at last while bosun sprague went into his third repeat of a call shuffled about to face inboard and groped blindly with one foot for the first batten with his hands gripping the inner face of the bulwarks we could prepare a bosuns chair sir if you garr was strachans comment as he managed to get both feet on the top batten and shifted his right hand to the aftermost mainmast stay oh mind the tar sir we lewrie cautioned gaah strachan reiterated as the fresh tar got daubed on his fingers before he rediscovered the manropes it took him at least a very long minute before his hat was below the lip of the entryport and bosun sprague could take his call from his mouth and catch a deep breath did he make it into his boat mister grainger lewrie asked im afraid to look ehm he did just now sir grainger reported after a peek over the side poor lubber midshipman rossyngton whispered gleefully my grandmother isnt that clumsy well now mister sprague lewrie said turning to the bosun and wasnt that bloody disastrous congratulations on your lungpower by the way thankee captain sprague replied still looking a tad blown i gave him an admirals salute four times over sir the feller didnt get to the boat soon idve trotted out the one to the king lewrie went back to the crossdeck stanchions and hammock nettings at the fore end of the quarterdeck where toulon and chalky were footballing their prize and playpouncing on the feather they looked up at him seemingly very pleased with themselves thats alright catlins i still love you despite that he told them chapter eighteen even with the great improvements in the nations road network the prevalence of huge postcoaches and regular service the growth of the canal system and passenger barges very few subjects of england scotland wales and ireland ever travelled much more than twenty miles from their home towns it took money and leisure time for people to travel so though many wistfully hoped to see london one day the number who did was but a fraction of the population of great britain those who resided in london who ever traipsed west to the parks and the mall and the grandeur of the west end round st jamess palace would represent about the same small fraction for most folk lived and worked ran their shops and such in familiar neighbourhoods where they felt comfortable perhaps even safe and might never stray more than two miles from them whether the neighbourhood was what was coming to be termed respectable rundown and seedy but close to their employments or a mazelike criminal stew the number of people of great britain who ever entered the palace of st james was an even smaller fraction this cool but sunny morning alan lewrie was one of them for the first time in his life and mostlikely the last he reckoned he had come up from sheerness as an idle passenger aboard one of the larger brigrigged packets ashore by gig to board her cross the medway and the nore to the mouth of the thames and upriver to the city he and pettus travelled together for he needed a man to see to his things captain blanding took a larger entourage including his cabin steward and personal servant all depended on the packets cook for their meals which were quite toothsome since fresh food and fresh fish were available as were lashings of drink the winds were contrary as were the tides so they all had to sleep aboard one night lewrie and blanding given cramped dogbox cabins with narrow slatted berths no larger than the accommodations that lewrie had slept in when he was a junior lieutenant the berths were not the sort he was used to either for his did not swing from ropes bound to ringbolts in the overhead deck beams but was nailed to the inner hull plankings not only was the mattress as thin as a devils bargain little more comforting than two quilts doubled over but the lack of swaying motion was irritating and kept him up half the night he had been rocked to sleep like a babe in its crib too many years stillness felt unnatural and he envied pettus and his hammock on the lower deck with the other servants the morning brought a hearty breakfast though with kippers and eggs thick toast and scalding tea and enough hot water in civilian measures for a scrubup and a shave with the luxury of even more tea on deck afterwards lazing in perfect idleness even going so far as to lean on the bulwarks in lubberly fashion as the packet made the bend into greenwich reach and plodded along past the naval hospital observatory and deptford naval dockyards if captain blanding had had trouble sleeping he gave no sign of it bubbling over with boisterous bonhomie tucking away a large breakfast then enthusing over all the new construction at deptford and expressing the hope that once he had been honoured with his knighthood one of the gunned third rates on the stocks would soon be his i thought you were immoderately proud of modeste sir lewrie commented and her turn of speed for a sixtyfour oh i am lewrie blanding responded laughing out loud but one aspires to greater responsibilities a larger command perhaps the charge of a squadron of third rates i spose im too used to frigates and their freedom lewrie confessed as a servant came round with a fresh pot of tea if admiralty thinks me worthy of squadron command id prefer it to be a frigate squadron with me in reliant or another fifth rate thirtyeight well i dare say youre a dashed good frigate captain now sir blanding allowed and youve done very well by me but promotion and greater responsibility comes to us all sooner or later should we live long enough and not come a cropper sometime in ones career reliants your third frigate fourth actually sir lewrie told him though i had savage only a year or so before the trial and my being relieved and got thermopylae as a last minute replacement for her captain when he fell ill ive a year and a half left in reliant before shell need to be put in the graving docks for a refit make the most of it then lewrie for theres mostlike some third rate in your future blanding said with a shrug your family will be joining you at court only my father sir lewrie said hes the only one in the vicinity given the short notice we got yours sir oh theres the wife and my eldest son hes just taken holy orders and is still angling for a good parish im assured he will find a post as a vicar not a rector whys that not a srprise lewrie cynically thought church of england politics and interest was as fierce as any and ones posting could be as profitable as a government office rectors were much like lieutenants when it came to prizemoney in the navy their share of the tithes their salary the size and profitability of the manse and the farm that came with it the glebe would keep a man in comfort but it was the vicar who got the captains larger share of the tithe and a share of the tithes from the rectors under him the blandings were ferociously wellconnected and wellchurched look at reverend brundish for instance captain blandings personal chaplain who must be very well paid to come away from a profitable vicarage with all the huntin shootin dancin fishin and steeplechasin in which he revelled god knows the navy didnt pay chaplains pittance my daughter will be there she and the wife will take advantage of their time in london to expose her to society blanding went on winking and grinning as he added and find her a suitable husband if the markets good brundishll accompany us o course coached up to london two days ago to prepare the ground and see to the missus and my girl blanding added when he saw lewrie raise a brow in question care tdine with us beforehand god that sounds tedious lewrie thought perhaps after sir ive people to see solicitor my bank admiralty and some old school friends lewrie begged off hoping for a long delay before he would have to socialise with the blanding clan and theres the mystery of what sir harper meant by best uniform and court dress one hopes his promised letter sent tmy lodgings will be explanatory and not too costly where will you lodge sir blanding asked the madeira club sir lewrie told him explaining that the place was a bachelors refuge respectable and clean for the middling sort of gentleman wonderful wine cellar and grand victuals but not open to gambling they retire early at the madeira you sir brundishs brother charles is a bishop at hampstead and has graciously offered us the use of his london house blanding told him in bruton street lewrie tried to place bruton street and thought it was south of oxford street safely distant from his lodgings unless blanding was intrigued by the name of his favourite coffee house the admiral benbow at the corner of baker and oxford streets and blundered in and why am i not sprised that brundish is kin to a bishop he asked himself aye after might be best after all lewrie blanding allowed with a sage nod family to see what doings to catch up on in my long absence but once its done id much admire could you and your father join us for a celebration supper after we go to westminster abbey or saint pauls to give thanks to the good lord they let my sort in church lewrie wondered but agreed to his superior officers suggestions whether he cared for them or not thought wed take a cabriolet this morning his father said as lewrie descended the steps at the madeira club to the kerb where a light twohorse carriage awaited with its weatherproofed convertible top folded down above the boot and aint you a picture what like a belle goin to a ball haw haw one more reason i dont much like the old bastard lewrie told himself as a liveried footman opened the kerbside door and let down the metal steps oh stop yer gob lewrie growled get up on the wrong side o the bed this morning did ye sir hugo st george willoughby gravelled as lewrie got in or are the breeches too tight in the crutch lewrie spread a cleanlooking lap blanket on the leather bench seat before sitting down just to be safe at such short notice they are a bit snug lewrie admitted as the footman closed the door and folded up the steps daft too dear and if gods just ill only wear them this once silk breeches mine arse just like a belles ball gown daft too dear and good for only one appearance in a london season sir hugo remarked after landing in the pool of london taking a hack to the madeira club and unpacking lewrie had found the ornate formal letter that sir harper strachan had promised immediately upon reading it he had begun to curse blue blazes he would need a new pair of shoes in that idiotic slipper style new white silk stockings these damned silk breeches and all the help the valet staff of the madeira club could offer alongside pettuss best efforts his best formal uniform coat too long kept in a seachest had to be aired out to rid it of shipstink but nothing could restore the gloss of its gold lace trim that had gone a sickly green at sea a tailor who specialised in military and naval uniforms had to remove the old and sew on new damned near overnight brushing it down pettus had gotten a whole handful of cat fur off it hed had to purchase two new epaulets to adorn his shoulders too a new silk shirt a new black neckstock his best white waistcoat sponged down and pressed the neckstock too that very morning after a wetting a starching and a time for drying before it was pressed with a hot iron the latest thing sir the borrowed valet told him winking and all the crack about town these days all the dandies are trying to emulate some fellow name of brummell when it comes to stocks whose ownre marvels flat and sharpedged stead of ropylooking after a bit ill bind it on last if you dont mind sir hed been in need of a haircut long overdue in point of fact and a close shave that morning by anothers skillful hand instead of shaving himself there had been a vial of west indies scent for his smoothshaven cheeks and a discreet dash or two on his coat which was still redolent of salt tar pea soup farts and mildew at least the scent was made from the leaves of the bay tree and wasnt all that sweet the one item over which he almost balked was the wig look i only need it the once for gods sake lewrie had told the wigmaker after trying several on and discovering to his chagrin that with one of those follies on his head his hat wouldnt fit i havent worn a wig since i look like a macaroni in point of fact before his father had crimped him into the navy that very year sure that grandmother lewrie in devon would turn toes up and leave a fair amount of her fortune to alan and he could pay off his creditors with young lewrie half the world away and all unknowing lewrie had been a macaroni fop right down or up to the wee hat perched atop a toobig wig couldnt i just rent one for a day or two lewrie had pled now whatd my reputation be did i allow that sir the wigmaker had disagreed letting wigs out and them coming back with fleas or lice and the next customer getting infested no sir it must be purchase only youre to be presented at court ill not put shoddy on you sir what would people say of me try this one pray do he had found one that was sleekly swept back on both sides and allowed his hat to sit at almost the proper level though lewries own sideburns and the short fourinch queue that he wore bound with black ribbon at the nape of his neck were visible the wigmaker had suggested that he pin it on with ladies hat pins just to be safe so thats how strachan did it lewrie had marvelled sourly marvelled really so there he sat in an open carriage on display to the world in his new finery with his hundredguinea presentation sword at his hip the one awarded by the east india company for saving the small homewardbound convoy in the south atlantic a few years before when hed still had the proteus frigate his gilt buttons were polished to mirrorlike gleamings those silly shoes blacked and buffed nigh to patent leather shininess and all his clothes so restored or new that he feared the young imps of the london mob would delight in covering him with dung and mud before theyd gone half a mile he stared at the sky dreading rain too it had rained the day hed arrived though the last two had been dry so maybe there would be no puddles to wade through when they alit at the palace if there are will my father fling a cloak on em like walter raleigh did for queen elisabeth he sourly wondered i doubt that well have to be brushed down once were there sir hugo said with a squinty look damn powdered wigs spose the palace flunkies and catchfarts know what theyre about with whisks ever been lewrie asked him as they headed south down baker street turning right onto oxford street and bound for the shortest and most direct main route down park lane along hyde park the once sir hugo allowed picking lint from his coat when i got tapped and named a knight of the garter back when the king was saner than he is now and prinny was a toddler horridstuffy was farmer georges court in those days in publick at least my sort well yell note they havent had me back for a brandy since understandably lewrie japed with a smirk dont imagine your welcome will be a whit better haw haw damme if he aint got it exactly right lewrie thought chapter nineteen when rattling down park lane at a comfortable clip their cabriolet had seemed fashionable enough for the occasion the morning was clear and sunny and those west enders who had risen earlier than the norm were out in their own opentopped carriages or on horseback for a canter through hyde park to their right turning into piccadilly then turning once again into st james street though they found the way to the palace was lined with fourhorseteamed equipages mostly closed and with only their sashwindows down to acknowledge the season all very much grander than their own sir hugo began to work his mouth squint and grumble as they joined the long queue leading to the entrances as if regretting his choice of conveyance might as well have hired a onepony dog cart he groused doesnt matter lewrie told him he could have given a bigger damn if they had had to walk at that point or had they been trundled up in a ragpickers wheel barrow hed intended to get a good nights sleep but some members of the madeira club the younger stillsingle ones had proposed more toasts than usual posed more a glass with you sir individual toasts that had gone on in the common room long after the uncommonly good supper with all its toasting and the port cheese nuts and sweet bisquits major baird their chicken nabob whod come back from india with a middling fortune in loot and was still seeking a suitable mate when not pursuing standup kneetrembler sex with the wenches who haunted the theatres had even discovered a stone crock of american corn whisky and had urged lewrie to imbibe with him to say that lewrie was a tad hung over would be an accurate statement a bit too blurred to feel impatient outclassed by others elegance or anything much at all though there were some young women in the gawking crowd that usually thronged outside the palace on days when levees were held that were quite fetching and since lewrie seemed to be somebody of note he was in a carriage bound for the portico wasnt he an officer wasnt he some of the bolder even cheered and tossed a flower or two they surely wouldnt waste flowers at a closed coach where the toplofty nabobs kept their aloof distance prhaps it aint that bad after all sir hugo said leering across lewrie at a roundfaced teenaged beauty who was all but bouncing on her tiptoes in excitement sir hugo even tipped his cocked hat to her and grinned which grin seemed to put her off and make her frown the sight of a beaknosed old goat liver spots and all ogling her like a vulture would a neglected beef roast would have put any young woman off even if he was dressed in a generals uniform and might be as famous as the duke of cumberland after culloden hmm pretty lewrie commented after a glance how do you keep yer wig from comin off when ye tip yer hat he asked glue sir hugo said with a pleased sigh sniffing the flowers he had gathered from the floor of the coach theres times when losin my hairs a blessing lots o scalp for the paste heh heh it washes off later he added with a shrug the palace staff was very well organised as each coach rolled up one of the passengers and the coachee was handed a numbered ticket made of pasteboard at the foot of the walk sat an easel with much larger numbers stacked up beside it so that when the guests departed their number could be displayed to the throng of coaches waiting in a side yard summoning the proper conveyance the british army should have been so efficient but then army officers bought their commissions and the palace staff were selected and paid for competence your invitations sirs a grandly liveried flunky demanded chequed them off a list and bowed them onwards to the imposing entrance did one ask captain alan lewrie what he recalled of st jamess palace in later years he could only shrug cock his head to one side and respond by saying huge rather huge his hangover might have had something to do with it there were grand marble staircases and sumptuous carpetting huge headtotoe portraits many times lifesize framed in overly ornate gilt there was a positive shitload of gilt lewrie remembered high ceilings replete with angels and cherubs above him thousands of candles burning furniture lining the hallways and gigantic rooms too grand to really sit on and one long hall after another he reckoned that he might have walked half a mile before reaching yet another hall where the levee was held which was already thronged with the rich the titled the elegant and dashing and those who would be honoured and hopefully become titled and elegant and interesting because of it at least in part anyone you know hey sir hugo asked after another liveried and whitewigged servant had taken their hats and presented them with yet another set of claim tickets hmm lewrie responded peering about owleyed damn my eyes are ye foxed sir hugo grumbled did ye take on a load o dutch courage with yer breakfast nought but coffee lashins of it lewrie told him now last night was another matter no i dont think i do know anyone dont even see the blandings yet do you none i know but oner two id care tknow sir hugo said as he raised a brow and put on a grin to a willowy and languid dame in her forties one with dark auburn hair and a comehither grin who was gliding by on the arm of a much older and tubbier man she seemed to look the both of them up and down then smiled and played with her fan against her cheek for a moment flirtatiously im out of touch lewrie confessed does that mean anything the key to paradise sir hugo muttered back shes took with one of us either that or she had an itch needed scratchin yet another liveried fellow came up to them as they neared the tall and wide doors to the hall proper he seemed to know what he was about and was all coolly buinsesslike captain alan lewrie majorgeneral sir hugo saint george willoughby aha he briskly said honouree and guest in a moment you gentlemen will be formally announced right after captain lewrie might you grant us a few minutes to explain the procedure with some of the others oh good tea or coffee will be available and there are sidechambers where any adjustments of your habiliments may be made and lastminute needs may be answered in a necessary once his majesty has made his entrance an equerry shall queue you up in order of honours to be presented ill take another number lewrie asked hoping that coffee would be shoved into his hands instanter in a matter of speaking sir the courtier told him grinning he was an older fellow who had obviously supervised these ceremonies so often that he could have done them in his sleep another queue as couples or parties of three or more waited to be announced and admitted there were old hands at it whod been coming to the palace for ages along with nervous coughing and aheming throat clearers of both sexes husbands squeezed wives hands to reassure them sons and daughters ranging from gawky teens to matronly women with flushed faces all but squirming in unaccustomed finery to get more comfortable some moving their lips over rehearsed phrases of greeting should they get a chance to be spoken to by their sovereign and a pair of teen daughters practicing their deep curtsies tittering at each other each time there were men christ half of em look like bricklayers or greengrocers lewrie thought in wonder they handin out knighthoods for brewin a good beer thats how sam whitbread got his on closer inspection even those who already wore signs of rank ladies in tiaras and elegantly clothed men with sashes and stars were not all that elegant or handsome either at last the haughty majordomo thudded his fivefoot mace on the marble floor and bellowed elegantly majorgeneral sir hugo saint george willoughby and captain alan lewrie that drew no particular note from those already in the hall though lewrie plastered a smile to one and all on his phyz and looked the room over there were thrones at the far end atop a raised dais with a cushioned kneeler before it all adrip with even more gilt red purple cloth with the union flag the ancient royal banner and the flags of englands subordinate lands stood up behind he admittedly gawked if you would come this way sir ah a plummy oxonian voice bade it was sir harper strachan baron ludlow again dressed in an even grander suit of court clothes wielding his macelike cane and scowling for a second as he gave lewrie another of those upanddown appraisals quite a change for the better hah he decided harper sir hugo said from the side nodding in thin greeting hugo strachan replied just as coolly there was evidently no love lost between them subalterns together in the kings own sir hugo explained ah what memories he sarcastically added strachan wriggled his nose and mouth in a petulant manner then languidly extended an arm to steer lewrie to a sidechamber oh there you be lewrie captain blanding said as he spotted him top of the morning to you and to you as well sir lewrie replied bound for the sideboard where a silver coffee pot stood steaming over a candle warmer at last after a sip or two of creamed and sugared coffee he began to feel as if he was back in the land of the aware and gave an ear to strachans introductions and explanations there was a coal baron who would be made knight and baronet a senior doddering don from cambridge whod written something or other impressive who would be knighted an unctuous younger fellow who was to be made a baron from the names and hints he dropped lewrie got the impression that pimping for the prince of wales was going to be amply rewarded in a few minutes there was a fellow retiring from the foreign office who would also be knighted disappointingly there were no other officers from the navy there were none from the army either but they hadnt done all that much but drill drink and dance since the dutch expedition in when summoned once the attendees had had half an hour or so to mingle they were to queue up in descending order the pimp the coal baron captain blanding then lewrie followed by the don and the old foreign office inkspiller when announced by name they were to make their way to a particular rosette in the carpet and perform a graceful lega deep long one strachan insisted there would be time for them to practicethen move forward to the edge of the dais before the thrones and stop head bowed still in proper humility when named to the king til the sovereign approached them with the sword of state at which time they should kneel on the cushion once the rite was done it was allowed that one might express a brief sentence of gratitude before rising bowing again then walk backwards away from the throne counting the large rosettes in the carpet til they reached the third where they had begun and deliver a final leg it is not done to break away and turn your backs on his majesty sir harper cautioned in a stern clench jawed drawl so long as he is present doesnt that make chatting someone up rather awkward captain blanding interrupted one may converse with others turned somewhat towards the presence but one must not face deliberately away sir strachan said in irritation lask to em on a bowandquarter line sir lewrie said with a tongueincheek smirk a third cup of coffee was doing wonders oh good ho blanding said with a happy satisfied snort they could not quite catch what sir harper strachan was saying under his breath or quite make out the sound of grinding teeth palace staff will now assist you with your appearances sir harper gravelled should you feel any adjustments are necessary the necessary aye by jove blanding said peering about for a door which might lead to a jakes he was pointed to a door to one side of the room and eagerly trotted off might i assist you sir a catchfart in palace livery asked lewrie a wee minnikin who barely came up to his shoulder just whisk the bloody hair powder off thankee lewrie told him think i can manage the rest myself he added with a nod at the door behind which blanding was urinating as loudly as a heifer on a flagstone floor and humming a gay air quite so sir the wee fellow happily agreed once back in the hall lewrie got introduced to mrs blanding the reverend blanding and miss blanding the reverend brundish he already knew the son was already as plump as his father and mother and affected an oxonian accent as irritating as strachans the daughter was somewhat prettyshe had not yet inherited her mothers slightly raw and rosy complexion once the allow me to name to yous had been done captain blanding launched into a paean of praise for how lewrie had been so energetic and clever during their service together which forced lewrie to put on his false modesty a sham at which he was uncommonly good by then it appeared that their fusses over his many submit hoists and all the woes of the convoy were quite forgiven such an arduous task miss blanding piped up sounding as she chanted as daunting as any labour of hercules to deal with so many uncooperative merchant captains like herding cats lewrie rejoined with a grin and a wink or much like the early years of king david when he was but a humble shepherd boy the reverend blanding the younger added oh christ here come the bloody sheep again lewrie cringed first to slay goliath then to see his flock to safety aha quite so jeremy quite so chaplain brundish praised the slaying part was a lot more fun lewrie told them the french of course miss blanding said her cheeks colouring a bit at her daring to speak in company no longer reckoned to be a child who should be seen but not heard father wrote us of your bereavement captain lewrie and dare i note the satisfaction that the victory over them i would imagine provided you well a touch of mine own back aye lewrie gruffly answered he was saved by his fathers arrival with a glass of wine in his hands and it was lewries task to make the introductions all over again you must be very proud of your son this day sir hugo captain blanding purred indeed captain blanding indeed i am sir hugo boasted rocking on the balls of his slippered feet amazed too i must own for i never thought he could direct his boyhood boldness into useful work but god help the french hey he ever tell you how he was sent down from harrow and why lord but he was a caution in those days why no i dont believe so sir hugo blanding said cocking his head to one side my lords and ladies gentlemen and gentlewomen the king a functionary bellowed with a thud of his mace way was made to either side of the great hall like the parting of the red sea for moses there was a fanfare an end to the sprightly string music from the court orchestra and a great deal of deep bowing and curtsying heads and gazes were lowered but some onceonly guests like lewrie did peek as did the gossipmongers looking for a sign that king george was still in decent health or fading fast and to be sure members of the privy council and the underministers of the latest pitt administration searched for clues regarding the continuation of the present monarch and their prestigious offices well he looks sane lewrie told himself but theres no real way ttell is there whilst he was still in the west indies one of his fathers letters had noted that king george had opened parliament in february by addressing the body as my lords and peacocks since lewrie had never really seen him in the flesh beforea parade of fasttrotting royal coaches jingling through st jamess square where lewrie had grown up admittedly not the good side of the square much like his familys repute a hat in a window and a glance of a pudgy and serenely bland face for an eyeblinkhe had only the portraits in the gallery of ranelagh gardens to go by and if hed met him in a shop in the strand he wouldnt have known him from adam the king was looking a tad rickety hed always been a hefty fellow as rotund as the late dr samuel johnson as captain blanding and his brood but now the kings scarlettrimmed and goldlaced dark blue suitings looked as loose and free as a flagging jib queens ill again he heard someone whisper wheres she and here comes prinny another muttered his royal highness the prince of wales the majordomo cried down the crowd went again in bows and curtsys as a lesser fanfare sounded be the regent soon you mark my words someone snidely hissed god help us then a woman whispered back and once the king and the prince of wales had passed them and they could stand upright again the same woman remarked the prime ministers in no better condition hes played out well weve lord canning and lord castlereagh her companion pointed out and a pack of ninnies the william pitt government now consists of william and pitt and the scribblers he japed sir hugos letter had expressed concerns that when william pitt had returned to office hed refused to find a position in his ministry for addington whom hed supplanted and refused his own cousin and friend lord grenville pitt had even angered the navy by turning out admiral lord st vincent old jarvy as first lord of the admiralty just as his campaign to root out corruption malfeasance graft and doubledealing in the victualling board and hm dockyards had begun to solve some of the longstanding problems hed replaced him with a man who could have cared less henry viscount melville lord business as usual government was run by an untalented pack of nobodys looks a tad off his feed dont he sir hugo whispered with a raspy sarcasm though prinnys bulkin up nicely good as a prime steer whered ye find the wine lewrie asked for you thats for after his father rejoined no matter do i get squiffy but you youre the trickperformin pony in this rareeshow whyd ye bring up our harrow bombplot lewrie further asked long ago lewrie at a callow sixteen and a clutch of his fellow rakehells at harrow had decided to emulate guy fawkess plot to blow up parliament and had obtained the materials with which to lash back at the school governor by blowing up his carriage house theyd been caught right after of course lewrie with the smouldering slowmatch in his hands and expelled it was a feat to be dined out upon but not a fact to be blurted out to a superior officer who might imagine that lewrie still harboured pyrotechnical urges gawd youre clueless sir hugo said with a snort see how miss blanding was makin cowseyes ye told me they were stayin in london tfind her a suitable match want tbe that poor bugger oh for gods sake they couldnt lewrie objected youre better off than most theyll find sir hugo sniggered and a bloody hero tboot with a knighthood and a bank full o prizemoney well god help em with that project and pity the poor fool saddled with her soon as she pups an heir or two and ends as round as her parents best they know your warts right off captain lewrie sir strachan intruded with an impatient schoolmasters vex to his languid purr might you find the time to join us sir all are in place but for you oh coming lewrie replied following the equerry to the middle of the carpet to join the others he stood by captain blanding took a deep breath to settle himself and did some lastminute tugging at his shirt cuffs and the bottom of his waistcoat to settle them a grand moment blanding whispered to him grinning like puck a proud moment nigh the finest in my life lewrie he was almost overcome with emotion and awe of the occasion well he quibbled there was my wedding day and the arrival of the children but to be so honoured and rearadmiral sure tcome soon after sir lewrie hinted oh well aye but to stand before his majesty our soveriegn to converse with him blanding went on looking as if he would keel over in a faint or whirl like an ottoman dervish and snap his fingers in glee thudthudthud from a ceremonial mace and a richly toned voice was calling for captain stephen blanding of his britannic majestys navy to come forward for a stout fellow blanding did most of that ritual well deep bow atop the third rosette in the carpet from the dais advance stop and bow again it was the kneeling part that gave him a spot of bother a senior courtier stood by king george to hold an unrolled parchment for him to read from captain blanding captain stephen blanding in honour of your stellar career as a commission sea officer in our royal navy and in grateful recognition of your splendid victory over a french squadron at the battle of the chandeleur isles we name thee knight and baronet the king intoned stumbling a bit over the words as if he missed his spectacles down came the sword to tap blanding on each shoulder and it was done there were some words exchanged that hardly anyone ten feet away could catch then captain blanding was up and bowing and backing away for the last bow on the proper rosette and he halfturned to lewrie gaping with joy and with actual tears in his eyes like he just got healed by jesus lewrie thought finding this ceremony and the most ungodlike appearance of the king a bit of a letdown blanding might be reduced to a quaking aspic but for himself lewrie could only chide himself for a cynic and a sham captain alan lewrie of his britannic majestys navy will come forward the courtier intoned third rosette nice carpet lewrie thought looking down at it as he made his formal leg i like the colours then it was headup and stride forward looking over both the king and the prince of wales a bit drifty lewrie thought of the former noting how george iii was turning his head about like a man looking for where he had left his hat bored tdeath was his thought of the prince was he got up too early this mornin or do his nails really need a cleanin the last bow then the kneeling and the lowering of his head but he really was a tad curious to witness what was about to come so he looked up without thinking hoping that king george would be a mite more careful with how he slung that sword about captain alan lew lewrie the king began leaning to peer at the ornate document the courtier held out for him in honour of your stellar career as a commission sea officer in our royal navy christ cant anybody pronounce it right lewrie thought with a wince it aint like hes a foreigner is it grateful recognition of your inestimable part which led to victory over a french squadron at the chandeleur isles the king said in a firm voice though leaning over to squint myopically at the parchment the courtier held then leaned back to conclude his words we do now name thee knight and baronet he said looking out over the hall over lewries head ahem the courtier tried to correct what the bloody lewrie gawped hows that did he just king george looked down at lewrie then at the sword with a bit of puzzlement then tapped lewrie once on each of his epaulets ahem from the courtier a little louder knight and baronet king george iii reiterated in a mutter as if making a mental note to himself knight and baronet he said once more as if that sounded better he returned his placid gaze out to the crowd once more grinning as if quite pleased with himself i ah allow me to express my gratitude sir your majesty mean tsay lewrie managed to croak sharing a glance with that courtier who was shaking his head with his eyebrows up what hey king george asked looking back down at lewrie as if hed never seen him in his life and how the devil had he got there uh that im proud and pleased to be so honoured your majesty lewrie tried again well of course you are young fellow and welldeserving of it too the king rejoined beaming kindly addled as an egg lewrie deemed him but kindly now up you get lewrie rose to his feet his mouth agape as he performed a departing bow though his head was reeling he managed to pace back with measured tread til he reached the thirdfromthedais rosette in the carpet made a last leg with his hand on his breast then halfturned to sidle into the larboard half of the crowd looking for sir hugo and captain blanding when he found them safely deep in the second or third row of onlookers he spread his arms wide and blared his eyes in a cockheaded grimace of what the hell just happened incredulity he was in serious need of a stiff drink something stronger than the wine that his father had discovered lewrie did he say blanding asked looking aghast deed he did sir lewrie replied shaking his head it must have stuck in his head from yours and he did it by rote im sure it was a mistake soon tbe corrected blandings wife was looking huffy as if lewrie had both insulted the sovereign and diminished the grandeur of her husbands investiture chaplain brundish and the newminted reverend blanding frowned as if someonelike lewriehad run stark naked through church whilst miss blanding was making coweyes as if actually impressed pity it wont stick sir hugo drawled looking wryly amused whered ye find the wine lewrie asked him and do they have brandy now the king was conferring honours on the cambridge don this time reading much more closely and sticking to the script a polite round of applause followed the foreign office chap got his knighthoodand no moreand all applauded again the tepid sort of acknowledgement preferred in society too much enthusiasm was deemed crude and common once the last claps died the string music began again and people began to mingle filling up the lane between trays of wine began to circulate and lewrie excused himself from the blandings to beat up to a liveried servant with flutes of champagne threading his way between people in his haste nodding and smiling whenever one of them addressed him as sir alan in congratulations he almost snagged a glass but for the interruption of the senior courtier whod first steered him to the sidechamber a word if i may sir alan may i be the first to address you as such he asked about the ah lewrie asked with a knowing smile exactly so sir if you would be so kind as to come this way he was led to the same sidechamber where sir harper strachan baron ludlow stood grimacing and working his mouth from side to side in agitation as if he wore badlyfitted dentures hah there you are sir strachan snapped stamping his cane on the floor like a school proctor about to thrash an unready student as if the gaffe was lewries fault and doing aye here i am milord lewrie coolly answered wondering if he actually was in some sort of trouble we feared you would get away before being presented with your patent and your decorations sir alan the senior courtier said with an oxonian drawl much like strachans but much more pleasantly as if trying to defuse the situation or defuse strachan if youd be so good as to remove your coat for a moment sir alan lewrie had not noticed before that a long sideboard bore several shallow rectangular boxes one of which the courtier opened your sash sir alan he said producing a wide bright blue strip of satin which he looped over lewries chest from right shoulder to left hip christ this is for real lewrie realised as he put his coat back on and the courtier brought out the silverandcloisonne star which he pinned to the left breast of lewries uniform coat most wear the sash under the coat sir the courtier informed him though there are some who wish their coats to be doubled over and buttoned then wear the sash outside the coat beneath the right epaulet risky for gravy stains was the first thing to pop into alan lewries head oh indeed sir alan the courtier agreed simpering happily grr or what sounded like it from strachan the documents will have to follow along later sir alan the courtier went on they must be amended do you see as will the preliminary work of the college of heralds to reflect your baronetcy amended mean tsay the kings slipll lewrie gaped sir alan strachan interjected highnosed and arch though striving for pleasance his majesty the crown does not make slips as you term them his majesty does not err that word sounded more like grrr without the g and should our sovereign ehm get ahead of himself then it is no error mine arse on a bandbox lewrie blurted stunned mean tsay i really did the king really did make me a baronet too that is the case sir alan the courtier said beaming he did strachan intoned sounding imperious and angered one must assume sir alan that his majesty on the spur of the moment deemed your actions in the battle the only noteworthy that occurred last year entire so praiseworthy that he decided to name you knight and baronet in sign of royal gratitude the courtier conjectured with a hopeful note to his voice and enfin whats done is done and to borrow the phrase from the order of the garter honi soit qui mal y pense what lewrie goggled at him dredging through his poor abilities with french for a long second or two before he twigged to it shame on him who thinks evil of it he understood at last grr again from strachan who was a knight of the garter mine arse on a lewrie croaked im in through the scullery door or the coal scuttle lewrie thought whilst the courtier beamed and nodded and strachan ground his teeth he shook his head in disbelief that the king who should have been better off in bedlam by this point could announce his marriage to his horse like the roman emperor caligula and the sycophants in the royal court would find an excuse for it and aint he the wag though twixt the king the shaky prime minister william pitt and napoleon bonapartes threatened invasion englands in a pretty pickle he sadly thought pretty much up shits creek now i think i really need a drink lewrie told them there was a soft rap at the door and a servant whispered that the rest of the honourees were assembled for their presentations the senior courtier nodded and bade them be sent in with them thankfully came another servant with a silver tray of wine glasses yet another with a magnum of champagne a war with the french notwithstanding so that lewrie could snatch one and press the second servant to top him up while the others were receiving the marks of their new distinctions gentlemen a glass with you all sir harper strachan said at last as the champagne circulated and lewrie got his second congratulations and happy felicitations on this day after the toast they were free to reenter the great hall and circulate with their families and friends captain blanding stuck to lewrie for a bit on their way out sir stephen sir lewrie said with a wink and a nod raising what was left of his champagne in toast sir alan haw blanding responded in kind ehm did they set things right he enquired leaning close and looking concerned in a manner o speakin sir lewrie told him it seems the crown dont make errors else theyd have tadmit that his majesty is soft in the head again so itll stand can you believe it that froze blanding dead in his tracks with a stricken look on his phyz well now sir thats simply ehm it seemed that blanding did feel irked by lewrie being elevated to his own level as if his own investiture had been diminished and robbed him of all the joy of it he recovered wellenough to say well now congratulations to you captain lewrie and mine to you sir lewrie replied you at least more than earned it he confessed ah theres the wife blanding quickly said looking away and you must show her how well you look in sash and star sir lewrie said looking for escape as much as blanding aye i shall see you later sir alan blanding said sir stephen lewrie replied tossing off a brief bow from the waist and wondering if that promised celebration dinner and jaunt to westminster abbey or st pauls cathedral was deadoff once he found his father lewrie could not help giving him a toothy grin and saying i outrank you now do we ever dine out together ill precede you to the table mean tsay yer baronetcyll stand sir hugo gawped then was taken with loud laughter the place and the august company bedamned good christ but he must be deeper in the bedlam bluedevils than anyone thought sir romney embleton probably wont mind but damme will young harry throw a horsekillin fit begad yes he will wont he lewrie smirked savouring how it would go down with that otterchinned fool to have a second baronet in anglesgreen when his father passed on and he inherited the rank i must write sewallis at once and tell him hell be a knight when i am gone lewrie said now wheres some more champagne chapter twenty now how does a baronet conduct himself lewrie asked himself as he made a slow circuit of the hall with a fresh champagne in his hand and an eye out for the nearest refills and for the comely young women present so long as it wasnt the blandings mort sir hugo had strayed away in pursuit of the auburnhaired woman theyd spotted early on he wished him joy of it though he smugly thought that shed not had eyes for that old rogue it must be admitted that now that he was knight and baronet even a backdoor variety he began to enjoy the rare chance to preen it wouldnt last of course within a few days he would be back in dreary sheerness back aboard reliant and in the minutiae of shipboard life and his sash and star stowed away at the bottom of a seachest the hall was not so crowded with people nor was it as candlelit as it might be for an evening event that it had grown oppressively warm and someone must have thrown up the many sashwindows and opened some glassed doubledoors to let in the cool days wind captain sir alan lewrie sir someone called out in a braying voice forcing him to turn and peer about a tall fellow with a full head of long dark blond hair was beaming at him a fellow garbed in a uniform of some cavalry regiment and epaulets of a lieutenantcolonel sir lewrie said smiling back you have the better of me percy stangbourne sir alan the dashing fellow said coming to shake hands vigourously viscount stangbourne but everyone calls me percy congratulations on your knighthood sir alan and gaining a baronetcy thank you kindly my lord lewrie responded an idea nagging at him that hed heard that name before but i bring felicitations from a mutual acquaintance of ours too sir alan stangbourne teased mistress eudoxia durschenko of equestrian fame oh hes the chap father wrote me of lewrie realised wondering if he would be called out for a duel by a jealous lover you are acquainted with her my lord percy lewrie asked as innocently as he could he was rather good at shamming innocent just as he was at portraying false modesty yet thinking honest tgod your honour sir i never laid a finger on yer daughter sister wife mistress and why the devil aint he wearin a powdered wig too mistress eudoxia and i were fortunate enough to make our acquaintance during the last winter interval whilst riding in the park and i have had the further great fortune to have obtained her fathers permission to call upon her sir alan lord stangbourne blathered enthusiastically like a teen in creampot love he did lewrie exclaimed stunned if arslan artimovitch did id have tdeclare ye the luckiest man in all england probably showed him all his daggers pistols and his lions to give him good warnin lewrie thought so i consider myself sir stangbourne boasted seen them lately lewrie asked off on their summer touring lord stangbourne said with an impatient shrug up to the reeky towns of scotland and back he had to swipe at the romantic mop of hair that fell over his forehead we do write twice weekly mistress eudoxia had spoken so admiringly of you sir and of your splendid defence of their ship when they were returning from africa some years back so when i heard your name called i simply had to meet the man who saved my intended express my thanks and take the measure of so bold a fellow ha ha see if im a rival lewrie cynically thought what shes his intended is he daft young lords sport with actresses and circus girls they dont bloody marry em lewrie recalled though how zealously eudoxias father guarded her innocence stangbourne wouldve had to propose just to get close enough to shake her hand or smell her perfume intended why thats marvellous for you my lord lewrie pretended to be delighted percy rather when next you write her please extend my best wishes even to her father youll wish her to leave the circus o course is her father amenable to that too they see the sense of it percy stangbourne said with another shrug that one much iffier as if hed not dared broach the subject yet ah and heres my sister he brightened waving to someone i say lydia come meet the hero of the hour that captain lewrie that eudoxia told us about the one who saved their bacon in the south atlantic several years ago lydia stangbourne looked a tad less than enthused at the mention of her brothers outre intended all but rolling her eyes during the naming to each other lydia stangbourne wore a placid bland and almost boredwiththeworld expression her mouth a bit pouty that was a bit offputting to lewrie though she had an odd sort of attractiveness instead of dropping him a graceful languid curtsy in answer to his how though she extended her hand manfashion do i kiss it like a frenchman shake or just stare at it he wondered compromising quickly by grasping her fingers she found his response slightly amusing one brow went up her dark green eyes sparkled and one corner of her lips curled up in what he took as a smirk sir alan she purred looking him directly in the eyes miss stangbourne your servant maam lewrie replied there was no wedding ring to give him a clue and if she had a lesser title than her brother the viscount he hadnt heard it mentioned honoured to make your acquaintance he added dont be too sure sir alan she responded with a toss of her head and a brief laugh were both hellishunconventional a smirk and a rueful moue followed just lydia will suit as just percy does for my brother at one time the honourable miss lydia would serve but that was a while ago and hellishinformal to boot haw percy happily seconded prinny finds us amusing lydia said inclining her head at the dais and the prince of wales which reminded lewrie that sir hugo had written that percy stangbourne was an intimate of the prince his declared informality and that acquaintance might explain why neither of them was wigged or powdered lydia stangbourne was not a ravishing beauty in the contemporary sense but lewrie found her rather attractive her face was oval with faintly prominent cheekbones tapering to a firm but narrow chin and an averagewidth mouth one with delicate almost vulnerable and kissable full lips when they werent haughtily pursed lewrie thought her a tad elfinlooking though her nose fullon was too wide and large at first glance but when she turned her head towards a servant offering glasses of champagne it then appeared almost irish and wee lydias eyes were dark emerald green the brows above them thick and brown and her hair was darker than her brothers as dark blond as old honey and faintly shot through with lighter gold strands in fashionable soft leather slippers she stood too tall for societys taste three inches shy of lewries five feet nine almost as tall as his late wife and she wasnt what society wished in its womenfolks form either for she was not pale wee round and squeezeable her stylish light green gown clung to a sylphlike willowslim frame her complexion hinted at outdoorsy pursuits and her bare upper arms displayed a hint of muscle her handshake had been more than firm making lewrie think that miss lydia did things more strenuous than pouring tea embroidering or punishing a piano shall we stroll percy suggested and with glasses in hand they started a slow circuit of the grand hall with percy pressing for details of the seafight that had saved the durschenkos where were the chandeleur islands anyway and what had happened there as eager as a toddler to hear a scary ghost story percy must sir alan recite all his battles lydia chid him after a time reverting to her earlier thinlipped coolness you two could save that for another time i am more interested in how captain lewrie gained his somewhat infamous repute what the hells she heard lewrie wondered ready to flinch as a champion of william wilberforce and the abolitionist society lydia went on turning her head to bestow another of those directintheeyes looks with a brow up and her lips curled in sly humour you were put on trial for stealing slaves but acquitted is she twittin me for fun lewrie asked himself a bit irked the tracts and the newspapers called you black alan did they not lydia asked with what looked like a smirk i wasnt fond o thatun lewrie said grimacing nor when they named me saint alan the liberator either i do despise chattel slavery but i must confess that the whole thing began as a lark he told them the bald truth of how he and christopher cashman had duelled the beaumans on jamaica and why and how theyd arranged the theft of his dozen black volunteers including the bizarre appearance of the seals that night as if in blessing and what splendid sailors those rescued blacks had become seals sir alan lydia posed looking dubious as if he was a superstitious fool and lewrie explained why people in the fleet thought him blessed with a lucky cess the selkies whod appeared as seals at a seaburial of a boy midshipman from the west country in and the seals that turned up in warning in the adriatic then those who had swum out to his frigate in a snow storm to guide the thermopylae frigate into the baltic in i know its more coincidence than fact but stranger things than thatve happened at sea he concluded with a disparaging grin you seem to be a man of more parts than one would at first suspect sir alan lydia commented this time with a wider grin not a simple scalyfish stumpin round his quarterdeck yellin luff lewrie said with a laugh we must have you to supper if only to hear a tenth of it all percy stangbourne eagerly proposed indeed we must percy lydia quickly agreed giving lewrie another uncanny direct look this time smiling promisingly and slowly fanning her lashes you will be staying in london for long she sidled an inch or two closer her head slightly over to one side and sounded as if his answer was vitally important to her only a couple of days unfortunately lewrie had to tell her admiralty some other business before i have to return to sheerness they tell me theres a war on and the french are bein a bother dinner today perhaps lord percy proposed im down for dinner with captain blanding and my father he said and damned unhappy he was to say it too do i gather that that sounds as dreadful as supper parties with wilberforce and hannah more and their crowd lydia japed tossing her head back for a good laugh on a very slim graceful neck lewrie noted as much as one admires their good works and their intentions they are such a tedious lot aye ive been bored ttears a time or two myself lewrie happily agreed laughing too before my trial it was almost once a week and its not just slavery theyll do away with foxhuntin and steeplechasin bearbaitinn dogfightin itll be tasty food and beer to be done away with next i expect sling every child into what theyre callin a sunday school and wallop all glee from em spiritous drink music and dancing too do you imagine she said with an intriguingly impish cast to her eyes what about supper this evening sir alan youre free arent you percy i would be delighted lewrie quickly told her we must show you off to london lydia said tapping the star on his chest next to his medals for cape st vincent and camperdown at whites the cocoa tree or boodles almacks too lord percy boyishly hooted make the rounds and ive a yen to try my luck again in the long rooms not too deep this time percy lydia said her face losing all animation with a fretful expression last time i garnered seventy thousand percy boasted now had i been gambling deep it might have been a million by dawn do say you will join us sir alan as our guest for the evening my word i still wish to hear at least some of your past battles even though they may bore poor lydia to tears all that sailing stuff and manly doings pooh percy in captain lewries case i very much doubt if i could be bored lydia rejoined and there was yet another of her odd and encouraging looks and a warm smile of amusement then i shall lewrie swore he gave his address at the madeira club got theirs in grosvenor street hellishfashionable that and a promise that they would coach round and collect him at in the evening a handshake with lord percy a bow to lydia then once more a clasping of hands with her and this time her fingers trailed slowly cross his palm as they let go and her enigmatic smile well well well lewrie thought damned pleased with himself comin up in society am i he had skirted round the fringes of the aristocracy in his childhood when theyd still had the house in st jamess square and at his various public schools then encountered a few more of the peerage in the navy in the main hed never been all that impressed or in awe of lord thinggummy types they were either competent or lacklustre bores either likable dunces or rogues or vicious little tyrants with no time to spare on the lower orders lord percy viscount stangbourne seemed to be a decent sort so far and his sister how does one go about seducin her kind he puzzled or would that be too aspirin for a lackey like me hmmm he pondered further bound tbe bony and not much by way o tits but chapter twentyone gad yes but viscount stangbourne gambles deep and has a most uncanny knack o winnin most of the time sir hugo informed him once they set off in their cabriolet from the palace he can afford to theyre swimmin in tin id advise ye tstick to shovehapenny or bowls for neither of us ever had a head for serious gaming a pound or two at loo perhaps lewrie assured him marvelling at how the cheery sunlight winked off his star thats what ye always promised and how much o yer debts did i end up coverin what then ill toady and cheer him on lewrie replied his sister is rather interesting he added striving for mild interest the infamous lydia a scandalous baggage sir hugo snickered fetchin ill allow but ye didnt read about it she was in all the papers about three years ago what was it about lewrie asked a bit more intrigued her parents settled two thousand pounds a year on her when she came to her majority the brother twice that til he inherited everything when they passed the fortune hunters lined up by the battalion his father began to explain that sum made lewrie grunt in amazement one could have a fine gentlemanly life in some style too on about three hundred a year before the war and the taxes at least she was hellishhard to please but finally wed at last four years ago sir hugo continued the fellow lord tidwell was only a baron below the stangbournes in the peerage but his title was an old one and percys only the third viscount dye see though the grooms people were nigh as well off like any englishman sir hugo delighted in the doings of the quality and was snobbish about the order of precedence in the peerage there was some juicy gossip there for sure divorcement charges and countercharges and testimony of adultery were printed bound and sold as mild pornography didnt take though sir hugo explained it turns out that tidwell was a very nasty item with a taste for more perversion than i ever knew existed sir hugo in point of fact had been one of the founding members of the hellfire club and knew more than most i rather doubt that lewrie shot back with a leer wish me to continue hah sir hugo gravelled leaning back to one side of his seat fellow was flyin false colours it seems so it wasnt more than eight months into their wedded bliss than she up and decamped to the family house in london then to the country and got her brother thire on lawyers well percys in lords and their borough is most like a rotten one so their member in commons filed her a bill of divorcement quick as ye could say knife oh it was just lurid brutality waste of her dowry reducin her to little more than pin money adultery demands for carnal acts no decent woman should put up with sir hugo was not quite drooling but he did massage his hands against each other vigourously soon as hers hit the agenda tidwell filed one against her alienation of affection refusal of proper congress and adultery too sir hugo related cackling in glee and the charges were the titillatin marvel two years runnin shedve had peoples sympathy for her lookin elsewhere for affection seein as how she claimed he was poxed to the eyebrows and a secret sodomite and she feared for her health but for how many other men were alleged dye see so thatd make her what thirty or so lewrie asked about that perhaps a tad older his father said impatient to continue parliament finally saw things her way and granted her the divorcement this cost and she got tkeep all her jewellry and paraphernalia shes still in bad odour in society but still in society whilst tidwells retired to his country estates rantipolin evrything in sight but his horses and huntin dogs and rumoured tbe so poxed he has tcarry a bell twarn people off like a leper prinny back yonder she and percy are in his circle and i heard hedve made a sally at her til the king warned him off and i heard that she snubbed him too so she mustve been talked to by one of the palace catchfarts or has more sense than i imagined of her dye think all the charges were true lewrie asked intrigued and finding that those toosnug silk breeches were even snugger in the crutch of a sudden its good odds she and her attorney gilded the lily but in the main i expect they got tidwell to a tee sir hugo snickered as to tidwells charges they might be true too but he brought it on himself and has no one else tblame why fancy your chances with her what ye find her all that fetchin fetching aye lewrie admitted with a wry smile cocking his head to one side but shed mostlike laugh my sort to scorn did i try he scoffed someone raised so rich and privileged born to the peerage well im a bootblack in comparison and im sure that theres some still chasin after her with an eye out for her fortune so know what they say though the old rakehell rejoined with a nasty cackle ye sup on roast beef and lobster mornin noon and night evry now and then bread cheese and beer is toppin fine ha ha so where are we bound lewrie asked noting that their cabriolet had just passed through charing cross and was bound east for the busy bustling strand saint pauls for a long kneeldown and a homilylong prayer from young reverend blanding it appears westminster abbeys out weve long passed that dont know about that part but youre dinin with em at that splendid chophouse in savoy street you went on and on about and thankee for tellin me of it i on the other hand will coach on home for my townhouse then dine with a lady i met at the levee and a most handsome mort she is too youll beg off for me will you theres a good lad what dont tell me ye made progress with that auburnhaired wench that quickly with her lawfulblanket there lewrie gawped not her a grasswidow whose husbands regiments been posted to the kentish coast in case bonaparte does manage tget his army cross the channel aha sir hugo cried as the carriage neared savoy street coachman draw up here so my son may alight what what the devil lewrie carped you can whistle up another conveyance once youve eat right sir hugo said as the assistant coachee got down to open the kerbside door and lower the folding steps im saddled with the blandings alone while you lewrie fumed your friends not mine his father said with a snicker tapping his walkingstick impatiently to force lewrie to alight i can always count on ye father lewrie said once he was on the pavement heaving a longsuffering resigned and ishouldknowbetterbynow sigh you will always let me down ta ta lad bon appetit lewrie had changed to light wool breeches that fit more comfortably and a sensible pair of shoes with gilt buckles for his evening out lord percy stangbourne had swapped slippers for highly polished cavalry boots dont i look dashin and dangerous hey hed hooted showing off his elegantly tailored uniform in which he did look very dashing indeed and revelled in it lydia stangbourne came gowned in a champagnecoloured ensemble that surprised lewrie with its lack of translucence oh its undersleeves were sheer but it was not as revealing as young ladies and a fair share of older ones preferred these days the top of her gown began almost at the tips of her shoulders and it was delightfully lowcut in the bodicea grand sight that though lydia was not amply endowedbut her gown was rather conservative compared to the rest of the women who dined at boodles she had seemed happy to see him and during the coach ride her face had been animated and nigh girlish once there though that softness had evaporated and lydia had worn almost a purselipped pout a royal we are not impressed expression the stangbournespercy particularlyseemed to be regular customers at boodles for their party had been greeted with the enthusiasm usually associated with the arrival of a champion boxer or jockey liveried flunkies took their hats walkingsticks or cloaks with eagerness to serve and even before they had left the grand foyer for the main rooms flutes of champagne had appeared a dining table had been awaiting their arrival but it had taken nigh ten minutes to reach it for their entry had turned into what felt like a royal procession all the young and flash sorts and a fair number of older ladies and gentlemen had simply had to come and greet them with much beaming bowing hoorawing curtsying and tittering so many sir whosises and dame whatsits lord soandsos and lady thinggummies being introduced to lewrieand so many japes and comments passed between them and percythat he had felt quite overwhelmed and after a bit irked to stand there like a pet poodle and listen to subjects he knew nothing about sail round his floppy fuzzy ears and have them scratched now and again like aint he a handsome hound now tossed at him another thing that had irked him after a while scandalous or not lydia stangbourne still drew admirers and tufthunters by the dozen hed lost count of how many young fellows hed met and shaken hands with all of whom had looked him up and down and had seemed to dismiss his presence as a potential rival they all seemed to be civilians of course elegantly stylishly garbed and once returning to their own tables laughing at him behind his back sneering at him for a jumpedup inarticulate seadog not worthy to be in their select company his ears had begun to burn lydia had sported that bored pouty look as if raised to play arch though she had smiled briefly when greeting admirers and had chuckled over their jests what the bloody hell was i hoping lewrie had thoughttil lydia had shifted her champagne glass to her left hand and had slipped her right arm into his hullo she bein kind hed speculated imagining that she had sensed his unease and was just playing the polite hostess as a duty to ease the outsiders nerves once seated though she had turned lively smiling and laughing and seeming as rapt as her brother as percy dragged tales of derringdo and battle from him an explanation of his theft of those dozen slaves and the fleet actions hed participated in given a chance to preen even to a small audience lewrie had begun to feel more at ease as the supper progressed keeping things light and amusing and are you married sir alan percy had asked even though i hear that many sailors dont til they attain your rank was dame lewrie unable to attend the levee this morning my my late wife caroline was murdered by the french two years ago lewrie had sobered wed gone to paris during the peace of amiens a second honeymoon really good god above why percy had demanded his mouth agape you poor man lydia had exclaimed the shot was meant for me lewrie had told them laying out how hed angered napoleon bonaparte by presenting him captured swords in exchange for the prized hanger bonaparte had taken from him after blowing up his mortar ship at toulon on youve met the ogre lord percy had further cried only twice and neither time was enjoyable lewrie had said having to explain that first encounter long ago and how hed refused parole and had had to surrender his sword to remain with his men and the royalist french with him who surely would have been slaughtered on the spot had it not been for the arrival of a troop of yellowjacket spanish cavalry to whisk them away to safety dont know if it was really me and the dead frogs swords or something else that rowed him but he set agents and troops to hunt us down and kill us we almost got clean away almost into the boat but some french marksman lewrie had tried to conclude but all the memories had come flooding back and he had stopped chinup and his face hard my most sincere apologies for broaching the subject sir but to have been facetoface with the corsican tyrant the emperor of all the french well lord percy had cried much too loudly and had proposed a toast again much too loudly to lewries honour and by the time for dessert port and cheese the same people who had been introduced once had come to their table for another round of greetings their names and faces just as unrememberable as the first time then with supper done lord percy would not take no for an answer til theyd made the rounds at almacks and at the cocoa tree too to show lewrie off and name him to everyone they knew as the hero who had bearded bonaparte twice and lived to tell the tale lewrie began to feel like a prize poodle again for a whole other reason chapter twentytwo lewrie wished he had begun to playact yawns and beg off after almacks but there he was in the cocoa tree one of the fastest gaming clubs in london nodding bowing and smiling a tad forced by then his smiles to yet another parcel of simpering hooraws percy was deadset on entering the long rooms to find a game and lewrie had to follow along do you care for a flutter of the cards tonight sir alan he asked craning his neck to find an empty chair and a game he liked ive really no head for gambling mil percy lewrie said with a grin and shake of his head got my fingers burned and learned my lesson before i went into the navy are you sure youre english sir lydia teased tossing back her head to laugh her arm under his once more why wagering is the national disease got cured of it lewrie told her chuckling i wager the wagers alan makes against the french are deeper than any ive ever made lord percy hooted wager wagers hey well you two can support me whilst i take a risk or two i say theres an opening for vingtetun smashing keep your head percy lydia cautioned her brother youve taken on nigh your daily halfdozen a gentleman who cant manage half a dozen bottles of wine per day is no proper gentleman lydia lord percy scoffed shes of a piece with you alan do the stakes near an hundred pounds lydiall go all squeamish and quaking there mustve been a miser in the family tree long ago and she inherited ha ha let us know whether youre winning or losing large percy she told him with a wry tone scream or groan and well come running to your rescue captain lewrie will surely join me for more champagne by this time o night im about ready for a pot o tea he had to admit to her feeling well and truly foxed now i know youre not english captain lewrie lydia teased again there must be a west country methodist or a scottish calvinist in your family tree well my mothers family is from devonshire lewrie quipped a pot of tea then with devonshire cream lydia decided smiling most fetchingly and with lowered lashes they found a comparatively quiet corner table in the outer public halls and ordered tea with scones and jam which didnt even seem to faze the waiter odder things had been called for at the cocoa tree over several restoring cups which cleared some of the fumes in lewries head lydia led him through his background how his mother had died in childbirth and sir hugo had come back to take him in that willoughby lydia almost gasped the hellfire club willoughby good god sir alan hes almost as scandalous as i she laughed in delight then lowered her head to peer hard at him cocking her head over to one side do you take after your mother now or do you take after him do you share his proclivities even my lessthangood repute might be in jeopardy just a simple sailor me lydia lewrie japed youre aware my divorce and all that she asked intently father told me a bit this afternoon he admitted shrugging sounds as if you got saddled with the devils firstborn son he was and he is lydia told him looking a bit relieved by his answer and im well shot of him you have children and lewrie had to explain how both his sons were in the royal navy and how sewallis had managed to forge and scrounge his way into a midshipmans berth which much amused her his daughter charlotte well shes with my brotherinlaw and his wife in anglesgreen never heard of it halfway twixt guildford and petersfield a little place best really my fathers country place is there but theres no one to care for charlotte even if governour thinks it was all my fault our going to paris and carolines murder and the last i saw of charlotte over a year ago she blamed me too you dont have a seat yourself lydia asked her voice going a touch cool for his lack caroline and i were her uncle phineass tenants we ran up a house built new barns and stables but after her passing i couldnt stand the place all hers dye see and then uncle phineas decided that my other brotherinlaw burgess chiswick and his new wife needed a place of their own and turfed me out so he could sell it to burgesss new inlaws the trencher family lewrie explained now my fathers place is home do i ever get a chance tgo there what with the war and all twice the acres twice the house even if sir hugo opted for a onestorey hindoostyle bungalow rambles all over the place and even has an ancient celtic hillfort tower later a roman watch tower hes partially rebuilt mine when he passes but lydia darling lydia a man interrupted coming to loom over their table pardons sir he added very perfunctorily as if the presence of another man was of no concern and good manners were not necessary how delightful you look this evening my dear the gallant continued the colour of your gown makes you simply ravishing why hullo georgey lydia rejoined turning arch and boredsounding once more extending her hand to be slobbered over alan may i name to you george hare georgey allow me to name to you captain sir alan lewrie baronet lydia said pointedly using lewries christian name and hares diminutive pleased to meet you sir hare replied tossing off a brief bow from the waist before turning his attention back to lydia yer servant sir lewrie gruffly responded striving for the blandest note as if the fellow made no impression though he felt an urge to slap the interloper silly or demand what the devil he was doing by intruding damme does she know everyone in london he fumed lydia my dear have you given consideration to my invitation to lady samples supper party on saturday it will be ever so gay an affair music dancing and ecarte unfortunately i cannot attend georgey lydia said with the weariest drawl drawing back her hand percy and i thought of going to the country for the weekend some time en famille nestce pas well perhaps a brisk canter through the parks before then hare suggested with a hopeful expression we shall see the weather permitting lydia said all but feigning a yawn i can promise nothing ehm well does it not rain ill send a note round the fellow pressed knowing he was being snubbed but determined not to show it and stubbornly determined to arrange a meeting with her yer servant sir your undying humble servant lydia he said bowing himself away such an unctuous beastly boor lydia huffed once he was gone can he not see how heartily i despise him my apologies alan your grand night should not have been interrupted by such a toadying moneyhunting oily pimp she all but spat her face fierce with anger i gather his sort turn up rather a lot lewrie said feigning an amused grimace though he wasnt much amused it had been irksome some more subtle than others lydia told him making shivers of disgust then smiling faintly my misfortune at marriage that is the reason i dread reentering that particular institution lydia said with a headcocked shrug before peering intently into his eyes though try telling that to all the swaggering jackanapes who cant imagine a woman who wont swoon at the sight of them to be single i am thought unnatural a condition only cured by throwing my self and my dowry into some new mans dungeons to be reenslaved then dont lewrie told her with a grin enjoy your life georgey hares one of the worst lydia went on stunned for a second by lewries bald directive his familys decently welloff and hes a thousand per annum so he can play at the law i dont like attorneys much lewrie japed except when in need o one oh let us speak no more of georgey or his slimy ilk lydia said with a huff of exasperation slumping into her chair and looking poutysad i know she perked up instantly turning mischievous and leaning over the table towards him do we wait upon percy it will be dawn before he leaves the long rooms winning or losing he cant be dragged away by a team of bullocks will you trust me sir alan to find some place more amenable to quiet conversation could we really be aboard lewrie devoutly wished to himself amazed by her daring god yes he quickly agreed then let us go she said determined are you comfortable alan lydia asked in a whisper as she lay beside him her head propped up on the pillows and her forearm most comfortable he told her stretching and sighing blissfully halfturned towards her with his right arm under her pillows and damned grateful thankee very much her long dark blond hair was down and her grin was impish and infectious by the light of a single candle on the nightstand her green eyes sparkled like emeralds as she regarded him as if inspecting him for warts she grew sombre for a moment i mean are you comfortable with your estate in life she amended waving her free hand in the air do you aspire to dye mean task if i aim for wealth he countered sitting up a bit never gave it much thought really no really he insisted to her moue of disbelief look ive my fathers house and land when he passes and he came back from india a chickennabob so ill not have tgo beggin in the meantime theres my navy pay and ive been more fortunate than most when it comes to prizemoney theres a goodly sum in the three percents inherited plate jewellery and such and a tidy sum at coutts im not after yer money if thats what youre wonderin aye im comfortable as ye say lydia on my own bottom as the navy says do you fear i am its what i fear from every man she confessed cuddling up onto his chest to drape herself atop him well the proofs in the pudding as they say lewrie said a bit miffed that she would even ask though he still stroked her bare back and shoulders with delight of course thatd require that youd allow me tknow you better you do not think you know me a trifle better than you did this morning alan yesterday morning by this time she lazily teased shifting a slim thigh over him in response to his stroking and id admire to know a lot more lydia lewrie told her as she raised her head to look at him i would admire that too she whispered earnestly intently staring at him for a moment before sliding up to kiss him deep with her breath still musky from the afterglow of their lovemaking he had hoped but hadnt been too sure where they were headed they had tried a lessfashionable tavern and though it was still open for business so late it was too full of halfdrunk young couples who were much too loud her coach had taken them to her family house in grosvenor street after which shed called for coffee cream and sugar from the sleepy few servants still awake and dismissed them for the night they had sat close upon a settee turned towards each other inclining their heads closer and closer as theyd whispered and laughed and then shed drawn him to his feet and had led him on tiptoes in stockinged feet to a spare bedchamber giggling at their daring til locked in and lewries fondest wish had been realised lydia was very slim as slim as tess the irish lass in mother batsons brothel in panton street as girlishslim as his late wife had been when theyd first wed her flesh firm but so silkily soft as if he ran his fingertips through finemilled talcum powder their undressing had been slow and tentative despite lewries urgent and fierce wants after two years of celibacy since his return from paris he didnt wish to frighten her off at the last moment on lydias part she had shown a shyness that lewrie wouldnt have expected in a woman so outspoken or one with an allegedly scandalous past there had been just the one small dim candle to light them under the covers with lewries back turned as shed slipped beneath them and her head partially averted as he did so she hadnt come to his side til the sheet was pulled up to their chins and he had slid a light hand over her taut but tantalisingly soft belly might be just the once so make the most of it hed cautioned himself savouring every moment as if it was the very last they would share that he would have with any woman slowly sliding down her body to worship her graceful neck her ears her breasts and her stomach at last to the tops of her slim thighs her belly and her fine cornsilk blond fluff then even further down hoping against hope lewrie had brought along four of his halfmoon street sheepgut cundums there was an awkward moment to don one and return but by then lydia had been more than eager her bottom lip almost trembling as she drew him down to her with a kitteny mew again despite the brute lust roaring in his head hed begun slow pausing a time or two to contain himself before lydia had begun to urge him on to a canter to a gallop with breathless wee cries of yes oh yes too much wine too late at night lewrie couldnt fathom how but the world had evaporated from his senses the mattress and sheets might as well have been a cloud and the only things that existed were their bodies and their joinings and then lydia had been grasping and raking his back clinging with upraised thighs crying out as guardedly as she could to avoid waking the house staff and lewrie could let go groaning like the timbers of a stormwracked ship and wishing he could roar like a lion in triumph and mindfrying pleasure whats the time lydia asked in a whisper breaking off from kissing his mouth his shoulder and rolling off him a bit to peer at a mantel clock with her hair mussed most prettily and some longer strands dangling over her face uhm a bit after four lewrie told her after a squint of his own should i be going before the house wakes he felt like crossing his fingers to hear her answer for he certainly didnt wish to go not quite yet lydia said swiping her hair back in place and bestowing upon him a sly impish and teasing look as she settled back half atop him and resumed her kissing were the idle class alan we take cocoa and toast at ten and dont stir out til after noon do you know at least percy has his regiment his clubs coffee houses and a seat in lords when he bothers to attend the servants dont stir til half past five or so our butler tells us no sleepwalkers on staff are there lewrie japed all sound sleepers for all i know of them lydia told him chuckling theres still time for us if you wish that is if you find me pleasing oddly that struck lewries ear as a plea to be found pleasing and pretty aye by god i do and theres no other place id rather be right now for a for a bloody knighthood he told her which caused them both to laugh almost loud enough to wake the house for a bit til he drew her down to him and held her close and their lips met in sweet light brushings curled with glee at first make love to me alan lydia whispered urgently but sounding shy as if amazed at her own daring to even ask make love to me lydia lewrie whispered back his own voice grave and earnest peering intently into her eyes and wondering why he had ever thought her less than hellishhandsome with her hair down and her bored and arch expression blown to far horizons she was very lovely to him at least which was all that mattered wasnt it here this moment she even seemed vulnerable not a stiff member of the aristocracy but an ordinary woman with wants and needs and so she did and he did make love one more time before he had to go more hungrily this time more fiercely thrashing and panting to an almost simultaneous bliss then lay entwined and cuddling and kissing and gently stroking til the mantel clock reached where did we leave our shoes lewrie muttered his head well fuddled by then as he peered about the parlour they hadnt been in the bedchamber we left them by the settee lydia whispered back giggling how remiss of us how embarrassing that couldve been lewrie said as he found his and sat to slip them on oh i am loath to let you go though i must lydia declared as he got to his feet again and she came to embrace him dressed only in a silk robe almost as soft as her flesh and warmed by her warmth lewrie slowly ran his hands up and down her slim back down to her narrow hips and wee bottom purring in her ear i must you must else its almost half past five parting is such sweet sorrow lewrie said chuckling that i should say goodnight til it be morrow yes and all that but she insisted laughing again and breaking away to lead him by the hand to the foyer and the front door ill not send you out into lawless london unprotected alan here well hullo lewrie said she had handed him a wee onebarrel pocket pistol to shove into his uniform coat even here in the west end theres footpads aplenty and id not wish any harm to come to you lydia assured him mind now i expect you to return it she teased her eyes alight lets set a time for that lewrie said with a grin supper tonight theres a grand chophouse i know in savoy street hellishfine wine cellar and emigre french chefs tboot eightish and no clubs after as few of your host of admirers as possible sir i would be delighted to accept your kind invitation she said dipping him a graceful curtsy grinning back but you must go at once lydia insisted playshoving him to the door there was just one wee problem with his leaving the door was locked tight and though several bolts could be withdrawn there was no key in sight un emmerdement as the frogsd say lewrie whispered dont think askin yer butlerd do much good would it oh god lydia breathed opening every drawer in the massive oak sideboard table where the mail pagedelivered notes and calling cards ended in a large silver tray heres one too small thats surely for one of the drawers let me look lewrie offered infected by lydias urgency aha far back in the lowest drawer there was a huge housekey strung with a hank of ribbon and a pasteboard tag thisuns big enough for the bank of england he inserted it gave it a turn and let out a happy sigh as the main lock clanked open thank god for efficient housekeepers lewrie thought as the door yawned open to the front stoop and the street with nary a creak the hinges had been welloiled youre off to your madeira club lydia asked as he stepped out to the stoop clutching her robe about her more tightly i will send round a note hmm lewrie asked wondering why a note was necessary if he had set the time when he would coach to collect her my treat a surprise she told him smiling inscrutably here your lodgings neither is suitable are they alan damme but youre a grand girl lydia now shoo scat begone and thank god it isnt raining she urged swinging the door shut yet blowing him a kiss just before it closed completely damme if she aint a grand woman lewrie told himself as he plodded east down grosvenor street looking for a carriage beaming and whistling the bowld soldier boy the tune used when the rum issue was fetched on deck aboard reliant at half past five am it was not quite dawn but milkseller wenches with clothcovered buckets yoked over their shoulders were already stirring to cry their wares to the waking houses horse or ponydrawn twowheeled carts and traps were clopping along their axles squealing filled with fruit or vegetables and young girls yawned as they carried baskets of fresh flowers the tinsmiths and tinkers were out the ragbuyers and sellers halloed their goods knife sharpeners bakery boys with their trays of hot loaves and rolls old women with baskets of eggs venomouslooking unshaven men with fletches of bacon the street vendors of the city were already out in force and all found it amusing to see a navy postcaptain a man with the sash and star of knighthood walking when he could ride and the fellow appeared stubbled mussed and perhaps even a trifle foxeddid he even know which part of london he was in lewrie took great delight in doffing his hat to the vendors offering cheery good mornings he could not recall being happier in years chapter twentythree a hot bath and a close shave a hearty breakfast and six cups of coffee and lewrie still felt like deathsheadonamopstick but there were things to meet and people to do to make the most of his brief time in london there was the college of heralds where grave people who put a lot of stock in such arcane things as coatsofarms hemmed and hawed suggested and queried him over what he would like or what was suitable to his career to paint on a parchment and the ah fees will be so much and might you wish to pay by a noteofhand or a draught upon your bank sir alan no fear the crownll run short o tin lewrie sourly thought they must do a whoppin business handin out honours if they cost the recipients so bloody dear i could buy a thoroughbred for that much with the promise that preliminary sketches in full colour mind would be forthcoming lewrie toddled off for dinner then a visit to his bankers at coutts for more cash and a review of his accounts he was pleasingly amazed that the prizecourt on jamaica had completed their surveys of the four french warships they had taken at the chandeleurscaptured warships always seemed to breeze through quickly since the fleet was in such need of new onesdeciding on a sum of lewries frigates share was a fourth of that and his own twoeighths amounted to nothing to sneeze at for certain he left in savings and transferred to the funds where it would earn a tidy per annum he pocketed the remainder with plans to splurge quite frankly later passing a booksellers bowwindow display he was taken by the sight of not one but two books written by his old steward and cabin servant aspinall he dashed in and flipped through their pages which were uncut so he only saw half just as aspinall had promised one was an illustrated guide to all the useful knots employed aboard a ship and the other a compendium of music and songs popular in the royal navy good god lewrie exclaimed as he read the dedication in the first one about knots to my old captain of hms jester sloop of war and the frigates proteus and savage an officer of unparalleled energy courage and skill whose determined but pleasant nature won the affection and admiration of every manjack capt alan lewrie rn damme thats gildin the lily aint it lewrie muttered a most useful guide that sir the bookseller told him yet one that instructs even the humblest beginner weve done quite well with it as well as the music book in the coming year we plan to bring out yet another on the making of intricate items of twine which the author informs me that sailors will do in their idle hours as gifts for their dear ones on make and mend sundays aye lewrie said unable to resist boasting hes dedicated thisun to me it seems you are that captain lewrie sir my shop is honoured ill have three copies of each lewrie quickly decided ive sons in the fleet he explained you are the publisher or i am sir the bookseller told him so aspinalls in touch with you regularly then you have his home address so i could write and congratulate him lewrie asked the fellow and might i purchase some paper and borrow a pen id like to write a short note first that you could send on at once done sir this very instant at least someone from the old days is doin well lewrie gladly thought as he strolled out with his purchases when aspinall had left his service the lads plans for the future and making a way in civilian life had sounded a tad iffy but so far he seemed to prosper lewrie didnt think that he would have enough time in london to look him up for a natter the best he expected would be a reply sent to his lodgings damme i shouldve bought a set for desmond lewrie realised if hes still in the american navy he was forever forgetting desmond mcgilliveray the bastard son hed quickened with soft rabbit a cherekee slave hed been forced to marry by his muskogee indian hosts during the american revolution on a doomed expedition up the appalachicola river in spanish florida to woo the muskogee and seminolee into war against the rebel frontiers their guide halfmuskogee himself had given the child his own name after the british survivors had left and taken soft rabbit for his own and when they had both died of the smallpox little desmond had been delivered to the mcgilliverays in charleston south carolina and raised as white during the socalled quasiwar twixt america and france the american navy and the royal navy had secretly cooperated and lewrie had been completely stunned to meet the boy hear him speak of his indian mother by name and realise who he was well he dont write me all that often either he mused a stop in at lloyds coffee house for tea and a place to use his penknife to slit the pages so he could read the books later and wonder of wonders there was his old school friend from harrow peter rushton viscount draywick holding forth with a table of gentlemen on the reality of the threat cross the channel and what was the pitt administration doing about it et cetera and et cetera alan my old peter yelped tipping his chair back onto four legs and rising to greet him sir alan knight and baronet can you feature it haw read of it and congratulations indeed comin up in the world like one of those infernal french hotair balloons peter how the devil dye keep lewrie cried pumping his hand mainwell alan mainwell i will allow rushton said with a smug and satisfied smirk in town long are you a day or two more perhaps then back to sheerness i hear theres a war on and the french are bein a bother lewrie replied hell that jape pleased once how are things in lords met someone you should know one of yours percy viscount stangbourne hell of a fellow was peters opinion simply madkeen to have a go at the frogs with that regiment he raised and the grandest sportsman going has bottom at the gaming tables let me tell you got a head on his shoulders too quite unlike half the twits that sit in lords he actually stays awake pays attention and damme if he dont make plain sense when he speaks up quite unlike me lord knows haw haw here lets take a table and have a glass or two hows clotworthy lewrie asked once two glasses of brandy appeared still up to his old tricks prosperin quite nicely peter told him with a wink and a nod over clotworthy chutes chosen profession that of a charming captain sharp who specialised at separating newcome heirs and aspiring chawbacons from some of their money by playing the knowing guide to every pleasure and absolute necessity of life in london sharing a very pretty penny with all the tailors hatmakers renting agents and furniture and art dealers to whom he steered the gullible of late the lads gone honest sort of artworks statuary furnishings and the sort of classical tripe people used to bring back from their grand tours of the continent that stunning news was delivered with another wink and a nod have you the time you should see his new shop bronze greek or roman statues made a thousand years old in one week in a saltwater bath hey i saw him pull that off in venice he has a genuine talent and a damned fine eye for the real article ill give him that lewrie said with a laugh if i dont see him before i leave give him my very best regards oh i shall so if you havent been dined out on your newest baubles rushton said pointing at the star on lewries coat yet i mean tsay we should dine together tonight my treat thatd be grand peter but im promised lewrie had to tell him not with your father rushton said with a shiver with a lady lewrie corrected him hoping to leave it at that oh ho anyone i know or would care to know peter leered she may be known to you lewrie hinted offhandedly well it cant be that rooski wench eudoxia durschenko her circus and alls on tour for the summer rushton said puzzled off somewhere far north and nasty where the locals offer sheep dung for admission haw and i hear percy stangbournes mad for her anyway who else do we both know you could hunt up on short notice hmm my word thats a poser and it aint tess or a parlour guessing game lewrie rejoined with another laugh how is tess by the way still utterly delightful old son peter boasted found her a very good place convenient to parliament it can be days between real business and i must confess ive become rather fond of her i thank you for introducing us and feel forever in your debt for it even if the wife wont spoilin her proper lewrie teased and youre welcome oddest thing she seems pleased and content with the simplest things doesnt pout for gewgaws and all that as your runofthemill courtesan or mistress will simple conservative tastes and comes of bein bogirish poor so long i spose peter said with a shake of his head in wonder should i give her your regards only if you think it best lewrie told him really now who is the lady in question rushton said more animatedly leaning forward on his elbows and leering you leave me most perplexed a gentleman never tells peter lewrie gently chid him the devil they dont rushton hooted with glee if one cant boast then whats the point o chasin quim my lips are sealed lewrie said shaking his head no well if you wont you wont rushton said with a sigh as he leaned back and took a sip of his brandy i spose youll be back at sea in a week anyway with no time for sport so whoever she is take what joy you can before keep the french in line on their side of the channel theres a good fellow crossin the channel aint like puntin down the avon lewrie dismissively said i havent spent all that much time in it but its a nasty piece of work one day out o three and a right bastard on the fourth hellishstrong tides sweep up and down it and a contrary wind can whistle up when youre halfway across its hard to feature just how the frogs intend tmanage it at all youve not been following the papers old son rushton objected shifting impatiently in his chair and leaning forward again where the devil have you been you havent kept up west indies lewrie told him with a grin soon as the war began again last may bonaparte started shifting nigh an hundred thousand troops to the coast and began building an armada of boats mightve launched it all before may theres umpteen thousands of boats of all descriptions barges gunboats sailing craft rowing craft as big as cleopatras that might be able to carry whole batteries of artillery limbers caissons forge waggons and the horses rushton hurried to explain they tell us in parliament that theyre massin em round boulogne dunkirk and calais mostly for the shortest trip cross the dover straits but theyre buildin em in any port or river from brest to amsterdam i tell you old son bonaparte means to try it on sometime this summer were told to expect and if boney does then all our sea fencibles yeoman militias and our pathetically small army wont be able to handle em peter gravely insisted jabbing a forefinger on the table top we can build all the martello towers we wish but the french will just sweep round those and head for london laughing all the way what the hells a martello tower lewrie asked frowning looks like a big tall drum with lots of guns but theyre too far apart from each other to deny the ground between em and the garrisonsre just large enough to defend themselves penned up inside lewrie would have asked rushton what a sea fencible was too but that might have been confessing a tad too much ignorance he supposed someone could inform him sooner or later cant exceed the budget after all rushton sneered tossing back a dollop of brandy the nations survival mustnt reduce the subsidies to our good allies the austrians now when he was still first lord of the admiralty earl saint vincent assured us the navy could handle things told us i do not say the french cannot come my lords what i say is that the french will not come by sea reassurin til that dodderin pitt reclaimed office and turfed him out for lord melville who mostlike dont know what an oar looks like god for all we know alan the french might float over in really big hotair balloons and land soldiers right in whitehall weve heard theyd experimented with the bloody things struth rushton barked in response to lewries stunned look the bloody snaileatin bastards might have two hundred thousand men in arms round boulogne he said on leaning on his elbows again looking wearied and depressed we all just hope that you and the rest of the navy can handle em when they come i like bein a philandering rakehell with lashings o tin and a lovely mistress tspend it on alan a free english gentleman whod prefer tdie in my bed and not get beheaded by a french guillotine all that stands between us right now are our stout wooden walls and salty sods like you that rant had been a tad too depressing for the both of them so lewrie had not stayed at lloyds much longer after that one brandy was drunk he walked back to the madeira club hoping for a long nap to restore his flagging energies but it wasnt lydias promised note that the dayservant who manned the desk and cloak room held out to him it was a letter from the first secretary to admiralty william marsden requiring him to report at his earliest convenience upon the morrow to be briefed upon certain confidential matters pertaining to the threat of possible invasion good christ i guess its serious he muttered chapter twentyfour oh dear lord above lydia stangbourne muttered setting down her tea cup and sighing resignedly the bloody papers the bloody scribblers she was back in the gossip columns again as was captain sir alan lewrie bart though no names could be mentioned anyone in london who followed the news could figure out who was involved last evening a dashing naval person recently made knight and baronet was seen in the company of a lady bestknown to our readers for obtaining a bill of divorcement which was an infamous marvel in our pages two years running perhaps the lady in question may teach the heroic seadog some new parlour tricks or has our jason obtained a fresh sheetanchor for his good ship argo if it had been the times or the gazette the jape might have been printed in latin or greek though both papers were not immune to such smirks in english these days she realised laying the newspaper aside she shook her head and let out another sigh thankful that the damnable observer had only seen them together at supper not later as they entered williss rooms for the night hallo sister and arent you a picture her brother percy commented as he came breezing into the small informal dining room as chipper as ever good morning percy lydia said forcing a smile on her face and folding the paper so that that item would not show cook will be delighted that you came to breakfast on time for a change have a good night did you smashing night percy crowed sweeping his coattails as he sat down there was a pot of coffee for him on the sideboard and a servant poured a cup for him at once good ho bacon and kippers im famished thank you james he said as his plate was delivered after creaming and sugaring to his taste and a first sip he went on yes the cards were with me at almacks not the cocoa tree the change was good for me oh i was down about five thousand for a bit but finally broke even and then a couple of side wagers put me a thousand to the good what did you do with your evening and was it enjoyable most enjoyable lydia said colouring a little at the memory i went to supper with captain lewrie he knew of this perfectly fine chophouse in savoy street and you simply must go there percy they have its like an allnations dram shop in a way emigre french chefs a neapolitan who specialises in fish dishes even a hungarian who prepares the most marvellous medallions of veal or lamb something called a ragout one they call a goulash and there was an appetiser of smoked oysters in a sweet hot sauce that was heavenly with captain lewrie percy said his fork paused halfway to his mouth took his bite chewed then got a sly teasing look damn my eyes lydia has the gallant sir alan caught your interest he is most charming and amusing to me without the unctuous smarm of most of the men i know lydia replied going arch bland and imperious hes a most admirable fellow soon to leave us mores the pity admiraltys ordering him back to sheerness on the morrow a confidential matter was all he could tell me of it he should be at the admiralty this minute being told what it may be lydia strove to make it all sound of no real concern to her concealing the smile that threatened to betray her as she thought of when and where lewrie had told her of his letter from the navy and what they had been doing minutes before he hasnt thawed the coldness of your heart percy japed i do not have a cold heart percy lydia rejoined with a languid drawl but after that beast tidwell ive a wary one had our late parents not settled so much on me and upon you my wariness might not be necessary or my fear that one day you will squander it entire on one bad turn of the cards should you render us both penniless id have to settle for one of those those she produced a real shiver of disgust who mostlike would not have me did i not fetch them a fortune she tossed off with a brittle laugh oh dont start on that lydia not this lovely morning her brother protested both looked to the windows that looked out upon the back garden it was a misty morning of light rain and they both had a laugh over it percy took another bite or two then returned to coffee looking over the rim of his cup i didnt get the impression that our heroic captain lewrie was all that welltodo perhaps hes just one more of your avaricious suitors wary wary wary pet weve known him for not quite two whole days percy lydia scoffed with another light laugh busying herself with her tea ive seen no sign he intends to woo me and besides wooings rather hard to do when ones a thousand miles out to sea or halfway round the world well theres that though you could do a lot worse percy tossed off intent on a nicely smoked kipper and his scrambled eggs he said something over supper last night lydia continued with her own attention on her own breakfast that may aid you getting your regiment posted to the coast that was a lie she had brooked the subject to lewrie oh really her brother said perking up if horse guards seems loath to accept might it not help to go down to the coast and meet the general in charge or ask for an audience with the lordlieutenant for kent lydia laid out were they aware of a regiment of yeoman cavalry so well horsed equipped and trained and readily available might not a request from them to horse guards turn the trick for you and a regiment so hellishexpensive even for people with their wealth and incomes as much as lydia approved of percys new hobby for it got him out in the country and away from the gaming tables the few times her brother had let her see the accounting ledgers with his typical male tuttuts about why a woman would wish to or was able to understand them shed been simply appalled at the costs if they did not go smash due to percys gambling then his toy soldiers would drag them down to poverty she was thirtyone whilst percy was twentyseven there had been a brother born between them but hed not lived a year and after percy their mother had not produced another she felt oldersisterprotective of him but frightened too by how boyishly hed fling himself into things kicking his heels in london he could gamble every night of the week but sunday with his regiment called up and out in the field living rough soldiering would put a stop to all that for the duration of the emergency lydia hoped she reckoned that he could just as well have gone shopping and purchased whole brigades made of lead foot horse and artillery and been just as content arranging them on the long formal dining table the pity of it was that so many people who mattered the prince of wales included who already had regiments named as his own had told percy what a dashing and patriotic thing he was doing that it was far too late for him to turn the endeavour over to someone else to let them bear the expense his pride his repute in society would suffer and that was just as unimaginable as percy swearing off gambling thats a shrewd thought by jove percy exclaimed your sir alan lewries a sly one no error to have thought of it an admirable idea hey get it an admiralable idea from a navy officer well percy found it amusing he is not my sir alan percy she pointed out though it may be good to strike while the iron is hot he will have to coach to sheerness tomorrow we could go with him offer our own coach then stay to tend to your business she tossed that off between sips from her cup as if it was spurofthemoment tomorrow percy frowned with lewrie quite early id imagine lydia mused gybing him for his slugabed ways despite the vigour of her night she had been back in her own bed by am and had risen remarkably refreshed and enlivened at almost singing she would own crack o dawn all that percy queried furrowing his brow and pulling a face no no it couldnt be done tomorrow thered be need of letters written first the ledgers to gather next week maybe well if you will not percy lydia said feeding a strip of bacon to their springer spaniel whod been begging and whining then i will take the coach and offer conveyance to captain lewrie myself youd what her brother exclaimed appalled alone all the way to sheerness then back without a man to protect you i am almost your equal at shooting percy she breezed off as if it was no bother father taught us early and well do you recall our coachees are good shots too they should be since youve recruited them into your regiment she pointed out with a smirk and one of her eyebrows up if percy could not be cozened into it then she would be brazen she gave him a very level and determined look to the further ruin of your reputation and it might not be he said scowling percy good lord she said do i ruin my reputation even more that may be a good thing the parents of my damned admirers at last could put their feet down id no longer feel hunted like a stag through the woods and be spared all the grasping bother she blurted laughing in his face she busied herself with a bite of buttered toast chewing while percy got his wind back what decent family would have the likes of me anyway percy she went on with a selfdeprecating chuckle were it not for my dot theyd mostlike tell their young men to find someone a lot more attractive more she would have added a scathing assuming your gambling leaves me anything but thought it was the wrong time to nag oh lydia i dont know where you ever got the idea youre not attractive why youre as fetching as most percy tried to assure her though it was backhanded and clumsy and it irked lydia could have told him where shed gotten the idea their father had loved her dearly though hed naturally hoped for a boy and heir despite having a girlchild as his firstborn he had delighted in amusing her talking to her and calling her my little funny face or you little monkey face with the tickles and treats and affections that made her squeal with joy it had been as dear to her as if he had said my little princess til other children began to taunt her as miss monkey face most cruelly and shed seen the why in her mirrors her father had not been handsome perhaps that was why he had married so late in life hed been all craggyfaced with prominent cheek bones and bushy brows and a cornish beak of a nose and as tall and rangy as a clydesdale her mother though no matter his looks he was immensely wealthy in lands rents and investments and titled a proper peer whilst her family had been nigh as welloff but commoners like had called to like when it had come to land and wealth and shed brought almost an equal portion along with her great beauty of the sort that society had applauded and worshipped lydia i swear youre as thin as a rope dear child you eat like a sparrow do you wish to be called a gawk no man will have you then shed said once with a brittle laugh and the once that lydia had overheard them discussing her her mother fretting that she is such a plain child pray god she blossoms late as some do before being presented at court and to society for her first london season else we must consider settling a large sum upon her to tempt the right sort of young gentleman and lydia had been heartbroken her debut at eighteen had been a miserable affair though her parents had deemed her pretty by then and her looks had rounded and softened to the point that she could now and then think herself adequate even what little hope shed had of success had been disappointed young girls of her status in the peerage young girls from the squirearchy or the newlyrisen middling class all properly schooled in music manners dancing and womanly attainments paraded at the many events it had been the prettiest who had found success and young mens approval her dowry had been a goodly sum to go under some young gentlemans coverture yet it had been the pretty the ravishing the cute whod shone at all the drums routs supper parties the operas symphonies and subscription balls whilst her own luck had been lacklustre lydia had refused to try again at nineteen or twenty preferring their country estate and her horsewomanship at twentyone shed been dragged back to london this time with and the change had been remarkable and to her sickening that season it had been the young beauties who had been ignored whilst lydia had been inundated in invitations and flatteries disgusted with the grasping hypocrisy shed treated the young beaus quite badly but no matter how arch and insulting how flippant or scornful shed treated them the greediest would abide her declaring her bold outspoken and intriguingly modern lydia shook herself back to paying attention squirming again at those memories percy was still blathering on about something then break the journey at shooters hill take a basket of goodies and dine al fresco atop it hey he suggested quite wistfully i swear the sweetest cleanest air ever did i breathe was at the top of shooters hill or is that on the north bank near tilbury and the forts youve your geography wrong percy lydia corrected him its a bit past greenwich on the south bank of the thames on the road to chatham and sheerness why if youre not going til next week well if youre so deadset i am she coolly replied sugaring and creaming fresh tea first light tomorrow he grimaced god id have to retire at sunset to get out of bed that early i am told that diligent soldiers are sometimes required to do so lydia teased cant let you gad off so boldly whatd people say of you or me for allowing it percy said shrugging surrender should anything befall you highwaymen or worse well percy do you mean you intend to accompany captain lewrie and myself she asked relieved that he would weaken so quickly i spose i could yes her brother said half his attention taken by the spaniel who found him an easy mark as well we will both go perhaps he can tell me more of his sea stories on the way to sheerness begad do you think they have a decent lodging house you are the best brother in the world percy lydia said as she rose to go to his end of the table and give him a hug and tousle his long hair well he had his good points she thought as she returned to her seat secretly thrilled with percy making three there could not be any more intimacy though she wished she could scheme a way those few hours over two nights were more pleasurable pleasing and passionate than any she had known in her little experience she could however spend a few more days with lewrie to learn more about him and his life at sea of which she knew next to nothing perhaps even be invited to go aboard his ship and see him in his proper milieu and stave off the loss of his presence just a bit longer lydia determined to write to lewries lodgings informing him of their offer of a more comfortable coach than any he could hire of which he knew nothing yet then caution him to take credit for the idea to help percy find employment for his regiment it was just as unseemly to be a clever woman as it was to be a single one chapter twentyfive lewrie had been delighted by the stangbournes offer though it made for cramped quarters in their coach there was percys valet and lydias maid and pettus to do for lewrie plus two coachmen and a footman little more than a lad whose sole duty seemed to be tending to the folding steps and the coach doors and general fetching and toting it would not do for the maid to ride outside so one manservant ended up on the coach roof like the cheap seats aboard a huge diligence coach and the luckier two crammed into the outside rear bench above the boot which bore more luggage than lewries whole family would need did they dash up to london for their spring shopping and spend a week at it the sky was clear for their piquenique atop shooters hill and it had been pleasantly warm when percy was off tramping up to take a gander of the semaphore tower and its method of working lydia had given lewrie a snippet of newspaper in case you havent seen this shed whispered looking away shyly i hadnt thought i would draw unwelcome comment upon you if you find it embarrassing then i am sorry i mine arse on a bandbox lewrie had guffawed though to her great relief with any luck people will think it was captain blanding and his wife will give him hell you are not lydia had gasped with a wide grin not a bit of it lewrie had assured her what blanding and his brood and his chaplain think of me doesnt matter a toss and if wilberforce and his lot take me off the champion list then ill be spared a parcel of dreadfulboresome suppers his reaction had pleased lydia greatly and theyd sat on the quilt close together hands closer fingers twining and both wishing they could embrace and kiss her smiles had been lovely and promising sometimes wistful sometimes impishly bold as theyd prated mostly of nothing wishing that the hovering servants and the enthusiastic percy could vanish like willofthewisps theyd found lodgings suitable to their needs at the very same hotel that lewrie had used long ago when fitting out hms proteus for the west indies close to the merchant docks and a view of the little nore in the same hotel where theoni kavares connor had stayed for nigh a week unfortunately and did they dine there together alan sincerely hoped none of the staff would recall him from that time and ask of his former mistress the mother of one of his bastard children and how she kept then he hired a boat to bear him out to reliant it had been gratifying to be piped aboard not to the usual bareheaded stances of attention from all hands on deck at the moment of arrival but by the loud cheers and whistles of reliants people as soon as they had seen the sash and star they had been victorious they had won it all for him to wear and a proud reflection upon them and their frigate as he had told them that instant before going aft and below his cats had been delighted to see him after the short absence and his cook yeovill had been equally delighted when he had been informed that he would be preparing at least one sumptuous dinner for a viscount and his sister the greatcabins though scrub and scour pettus lewrie had ordered sniffing at the corners the cats box especially fresh sand for the morrow and the quartergallery baking soda sir yeovill had suggested a box of it in the sand sir cancels odours it will ive lots of it sir weve still some citronella candles and lamp oil too sir pettus had reminded him that smells fresh and sweet it does pass word for desmond and furfy thelp with the cleaning and all pettus well start straightaway lewrie had ordered looking over his modest furnishings and wishing that he could replace or refurbish half of it overnight or should he hed reconsidered this was how he lived andodours asidethis would be what he would show the stangbournes he could always explain that the royal navy had a dim view of captains who lived too comfortably barebones spartan was preferred he had dined ashore with the stangbournes of course leaving yeovill even more time to prepare his feast but had been back aboard just at four bells of the evening watch to make arrangements for their reception aboard the next day at noon fresh sand and snowwhite manropes for the entryport and boarding battens a bosuns chair to be prepared for lydia of a certainty and for percy too if he proved to be clumsy or had a slip it would never do to drown a peer lastly he had the largest ships boat the cutter readied for the next morning lt westcott had suggested it rather than his shorter gig and had had the cutter scrubbed out and some of its paint touched up earlier it had not rained though there was a vast awning slung above the quarterdeck lest it did lord percy had managed to scramble up the battens lydia had been delighted to be hoisted high over the bulwarks and deposited on the starboard sailtending gangway alighting with an unladylike whoop of glee the tour of the ship had gone well even if belowdecks had still borne a faint reek of too many people crammed in too close and the smells of saltmeat casks drifting up from the orlop theyd emerged up forward by the foredeck hatch and steep ladderway right by the sickbay and forecastle manger then had strolled aft past the bowsedup guns to the base of the mainmast and into his greatcabins for a drink before dinner somehow i do not picture you sir alan a fellow of such bellicose nature having cats as pets lydia had teased him forced by the circumstances and the presence of other dinner guests to fall back upon her initial formality at that moment shed had the impetuous chalky in her lap arching and trilling to her lacegloved stroking and with toulon standing by her right paws working on the settee cushions and about to jump and join them captains live aft alone miss lydia lewrie had told her a prisoner to formality too in his speech at least though his manner was unchanged might dine a couple of people in each night but for the most part well theyre good amusing company even does chalky like to nip lt westcott pointed out with a laugh learned that to my harm my last captain preferred chickens maam midshipman rossyngton piped up turned out in his best lewrie had had to invite all his commission officers of course but only had chairs or places for two more guests and had chosen the two youngest mids even though mister entwhistle was an honourable and the youngest son of another peer hunting dogs maam midshipman munsell had added shyly he was big on hunting and fetched off half a dozen of his favourites it was bedlam and messy im bound hey mister munsell lewrie had japed when one of them ah on the deck chequer or his carpets he would call his servant smithey dog uh stuff munsell had blurted catching himself a second too late but all had been amused ye dont get that sort o mess with cats lewrie had said or the barking in the wee hours im bound lydia had posed to munsell drawing a shy nod of redfaced agreement pleasing the lad right down to his toes yeovill had outdone himself there had been a soup hed called a spanish treat served cool to suit the weather loaded with peas and maize kernels rice and pureed tomatoes in a spicy beef broth yeovill was very high on rice next had come quail old to lewrie by then but new to the stangbournes with fresh asparagus sprigs drizzled in hollandaise sauce and cheesy hashed potatoes the fish course had been a medley of mussels and peeled shrimp with buttery wee brussels sprouts all served with pipinghot rolls and a cool and light sauvignon blanc thered been a midmeal salad of wilted lettuce drippy bacon and vinaigrette last had come a small chuck roast with boiled carrots and roasted potato halves boiled onions and bottles of bordeaux and to top it all off yeovill had whipped up another of his lemon custards your cooks a bloody wonder sir alan percy had exclaimed towards the end ive half a mind to hire him away from you do you dine this well at sea hed marvelled shaking his head dont force me to outbid you for his services milord and no not after the first week when the fresh victuals run out or go bad lewrie had hooted back i fear even good mister yeovill has to use his creativity and imagination after a while even i will be reduced to saltmeats and our famous weevilly ships bisquit by pm hed seen them back ashore for a needful nap and had returned aboard to tend to ships business and a nap of his own the stangbournes would return the favour at their lodgings supper ashore was at half past seven but lewrie turned up just at seven this time in his secondbest uniform coat without the sash and star of his new knighthood or his medals either would you care for a stroll before supper lydia he asked the sunsets rather nice this evening and from my more pleasant doings with the french ive discovered that they place great faith in a stroll before eating to sharpen the appetite why thank you captain lewrie and i should be delighted she responded percy we will only be a quarterhour half an hour at the most shed told her brother who had halfrisen from his chair before twigging to what she meant that the invitation was for two not three hed sunk back with a sly grin outside their inn the shadows were lengthening the sunset so grand that though their view to the west was blocked it extended out eastwards to reflect on the hulls of the many warships in harbour on the sails hung slack aloft to air them and prevent mildew and rot and shimmer reddishgolden off the little and the great nore anchorage that was that evening at least at slack water and seemingly still alive with only millpond ripples and stirred by light airs merchant ships lay along the quays by which they strolled her arm tucked inside his and their hands linked jibbooms and bowsprits jutted high overhead from some which lay bowson alongside piers built at right angles from the quays masts and spars and furled canvas soaring aloft even higher amid their mazes of shrouds and running rigging silhouetted against the greying dusk lading was done for the day so the bustle of waggons and carts and the rumble of wheels no longer forced people to shout to converse the last sea birds were winging overhead or perched on bollards some peeping or gulls mewing a few ships had their taffrail lanthorns and work lanthorns lit while out in the roads lights could be made out aboard the anchored ships and it was all rather peaceful faint laughter some song and strains of musical instruments could be heard coming from the sailors taverns along the dockside street what an odd world you live in alan lydia said at last the ships and all these mysterious whatevers you pointed out to us sheets and braces jears and i dont know whatall you called them i expect it would take a lifetime to learn it all i think i had one week tlearn them else i was bent over the barrel of a gun and thrashed on my bottom with a stiffened rope starter lewrie cheerfully confessed its called kissing the gunners daughter and i kissed her quite often til i got em all right do ye know the first time they threatened that i thought the girl must be a really dirty puzzle if they meant it as punishment with just the two of them at last lydia could lean back her head and laugh out loud then place her right hand on his upper right arm and lean closer to him as they walked slowly along as if trying to snuggle they shared fond smiles which lewrie found himself wishing could go on far longer youve changed coats she noted this is not as fine and once we sail my everyday coat is even sorrier he said the good one then thisun will go deep in a seachest along with the star and sash no call for em at sea unless some admiral dines me aboard his flagship along with what passed in london she rather meekly pressed that drew him to a stop so he could turn and face her london was a welcome idyll and a memorable one i dont recall all of it such as the palace and all but but i most certainly will remember the best part your part dare i say our part god how i wish to kiss you she whispered then lets do lewrie urged putting his arms round her do i look like a sailors doxy do you call them this way lydia said with a happy throaty chuckle after she threw her arms round him and shared a long deep kiss with him its a seaport and i dont give a damn if you dont lewrie laughed never a doxy not you lydia a captains lady is what people will think and a damned handsome lady at that even one so scandalous she teased after kissing him again oh bugger that he shrugged off whats scandalous about riddin yourself of a beast id hope well hope what alan she purred looking up at him a bit her eyes alight that whats begun would continue hard as that may be with me at sea he confessed feeling a physical surge of warmth filling his chest with reliant to operate in the channel at least for the rest of the year it wont be months between letters if you mean tsay if i could have your permission twrite and of course i wish you to write me as often as possible she declared just as i swear that i will respond to each and write to you even should yours be delayed or you are too busy really alan after what has passed between us its hardly possible to misconstrue me as a spinstergirl whose parents permission you must ask now does it she hugged him closer laughing again though i appreciate the thought mind she wryly added her smile japing but fond often as possible lewrie promised as they resumed strolling along crossing the cobbled street to the wide wooden beams of the seaside quays tar and salt the seashore smell lydia mused when we went to brighton for the summer ocean bathing i always delighted in its freshness quite unlike what a ship smells like he japed back that reek that greeted you in spite of all we could do the manger our mildew our wet woolens our peasoup farts and sweat i thought you might heed a scented handkerchief for a minute or so the way your nose wrinkled well i must own to slight notice she confessed chuckling again concentrating on the toes of her shoes for a moment but i do crinkle my poor nose when amused or gawping in awe of all that you showed us she said looking back up at him again rather a nice nose lewrie fondly told her oh tosh now youre being kind she demurred no im not lewrie baldly stated three watchbells chimed from the nearest merchantman lying alongside the quays quickly followed by the chimes of dozens more as halfhour glasses ran out a bit later lydia looked to him part in puzzlement part in appreciation such a lovely sound though a lonely one she commented her head cocked over to listen to the last distant dings three bells half past seven lewrie told her i spose we should be headin back before percy gets worried and comes lookin for us our supper will be late bein laid i do not mind our being late lydia said hugging him again nor do i much mind percy fretting the last few years hes become quite good at fretting over me mores the pity yes we must return to the inn but slowly please aye milady lewrie agreed aye lydia echoed as if savouring the strangeness of the word then theres a good pirates aarrrh lewrie added i use it now and then for fun aarrhh she cried trying it on and finding it thrilling i rather like the sound of those bells they chimed all through our visit aboard your ship whatever do they mean though well a ships day begins at eight bells of the forenoon watch at noon lewrie explained as they strolled arminarm half snuggled down the nowdark street and each halfhour a ships boy turns the sandglass and strikes one bell for each halfhour that passes til he reaches eight four hours later we name each fourhour watch so much to learn of your world lydia said almost gasping you must tell me as much as you can and direct me to books where i can discover more its much like learnin russian or greek i warn you lewrie cautioned her sailors cant is contrary and sounds like nonsense to a lubber like you a lover she chuckled lubber not even a scaly fish yet lewrie told her and when you return might you quiz me on what i have learned might you bend me over a gun and make me kiss the gunners daughter with a what did you call it she enthused skipping ahead of him a step or two their hands together a twinewrapped length of rope about this long he said freeing his hands long enough to indicate a length of eighteen inches a stiffened rope starter a bosunll use on the slowcoaches mercy sir that long is it perhaps do ye have tbe bent over a gun i could discover something else thatd serve he said with a leer a bit startled by her boldness but liking it very very much yayss i surely think that you could lydia drawled coming back to tuck herself against him as they walked on towards the welcoming lanthorns of the inn just damn my eyes but i like this woman lewrie happily told himself as they dared to embrace and kiss just once more before they had to go in a kiss that lasted and lasted but could not last long enough book iv we are come to a new era in the history of nations we are called to struggle for the destiny not of this country alone but of the civilised world we have for ourselves the great duty of selfpreservation to perform but the duty of the people of england now is of a nobler and higher order amid the wreck and the misery of nations it is our just exultation that we have continued superior to all that ambition or that despotism could effect and our still higher exultation ought to be that we provide not only for our own safety but hold out a prospect for nations now bending under the iron yoke of tyranny of what the exertions of a free people can effect prime minister william pitt the younger address to parliament summer chapter twentysix idylls over lewrie muttered once he had signed for a thin set of ribbonbound and waxsealed orders handdelivered direct from admiralty by a taciturn older lieutenant the fellow knew nothing and said little more then departed to catch the morning coach to london before it left without him lewrie ripped the ribbons upwards breaking the seal and unfolded the orders for a brief moment his eyes strayed to another smaller sealed note on his daycabin desk one from lydia stangbourne which would he prefer to read first but there was no helping it he puffed out his lips in irritation as he turned back to the orders take upon yourself the charge and command over hms fusee bomb eight lieutenant joseph johns three he read under his breath almost mumbling theres three joseph johns in the fleet he wondered aloud who wouldve thought it ah has aboard at this time mister cyrus mactavish esquire and his chief artificer to perform certain experiments with the devices that mister mactavish has designed and fashioned you will render all aid and support to the timely experimentation and trial implementation of said devices against french harbours and gatherings of craft amassed for the possible seaborne invasion of the british isles you will see that your officers and men become cognisant of all mechanical details of said devices to support such experimentation and possible implementation with all despatch you will provide both escort and material support to lieutenant johns his vessel mister mactavish and his artificer in this endeavour lewrie wondered if that meant he had to dine them all in each night and serve them their grog ration too what the devil you are also most strictly cautioned that this endeavour is of a most highly secret nature and you are not only to protect hms fusee the devices and their designer and fabricator from capture by the enemy at all hazards but you are also strictly charged to restrict the secret of the existence of said devices from any naval personnel or civilians not directly involved in the aforesaid experimentation well there goes shore liberty and any more chance o puttin the ship out of discipline tease her people whew which step to take first brief his officers on the sofar unseen mysterious devices or go find this fusee bomb and speak with lieutenant johns this mactavish fellow and his unnamed artificer did he have time to read lydias note no with a long sigh he swept both secret orders and billetdoux into the top righthand drawer of his desk and locked them away shove me into my coat pettus and pass the word for my boat crew he ordered it took a shore call upon the port admiral to discover exactly where hms fusee was anchored then required a long row into the medway and through the protective boom to discover fusee which streamed to the tide near the old receiving ship hms sandwich which old threedecker still emitted the same old reeks of impressed misery that hed encountered when manning his first frigate hms proteus in for a vessel engaged in a secret endeavour her harbour watch was remarkably slack lewries gig was only an hundred yards off before someone woke up and hailed them the scramble to man the side for the arrival of a postcaptain could be called comical were it not so serious captain alan lewrie come aboard to speak with your captain lewrie announced to the single midshipman present fusees crew was about the bare minimum not over fifty hands all told so no more than one midshipman was required here he comes sir lieutenant johns the older lad said almost in relief as a tall and lean fellow in his midthirties turned up on the bombs quarterdeck joseph johns your servant sir the fellow said doffing his hat with a jerky halfbow from the waist lt johns was scarecrow thin with a prominent adams apple a long windvane of a nose and noticeable cheekbones he looked to be a perfect nonentity but for a pair of eyes that seemed aflame with enthusiasm weve just received directions from admiralty that you would be in charge of us and of our ehm he added jutting a pointy chin forward to his bombs foredeck where two thirteeninch seamortars would usually be emplaced in sidebyside wells heavily reenforced with great baulks of timber to withstand the shock of their upwards discharge and the downthrust of recoil now the wells were shrouded by what looked to be a scrap topsl so large that it might have come off a frigate looking in that direction gave lewrie the impression that the canvas shrouded six great water casks he also took note of a long and heavy boom rigged to the base of the bombs foremast and a hoisting windlass so it could be employed as a crane forward of the mast not aft pardon me for seeming remiss in searching you out sir but as i said orders came aboard not half an hour past johns went on mine preceded yours by no more than an hour mister johns it is of no matter lewrie allowed clapping his hands into the small of his back and craning his neck to look upwards i had a converted bomb in the bahamas tween the wars but alacrity as a gunketch had her masts equally spaced like a brig and the mortar wells were fore and aft of the foremast your fusee resembles a threemaster thats missing her entire foremast and sports but main and mizen the newer construction allows both mortars to work in concert sir bowson to a target stead of anchored beamon and becoming a better target lt johns laughed i admit the new ones look queer but with much larger jibs and foreandaft staysls they will go up to windward at least a point closer but still make leeway like a wood chip lewrie wryly asked no worse than the older class sir but aye lt johns said with a fatalistic shrug bombs are notorious for it unfortunately any chance that so much leeway when engaged in the ah experiments mentioned in my orders might cause any problems mister johns lewrie asked lowering his voice like a conspirator plotting mayhem what sort he still hadnt a clue well sir i wouldve preferred a vessel with deeper quickwork and less leeway but the wells are handy for the ah things and fusees lower freeboard will aid in their deployment johns replied looking cuttyeyed and furtive all but laying a cautioning finger to his lips but you must meet mister mactavish the fellow who devised the ah items sir johns perked up his ideas are visionary they could revolutionise naval warfare sir this way all that hmm lewrie most dubiously said lead on then youve sufficient ships boats captain lewrie might i ask lt johns enquired as he led the way to a small companionway and a very steep but thankfully short ladder leading below two twentyfivefoot cutters my gig and a jollyboat lewrie told him taking off his hat and ducking but ow he yelped mind the deck beams sir lt johns warned much too late i have found a cautious crouch best serves sir when belowdecks a trice later and lewrie found himself in the gloom of a very dark and small joke of a greatcabin lt johnss own quarters rightaft were screened off by deal partitions and a louvred door down each beam were four dogboxes and along the centreline stood a rough planked table with seachests for seating much like the orlop deck cockpit of bigger ships where midshipmen surgeons mates and masters mates resided two men sat slouched on their elbows at the table opposite each other poring over sheaves of drawings and plans which were rolled up hastily at lewries appearance as they turned to glower at him captain lewrie sir allow me to name to you the designer of our of the mister cyrus mactavish and his senior artificer and fabricator mister angus mccloud johns announced gentlemen allow me to name to you captain alan lewrie of the reliant frigate at least only the one of em popped out of a haggis lewrie told himself with two scottish names mentioned in his orders hed expected a lot worse captain lewrie your servant sir the urbanelooking one said as he cautiously got to his feet and came forward to offer his hand to lewrie mactavish sir formerly major in the royal engineers mactavish was lean and fair with an almost noble face dressed in a plain dark blue coat buff breeches and topboots and my righthand man angus mccloud mactavish pointed out if hed dressed in kilt crossgartered plaid stockings and a scotch bonnet mccloud could not have looked more sawney his grizzly beard included lewrie hadnt seen one on a man in ages the man wore a slategrey tweed suit of ditto the fabric so rough that sparrows might have woven it from straw and twigs mccloud was much older than his employer grey and bristly curlyhaired with tanned and leathery rough features he continued scowling gday tye capm was all he had to say with a short nod still seated gentlemen lewrie replied for the moment you have the advantage of me my orders did not specify exactly what it is were to do or what your devices do and with good reason sir mactavish said with a bark of good humour do the french learn what is in store for them it would make our trials much more difficult not to say impossible does the term torpedo mean anything to you sir ah some sort of eel or ray lewrie asked shrugging his ignorance a fish o some sort will you take coffee captain lewrie lt johns offered yes join us and i will enlighten you sir mactavish grinned once all were seated and lewrie had a mug in his hands the man went on with a sly and boastful grin theres all these bloody barges and boats the french have built not counting the prames and chaloupes of varying sizes and armament built as gunboats to provide escort to the invasion when it comes so many that the french have had to anchor them outside the principal invasion ports up against the breakwaters in row after row waiting for the moment when the troops and artillery go aboard them like trots o peegs anuzzlin a sow mccloud supplied with a gruff tone now with that the case captain lewrie how would you get at them mactavish asked already smiling with impending glee to reveal his solution with bombs and seamortars gunfire and fireships i spose lewrie replied sure that his answer would be wrong a cuttingout expedition on dark moonless nights ye canna geet yair frigate that close tshore mccloud piped up bombs canna expec calm waters een can they get inta shallower waters an th frogs gunboatsd put paid tyair fireships an a yair puir sailors ye send rowin in well angus when the time comes are we successful therell be all those in concert but with the addition of my torpedoes my cask torpedoes aha mactavish cried triumphantly those things shrouded in the mortar wells sir weve half a dozen ready to go and more being fabricated even as we speak when the time comes we intend to launch them by the hundreds on a french port and blow all of their caiques and boats and barges to kindling uhm how lewrie had to ask it sounded fine but imagine sir an assault launched in the dead of night without an inkling of danger mr mactavish continued squirming impatiently on his seat ships boats tow my cask torpedoes in close to shore cock the detonating mechanisms start the clock timer and set them to drift in on a making tide channel tides are rapid inexorable now silently unseen for they ride very low in the water waves of them waft inshore right up to those caiques peniches and barges as quietly as mice dinna forget th grapnels an th spikes mccloud dryly added they bob up alongside the french boats mactavish further enthused sketching out the assault with the tips of his fingers fluttercreeping towards a box of sweet bisquits on the table top grapnels and old bayonets snag or spear into the hulls of the boats the first warning that anythings amiss to the few french sailors aboard them to watch over their anchor cables and the lines which moor them together hah then when the clock timer winds up the trigger cords and those few frogs best efforts to dislodge them prove fruitless up they go in gigantic blasts ah ha he cried raising his hands his fingers spreading further to simulate soaring chunks of debris float in on the tide lewrie said back shifting uneasily on a hard sea chest that could take a while even on a channel tide your clock timer mechanism we determine the speed of the tide set the timers to account for it judge the distance at which the torpedoes are released then prime them and off they go mactavish told him beaming uhm channel tides flow into their ports aye mister mactavish but theres a strong tide up or down channel to consider lewrie had to point out is the bottom smooth tidewashed sand and mud or is it rocky which sets off strong eddies its not as if all your cask torpedoes will just drift straight in some will swirl about and might end up a mile from where you want them but the bulk of them surely will succeed sir mactavish said with complete assurance in his devices boats will be lost to them some damaged and force the french to replace them and once a few blow up without warning think of the panic they will engender what french sailor would dare to sleep aboard his caique or peniche if the presence of death may come with each sunset think of the panic in the boat crews who tow the damned things in ready to explode lewrie sourly thought how close ashore to the anchored boats would boat crews have to get before releasing them lewrie asked well that would depend on the run of the tide captain lewrie i should imagine that each boat will have a midshipman with a passable skill in mathematics mactavish said shrugging off the problem some of your whatdoyoucallthem masters mates able to judge the height of the boats masts and perform simple trigonometry to determine the distance the speed of the tide and set the clock timer accordingly boy midshipmen with good mathematics lewrie wondered now there is a snag a veritable paradox as to the matter of suitable boats sir lt johns brought up once more weve only a small gig and an eighteenfoot jollyboat on our inventory to tow them in quickly then make their way out just as quickly it would be best if we had some boats larger than your two cutters thirtytwofoot barges with two masts for lugsails and a jib would be best or at least twelveoared barges well ask of the dockyard lewrie told him im sure they might have some spares what condition theyre in well if we need authorisation who do we mention are we under lord keith and north sea fleet droppin a powerful name sometimes helps no worry then captain lewrie mr mactavish said with a toplofty smirk we have letters from lord melville personally signed authorising any expense or requisition might they do mine arse on a bandbox lewrie thought what do i want what does reliant need and how much can i get away with i expect theyd do mainwell mister mactavish lewrie allowed uhm could i see these wonders not the plans here but the real articles aye weel artificer mccloud grumbled rubbing his beard but of course sir this instant mactavish quickly agreed hmm rather big lewrie commented once the canvas shroud had been drawn back just far enough to expose one of the devices to his eyes to all outward appearances the cask torpedo was a large water butt about four feet tall and fat in the middle tapering at each end to shallow hemispherical lids not the usual flat wooden lids set into the ends two or three inches below the rims any large tun cask or barrel made to hold liquids was constructed with extra care of course so that the staves fit together so closely that only the slightest bit of seepage occurred in this case seepage inward would be the ruin of the device so it had been slathered all over in tar then wrapped with more tarred canvas th bottoms heemispherical yell note mccloud pointed out sae thayrs space feer th ballast tae keep eet ridin oopright een th water and the upper hemisphere is a void a space for air mactavish added that is where the clock mechanism sits along with the pistol which ignites the charge at the proper time when one is about to let one go one first pulls the line with the blue paint on the last inches of the line that will start the clock the redpainted line cocks the primed firelock of the pistol the clock gears drive a circular wooden disk which has several dowels projecting from it the trigger line is bound to one of the dowels and as the clock turns the disk the line is drawn taut til it pulls the trigger of the pistol and bang he gleefully concluded the gunpowder and the pyrotechnicals ignite and adieu monsieur frog ha ha how much gunpowder lewrie asked getting up on his tiptoes to peer over the top of the torpedo taking hold of one of the hoisting ringbolts and how low in the water will it ride i notice the top is not tarred but painted black and how do you set the clock at the last minute one hundred and twenty pounds of powder mactavish told him lewrie stepped back a foot or two dye mean its loaded now he gawped weel o course eets loaded mccloud said with a short snort of amusement but the pistols nae primed nor cocked an th clock aint runnin eets safe as sae many bricks so when the time comes to prime the pistols pan set the clock timer and ready it to go how do you if the tops sealed lewrie asked growing a bit more dubious of the whole enterprise and feeling a faint shudder of dread in his middle as to that captain lewrie mactavish said soothingly one must remove the bung set into the very top the hole is wide enough for your average man to reach down into it set the clock timer for the minutes judged best pull the lock back to halfcock and prime the pan then draw it to full cock oh jesus lewrie groaned inside pity the poor fool who does that from a wallowin rowin boat pull the trigger lines to set it all in motion then drive the bung back in place mactavish went on not noticing lewries look of utter dread the torpedo will float with the top six inches free of the water and should waves slop over it the bung will keep things dry enough for as long as the clock runs mind noo yell hae twind th bluidy thing feerst mccloud hooted then turned to spit overside thats why the top is painted black to hide it from a casual observer or lookout mactavish breezed off the ringbolts will do for hoisting out from this vessel and for towing lines from the boat which takes it in close the old socket bayonets will be fitted over muzzle stubs from old tower muskets and the same for the grapnels all the metal fittings screwed in and washered and tarred inside and out but well do all that before theyre hoisted out so right now were sittin on seven hundred twenty pounds of gunpowder lewrie said shaking his head and if anything goes amiss we could take out old sandwich yonder the medway boom tenders and an host of unwary workers nae countin th spare kegs o powder stored below mccloud said his head cocked over and nodding genial agreement with lewries estimate mister johns i think it best if you move fusee out into the great nore anchorage near my ship lewrie suggested not too bloody near thankee he thought of course sir lt johns replied stiffening with eagerness to be about the start of their adventure well take my gig in tow and bring my boat crew aboard for a bit lewrie added alright with you sir he had to enquire for it was not his ship and lt johns was fusees commanding officer very good sir bosun pipe all hands to stations for taking in the anchors johns bellowed lewries coxn and his gigs oarsmen came tumbling aboard from the boat and a long towline was bound to her stem bollard for towing astern it would be a nice rest for them instead of another long row of several miles they began stretching and chattering peering about at the oddness of a new ship a type which most of them had never seen patrick furfy stroke oar and liam desmonds longtime mate from their irish village took out a short stub pipe and began to tamp shag tobacco into it furfy lewrie snapped looking aghast no smoking if you please he added once he saw the surprise on furfys face not til were back aboard reliant and off this vesuvius lewrie determined chapter twentyseven it was another of those fine summer sunsets the wind from off the north sea just cool enough to rid the greatcabins of the warmth of the day as it wafted down through the opened windows in the coachtop overhead and through the halfopened sashwindows in the transom it was two days since lewrie had discovered fusee and her lethal cargo and one day after mr mactavish and lt johns had briefed reliants officers and midshipmen that had seemed to go well did one consider struck dumb and appalled proper reactions lt merriman and lt westcott had shared stunned looks but would soldier along lt spendlove reliants second officer though had expressed his distaste for the torpedoes calling them infernal machines and unworthy of a gentlemanwarrior if theyre to revolutionise warfare at sea sir it will be a brute form of revolution does this war go on long enough well be shelling enemy cities next hed said shaking his head in sadness oh lt spendlove would carry out his duties to the tee hed quickly assured lewrie but hed rather hoped that mactavish and his torpedoes would prove a failure close blockade was the very thing to spendloves mind just as the former first lord of the admiralty the earl st vincent had determined this evening lewrie would not be dining in lt johns mactavish or mccloud nor any of his own people either he and the cats dined alone toulon and chalky atop his table with their separate bowls of victuals with no one to impress lewrie could dress comfortably in an old pair of sloptrousers old buckled shoes and cotton stockings and just his shirt and loosened neckstock once pettus removed his soup and began to fill a plate with the entree lewrie could take the note from lydia stangbourne from a pocket and unfold it to read once more she hoped that his assignment in channel waters for the rest of the year would allow them to see each other again more often and even very often should he be called to london that would be grand and it would not involve round after round of gaming clubs should he be back in port long enough he must write her at once and she would coach down so that they thud went his marine sentrys musket on the deck midshipman warburton sah enter lewrie answered with a frustrated growl there were a few times when solitude was welcome and this was one of them mister houghtons duty sir and im to tell you that there is a boat hailing us with a visitor warburton announced from fusee lewrie asked scowling from shore sir he appears to be a civilian mr warburton told him percy come thave my guts for toppin his sister lewrie wondered no matter ill be on deck directly thankee mister warburton aye aye sir lewrie frowned dabbed his mouth and rose from the table hiding lydias note in a trouser pocket once more silently damning all callers whod disturb his supper or ruin his good mood good god lewrie said though once his visitor had boarded where the devil did you spring from hallo peel sir alan lewrie sir mr peel tis peel james peelreplied doffing his fashionable thimbleshaped hat and bowing as grandly as he would at court laughing though i bow to your grandeur ill even kowtow at your magnificence now thatd be a sight lewrie barked laughing back and going to shake hands the last i heard from you two years ago was a letter from somewhere in the germanies well soon as the war began again things got a bit hot for me and my line of work so the foreign office found something else for me to do closer to home damn my eyes lewrie how do you keep mainwell considerin lewrie replied care for a bite or two of something or would ye care twatch me eat while you sip a bit of brandy just a dab or two of what youre having and the brandy mr peel japed when lewrie had first met james peel in the italics in or so he had first taken him for a side of beef sent to bodyguard that old cutthroat from the foreign offices secret branch mr zachariah twigg peel was big enough for that duty he was not quite six feet tall and beef to the heel all of it lean muscle and he could certainly look threatening with his very dark brown hair and eyes a pair of strong hands wide shoulders deep chest with the lean hips of a panther a brainless bullybuck peel was most certainly not though for hed come from a distinguished family of the landed gentry had a quick and clever mind and at one time before his cheating at cards in his regimental mess had caught up with him and forced his resignation peel had been a captain of household cavalrythough even the curraissiers thought that he rode heavy peel had been twiggs man in the west indies during the slave rebellion on saint dominguehaiti and had aided lewrie against the creole rebel pirates in louisiana and again during the francoamerican quasiwar of a growin lad needs his tucker lewrie commented watching the fellow eat part of his own supper and empty half the freshbaked rolls in the bread barge ehm you arent come from mister twigg with another of his harumscarums are you the fingers of his left hand were crossed to ward off that very occurrence under the tablecloth no the old fellows done with spycraft and were the worse off for it but it comes to us all sooner or later peel said fading is he lewrie replied i recall my father mentioning hed had a bad winter but when that was he shrugged had several bad winters peel said between bites of pork chops his physicians finally told him to avoid london and its air like the plague and winter at his country estate in hampstead oh hell come down to london in the spring when the coal smokes not as heavy but for the most part hes up at spyglass bungalow spoiling his grandchildren something sinful thank god lewrie commented letting out a pent breath and uncrossing his fingers if he had wished to rope me in im spoken for anyway something just as lunatick as any twigg dreamt up you mean your cask torpedoes peel asked with a sly smirk dont know what youre talkin about and besides lewrie tried to wave off with a fork full of mashed potatoes in fact lewrie recall im secret branch peel japed we know all about them and i wish you the best of good fortune with them youre here to check up on them lewrie asked god no not me peel said laughing that would be some anxious admiralty sort and he wont pester you til youve had at least a few trials no i was making the rounds with admiral cornwallis of channel fleet admiral lord keiths squadrons in the downs and one or two others regarding the estimated numbers types and strengths of the invasion fleet bonapartes building uhm might i get a topup of this excellent whatever it is a singlechateau bordeaux sir pettus informed him as he did the duty the captain brought several back from the gironde youve numbers lewrie asked when hed called upon the admiralty in london theyd given him the descriptions and some sketches of what they thought the various french invasion vessels looked like but no idea of how they were armed or how many he would face peel gave him a cockbrowed look and a headjerk at pettus pettus one of those take the air on deck moments lewrie told his cabin steward and take jessop with you for a bit you are aware of the types peel asked in a low voice once he was sure they were alone theres guilots to transport horses and artillery batteries lewrie ticked off on his fingers theres some threemasted hundredfooter gunboats what they call prames with twelve twentyfourpounders peel stuck in though they build them so quickly and of such light materials that prames cant stand against a frigate go on peel urged with a sage nod they showed me brigrigged chaloupes lewrie said waiting three twentyfourpounders and an eightinch mortar peel said im told there are some lesser gunboats two or threemasted luggers even cutterrigged small ones lewrie asked pausing again for information might face only one twentyfourpounder and an army field piece in the smallest dutchbuilt ones perhaps some older naval guns of lesser calibres in the frenchbuilt peel enlightened him he was picking his teeth as he did so then theres all those damned penishes and caiques all of em luggers to carry troops and supplies lewrie continued admiralty said there were hundreds of em about seven hundred gunboats and escorts of various types and their plans are for over two thousand transports peel told him with a grave look im told though that both admiral cornwallis and admiral lord keith estimate that it would take two or three tides to get all of them to england and with channel fleet our north sea fleet and the downs combined against them given enough warning when they at last decide to try it on we could massacre them the french just dont have that many experienced sailors and most of their guns will be manned by soldiers with little knowledge of naval gunnery less its a deadflat calm when they come their artillerists will find floatin bobbin and wallowin boats just wont sit still as solid ground where they learned their trade aye lewrie determined almost ready to whoop with glee and a wish that the french would try and they cant send em out to the slaughter without the support of their navy and we have their proper warships bottled up in brest and rochefort or in the texel in holland they might get out yes but i doubt they will enjoy it peel said with a snicker topping up his own wine from the sideboard after all the frogs must man those squadrons guns and retain enough sailors to handle the ships and reserve even more skilled artillery men for the harbour and coastal batteries that boney has had erected all along the channel coast to boot is god just the french may plan to have their infantry aboard the gunboats work their own guns to defend themselves perhaps they work to a tight budget two for the price of one lewrie snickered back reaching to refill his glass too there is another matter though peel admitted at last lewrie became wary in an eyeblink for this was the way that mr twigg had begun to introduce his previous schemes there are according to one of our sources in paris several hundred more invasion craft to figure with youve still agents in paris lewrie asked stunned one or two mr peel confessed most slyly once the war began last may bonaparte clapped a total embargo on correspondence going in or coming out of france almost every book newspaper or letters read but weve managed we have our ways after all so far we only have vague descriptions no sketches of this other type of craft but everyone would dearly love to lay hands on one youll be working along the french coast good do you ever come across what looks like a waterbeetle with sails you snap it right up a waterbeetle lewrie said with a dubious frown theres a msieur forfait been made inspectorgeneral of the invasion fleet one of bonapartes pet mathematicians and scientists forfait earned his spurs designing and building shallow draught barges and such for use on the seine some people in london think the entire ideas as daft as bats but he is a skilled mathematician so we cant dismiss his work outofhand mister mactavish is a skilled engineer too and look what hes come up with lewrie sourly thought there are two types described peel went on leaning closer ones about thirtysix feet by fourteen or fifteen feet and will only draw about three feet of water the seconds about fourtysix feet in length and sixteen or eighteen feet in breadth that one is said to draw a little less than four feet of water when fully laden eighty or an hundred soldiers aboard a twentyfourpounder gun mounted in the bows and from the description may resemble two serving platters joined together the top one inverted and very flatbottomed there are slanted berths for the soldiers in the rims of the lower platter and theyre supposed to be rigged like a schweling fishing boat whatever the devil thats supposed to look like any clue never seen one in my life lewrie told him with a shrug anyway the most intriguing part of the written description is that theres a long box atop the upper platter that runs the length of the boat tall enough to allow the soldiers aboard to sit below it and be sheltered from fire peel said grimacing with mock disbelief four or five abreast and twenty or so deep so they can sit there in the same formations theyd form in the field napoleon bonaparte is very fond of the column when attacking opposing lines not keen on it myself but its seemed to have served him well so far now what we are worried about is whether that protective box and the wide slope of the upper hull from the waterline up might be armoured somehow if the french have reenforced these boats they might be the principal craft to drive themselves right onto the beaches and be proof against shot from any of our field guns or horse artillery batteries our fellow in paris describes the damned things as threefifths of their length flat with a rise of eight feet at the ends they could come ashore like so many walruses armoured with iron plate dye mean lewrie gawped thatd make em topheavy as hell centre of gravity metacentric height all that youve been reading technical books peel teased ye listen to others long enough well lewrie shrugged off if theyre armoured theyd be drawin a lot more water than three or four feet jemmy ill allow that the breadth of their hullsd buoy em up a good deal but not that much and if theyre that heavy it would take a lot more sail area than a fishing boats tdrive em the report says that they only require a crew of five or six seamen peel said dredging half a roll through the juices and gravy on his plate for a last bite and some sort of paddle arrangement to propel them if the wind fails what sort the work done by soldiers really alan if you see one go after it mactavishs experiments bedamned ill try and do my best lewrie grinned back anything else pick up the golden fleece slay medusa while im at it whats for dessert peel asked laughing heartily i think my cook said theres a bread pudding are we done on confidential topics ill have my steward return lewrie said rising to go to the forward door to his cabins to speak with the marine guard so he could pass word for pettus and jessop rather humble fare for a knight and baronet peel mused once hed returned to the diningcoach lewrie opened a covered dish it comes with caramel sauce lewrie said after sticking one finger into the dish and licking it and dont you start its all a sham anyway awarded for sympathy not anything i did the closest i ever got to something of note was years ago in the south atlantic when we took the luranie frigate and the baronetcy hmpf king george was havin an off day lets leave it at that unless ye wish to hear the whole story is it amusing peel asked completely lewrie assured him then do tell chapter twentyeight its grand that spains stayed out of the war so far peel said after supper they had gone on deck to the taffrails of the quarterdeck so he could light up a slim cigaro and blow smoke rings at the night do they decide to rejoin the french against us the price of tobacco will soar and the quality will decrease say what you will of american tobacco but i still think the best is from spanish colonies wouldnt know much about that never developed the taste for it lewrie said with a shrug lounging most lubberly on the aftermost bulwarks he looked over to fusee about half a cable off to larboard they wouldnt let you smoke over there not with all the powder aboard her were much more hospitable he added grinning think those things will work peel asked no idea lewrie replied i spose well soon find out the winds fair enough for us to set out tomorrow morning and let us test the first batch though after what weve learned of them the last few days i think my chancesd be better were i a french matelot sittin on an anchored barge than bein in the launchin boat well if mactavishs dont theres other designers ideas to try out peel imparted with a knowing nod and wink theres a fellow name of robert fulton an american whos come up with a variation on the torpedo mans just brimming with ideas he claims he could build a ship driven by a steam engine deadkeen on steam engines he is no thankee lewrie scoffed after a second of surprise correct me if im wrong but dont steam engines need big fires under the boilers fire on a wooden ship brr not only that this fulton fellow said he could also build a nautilus a submersible boat that could sink down twenty or thirty feet and stay down for the better part of an hour peel further told him a small crew three or four i forget which paddle it forward in some way and do what with it lewrie gawped then shook his head the very word sink makes my nutmegs shrivel sounds suicidal tme thats what admiralty thought too peel said with a snicker he offered both just after the war began again last may i gather that fulton couldnt sell his ideas to his own navy and couldnt raise sufficient private funds in his own country so he flogged his schemes on this side of the atlantic the last card up his sleeve was the idea of explosive torpedoes though i believe that the submersible boat and the torpedoes would have worked together the boat towing the torpedoes under an anchored ship and the torpedo exploding when it came into contact whilst the submersible paddles away on the other side not with a timing mechanism lewrie grimaced that would take some sort of hairtrigger pistol and any hard knockd set it off you wish crew for that thing best look in bedlam admiraltys judgement too peel said shrugging pausing to take a deep puff on his cigaro and exhale a jet of smoke mind now all these daft schemes are william pitts doing soon as he got back into office as prime minister he pressed for offensive action and not sit idle waiting for the french to invade admiral the earl saint vincent was against them but who knows about lord melville the damned things may turn up to be tested do we give events long enough or they grow dire enough christ was lewries sober comment to that better us than the french i suppose peel said laughing some more before he came to london fulton tried to sell his schemes to bonaparte went to paris during the peace of amiens and got an audience with the ogre himself and thank god boney thought fultons ideas madder than a march hare too lewrie tried to picture what the french would have done with a submersible boat and a towed torpedo could people be found with more martial ardour than sense to crew the things in the first place then this anchorage at the nore would lie open to a creeping unseen danger portsmouth plymouth great yarmouth or harwich he had to shake his head to rid himself of the image of a peacefully anchored and sleeping warship suddenly smashed open by a titanic blast then heeling over and sinking in minutes aflame from bow to stern no thankee at least a steamdriven shipd give you a fightin chance and stay atop the sea lewrie thought wondering uneasily where all this inventiveness would lead warfare at least had a few gentlemanly rulesnot that lewrie had always paid heed to them when needs mustbut in the main both sides went into battle with assumptions that things would go honourably fairly and sporting like knights of old at a joust if inventiveness mated with desperation though no with any luck such things wont work well enough to become normal or acceptable lewrie told himself penny for your thoughts peel prompted upon seeing how silent and pensive lewrie had become wonderin what fultons torpedoes are like compared to ours lewrie dissembled it wouldnt do to sound fretful even with a friend that would be croaking and might give peel the impression that hed no faith in mactavishs torpedoes and would not do his utmost to test them fairly smaller i gathered peel told him flicking an inch of ash over the stern small enough to be rolled over the side of a boat spherical made of copper i think theyre to be deployed in pairs with a line buoyed with cork blocks like a fishing net between them other than that the clockwork timers and cocked pistols to set them off are similar to mactavishs this very moment theres probably a captain like you charged with experimenting with fultons version a competition tween the two versions if you will and of course old man peel sarcastically added assuming an oxonian accent cant let the oldschool side down you know better the winner is british than a benighted brother johnathon from new england what yoicks tallyho and all that lewrie smirked win for the roast beef of old england peel laughed back unless the damned things turn out to be a pile of manure chapter twentynine the first cask torpedo was tried out in english waters just off mersea island and the mouth of the blackwater river where the north sea tides ran particularly strong and the ebbs left miles of exposed mud flats reliant stood guardian to the fusee bomb as she worked her way within a mile of shore as the tide began to flood and it was lieutenant johns and mr mccloud who saw to its priming its lowering into the waters and its towing behind one of their new thirtytwofoot barges lewrie had himself rowed over to fusee to watch and stood with mr mactavish whilst the evolution was carried out they will be setting the timer drawing the cocking line to the pistol and letting it go mactavish narrated a telescope to his eye like to jump out of his skin with excitement mccloud and i agreed to set the clockwork for half an hour no specific target just a trial of all the various elements you see sir hell piss his breeches does he have twait for half an hour lewrie cynically thought a telescope to his own eye the twelveoar barge was wheeling about fending off from the torpedo with a gaff and rehoisting its lugsails in understandable haste he also noted mactavish for all his seeming urbanity did closely resemble a squirming tailwagging circling puppy which would piddle in excitement he collapsed the tubes of his glass and became rivetted to his pocketwatch a fine one that had a second hand in addition to the usual minute and hour hands the fellow paced stewed fretted peered at his watch and fussed with the set of his coat and waistcoat his neckstock and unconsciously his crutch the barge returned lt johns and mccloud came upon deck and the boat crew led her aft for towing long minutes passed as a halfhour slowly ticked by lt johns and mccloud caught the fidgets too coughing and ahumming and now and then putting their heads together with mactavish for urgent whispered conversations lewrie looked at his own watch if mactavish was right their torpedo would explode in five minutes he lifted his telescope again looking for the device but could not find it any longer that blackpainted upper hemisphere hid it from sight most effectively even with a slight chop and bright sunlight shining off the whiteglittering wave tops the damned thing should have had a ring of revealing foam around it unless it had sunk of course lewrie thought ehm sirs fusees midshipman piped up coughing into his fist for attention sirs ahem that trading brig coming out from the river should we warn her off or something lewrie wasnt the only one who raised a telescope or scrambled for one sure enough a small twomasted merchantman was rounding the point east of bradwell waterside and standing out to sea sails trimmed to broadreach the noreasterly breezes could she be anywhere near your torpedo mister mactavish lt johns fretted aloud what was the rate of the tide mister mccloud lewrie asked the artificer in half an hour could it have nae muir than four or five knots i judged eet sae mccloud tried to shrug off pencil and paper mactavish cried my slate sir the midshipman offered think we should warn her off lewrie suggested warn her aye sir lt johns hurriedly agreed how lewrie further asked you have signal rockets we could fire a gun johns barked turning to order his small crew to man one of fusees puny pounders and whatll they make o that lewrie snapped i dont know sir lt johns replied stunned to inaction five knots drift for half an hour thats two knots progress on a course roughly northwest mactavish was mumbling half to himself a stub of chalk squeaking loudly on the midshipmans borrowed slate he paused to raise an arm to where he judged the torpedo first had been released his other arm to mark a rough course of drift then he fumbled to trade slate and chalk for his telescope once more well damme i think yes itll be wide of the mark sure to be wide of the mark once clear of the shoals the little merchant brig hardened up a point or two to the winds to sail on a beam reach angling further out to sea as if to pass well to windward of the anchored bomb and frigate without a clue or a care in the world safe as sae meeny houses mccloud predicted his thumbs stuck in the pockets of his waistcoat well miss her by a mile or boom a gigantic column of spray and foam liberally mixed with dark clouds of exploded gunpowder sprang up from the sea tall enough to tower over the brigs masthead trucks between her and the shore oh shit lewrie breathed hope her owner has insurance he further thought one halfhour to the minute sirs the midshipman meekly said my god from mactavish weel hmm from mccloud a shiver in the sea from the explosion was transmitted to fusee to rattle her blocks up through her hull to the tiny quarterdeck to make the oak planks shudder for a second or two what have we done dear lord what have we done mr mactavish was almost whimpering about ready to tear his hair out by the roots weel eet deed wirk sir sae mccloud tried to comfort him lewrie took another long look the merchant brig had hardened up to a closereach it was the wind pressing her sails that made her heel over more steeply not the blast of the torpedo she sailed off to their righthand side revealing that titanic column of spray and foam that was collapsing upon itself like a failing geyser at least a mile inshore of the brig but closer to the mouth of the colne river than the centre of mersea island as mactavish had planned thatll put the wind up him lewrie commented sarcastically perhaps the whole coast mister mactavish did you or admiralty warn the locals of your trials well of course not captain lewrie mactavish snapped back they are to be secret well it dont look too secret now lewrie told him with a wry grin as he lifted his telescope once more what fishing smacks that had been out off the coast were haring shoreward signal rockets were soaring aloft from clacktononsea and a semaphore towers arms were whirling madly the large black balls at their ends passing on a message to somewhere most urgently they were a bit too far offshore to see or hear the alarm their torpedos explosion had caused but lewrie could only imagine they had stirred up a hornets nest militia drums would be rattling mustering bugles would be tarahing and the womenfolk would be dashing about in a dither sure that the mysterious blast had been a fiendish french device sure sign of imminent invasion good lord sir do you imagine that the locals might think our torpedo was a lt johns gasped aghast at the implications im going back aboard reliant mister johns lewrie told him wishing he could wash his hands of the entire endeavour that minute i think the best action on our part would be to slink away very quietly and quickly and practice saying who me and declare my torpedoes a failure sir mctavish said with a snort now that the brig had escaped all harm he was back on his high horse it did work sir lewrie rejoined but i dont think more trials on our coast are a good idea you wish to try them in the conditions theyll face if accepted better we go mystify and frighten the french in a real channel tiderace well right then in the channel yes mactavish relented yes it did work didnt it he declared beginning to strut a bit in pride of his invention boulogne perhaps the harbour where theyre marshalling their forces uhm perhaps someplace less welldefended first lewrie said let me think of something for now mister johns get under way and follow me at two cables distance were off for france aye aye sir lt johns enthused all but licking his chops and get as far away from the results of our handiwork as we can lewrie thought chapter thirty are you quite sure this is a good idea sir lt westcott had to ask one more time just before lewrie departed the ship i could go in your place our people are still leery of the damned things sir lewrie replied patting himself down for essential items before going down to one of their cutters where his coxn liam desmond and his boat crew awaited him i cant ask any of them tdeal with em if someone does not lead the way dont worry mister westcott do we launch enough of them your turn will come very well sir westcott said with a resigned sigh best of luck sir thankee mister westcott reliant is yours for the time being keep her off the mud lewrie said first formally then with a laugh he doffed his hat then descended the manropes and battens to the boat leaping the last few feet to stumble into the arms of his oarsmen and then scrambling aft to its sternsheets by desmond shove off bow man desmond ordered his voice muted in conspiratorial fashion out oars starboard and make a bit o way out oars larboard and pull tgither set the stroke pat reliant and fusee had closed the french coast after full dark creeping in with leadsmen in the fore chains sounding the depths to a distance of two miles offshore where both had anchored to single bowers both vessels completely darkened despite the mugginess of a warm summer night all the oarsmen had been ordered to wear their dark blue jackets and tarred black hats just as lewrie had donned his old plain coat and doubled it over his chest to hide the whiteness of his shirt the night was so dark that the only way desmond knew how to steer for fusee was to make out the foam breaking round her waterline the shore was much easier to see even two miles off for the towns of st valery sur somme and le crotoy were lit up with street lanthorns or storefront lamps one town to either side of the mouth of the somme river and the deep bay axed into the shore between them it was easier too to make out the many riding lights of an host of anchored peniches and caiques in the small harbours and up either bank of the river so many wee riding lights that the flotillas resembled an extension of the towns that had flooded down the shoreline to fill the entire bay mister merriman still behind us desmond lewrie asked looking astern seems tbe sor desmond replied after a quick peek for the splash of oarsdarkened oars not their usual natty white and gay blue even both cutters hulls had been smeared with galley soot lewrie patted himself down once more seeking his small boat compass the hilt of his hanger and his pair of doublebarrelled pistols his powder flask and leather pouch for spare cartouches how he could read his compass without a candle would be another matter hoy the boat someone called as they neared fusee reliant number one desmond called back aye come alongside to larboard the voice yelled back desmond put the tiller over to swing the cutter round fusees stern easy all he ordered to ghost near her sides that you captain lewrie mr mactavish asked in an exaggerated whisper from one of the barges that sat rocking and wallowing by the converted bombs bows here sir lewrie called back forcing himself to sound eager weve four torpedoes ready in the water ready for towing as soon as youre ready to receive them sir mactavish said sounding gleeful christ lewrie muttered imagining four of the beasts primed and ready their spikes and grapnels affixed bobbing close together hoy the boat again from the quarterdeck reliant number two lt merriman announced as his cutter came in sight ghosting up behind lewries i will see to one of them midshipman frederick the second mactavish continued as loud as he dared as if a french guard boat was within hearing distance mcclouds instructed him thoroughly in its operation and its simple enough after all says you lewrie sourly thought is that the lads name our two are ready for towing mactavish went on lieutenant johns will pass you your towlines sure you have everything in hand sir row in abreast about one hundred yards apart and release them as one if we can see to do that aye lewrie told him well er mactavish flummoxed didnt think that quite through did ye lewrie scoffed to himself ive a small hooded lanthorn and if i spark my flint tinder that may create a signal mactavish extemporised quickly i will be the one to judge the heights of the masts and the proper time to set them free when i signal set your timers for fourtyfive minutes bow man hook on desmond ordered steering the cutter under fusees larboard side just long enough for a towing line to be thrown down to them and secured to a stern cleat ready sor make way desmond and get us clear of the others to starboard of fusees barges aye sor jaysus joseph an mary strokeoar patrick furfy muttered as the towline paid out to the point that the massive torpedo put a strain on it slowing the cutter to a crawl he freed one hand long enough to make a sketchy cross over his chest as delightful as reliants sailors had thought the idea of blowing frenchmen to kingdom come the explanation of how they would have to deal with the torpedoes inner workings had made many of them look queasy and cuttyeyed primed pistols to be cocked clocks set at the last moment too right alongside pounds of gunpowder brr if their officers or their senior midshipmen did it that was one thing but if the time came for a massive attack with dozens of them and it would possibly be their duty to set the clocks and prime the pistols and get away that was quite another which was why lewrie was here in reliants lead cutter whether he cared to be or not lewrie could see two faint grey smears off to his left as the two barges slowly stroked away to form half of the lineabreast whitepainted hulls sooted to blend in with the sea and the night he turned to look aft again and made out lt merrimans cutter just beginning to stroke free of fusees sides lets be about it then desmond lewrie told his coxn we will form lineabreast with those two boats to larboard aye sor his usually cocky irish coxn grimly replied the oars creaked in their canvaswrapped tholes in unison and the cutter surged to each long stroke rocking and wallowing between to the chops and rolls of the sea rising and dipping to the scend with a faint sound of surging water down its flanks the hands dug in and uttered faint grunts to drive forward the cask torpedos towing line raising a groan of its own dragging against the rowers efforts as if the cutter was tethered to a stone landing stage so slowly it seemed that the time went by with the lights of le crotoy and st valery drawing no closer the anchored trots of invasion boats remaining tiny and distant with the threat of a cruising gunboat lying just beyond their sight til one might suddenly loom up demanding identification with its guns run out and ready for firing then in a twinkling lewrie thought them too close to the enemy boats as if hed managed to nod off for long minutes and was presented with being at close quarters awakened by some frenchman crying qui va la or the bark of a gun he could make out individual shops and houses ashore spot waggons in the streets espy people strolling about and the peniches and caiques anchored in their dozens were so close that he could almost make out details in their rigging close enough dammit he asked the aether turning to peer out to larboard for mactavishs signal for a spark from his flintlock and tinder lighter or the covert flash from his hooded lanthorn but there was nothing to pierce the darkness he couldnt even see either of fusees barges if it had been up to him hed have signalled for the torpedoes release five minutes before off to starboard there was no sign of lt merrimans cutter any longer so when izzat a spark sir an oarsman whispered yes and just thankee jesus lewrie crowed to himself for he could see it too as mactavish cocked and fired his igniter over and over easy all desmond lewrie whispered to his coxn furfy and hartnett haul on the towline and bring the thing alongside aye sor furfy softly replied crossing himself once more without forward motion the cutter wallowed and rolled fitfully as the great cask was pulled up astern right to the cutters transom lewrie laid his hat aside and leaned out as far as he could reach to take hold of it but those spike bayonets and the grapnels fended the torpedo off like an aroused porcupine it butted against the cutters rudder with loud thuds keeping it even further away well this is hellishawkward lewrie silently fumed lets haul it round alongside the larboard quarter lewrie ordered that spared the rudder but the bayonets still kept it too far away the only way that he could see to remove the large bunglike tompion from the torpedos hemispherical top and reach down inside to set and activate its mechanism would be to leave the boat altogether and clamber on top of it and if he fell off he would surely drown for lewrie could not swim a single stroke the last time he had been forced into the sea was at toulon in when his mortar ship exploded flinging him skyhigh and his cabin steward will cony had buoyed him up and towed him to the nearby beach see if you can turn it halfway round furfy lewrie snapped in frustration spin it so the grapnels lay foreandaft and take off two or three of the bayonets touch it sor furfy yelped wiping his big hands down both thighs of his sloptrousers me sor aye you sir lewrie insisted the bayonets fit over the barrel stubs like they do on yer own muskets furfy the bloody thing cant go off til ive set it bear a hand pat liam desmond snapped leaning over the side you too hartnett pass the gaff back here thomas hook onto one o the liftin ringbolts tsteady th bastard they got the torpedo turned and removed three of the bayonets which allowed the massive bulk to thud right against the cutters hull sounding like a large wooden bell despite the need for silence lewrie turned his head to see that the larboardside oarsmen not involved with the torpedos turning and steadying shrank back to starboard lets see now he muttered leaning far out despite how close they had hauled it grasping one of the ringbolts with his left hand and groping at the tompion with his right damme thats snug the tompion which kept the inner works dry was a flush fit into the lowdomed wooden top with only a small brass ringbolt in the centre only large enough to pass a thin rope through it or one finger lewrie clawed the tompions edges with his fingernails but that was of no avail there was nothing for it but to lean out even further from the dubious safety of the cutter chest pressed against the torpedos top and his legs from the knees down inside the boat so he could take hold of the ringbolt and try to pull upwards well shit finally here furfy he handed the tompion back to furfy the nearest seaman who acted as if lewrie had just offered him a lit grenado bomb he still couldnt reach inside though hold it close alongside lads and very bloody steady hey lewrie whispered harshly to his sailors as he groped for the far edge of the torpedo to haul himself out half on top of the bobbing rolling beast hold my legs desmond even though he had managed to reach inside the night was nigh as black as a boot and even a tiny glim candle was right out of the question too much gunpowder and too many damned french patrols he stuck one arm down inside fumbled about and found the clockwork mechanism the only hand the minute hand was straight up at midnight lewrie gently pushed it down to what felt like a quarter past oops as the cutter and torpedo bobbed opposed to each other he had to fiddle some more to make sure that he hadnt pushed the hand down too far now where were the two trigger lines he found them drew them to their full lengths and pulled his arm clear god forgive a sinner he prayed then jerked them both hard both mechanisms sounded off together making him gasp in fright there was a hellish clank as the firelock on the pistol drew back to full cock and a bladderemptying whirrtick as the snugly wound clock began to function after a few panting breaths to calm himselfand realise that he hadnt been blown to atomslewrie coiled up those lines and dropped them to a far corner of the torpedos interior right furfy hand me the bung again he bade sliding just a bit more into the cutter he carefully placed it atop the torpedos top rattled it round into the hole and tried to push it back down christ on a crutch mine arse on a bloody bandbox it wont seat lewrie spat had it swelled in the few minutes it had been out the tompion was only halfway home and the priming and the powder in the pistol barrel which fired the larger charge would be soaked as the torpedo bobbed its way inshore with the chop sloshing over it hand me an oar somebody ill have thammer it home every sailor in the boat croaked taking in great gasps of air someoneit might have been the bow manlet out a wee whimper but they passed him an oar which he shortened up on as he slid back into the cutter feeling an immense sense of relief it must here be noted he turned the loom of the oar flat to the tompion lifted it then gave it a couple of hard whacks our father who art in heaven hallowed be does it look flush yet desmond lewrie asked oh flushz yer dinin table sor aye desmond whinnied seconded by a chorus of hearty agreement from the rest i dont know lewrie speculated using the loom of the oar to prod the rim of the tompion if it slid smooth that was fine but he reckoned there might be an inch to go for sure watertightness well it aint gone bang yet so he thought rising to stand in the boat with furfy clinging to his legs to steady him or cringe in terror lewrie slammed the oar down on the tompion one more time much harder causing a deep emptybarrel thud from the torpedo a thud that sounded very much like doom several sailors stuck fingers in their ears and squinted their eyes tight shut look flush now desmond he asked again i ah wouldnt know sor desmond croaked wouldnt want water gettin in and ruinin it right perish th fackin thought sor desmond assured him that should do it i think lewrie decided passing the borrowed oar back forward lets free the gaff and the towline and get away from it bugger the bayonets just toss em over and get a way on only the forwardmost larboard oarsmen could get their oars in the water whilst the starboardside rowers were free to work the towline was tossed free and the cutter began to move again its followin us someone cried with only the full bank of starboard oars at work the cutter was circling round to its left despite desmond holding the tiller hard over to larboard to steer away they were circling the torpedo and it was still right alongside were spiked to it furfy pointed out most anxiously mustve spun about and stuck a bayonet into the hull lewrie said hoping that mactavish had spent a goodly sum on his clocks get us free gaff here shove the bastard off unscrew the bayonet from the barrel stub another suggested wont come free th bitchs rollin too much tget a grip arms and legs over the side and push lads lewrie snapped heave heave heave at done it sir the torpedo at last drifted a few more feet away bobbing like a gigantic cork the lights from the town and anchored invasion boats glinting off its painted top and steel grapnels and bayonet blades aint naturaltis devils work them things a sailor whispered to his mate as they got both banks of oars working in unison and made their escape lewrie opened his pocket compass and held it close to his face but could not quite read it on the way in before they had left fusee the course had been sousoueast and the reciprocal to take them back near the converted bomb vessel should be nornorwest but he looked astern to the lights of st valery and le crotoy keep the towns on our starboard quarter desmond and thatll take us somewhere near fusee aye sor liam desmond replied with a firm mutter and a nod now they were getting away from their infernal device he sounded in much calmer takings by the faint whispers and brief flashes of his sailors teeth the cutters crew seemed much relieved too some even uttering very soft laughter jesus what a shitten mess lewrie thought letting out a sigh relaxing himself falling into an exhausted lassitude that happened to him now and then at the conclusion of battle aboard ship or the end of a persontoperson fight with his sword the intensely keen concentration at either left him so spent of a sudden that he sometimes needed a good sitdown to regain his strength and his wits lewrie shook himself back to full awareness and groped round the sole of the cutter for his hat it was soaked of course and trampled into ruin but he clapped it back on his head and what was the time when the damned clock began to run he suddenly thought you bloody fool ye didnt note it howll i know if the bastard blows up on time shit shit shit coffee sir lt johnss cabin steward offered aye more than welcome lewrie replied accepting a battered pewter mug of scaldinghot black coffee waving off the further offer of goats milk or sugar they had found fusee by steering blind til espying the long irregular skirt of foam breaking round the anchored bombs waterline mactavish and midshipman frederick had come along a few minutes later and lastly lt merrimans cutter had approached coming alongside to starboard having steered too wide and to seaward for a time cup for you too sir the steward offered merriman god yes the cheerful merriman so aptly named answered four minutes by my reckoning for mine mccloud the inventor mactavish said to his artificer in a loud whisper pardon sir but did you have any trouble with yours lieutenant merriman softly asked lewrie mine was a total bastard a complete shambles aye lewrie muttered back gettin it alongside with all those bloody bayonets gettin the tompion out and fumblin in the dark then gettin the bung back in we got spiked to the damned thing for a bit too aye sir i cant see how the torpedoes can be managed in the dark and if we launch them in daylight it will have to be done so close inshore that the french shore guns and gunboats shoot us all to flinders lt merriman told him shaking his head i dont know launchin em by the dozens lewrie muttered back i cant picture our sailors gettin it done right night or day theyre too damned complicated tset and prime about time gentlemen its about time mactavish enthused drawing all participants officers and sailors to the bulwarks to peer shoreward that was anticlimactic though for at least three more minutes passed before the first explosion there was a distant and dull boom as a torpedo at last went off shooting a geyser of spray and foam into the air and sounding no louder than the slam of an iron oven door and much further out to sea than the tide should have taken it according to mactavishs lastminute estimations it had not gone much more than half a mile hmmm id have thought mactavish fretted then drew out a sheaf of papers from his coat and tried to decypher them in the dark even more long minutes passed before the second torpedo burst and they almost missed that one for though this one had drifted in to roughly the proper distance to reach a trot of caiques the geyser of spray foam and gunpowder smoke looked little taller than the splash of a pound shot dapping along from its first graze and the sound of its expected titanic explosion was little more than a fumph not all the charge went off lt johns said crushed how could that be someone was remiss as to snugly replacing the tompion and the sea got in mr mactavish accused mine mostlike lewrie sheepishly thought but would not allow that to stand if seawater got to the pistols priming or powder charge it wouldnt have gone off at all mister mactavish lewrie told him i expect it was the main charge below that got soaked somehow and went off like a squib th casksre tightern a drum an tested fair leaks sair mccloud the artificer bristled back twitching his jaws so hard that his scraggly beard rustled paid ower weet tar an bound in tarred canvas they canna leak evidently thatun did mister mccloud lewrie rejoined or being stored at sea for a week or so the damp got to the gunpowder two to go though gentlemen alls not lost yet mactavish insisted but the trial evidently was over for after a full hour waiting for the other two to explode long past the time when they had been set to go off there were no more geysers or bangs i dont understand mactavish said bewildered according to my calculations i am certain that i prepared mine properly if no one else managed to follow such simple instructions lets get under way mister johns lewrie ordered yawning im amazed the french havent found us yet and we must be clear of the coast by dawn aye sir a crestfallen lt johns agreed theres still two to go i must point out to you sir mister mactavish peevishly demanded theres still darkness aint in the cards mister mactavish not tonight it aint lewrie told him im charged with keeping you two your torpedoes and anyone involved with em out of french hands and weve pressed our luck as far as i think it seemly tgo tonight were off and i need some bloody sleep lewrie told himself chapter thirtyone the morning after their assault on the mouth of the somme river reliant and fusee were forced to return to sheerness lt johns had made an inspection of the remaining torpedoes and found that their clockwork timers inner workings were so corroded by saltair damp that they would not run likewise for the firelocks of the igniting pistols a lack of mineral oil to protect them from rusting would have guaranteed a failure in private lt johns had also confided to lewrie that both the clocks and the pistols were of the cheapest manufacture castoffs or rejects of such low quality that they appeared to be the first failed efforts of new apprentices trust scots to pinch and bemoan a groat sir a penny bedamned johns had muttered most sadly disappointed mactavish and mccloud hed also reported had gone off on each other each blaming the other for the failures and the artificer sent off in a huff sacked from his position mactavish would have to see to the construction of new torpedoes himself find a new artificer to oversee the work and most definitely not spare hm governments money this time on the timers or pistols lewrie had begun his report to admiralty the morning after the trials off the somme and completed it just before reliant had come to anchor in the great nore he dispassionately described the complicated method of priming and activating the difficulty with the tompion and the use of them in the total dark along with the risks involved if deployed during the day the shoddy materials used in the first place and the great risk of damp getting to the powder no matter how snugly the torpedoes were sealed due to being stored abovedecks exposed to weather then slung over the side and towed long distances all but submerged it was no way to treat gunpowder if one wished it to stay dry and go bang his clerk and one of his mids with a good copperplate writing had made copies one for mactavish lewrie expected he would hear the fellows screeches all the way downriver from woolwich once he read his copy in the meantime though excuse me sir but i wonder if i might have a word aye mister merriman lewrie said looking up from his stroll of reliants quarterdeck to savour the summer sunshine its about the torpedoes sir lt merriman began those bastards lewrie said with a dismissive snort indeed sir merriman said with a wry grin of agreement i and mister westcott were talking things over last night and we were wondering if there would be any more trials with them if so we think weve come up with a way to improve them seaanchors sir seaanchors one uses a seaanchor to keep a ships head to wind in stormy weather but was a seaanchor used in a strong tideway would not a drogue pull the torpedo shoreward faster just bobbing about like they did we had to get within a mile with the timer set for fourtyfive minutes but if we could launch from farther out we could almost do it in daylight and be out of range of most shore guns lt merriman said bubbling over with enthusiasm might as well put a mast and a lugsl on em sir lewrie rejoined feeling gloomy of a sudden to imagine that there would be one more round of trials with the damned things or just shove tons of powder into a fireship and let it sail itself in the first lieutenant brought the idea up too sir merriman replied falling alongside of lewries inboard side as he paced aft to the taffrails if the drogues wont improve the torpedoes then perhaps a small fireship a fireboat might serve the purpose theres the problem of damp though lewrie pointed out aye sir and on that head we asked mister mainwaring the surgeon if he knew of any earth or element that would absorb damp lieutenant merriman rushed on all eagerness he cited sodium chloride sir whatever that is fireboats as in ships boats mister merriman lewrie asked pausing in midstride exactly so sir every dockyards full of them or they can be readily bought lt merriman continued one could place a floor above the ribs and keels a bulkhead forward in the bows and deck it all over with just a cuddy to allow for setting the timer and priming the pistol igniter just before the crew abandons it perhaps even construct interior beam partitions to form a box cabin which would secure the powder charge sir fill the voids between the hull and partitions with this sodium chloride whatever to soak up the damp perhaps even line the entire box with tin or lead or something to keep it all dry and a cheaply purchased fireboat could sail in under its own power why they might not even have to be set alight and could sail in in the night with the french none the wiser til they explode and a cutter or barge could carry a lot more gunpowder than one of the cask torpedoes sir youve sketches mister merriman lewrie asked beginning to be intrigued anything would beat mactavishs casks all hollow uhm mister westcott said he would essay a sketch or two sir merriman explained he did not wish to present them to you til he and i were perfectly satisfied but he also said that i should speak to you about the possibility hidin his light under a bushel basket is he lewrie japed well sir if our idea seems plausible mister westcott thought that the fireboats should be deemed as secret as the torpedoes hence we should show them to no one else but you for now sir lieutenant merriman said in a more guarded way when you and the first officer deem em ready bring em aft to the greatcabins mister merriman lewrie told him and mums the word til then carry on aye aye sir merriman said doffing his hat in salute gawd another daft idea lewrie thought once merriman had gone even more gunpowder a ton or so brr still an explosive boat doesnt depend on the tide alone lash the tiller and itll steer itself i wonder he heaved a sigh realising that if admiralty found westcotts and merrimans concept practical both officers might be sent off to develop the boats costing him two damned competent men if he wrote too enthusiastically admiralty might even think him clever enough to oversee the project and take reliant away from him and give him a shore post at some dockyard admiralty thinkin me clever lewrie scoffed though thatll be a cold day in hell id fight that even did all night in with lydia come attached it was midafternoon before lewrie heard back from lieutenants westcott and merriman and he was in point of fact writing a letter to lydia stangbourne and looking forward to a good nap once that was done and sent ashore to be postedin emulation of his catswhen his marine sentry loudly announced their arrival come he bade and westcott and merriman trooped in cocked hats under their arms and a packet of drawings in their hands carefully rolled up and bound with twine to guard against their contents being revealed prematurely tea for all pettus and then take yourself a long idle hour or so on deck lewrie called out pettus poured them all tumblers of lewries patented cool tea from a pitcher set out lemon slices and a sugar bowl then departed taking wee jessop with him quite refreshing sir thank you westcott said after a sip what have you come up with then lewrie pressed shifting with some eagerness in his chair as they sat round his dining table if it aint torpedoes its welcome oh aye sir lt westcott laughed baring his teeth in a wide grin he undid the knots in the twine and unrolled a short stack of foliosized sheets the first sir is the overall outer design with ends overhead and beam views mister merriman and i reckon that wed need at least a twentyfivefoot cutter to get the job done though a thirtytwofoot barge could carry more sail on its two masts and more gunpowder depending on how big a bang you wish sir merriman finished for his companion with a laugh youll note sir that the deckingover to keep the powder charge safe from spray and slop is slightly arched to channel a heavy sea off like water off a ducks back howd the sailors hoist sail then if its arched lewrie puzzled frowning over the drawing which was as fine and detailed as any hed seen in a dockyard office wouldnt they slide over the side with the water ah youll note that the decking ends just inside the gunnls and two inches below them sir lt westcott explained with another grin so the caprail of the gunnl forms a low rail to brace their feet as they tend the sheets and halliards uhhum was lewries comment to that thoughtful provision it appeared that his two lieutenants had given the matter more thought than the recently departed and unlamented mr mactavish had his casks the deckingover extends right aft almost to the sternsheets sir merriman said taking up the explanation of the plans theres the cuddylike hatch to allow access to the box cabin through which the powder kegs will be loaded and the clockworks and pistol can be set he used a pencil to tap the pertinent parts that way sir the kegs could be kept dry and safe from accidental discharge in the tenders magazines til needed lt westcott added now the next sheet sir depicts the interior appointments and the lining and beam partitions to hold the dessicant dessicant lewrie puzzled thats mister mainwarings breakteeth word for blocks bags of sodium chloride salt sir merriman said chuckling very scientific that for stuff thatll soak up humidity and any leaks theres another humidity westcott stuck in winking see how much were learnin lewrie japed right back damned if the interior sketches were not merely fine builders plans but they had done threequarterview drawings too shaded in varying tones of light and dark as meticulous as a woodcut illustration printed in a reference book or a serious newspaper article i did not know that you two were such talented artists lewrie praised them leaning far over the table to admire their work well sir the rough preliminary sketches were my work but mister westcott is the real draughtsman merriman confessed indeed he is lewrie exclaimed leaning back i once asked if he was musical and when he said no i assumed his true talent lay in seafaring and women lewrie reminded himself most definitely women but i spose we all have our sidelines tkeep us occupied in our offwatch hours lewrie went on thank you sir lt westcott said grinning and bowing at the waist whilst seated george here though wrote the proposal and i dare say that you will find it equally meritorious captain merriman has a way with words its included sir merriman said almost shyly i look forward treadin it lewrie said but once cocked and all what happens to the boats crew and how many men as to the second sir if i may we estimate that only one midshipman would be required to command and steer the boat in sir lt merriman replied shifting in his chair to scoot closer each of the boats would need two hands to tend the sails then spell the mid for as long as it would take for him to start the timer and cock the pistol then as to the first matter sir we envision that each explosive boat would need a gig or jollyboat to trail it in then take off the crew once the tiller is lashed and the sails trimmed for the last time lt merriman explained though it is possible that if a flotilla of boats are launched only three or four oared and masted barges could recover all the hands from a round dozen a lieutenant or two to command overall sir and take charge of the recovery boats lt westcott added with a shrug umhmm lewrie said in appreciation looking up at the overhead and deck beams for a moment given the risk of losing the both of you to this proposal should admiralty approve it it must be sent on to them at once secretly but speedily ill read the proposal this evening then call upon the dockyard commissioner first thing in the morning to have the drawings and all forwarded to london by the fastest most secure courier along with my own strong recommendation for the plans urgent consideration what bloody good my backind do well lewrie scoffed as he patted his hair and tossed his shoulders and hands up in a shrug of his own at least well get it put forward and see what theyll make of it one way or the other all we ask sir merriman enthused thank you for approving sir lt westcott seconded were sure that this is a much more useful idea than what weve seen so far good god mister westcott lewrie barked in amusement what aint and congratulate mister mainwaring on his jape about salt chapter thirtytwo reliant spent another two idle days anchored in the great nore with no orders and lewrie was just about to let the ship be put out of discipline for fortyeight hours when another grimfaced admiralty courier turned up with a fresh set of sealed orders marked captains eyes only he signed for them bade the courier a good journey back to london then went aft and below to read them good god who do i have to murder tget out o this lewrie gravelled once hed opened the beribboned and waxsealed packet he was required and directed to make the best of his way to portsmouth dockyard for further trials this set of orders was even shorter and more enigmatic than those that had preceded the trials with the cask torpedoes evidently people at admiralty worried that letters of too verbose or revealing nature could be intercepted by french agents in england or treasonous britons in their employ there was a second onesheet letter from the honourable henry legge a fellow billed as commissioner without special functions a title new to lewrie thatun was just bloody galling choice of mersea island and the blackwater river estuary an imbecilic choice resulting in widespread panic among his majestys subjects ye didnt tell us where ttry em out in the first place ye nitpickin lewrie fumed under his breath had the cask torpedoes functioned as designed in your rash and precipitate attack upon the french invasion fleet then gathered at the mouth of the somme the nature of future attacks en masse would have been revealed to the foe prematurely as would the existence of said torpedoes which the lords commissioners for executing the high office of admiralty severely and strictly charged you to protect at all hazards ye said ttry em out on the frogs damn yer blood lewrie spat somebodys tryin tcover his arse he opened his desk to fetch out the original set there it was in blackandwhite as plain as the canvas deck chequer he was to conduct trial implementation of the damned things against french harbours and gatherings of invasion craft due to the extremely secret nature of the devices it is not feasible at this time to warrant formal charges laid against you at this time lewrie gawped theyd considered hauling him before a courtmartial board for doing what hed been ordered to do in the first place upon reading you will destroy this letter and your previous orders to prevent any knowledge of the devices existence and upon arrival at portsmouth you will turn over your latest set of orders directing you there to continue trials to the port admiral for his safekeeping the bloody hell i will lewrie agrily whispered rolling them all up into a tight cylinder and rewrapping them with the ribbons attached he shoved them to the back of the lowest locking drawer in his desk sure that he might need to present them if a time came when the torpedoes were perfected and used in mass attacks the secret would be out and they could put him to courtmartial damn em all lewrie grumbled then took a deep breath before donning his coat and hat and going on deck the first officer mister westcott was by the first larboard pounder on the quarterdeck in his shirt sleeves a sketch pad and a charcoal stick in his hands chatting with the purser mr cadbury who was seated upon a second pounders breechend mumbling to himself as he balanced his books in the fresh air and mild midmorning sunshine good morning mister westcott good morning sir lt westcott replied abandoning his artwork may i see damme but for the lack of colour thats reliant to the life lewrie commented is the ship ready for sea in every respect mister westcott well aye sir westcott replied looking puzzled there are a few items to come aboard from the dockyard and the chandlers sir the purser stuck in with a worried look on his face paid for or promised mister cadbury lewrie asked on order sir but not yet paid for the purser replied you can make up the lacks from portsmouth sources lewrie said were ordered there instanter i see the winds are from the west roughly sir aye westcott said looking up at the commissioning pendant atop the mainmast then taking a quick squint about the harbour we do have a workingparty ashore though captain recall them at once stow away whatever it is theyre there for then get the ship under way by noon lewrie ordered paying off from the winds once the anchors were up would be an easy chore as would the long starboardquarter slant out to sea to turn roughly westsouwest to make passage to portsmouth though that would be a long hard slog almost into the teeth of the winds and take at least a day more with a night spent standing off and on the coast til it was light enough to attempt an approach into port ill see to it directly sir westcott vowed in his best uniform with sash and star of his knighthood and the cape st vincent and camperdown medals round his neck lewrie reported to admiral lord gardner ashore with some trepidation it must be admitted since lord gardner was reputed to be a dyspeptic and irascible officer of some age a tetchy man who did not suffer fools at all gladly and lewrie had heard some described him as composed of paper and packthread stay tape and buckram for his overattention to every little detail no matter how niggling lewrie was forced to sit and wait in the great mans anteroom for an hour before being allowed an audience and you are who sir admiral lord gardner testily enquired as he gave lewrie an upanddown inspection captain sir alan lewrie my lord the reliant frigate i was ordered to portsmouth and told to deliver my orders for transfer from sheerness to you for safekeeping lewrie replied you waste my time with this sir lord gardner snapped most popinjay captains announce their arrival to me by letter uhm its a matter of secrecy my lord concerning trials of certain ah devices lewrie tried to hint what sort of devices gardner sourly demanded secret you say well my lord if you have not been told of them i cannot dsecribe them to you lewrie answered no one not engaged with them is to be allowed to bedamned if you cannot sir what sort of foolishness is this tripe niles niles come here at once i say theres a lunatick in my office ravin about secret devices gardner erupted then hailed for an aide at the top of his lungs too might as well give it to the town criers too lewrie thought with a wince yoohoo frog spies harkee tthis a door to a side office adjoining opened and a geniallooking postcaptain who looked to be in his early fifties entered his brows up in query you called my lord this imbecile what the devils your name again this officer claims hes ordered to give me his transfer order to keep it secret and goes on about devices lord gardner ranted alan lewrie sir lewrie offered hoping that this new fellow knew more than his superior the reliant frigate guessin the name of your own ship sir lord gardner sneered lewrie lewrie lewrie the postcaptain muttered reliant aha he concluded with a snap of his fingers may i see them sir lewrie handed his orders over whilst the newcomer hummed a gay tune under his breath as he read them sir alan sir the postcaptain said at last stepping up to offer his hand george niles flagcaptain and your servant sir and i am yours captain niles lewrie responded in kind fraid hes the right of it my lord captain niles told his superior those infernal things built at gosport captain lewries the goat charged with their testing and admiralty does wish us to see that his orders are kept safe lest bonaparte get the slightest inkling of their existence all very mums the word then why could he not just say so lord gardner snapped i expect hes cautioned to not say a thing about them to anyone not aware of them to begin with my lord captain niles jovially informed the port admiral the fewer in on the things the less odds that someone would blab my lord does admiralty not trust me niles lord gardner yelped still wroth and in high dudgeon merely need to know my lord captain niles poohpoohed to calm the fellow ill see to captain lewrie if i may sir there are his orders here to file away more like squirrel away if you will come into my office sir i do believe there are separate orders specific to your ah mysterious duties thank you for rescuing me sir lewrie told niles once they were in his side office with the door closed on the port admirals his bark is much worse than his bite sir alan captain niles told him with a sly grin unless one deserves a nipping and then he can latch on like a bulldog and gnaw a limb or two right off ha ha yes i have them here sir captains eyes only and all that nonsense here you are sir lewrie took the foldedover waxsealed and ribbonbound letter from niles which was also marked most secret and confidential in bold writing do you know what its about sir lewrie dubiously asked even if i did id forget it the moment you leave my office sir alan niles said chuckling i will admit to curiosity though you are not the first officer to call upon us with secret orders waiting for him you know the other fellow captain well i gather you and he are to work together on whatever it is that our lords commissioners deem so vital mind i forgot him and his packet as soon as he left my office too ha ha then i shall be on my way at once captain niles so you may forget my arrival as well lewrie japed goodbye then captain whoever and good fortune niles said with another sly look and a glad hand lewrie was back aboard reliant just a tick before of the morning and got himself comfortable before opening his newest set of sealed and secret orders with a tumbler of cool tea with lemon juice and sugar near to hand he broke the seal and read them they were much like the first when hed learned of those cask torpedoes he was required to take upon the charge and command of the trials to serve as escort and guardian of the hiredinforthepurpose collier penarth commanded by one lieutenant douglas clough penarth aint that welsh he puzzled with a frown sure tbe if shes in the coastal coal trade and this douglas clough a scot lord i hope hes better than the last two i think penarth is close tcardiff aid to the best of your abilities the officer placed in charge of the trials no it cant be midshipman grainger sah the marine sentry bellowed enter lewrie bade quickly stowing away his letter captain sir there is a boat coming alongside with a postcaptain aboard mr grainger told him the first officer has been alerted and the sideparty mustered i will come on deck mister grainger thankee lewrie said already almost sure who it was that had come calling he arrived on the quarterdeck standing near the beginning of the starboard sailtending gangway and the entryport waiting to see if his suspicions were true as the upper tip of the standing dogs vane on the callers hat peeked over the lip of the entryport the bosuns calls began to tweedle the hastily gathered marines and sailors saluted and a grim jowly face emerged beneath the hat then the upper body of a stocky paunchy postcaptain who wore his own hair in a grey fluff either side of his ears with a long oldstyle seamans queue over the back collar of his coat capm joseph speaks come aboard to speak with your captain lewrie the fellow announced in a loud voice as he doffed his cocked hat to one and all scowling or grimacing most uncongenially welcome aboard reliant sir lt westcott rejoined welcome captain speaks lewrie seconded stepping forward with his own hat lifted so thats what he looks like he thought capm lewrie speaks said tautlipped drawing out lewrie a second time as if in disgust aye sir lewrie replied blandfaced where in the hell are my bloody iron stoves speaks barked chapter thirtythree honest tgod sir thats the last i saw of em lewrie told the older fellow as they sat in reliants greatcabins with a pitcher of cool tea before them on the low brass hindoo tray table before the starboardside settee what pridemore did with ems his doin and i havent a clue where he or the stoves are now thermopylae was sent off to the east indies last may when the war started up again captain speaks gravelled and pridemore one of her standing officers went with her what the devil anyone would need heating stoves in calcutta or sweatypore boggles the mind but someone owes me for them he doggedly insisted its possible that pridemore leased a couple to the standing officers of other laidup ships sir lewrie speculated or sold em outright expectin that youd not recover they couldve gone to a scrapiron monger or the dockyard offices on the sly but i you have been in touch with my solicitor in london mister mountjoy all standoffish pettifogging and legalese captain speaks said almost snarling look here sir we can settle this like gentlemen theyre worth fifty pounds each on todays market they were worth thirtyfive pounds when you bought em sir lewrie gently objected sure he was getting gouged noted theres a war on sir speaks snapped back the price of irons up and civilian iron goods are in shorter supply so did i wish to replace them thats the going price you give me a noteofhand for two hundred pounds and well call it quits and itll be up to you to redeem the sum from that sharppracticed nipcheese pridemore sue him in a court of common pleas i am bein gouged lewrie felt like yelping and hows your parrot sir lewrie asked instead to delay his agreement which he would have to make still gabbin away hellishfine and of no matter sir captain speaks rejoined i hate to state it this way captain lewrie but i am senior to you by five years on the navy list and your immediate superior in this endeavour with the torpedoes so consider how much better we will rub along with each other with the debt settled without my having to take you to common pleas hey but it wasnt my fault lewrie insisted immediately thinking how lame that sounded as if he was back at a school from which he was not yet expelled you trusted the wrong person and yes it is speaks growled oh very well lewrie said after a long moment and a great resigned sigh he could afford it after all it wasnt like the loss of two hundred pounds would leave him skint he took a long sip of cool tea to slake a suddenlyparched throat rose and went over to his desk to scribble out a noteofhand to speaks youll still have to send this on to mountjoy in london hes my shore agent and estate agent he told the testy older fellow theres not a jobber wholl give you full value in portsmouth theyre all retired pursers he wryly japed he fully expected that speaks would hand his note to a local banking house get his money in full then they would send the thing on to mountjoy whod turn it in to his bankers at coutts and everyone would be square here you are sir he said as he returned to the settee captain speaks took it squinted hard at it as if suspecting a ruse then grunted nodded in satisfaction and shoved it into a side pocket of his uniform coat youd done that at the very beginning captain lewrie and we would have each saved a pretty penny on stationery and postage the heavyset chap commented baring his teeth for a moment in a triumphant grin now sir you know what a torpedo is weve just finished a round of trials with cask torpedoes as designed by a mister cyrus mactavish sir lewrie told him and an awful waste o time and materials they were good then you understand the basic concept speaks replied what we will deal with are catamaran torpedoes a different kettle of fish entirely catamarans lewrie said sounding highly dubious catamarans were workstages used alongside a ships hull to scrub clean or paint to tend to the maintenance of channel platforms deadeye blocks and mast shrouds they were little more than two great baulks of timber for buoyancy with planking nailed across them much bigger than the casks of which you speak sir and with much more powder aboard than that upstart american mister fultons copper sphere torpedoes speaks informed him thats why weve the penarth shes all sorts of capstans windlasses and standing jibarms for unloading tons of coal in cargo nets at one go shes an old and ugly bitch but shell suit my purposes our purposes rather what the devil are they like sir lewrie enquired hoping to get down to business and put the money out of mind and that captain speaks would be fairminded enough to consider the matter over and done as well when hed replaced him thermopylaes officers and warrants had spoken highly of him and his concern for the hands welfare the fellow was touted as the typical firm but fair sort are all your officers and midshipmen aboard at this minute captain lewrie speaks asked instead all but my first sir lieutenant westcott lewrie told him damme recall him at once speaks ordered itd be better were they all on hand for a demonstration all together so we do not have to go over it in dribs and drabs westcott wont care for that lewrie thought with a tiny secret smirk hes mostlike up to his ears in some chits tits by now did he leave his whereabouts i cant recall ill see to it sir though it may take some time to hunt him up lewrie said lieutenant westcott said he had relatives down from home and may be showin them the sights a fib not a lie that no later than four bells of the day watch then captain speaks demanded or on your head be it what aye sir lewrie answered thinking that this sharptongued and impatient man was not quite the genial and easygoing speaks that had earlier been advertised faulkes lewrie asked of his clerk did mister westcott leave his shore address with you yes sir pass word for my boat crew and go ashore and recall him do express my sincerest apologies but he is needed back aboard at once yes sir eaulkes replied eager to get off the ship for two hours or so himself good taste in cabin furnishings lewrie captain speaks said after faulkes dashed out quite comfortable id imagine that sounded like a backhanded condemnation another way to say that lewries greatcabins were a touch too fine not the spartan barebones indifference to personal comfort expected by the navy thankee sir lewrie said watching speaks rise and go aft towards the transom settee you carry your wife aboard sir speaks asked espying that wideenoughfortwo hanging bedcot i am a widower sir two years ago lewrie told him with a slight disapproving edge to his voice good god are those cats speaks further growled spotting toulon and chalky curled up together on the coverlet mousers id hope passingfair at it sir but mostly company lewrie replied youve your parrot ive my cats theyre nigh mute but amusing i despise cats speaks huffed cant abide them give me a good dog now thats another matter what elsell he find fault with lewrie sourly wondered your ship sir captain speaks said turning to face lewrie when i came aboard she looked shipshape and bristol fashion we try tkeep her all tiddly sir lewrie blandly said i find that the french make that difficult now and then so much like my old thermopylae captain speaks said seeming to mellow at the mention of his last command of the same rate and weight of metal you were at copenhagen it sounded like a petulant accusation aye sir got a chance to fight her speaks said with a grunt we did sir and went up the baltic to scout the state of the ice and enemy harbours on our own lewrie answered we rejoined the fleet the night before lost good mister ballard speaks sadly mused pacing about the cabins as if they were his own arthur was an excellent first officer to me would have made a fine captain had he lived i liked him very much though you didnt know him as long as i he was my first officer in the alacrity for three years sir in the bahamas tween the wars lewrie interrupted he goin tblame me for that too lewrie angrily thought i did not know speaks gruffly said well sir be sure to be aboard penarth by four bells and lieutenant clough and i will show you what were to work with and familiarise your people with the procedures very well sir ill see you to the deck lewrie offered as he went for his hat which hed left on the dining table no need sir captain speaks quickly said i might take one or two minutes to savour being aboard a frigate again youd wish a brief tour sir lewrie asked no no dont wish to bother your people speaks insisted no bother at all sir and since im goin on deck too lewrie said but speaks was already halfway to the doors to the weather deck he had to trot after him then pass him as speaks idled on the outer deck between the guns lewrie was at the top of the gangway by the break of the quarterdeck by the time speaks made a slower way up the ladderway sideparty for departure honours mister houghton lewrie ordered his senior midshipman from the corner of his mouth captain speaks paused at the top of the ladderway hands in the small of his back and gazing forward to the forecastle taking in all the bustle of reliants hands the mathematical exactitude of all the yards and maze of rigging speaks heaved a deep sigh which came out as a throatclearing grunt then became all businesslike as he doffed his hat in departure the bosuns calls tweedled muskets and swords were presented to see him over the side right to the last moment when the dogs vane of his hat dropped below the lip of the entryport poor old shits jealous by god lewrie told himself i have a command and he dont not a realun captain joseph speaks would have recovered from his pneumonia by april of but admiralty had not offered him another warship and then the peace of amiens had kept him ashore on halfpay midmay of last year had seen at least an hundred ships put back in commission but none of them were his and when finally recalled to active service what had he gotten not a frigate or warship commensurate with his seniority but a project no wonder hes turned sour as crabapples lewrie realised chapter thirtyfour before boarding one of reliants cutters for the long row out to penarth lewrie had time enough for a private moment with lieutenant westcott should captain speaks make mention of it some of your family are down to portsmouth to see you mister westcott lewrie muttered to him which took you ashore he might have a down on ye else thank you for covering for me sir westcott said with a wide grin not one of his usual quick flashes and was a good time had by all lewrie japed with a leer all did sir lt westcott cheerfully confessed and wed have had a better had faulkes not found me the ladys most obliging and fetching a recent widow of an apothecary sold up the business to another but didnt manage to gain all that much security thank god she can still afford to send the son off to a schoolmaster with his dinner pail hours and hours on her hands alone most days and yours on her lewrie told himself chuckling at the image whatever shall i do with you mister westcott lewrie teased swear im an abstinent and celibate christian should bullybucks come and ask for me sir westcott rejoined and that im not here penarth was a twomasted brig fitted with shorter mast stubs to serve as crane supports one aft of her foremast the other forward of her mainmast from which jibarms could swing she had much more freeboard than fusee the result of a much deeper hold for the coasting coal trade and slabsided with none of the tumblehome designed into warships to reduce topweight her boarding battens were vertical and a hard climb right over her bulwarks to an inboard set of steps with no proper entryport welcome aboard sirs her captain said lt douglas clough was indeed a scot but without a highland sawney accent he was redhaired and palecomplexioned though his hair when he doffed his hat frizzy and tightly curlywavy clough was an oddlooking bird for his forehead receded at a pronounced slant from a heavily beetled ridge of brow his large stubby nose almost matching the angle of his head so that it appeared that they were one precipitous slope captain speaks has spoken has explained the nature of the catamaran torpedo to you sirs he asked only that they are a form of torpedo sir lewrie said for all lets show them clough captain speaks grunted this way sirs we keep them in the hold out of sight nice and dry til deployed if you will all follow me clough bade someone had done some modification work on penarth to lengthen her main midships hatchway perhaps turning two into one and removing some crossdeck bracing timbers they clambered down yet another very steep ladder into the belowdeck gloom lit only by a pair of lanthorns built like the light rooms found in a warships powder magazines here they are sirs lt clough proudly announced pointing to two large boatlike objects one to either side of a narrow aisle running foreandaft the objects were covered with tarred canvas on the outside tapering bluntly at either end and put lewrie in mind of gigantic cigarros of the same colour as aged tobacco leaf what are they midshipman rossyngton wondered aloud catamaran torpedoes young sir captain speaks snapped back weve eight aboard at the moment lt clough explained two here two more forward on this temporary deck and four more below in the lower hold a catamaran torpedo is twentyone and a half feet in length much like a ships boat in size three and a half feet in beam they taper to blunt ends with a slight rise alow and a rise aloft ha ha the main midsection is basically a sealed wooden chest with the interior lined with lead to make it waterproof and all the seams soldered to prevent any leakage once theyre in the water theyre flat on the bottom and the top though they do have a slight curve to their sides much better than any creation but fultons copper spheres captain speaks told them as if they were his own idea if theyre sealed sir how does one manage to set the timer and cock the igniting pistol lt merriman who had had more experience than the others with such devices enquired clambering up onto a cradle in which one of the torpedoes sat for a closer look see that standpipe in the top clough pointed out theres a watertight tompion at its mouth when one removes the tompion the starting lines are attached to it and all one has to do is give both a good hard yank and one is in business sir aye weve dealt with that before sir lt westcott said to their host but how do you set the clock you cant get a hand down that pipe theyre already set sir clough replied with a confident grin some for as short as fifteen minutes some for half an hour the pistols are loaded and primed as well mean tsay theyre ready tgo lewrie gawped aghast with a shrivel of his wedding tackle soon as you yank the cords sir clough told him and theyre already filled with gunpowder lt spendlove said with a worried frown with such a tiny access point as the standpipe sir there is no way to load them at the last minute captain speaks spoke up aye theyre loaded ehm how much gunpowder sir midshipman warburton asked fourty kegs young sir clough announced jesus one of the mids whispered all up they weigh two tons each captain speaks said we must use penarth and her stout hoisting gear to lift them out and put them in the water a twodecker seventyfour was not available he added almost making a jest a very dry one four hundred bloody pounds o gunpowder lewrie goggled horrified unconsciously he stepped back from the torpedo hed been inspecting but there was another of the monsters at his back he looked up to the patch of sky framed in the large hatchway most longingly as he tried to grasp the idea that he was standing amid thirtytwo hundred pounds of explosives all just waiting for a stray spark mactavishs poor cask torpedoes couldnt hold a candle to these set at fifteen minutes only lieutenant clough it would be necessary to tow them in quite close before releasing them spendlove the skeptic said his face grim even a strong tide run didnt take our previous experiment in as quickly as we wished unless they have a method of motive power youll be telling us about they float in on a making tide sir captain speaks grumbled the boatlike shape of their hulls is what will make them faster than any damned cask or set of spheres or theyll swirl endforend like twigs in a millrace was lewries skeptical comment or turn beamonto the tide like logs beamto the tide sir lt merriman added with his head laid over to one side in contemplation theres more surface area like a twodeckers hull freeboard for the tide to push against it might waft them in a bit quicker but drogues mister merriman lt westcott quipped with a wink and a fixed rudder perhaps sir merriman grinned back what the devil are you talking about captain speaks asked will the civilian designer or fabricator be sailing with us sir lewrie asked speaks im given to understand that he will not speaks told them frowning over whether that mattered busy building even more of the things i imagine why do you ask sir he asked rather archly mister westcott and mister merriman gave the matter a bit of thought after our first unsuccessful trials with cask torpedoes sir they came up with an idea for unmanned ships boats decked over and rigged to sail in lewrie explained these catamaran torpedoes are a form of boat as mister clough said a semisubmersed one i wondered if we could make some modifications to them without express permission from their designer or would we have to wait til whoever it is mulls our ideas over and approves them sir modifications captain speaks gravelled grimacing as if the word was a sort of blasphemy what sort first of all sir a fixed rudder at the ah whichever end one names the stern sir lt merriman eagerly contributed an oar or sweep extending from the standpipe down the top and over the end that might help them stay on course once released and a seaanchor rigged from the bowend deployed and allowed to fill and its towline to go taut before the torpedo is set free would drag the torpedo inward sir since one cant rig a mast and sail on it sir lieutenant westcott attempted to add but speaks cut him off short i am tasked we are tasked to make experiments with the torpedoes as built and delivered to us sirs speaks snapped we will make a go of what we have to work with we will prove them useful as they are sirs got that we do sir lewrie replied speaking for all again now should they not produce the desired results in their current form we might suggest improvements to their designer and the yard at gosport speaks relented and allowed a long moment later for now though lets be about the task at hand lieutenant clough and his people are ready for sea are you as well captain lewrie i am sir lewrie told him lastminute lading to be concluded by the end of the first dog today and we shall sail by dawn tomorrow the wind depending speaks ordered we shall be trying them north of the channel isles mostly off guernsey too damned close to spying french eyes for me but those are my orders we done gentlemen have mister clough and i satisfied your curiosity not in the slightest lewrie uneasily thought but was forced to say that he and his officers were ready and willing excellent captain speaks barked in happier takings leading the way to the weather deck fresher air and a dubious sort of safety ehm captain speaks seems deadkeen on them does he not sir lt westcott said once they were back aboard reliant and standing on the quarterdeck together a bit apart from spendlove and merriman driven lewrie glumly agreed cautious to not be heard making unfavourable comments about a senior officer it just wasnt done one hopes they go boom as advertised sir on time and all that westcott went on in a guarded mutter heaving a leery shrug if they dont one also hopes admiralty allows modifications if not i fear that captain speaks takes the project too seriously sir privately mister westcott we may think what we wish but for the hands well just to have to soldier on lewrie told him tapping a finger on his own lips make the best of it without quibbles growl we may but go we must aye sir westcott said with a resigned sigh itd be best did we not even growl sir lewrie japed aye sir aye sir two bags full westcott quipped back and clicked his heels together as he raised two fingers to his hat if they dont work and im pretty sure they wont lewrie thought as westcott and the others made their way below to take their ease for an hour or so therell be hell tpay and do we raise our suggestions again will speaks be desperate enough tlisten or will he snap all our heads off chapter thirtyfive i suppose this beats convoying sir lt westcott said before he departed the anchored frigate for his first taste of picking up one of the catamaran torpedoes to tow it in prime it and release it we may look back on those days as idyllic aye lewrie said off ye go then dont get yourself hoist by your own petard by god ill try sir ready mister houghton eager to go sir their eldest midshipman perkily replied ah the enthusiasm of the young westcott laughed the afternoon before they sailed from portsmouth they had seen captain blanding once again as modeste had departed for the downs to gather a fresh west indiesbound trade their old comradesinarms of last year parham in pylades and lt hyde in cockerel had sailed with him reenforced by a brace of brigsloops blandings twodecker flew a red broad pendant a solid red pendant marking blanding as a substantive commodore no longer a senior postcaptain so that might have been a goodenough sop to his ego along with his knighthood and baronetcy even if the duty assigned him would be sheer drudgery and frustration bound for the west indies in late summer too hed sail into the start of hurricane season by the time he arrived and mostlike would have to winter over or risk a lateautumn departure at the very height of the storm season dreadful as all that would be lewrie almost envied him coffee sir pettus asked once hed gained permission to come up to the quarterdeck he held lewries battered old blackiron pot by the bail and one towelled hand underneath it with a string of pewter mugs clanking together from his elbow aye pettus thankee lewrie answered taking a mug id take a cup pettus lt spendlove cajoled then here you go mister spendlove pettus cheerfully agreed black only what the french call noir lewrie went over to the starboard bulwarks to watch westcotts and houghtons thirtytwofoot barges row over to penarth which was anchored about two cables off one torpedo was already in the water and the second to be tried this morning was being hoisted out its grapnels at either endlewrie could not quite deem them bow or sternattached as soon as it emerged from the deep hold and rested on deck for a bit both ships lay westsouwest of guernsey and st peter port about two miles offshore anchored by best bowers and stern kedges to keep them beamon to the island though the holding ground was iffy and the strong channel tides were already in full flood making thighthick anchor cables groan in the hawseholes if a french warship did appear they would have to cut their cables and lose their anchors in a rush so that penarth and her secret torpedoes could escape and the frigate to engage the foe to save her lewrie would have liked them to have remained under way for the first trials or at the least come to the wind fetchedto but captain speaks had insisted fearful perhaps that the tide would carry both ships into tooshallow water and take the ground right behind their own torpedoes or almost atop them when they exploded if they exploded the second torpedo swayed high over penarths bulwarks inching upwards and outwards in fits and starts as her crew grunted and heaved on capstan and windlass bars there was a goodly sea running and for a time it looked as if the colliers rolling would swing the torpedo so far outboard that the weight would overset her and god help the men tailing on the steadying lines to check those swings at last though the jibarms and forecourse yard dipped far enough to lower the torpedo out of reliants sight below her starbd bulwarks and lewrie let out a sigh of relief if the torpedo slammed against penarths hull hard enough would that set the pistol off he heard a long whew nearby and turned to see lieutenant clarence spendlove still with a wince on his face and his eyes wide perhaps theyd do better towed by the collier from the outset sir if they are as watertight as they claim them to be spendlove said with a dubious shake of his head anything but a flat calm then the sight of emd let the secret out of the bag mister spendlove lewrie said and scare the hell out of everyone in portsmouth and with good bloody reason there is that sir spendlove agreed chuckling a little he sobred quickly though if they prove successful and we launch them by the dozens against the french though sir by the hundreds what will the world make of them sir what will they say of us of great britain for using them that were clever or that the torpedoes are infernal engines frankly mister spendlove novel ways tblow frogs thell are fine with me lewrie told him with a wry grin and a shrug expressing disinterest in the worlds opinion the onliest problem i have with em is that none of the devices weve seen or heard described to us are worth a tinkers dam and if we do launch em by the hundreds well look hellishdesperate and the failured give us a black eye mark my words sir fail they will the duty assigned us well at least it keeps us from more convoy work and it does keep us close to port almost like daysailin or yachtin like the royal family fresher victuals aye sir spendlove said perking up a bit relieved to know that his captain somewhat shared his distaste for the devices if not for the same reasons as he held and nighdaily mail service mister spendlove lewrie added thinking of lydia stangbournes latest chatty letter lewrie took a sip of his coffee then wandered over to the larboard bulwarks for a bit grimacing at the sight of the bow and stern anchor cables slanting away at noticeable angles from the bow hawsehole and the taffrail hawse the wind pressed upon reliants hull on her freeboard and the tiderace shoved at her quickwork below the waterline together hed posted a midshipman at either cable to keep an eye on the angles and their tautness for the first sign of slippage but was still worried he looked up to the mastheads where lookouts were posted to sing out at the first glimpse of french snoopers they were alert intent on their portion of the horizon but silent so far so far so good he thought with fingers covertly crossed mister westcott and mister houghton are setting out from the collier sir lt merriman reported very good lewrie said returning to the starboard side he got there just in time to espy the two barges standing out clear of penarth lugsails and jibs squeaking aloft and beginning to fill much as lewrie had loathed going too far aloft since his midshipman days he had to with a telescope slung over his shoulder he mounted a carronade slide then its barrel to the caprails of the bulwarks and swung out into the mainmast stays and ratlines slowly and deliberately making his way almost to the catharpings below the fighting top boot heels snug on the ratlines and one arm looped to a stout stay he turned to face outboard and extended the telescope at first penarths masts were in the way before the two barges got a goodly way on and began to bound towards the island lewrie had to laugh out loud to spot both the beef to the heel lt clough and the stocky older gotchgut captain speaks high aloft in her rigging their own telescopes extended reliant was rolling making it difficult to keep the boats in his ocular the urge to pull out his pocketwatch to check the time and to keep his precarious hold aloft and keep the telescope aimed at the same time was a bit awkward but both barges were lowering their sails at last and hands began to haul the torpedoes in close alongside the antsized lt westcott and midshipman houghton clambered atop the torpedoes to remove those tompions both clinging for dear life to the standpipe as the things rolled and wallowed and the choppy sea broke over them in for a soakin and dry breeches once back aboard lewrie thought as he watched them scramble seconds later and they were in a clumsy rush back aboard their boats and in understandable haste to quickly get away from those nowprimed fourty kegs of gunpowder as they gained their boats safety each man displayed a bright yellow signal flag wigwagging to beat the band for a few seconds in sign that they were successful towlines were cast off and sails began to sprout tillers were put hardover and the boats began to ghost away from the freed torpedoes rapidly gathering way and coming about to beat full and by back towards penarth and reliant whats the rate of the tide mister rossynton lewrie called down to the midshipman he had posted with the chiplog ehm four and threequarter knots sir lewrie stayed in the shrouds long enough to make sure that the boats had made sufficient clearance from the torpedoes even if they malfunctioned and blew up prematurely then stowed away his telescope and carefully turned his body to face the shrouds and make his way to the deck it will be a long slog back lt merriman was telling midshipman entwhistle shorttacking home dead downwind of us is someone keeping the time lewrie asked safely inboard and on solid oak planking once more aye sir merriman told him by pocketwatches and glasses though we dont know which of our boats was in charge of the one set for a quarterhour or the halfhour merriman had a watch with a second hand as did entwhistle and a ships boy standing nearby had turned a set of sandglasses as soon as the yellow signal flags had been displayed the boy swiped his runny nose on his shirt sleeve almost dancing a jig as he divided his attention between the timing glasses and the sea shoreward impishly grinning in anticipation of a very big pair of bangs lewrie put his hands in the small of his back and paced along the starboard bulwarks to the taffrails and back chiding himself to act captainly and stoic for a rare once he tried humming a tune for a bit but thought that a bit too much a sham and left off he resisted looking at his watch again as long as he could then as soon as he pulled it from his breeches pocket there came a stupendous roar and he looked up to see what looked to be a mountain of seawater and smoke jut skyward huzzah the ships boy squealed hopping up and down in glee and huzzah from reliants crew most of whom were standing by the starboard rails or in the rigging like so many starlings on a bare trees limbs thats the quarterhour one to the minute ha ha lieutenant merriman gloated tremendous simply tremendous hey clarence he asked spendlove god look how tall and big a blast it is rather big aye george lt spendlove agreed rather glumly however it was released about a mile from shore as i adjudged by sextant and even with nigh a fiveknot tide to drive it it still only made half a mile by my reckoning spendlove had a slate covered with trigonometric equations he was a dabhand navigator and mathematician which he showed to one and all it appears that even this strong making tide is not enough to carry the things within range to do much real damage theres still the halfhour one merriman poohpoohed too taken with the seeming success of the first torpedo if it travels twice as far as the first we could see clouds of mud in the explosion in shoal water which would represent the depths of water in which the french barges and such are reputed to be anchored outside their ports and as lt westcotts and midshipman houghtons barges came alongside a quarterhour later the second torpedo exploded just like the first on time but roughly half a mile to starboard of where they expected it to drift it was impressively loud and tall but no one could espy any of merrimans expected mud some vagary in the tide perhaps lt merriman puzzled wide of the mark yes george but far short of where one would expect it to drift still too far offshore even released within a mile of the island lt spendlove patiently countered and in full view and gun range of the french batteries had we tried it out against them well perhaps captain speaks will let us try my drogues on the next batch merriman rejoined shrugging it off theyd be easy to rig up signal from penarth sir midshipman grainger reported it is to weigh anchor sir very well mister grainger ah mister westcott and how was your little jaunt lewrie asked his first officer as he came back to quarterdeck ye look a tad moist he teased him tis a soggy duty sir having to ride the back of the damned thing like a boy on an ox lt westcott wryly told him flashing one of his brief whiteteethed grins out of the boat into the boat i missed my leap and got soaked from the waist down yell have to let the wind dry ye off mister westcott no goin below for a change of clothing lewrie grinned as he told him for now lets get our anchors up and get the ship under way aye aye sir westcott ruefully replied i expect that my breechesll drain do i undo the knee buttons there were no more trials that day or for the next two for the winds and seas got up making the hoistingout of more torpedoes too dangerous the two ships stood offandon guernsey out to midchannel and back again in shifting winds rolling grey seas and nowandthen showers of rain it was only on the third day that the sky cleared and the seas abated allowing a full day of trials with four catamaran torpedoes two in the morning and two in the afternoon all four reliably blew up on time but nowhere near enough to shore nor anywhere near where they were expected to drift from the points at which they were released they stood back out to sea for the evening and penarth put up a hoist that lewrie was sure speaks detested he requested permission to come aboard reliant instead of ordering lewrie and all of his officers and mids to come aboard penarth for a conference well have all but the officer and mids of the watch to dine yeovill lewrie warned his talented cook maybe a good feedll make the fellow feel a tad better do your best not ten minutes later one of penarths boats made the crossing to reliant and both captain speaks and lieutenant clough were piped aboard sorry for the intrusion captain lewrie speaks began as soon as he gained the quarterdeck but weve too much to go over with your people whove handled the damned things take too many of them away from their duties what speaks added puffing from his clamber up the side and looking mortified that hed had to ask ill summon everyone but the sailing master sir lewrie said and welcome aboard it made the greatcabins cramped but westcott merriman and even the reluctant spendlove who had gone off with one of the afternoon torpedoes in strict rotation were there as were the midshipmen who had tried them out houghton entwhistle and warburton eight of them sat round lewries dining table whilst he jammed himself in at the head next to speaks using the chair from his desk from the daycabin there was tea and two bottles of claret on the sideboard weve proved that they work captain speaks began clearing his throat and speaking in a gruff voice full of seeming confidence everyone agreed on that point in terms of reliability of their timing and ignition mechanisms aye sir lewrie agreed sort of they do go off most impressively sir lt westcott added right then were halfway there speaks beamed rubbing his hands together now about why they dont seem to go in as quick as wed like or end up anywhere near where wed wish well speaks tossed off as if that was a mere quibble perhaps the reasons for that lie more in our imperfect hydrographic charts of the area with a lack of knowledge of what varies the expected straight runin of the tide than with the torpedoes themselves the admiralty is desperately in need of a proper office of hydrography after all all those captains journals sailing masters journals and observations stacked to the rafters in the basements ignored for years and years those that survive the annual floods of the thames that rise in the basements ha perhaps we should send ashore to guernsey for experienced fishermen to aid us sir lt westcott dared to suggest and let out the torpedoes secrecy to one and all no sir captain speaks said with a growl one brow up and leaning far back in his chair making it squeak alarmingly hardly a secret by now sir lewrie pointed out nigh tongueincheek i expect guernseys whole population brings their dinners to the shore to watch like a royal fireworks show now had we done the trials off lands end the lizard or the scillies there would be fewer spectators lt clough contributed the channel isles were admiraltys choice sir captain speaks gruffly rejoined not mine or ours better than launching torpedoes off the mouth of the somme hey captain lewrie or was that their designers choice to which you demurred admiralty orders sir lewrie told him stung by the gibe over the location of the first trials with mactavishs casks i still have them do you wish to see them sir hmm speaks uttered twisting his mouth to a grimace it is of no matter now sirs what may we do to increase the range and the accuracy of our torpedoes thats the matter at hand one might as well try to direct a sheep to graze northwards lt spendlove baldly stated though he did so in a calm voice without too much sarcasm do the french anchor row after long row of peniches and barges along their harbour moles and breakwaters a torpedo might end up alongside one of them sir but which one would be asking far too much of them in their present form i doubt even merrimans idea for explosive boats could choose a target any more than a fireship set loose to sail in on its own i think captain speaks does not intend that sort of accuracy sirs lt clough quickly interjected its more a matter of ending up somewhere alongside those long anchored rows instead of drifting a whole mile wide drogues lewrie said seaanchors tpull em in quicker and straighter though whatever variations in the direction of the tides the eddys and such might not a drogue pull them off course even faster clough wondered aloud his thick brow as furrowed as a wheat field well never know til we try lewrie said rudders too sir lt merriman stuck in looking eager again after the general gloomy tone of the gathering i dare say our carpenter and the bosun could whip something up in short order sir lewrie said turning to speaks poor old fart dont have a ship command and now it looks as if his projects a deadbust too lewrie thought as captain speaks hemmed and hawed and wiped his hand over his mouth lewrie felt certain that the catamaran torpedoes in their current form would sort of work if the yards built enough of them and the eventual attack on the main french marshalling port of boulogne used hundreds of the damned things at one go that might be enough success for admiralty and speakss career but if the old fellow was seen to use his wits and made improvements which worked even better there was a feather in his cap a pat on the back from admiralty and a promotion into a ship of his own will ye mention me in your report when merrimans modifications solve the problem assumin they do o course i could use some new credit in london too get that henry legge and courtmartial off my back lewrie speculated i suppose it would not hurt to try fitting the last two with drogues and perhaps one of them with a fixed rudder speaks grudgingly allowed after a long think weve what left mister clough one set for fifteen minutes sir one for half an hour that stout worthy replied excellent speaks enthused or pretended to he looked as if he was driven to sham zeal no matter what he really thought of torpedoes or their reliability or even the honourability of using them as weapons of war lewrie suspected that poor speaks was in over his head in a project he didnt have a clue about and might even hold to be a ghastly sneaking and atrocious idea but the torpedoes were all he had and he would prove them useful no matter his reservations even were they horrid wastes of materiel and money he would persevere to the last sticking post to prove himself worthy the afterend hoisting ringbolts sir lt merriman babbled on producing a lead pencil and a scrap of paper from his coat do we bind the tiller to either of those anchoring its end to the standpipe with a wood mast hoop from one of the barges lugsails umhum i see speaks gravely replied leaning over to peer at the quick sketch like a fixed sweepoar rudder exactly so sir merriman said chuckling but would it not wobble mister merriman speaks asked well hmm merriman frowned looking cockeyed at his idea if we nailed some small baulks of scrap timber to the torpedo they are wood chests after all yes we could nail baulks through the tarred canvas and outer planking say four inches thick and high eight inches long to make a restraining channel for the long tiller which wed still attach to the standpipe with a mast hoop pettus came to the table and leaned over to whisper in lewries ear then stood over to the sideboard to gather wine glasses for all the company youll stay aboard to dine sir mister clough lewrie asked his guests im told my cooks preparin bean soup roasted rabbit and a sea pie with apple tarts to boot delighted captain lewrie captain speaks replied turning to look at him very briefly now intent upon merrimans sketch to which he quickly returned once in place why not nail restraining boards over the brackets so the tiller wont hop out or slip free sir lewrie crooked a finger to pettus sir pettus said in a whisper leaning close again best see that the cats eat very separate tonight lewrie said with a slight incline of his head towards their senior officer ill see to it sir hes in a good mood for once lewrie thought pray god nothin spoils it chapter thirtysix drogues or seaanchors were easily cobbled together from the iron hoops of depleted ration butts or kegs which the ships cooper had disassembled and stored below one small hoop from a fivegallon barrico for the small end and a larger one for the main opening the canvas and the sewing work to bind the canvas cones to the hoops was done by the sailmaker and his mate and the bosun provided the oneinch manila for the towlines the ships carpenter with the bosun and his mate created the stabilising rudder device it looked damned odd for it had to mate to the flat top of a torpedo then curve to match the slope of taper along the afterend nailed in place in its brackets with a wood ring at the end that fit round the standpipe then doubled to hold a cutdown rudder off reliants jollyboat so it would not wobble the modifications were finished by midafternoon of the next day then borne over to penarth for fitting and the trials would come on the next morning tide flags mister merriman lewrie asked as he stood by the entryport to watch his boat crews board their barges mister cloughs idea sir merriman told him impatient to be about the trials with his improvements well tie them to the standpipe to show what time we pulled the priming lines and be able to see where they go at least for the experiment sir good thinkin lewrie agreed once set free i hadnt the slightest clue where they were til they went bang away with you mister merriman mister entwhistle have fun he wished them dont blow yourselves up lewrie wished to himself if they work better this time sir lt westcott said coming to his side as lewrie paced back to the centre of the quarterdeck we may have to buy more colliers into the navy else it will take better than three or four hours to hoist all eight out of the holds and ready them all for launching hmm hadnt thought about that part of it lewrie confessed come tthink on it i doubt if anyone else has either if we do end up launchin em by the hundred itd take a whole flotilla of colliers and ships boats and theyd have to anchor two miles off the french coast hours before the tide begins to make sacre bleu mort de ma vie vottever are zose anglais doing westcott scoffed quite cheerfully henri do you zink we should tell someone of zis or open ze fire wiz ze cannon on zese pests if theres a makin tide in darkness perhaps lewrie speculated with a leery grimace oh all this is nonsense and moonshine even if they work somewhat as desired its deployin em thatll be the rub it makes more sense that we just barge up to rangetorandom shot and fire away til the powder magazines empty the last torpedo was slung overside into the sea and the barges took them in tow today the trials were done under reduced sail not anchored so penarth did not block their view the barges sailed in towards guernsey til they were within an estimated mile and handed their sails for a minute or two through their telescopes lewrie and westcott could see people scrambling onto the torpedoes which were floating awash with the chop breaking over them tiny triangular red pendants sprouted a foot or so above the sea as lt merriman and midshipman entwhistle jerked the priming lines and replaced the tompions then the barges rowed out ahead of the torpedoes to deploy the drogues and tow them for a bit before letting go the drogues lines and rapidly turning away to rehoist sail and leave the immediate area soonest sand trickled through the quarterhour and halfhour glasses pocketwatches were consulted almost every two minutes and everyone who had access to a telescope peered intently from the starboardside shrouds or bulwarks the tiny red pendants shrank smaller and smaller as the minutes ticked by with some of the more enthusiastic boasting that the torpedoes seemed to be drifting faster this time and seemed not to be drifting too far off the section of the shore that had been chosen as a target can barely spot em now sir lt westcott muttered any time now on the first one mr caldwell the sailing master said squinting at his watch yes there it goes bwhoom followed the sudden eruption of flameshot gunpowder smoke and a great sprouting pillar of sea by a second or so mister spendlove lewrie asked turning to the second officer by my reckoning sir it went off on time yet still a halfmile short spendlove said after some quick figuring on his slate and do we take that stretch of shoreline from the white church and steeple on the left and the grove of trees marking the right end of a milelong target representing a line of french barges it seemed to trend larboard closer to the steepleend sir when it should have ended up closer to the centre we released from roughly the same place as the earlier trials on the same strength of tiderace over the same bottom influences we experienced before so theres no explaining it sir westcott said frowning in puzzlement for a moment but he perked up at last it seems though that the drogue pulled it closer ashore and kept it within the margins he said extending both arms to encompass the outer ends of that mile of shore now if the halfhour torpedo with the rudder behaves the same that one might come close to succeeding more long minutes passed then there sir midshipman rossyngton crowed leaping in glee the sea boiled of a sudden in a wide shallow hump that burst like a pusfilled boil spurting smoke and spray an hundred feet into the air yellowgrey powder smoke and white foam mingling a second later came the bawhoom from the gigantic explosion in the shallows i think westcott deemed it almost ashore and very close to the midpoint of the mile sir lt spendlove said in a flat voice as if the torpedos seeming success had awakened his initial misgivings again a fluke mostlike damme the bloody things might work after all lewrie grudgingly allowed if they do maybe theyll free us for other duties just thankee jesus he thought they work our parts done and someone else can go use em i still dont quite trust em they recovered their barges and lt merriman and midshipman entwhistle came tumbling back aboard in such glad takings that they could almost be said to dance jigs babbling away like magpies and before the barges could be led astern for towing penarth came slowly surging alongside within hailing distance with captain speaks at her larboard railings hoy reliant speaks shouted hands cupped by his face with no need of a speakingtrumpet that did the trick i will sail for portsmouth at once with the design drawings your first officer made congratulations to you and your mister merriman lewrie rest assured my report will be complimentary to you all thank you sir lewrie shouted back remain on station til i return with fresh torpedoes speaks ordered look for me off the noreast tip of guernsey in about ten days to a fortnight makin sure he gets all the bloody credit first lewrie sarcastically realised til then cruise independent and make a nuisance of yourself with the french speaks added hmm maybe not so bad at that lewrie thought more kindly youll not need escort back to portsmouth sir lewrie asked with no torpedoes aboard theres nought the french may learn sir speaks shouted over sounding very pleased and amused adieu and good hunting reliant thank you sir see you in a fortnight at the latest penarth sheeted home her forecourse and slowly began to draw away lewrie turned to his officers and mids well sirs he said we should make a nuisance of ourselves so lets be about it mister westcott mister caldwell we can be into the gulf of saint malo by early afternoon shape a course he said captain speaks has let us off his leash for a few days let us make the most of it aye aye sir westcott wolfishly agreed and get back to proper duties sir lt spendlove asked doin what a frigatess sposed tdo aye lewrie said with a laugh feeling immense relief and feeling rather wolfish himself chapter thirtyseven making a nuisance of themselves in the gulf of st malo was not as easy as it sounded however reliants draught of almost eighteen feet limited where she could go or dare go for only a few hours due to the dramatic rise and fall of the tides forcing her to venture no closer than two miles of the french coast far beyond the rangetorandom shot of her pounder guns besides other royal navy vessels were already in the gulf and quite successfully making nuisances of themselves vessels which drew much less water than she the bulk of them were small and light singlemasted cutters backed up by brigsloops or the rare threemasted fullrigged sloops mostly lieutenants commands with halfsquadrons or flotillas led by commanders in their sixth rates if reliant did meet with a larger warship commanded by a postcaptain an offer of help was turned down for the most part since all the aid the fifth rate gun ship could provide was more moral than substantial too far offshore to back up the blockading patrols or operations unless a french frigate of her own weight of metal emerged and so far none had what opposition the french had sent out had been chassemarees prames and chaloupes the gunboats purposebuilt to defend the armada of invasion vessels and those not too often either some people were having fun though swarming over the convoys of peniches and caiques trying to make their way to join the immense gathering at boulogne hugging the coast as close as the shoals sandbars and rocks allowed sneaking from port to port in short and breathless stages more enterprising young officers were leading their men ashore at night to cut out barges or set fire to them and the very bravest would row up the creeks or rivers to block the many canals or raid the small riverside shipyards where the invasion fleet was being built and reliant could take no part in that after a few days of fruitless prowling all lewrie could do was shake his head take a squint at point de grouin east of st malo and order reliant turned north for a return to guernsey and the open waters of the channel wishing his moreactive compatriots well though he did in point of fact envy the hell out of their shallower draughts their opportunities and even their lower ranks which could justify their active participation in such harumscarums if he could pinch reliant into hightide reach of the normandy coast he might find a chance for action off granville coutances lessay or barnevillecarteret or some other inlet or fishing port along the way if someone did not beat him to it first he did not know what awakened him the coolness of the night or his cats lewrie had rolled into his hangingbedcot round midnight in all his clothes but his boots and coat more for a long nap than anything else too fretted by the wind and sea conditions to imagine that he would drop off so soundly or quickly just after lights out at pm the winds had nighdied on them and the sea had turned to nearly a flat calm slowing the frigate to a bare three knots the air in the greatcabins was clammy and cool and his first thought was to pull up the coverlet or rise and close the upper halves of the sashwindows in the transom as well as the proppedopen windows in the overhead coachtop lewrie never left the lower halves open at night did toulon and chalky prowl and playfight in the dark it was good odds that one or both of them would tumble out some dark night they were both with him in the bedcot toulon the older blackandwhite was puddinged up atop his hip working his front paws and loudly purring chalky the younger mostly white ramcat was in his face when lewrie opened one gritted eye all he could see was warm fur though he could feel chalkys pink nose and whiskers brushing at his own nose and eyes what lewrie grumbled in irritation to be wakened so early in the wee hours cant i have the last hour we have tplay now far forward a ships boy began to strike the watchbells and lewrie let out a groan it was seven bells of the middle watch which ran from midnight to am while he usually wished to be awakened a few minutes before the change of watch this was a bit too premature right then lewrie mumbled gingerly shifting position and reaching out to pet both cats yawning heavily and stretching to ease stiffness with a frown he became aware of how still the motion of the ship felt of how faintly reliants timbers groaned as they worked almost as if she was securely moored in harbour his ears caught the creaks the squeaks of slack blocks and the slatting of sails as if there was no wind and he sat up quickly worried that his frigate was becalmed off a hostile shore possible prey to oared gunboats with those rumoured pounders in their bows he rolled out of the bedcot found his boots by tripping over them and groped about the top of the nearest seachest for his coat to don it and head for the deck he startled the nodding marine sentry who guarded his door dashed up the ladderway to the quarterdeck and looked about er good morning sir lt merriman exclaimed as startled as the sentry by lewries appearance i was just about to send for you captain the wind has fallen away the last halfhour and i believe theres a mist rising we still have steerage way mister merriman lewrie asked as he looked aloft for the commissioning pendant the normal indicator of the apparent wind but it was too dark to see it looking forward to the forecastle not an hundred feet from where he stood the lanthorn by the belfry looked fuzzy too barely sir lt merriman replied mister grainger just had a cast of the log and it showed a bit over two knots merriman went on to state that the wind was still out of the west but fading his crossbearings on the lights of granville off their starboard quarter and the lights of coutances on their starboard bows placed the frigate roughly six miles off the french coast with coutances and its inlets about eight miles ahead ah good morning to you sir mister merriman the sailing master mr caldwell said as he clattered up the ladderway to the quarterdeck did merriman send for you sir lewrie asked no sir i woke on my own and something just didnt feel right just afore seven bells was struck caldwell said how odd me too lewrie said wondering if after all of his twentyfour years in the navy he had finally gained a seasense misty caldwell commented lifting his chin to sniff there will be a fog i fear sir perhaps even a shift of wind i will confess my lack of experience in the channel environs mister caldwell lewrie said but in your experience is this millpond sea scant wind and fog normal all together sir damned rare i warrant even eerie mr caldwell told him his head cocked to one side in frustration winds died lt merriman pointed out as the main course sail ahead of them went limp and the spanker overhead sagged with its long boom creaking lewrie could barely feel even the faintest breath of it on his cheekthey were becalmed no helm sir mr baldock quartermaster of the watch on the double wheel announced she aint bitin no more to prove that he spun the wheel to either side which did nothing to shift the compass as reliant coasted along on course slowing shedding the inertia that her long hull imparted oh lt spendlove exclaimed as he came to the quarterdeck to relieve merriman a few minutes before eight bells good morning to you all egad sirs a flat calm is it and a fog mister caldwell assures us soon to come merriman told him with a grimace well dispense with scrubbing decks gentlemen lewrie said striving to put a calm face on things we will go to quarters right after the peoples bedding is stowed when the galleys got breakfast ready well let the hands below by watches but keep the guns manned well not be surprised by something froggish at short range right if caldwells right and there is a fog lewrie thought if its a good thickun we cant see them but maybe they wont see us chapter thirtyeight after an hour or so the winds returned the faintest zephyr off the land sometimes from the east then backing into the soueast for a few minutes allowing reliant to stir to ghost ahead on her former course of due north barely fast enough for the rudder to bite it was a landbreeze for the sea was much cooler and shed its gathered heat more quickly than did the shores the rocky hills and the land of france and even before the landbreeze arose had come the fog and it was as thick as a handbeforeyourface london peasouper before the sun had risen the fog had become so thick that the belfry lanthorn and its crispness had been turned to a vague blob of light and even the larger taffrail lanthorns right aft on the quarterdeck had gone feeble lewrie had gone below long enough to scrub up fetch the keys to the arms chests and his own weaponsfind his hat and boatcloakthen returned to the deck to slouch in his collapsible canvas slingchair now and then peering aloft at the commissioning pendant now all but lost in mist not darkness now and again once the sun was up a bank of fog would roll over the ship a bank so thick that he couldnt make out the forecastle much less the jibboom he breakfasted later than the hands taking only a bowl of oatmeal with strawberry jam and mug after mug of coffee with goats milk and sugar and a fairly fresh piece of ships bisquit or two soaked for long minutes in the coffee to make them soft enough to chew and he fretted over his ships vulnerability the lack of speed with which to flee the thickness of the fog from which gunboats could come with not half a minutes warning lewrie tried to be the sort of captain that the navy demanded cool serene and stoic in the face of danger but that sort of pose was not in his nature never had been in the past and he freely admitted to himself might never be in future he had to rise at last and pace the quarterdeck hands clasped in the small of his back hidden by the folds of his boatcloak so no one could see them being wrung up the windward side which was his alone by right and long tradition cross the forward edge of the quarterdeck by the stanchions and nets now full of rolledup bedding and hammocks then aft down the lee side right to the taffrails flag lockers and the nowextinguished lanthorns before beginning another circuit he paused and looked aloft again ha lewrie barked he could see the commissioning pendant as it lazily curled could make out the maze of rigging sails yards and topmasts once more he could even see the tip of the jibboom aft he could see the two barges and both of reliants cutters under tow a halfhour before all he could see was the towing lines stretching out into nothing it seems to be thinning at last sir lt westcott said as lewrie joined him by the helm with the ship at quarters spendlove and merriman were at their posts in the waist surpervising the guns about bloody time too lewrie said with relief and evident enthusiasm ye can see outboard a long musket shot or better any idea where we are now by dead reckoning mister westcott uhm about here sir lt westcott said stepping forward to the chart pinned to the traverse board coutances should be abeam of us to windward windward mine arse lewrie japed zephyrward more like with this landbreeze and ebbing tide carrying us i have no idea how far off the coast we are sir sorry westcott added as he traced their course with a forefinger our last sure crossbearings put us six miles off and id imagine that weve made enough leeway to estimate that we might be eight miles off by now in midchannel twixt france and jersey aye lewrie agreed does this scant breeze allow we might bear a point more westerly i wouldnt want trun her too close to cape carteret and on due north theres cape de la hague beyond that he looked up to sniff the air and peer about then returned to the chart this has tburn off say by four bells of the forenoon and the windsll surely shift back from somewhere in the west so harkee sir mr caldwell barked did any of you hear that hear what mister caldwell lewrie asked puzzled i did sir midshipman munsell piped up over yonder the younker said pointing out to starboard his mouth agape and his eyes blared in alarm moooowa seamonsters quartermasters mate malin whispered to another fellow manning the helm hist quartermaster rhys snapped back moooowa came from the fog plaintive and hackleraising eerie answered a moment later by a second then a third and a fourth further off and fainter if any seals turn up well tow the ship out of here lewrie thought thats just spooky sea cows midshipman munsell shudderingly asked fog horns the sailing master exclaimed trumpets of some kind or someone yelling through speakingtrumpets where away lewrie snapped dreading the chance that there were what sounded like four gunboats out there trying to find each other moowa there sir munsell cried pointing off the starboard quarter i think moowa and that one sounded as if it was out to larboard out to sea of them as the other fog horns mournfully lowed lt westcott pointed at one and caldwell at yet another his arms outstretched to encompass a section of the fog swivelling his head and hands like an errant compass needle as his best estimate sir sir midshipman munsell was crying hopping on his toes in urgency i think i can see a light out there to starboard where the loudest one was without being ordered munsell sprang into the mainmast shrouds and scrambled up the ratlines a few feet there sir i do see a light a tiny one lewrie and the others peered out to find it on their own waving back and forth handheld lt westcott speculated like someone in a small boat a fleet of fishermen perhaps mr caldwell mused aloud so long as they aint gunboats lewrie thought this far off the coast sir westcott countered in such a flat calm with no wind were they fishing boats they would have had to set out from coutances or some other wee port very early last night to be caught by this fog in their home waters they know best lewrie scoffed i dont think french fishermend dare come out this far not since the war reopened our close blockade keeps em a lot nearer port as we saw in the gulf of saint malo it does look like a handheld lanthorn dont it so whatever sort o boat it is it cant be all that large lewrie gave it a long think then went to the break of the quarterdeck to look down into the befogged waist of the ship where his men sat round the guns ready to spring into action when ordered mister merriman he called down see bosun sprague and assemble an armed boat crew mister simcock he said to their officer of marines who had been idly pacing the starboard gangway behind the file of a dozen marines posted by the bulwarks and rolled hammock nettings id admire some of your men to go with mister merriman to see just whats out there and board it if its manageable very good sir lt simcock replied stiffening to attention and beaming at a chance to do something may i have coxn desmond and your boat crew sir lt merriman asked at lewries emphatic nod the third lieutenant turned about to point at desmond furfy and the rest summoning them to the gangway and the starboard entryport ill take one of the towed barges sir so well have room enough for the lobsterbacks very good lewrie agreed make sure youve a boat compass and mark your reciprocal course were not goin anywhere quickly so we should be easy to find he japed moowa wailed from larboard making lewrie swivel his head to find her in the impenetrable banks of fog and think that the source of that eldritch hooting might lay two points or more forward of abeam to reliant in for a penny in for a pound he thought mister houghton he called to their oldest midshipman i wish you to take the second barge and some marines and seek out the boat out yonder he ordered pointing off in the general direction that his ears had determined repeating his warning to take a good boat compass moowa sounded from larboard again in answer to a thin chorus of hornamplified hoots very far out to starboard reliant was in the middle of the mysterious boats slowly ghosting forward on the scanty wind if the sofarunseen boats were small fishing boats as mister caldwell first supposed lewrie could not imagine them being much over thirty feet in length with only a single lugsail his frigate sported acres of canvas aloft in comparison and once such a large ship got any way upon her her weight and much longer hull allowed her to coast onward when smaller boats would wallow to a stop and require a stouter wind to get moving once more they might truly be becalmed and helpless whatever they were not gunboats though no gunboats pray jesus lewrie thought moowa and hoo from all quarters some close most distant and eerie and lewrie took note of his idle gunners looking at each other uneasily a few of the ships boys who crouched down the centreline of the waist between the guns leathercased powder cartridges in their hands peering about wideeyed in fear it aint whales lads and it aint seamonsters lewrie told them as loud as he dared theyre frog fishermen mostlike lost in the fog and they havent a clue that reliants the fox in the chicken coop that seemed to satisfy most of the crew though not all both the barges are away sir lt westcott reported mister houghtons is almost out of sight not a musketshot off and the other is already swallowed up wish youd have sent me sir he added are they gunboats i need you here sir lewrie said if we end up seizing a couple of fishing smacks theres not enough glory in em why mister westcott lewrie posed with a grin are ye in need of favourable notice with admiralty one of your amours isnt some admirals daughter is she frankly sir but for the chance to be blown skyhigh by one of our bloody torpedo contraptions its been a dull summer lt westcott replied looking for a bit of honest excitement was my desire captain speaks will be returning with a fresh lot of catamaran torpedoes lewrie pointed out perhaps well actually employ em on the french under return fire and at close range be careful what you ask for mister westcott theres some honest excitement for you just so long as we are in action sir westcott told him with a hungry grin and a flash of his teeth lewrie paced back to the binnacle cabinet with his first lieutenant dutifully following him were making two and a half knots sir barely mr caldwell the sailing master reported his coat damp from supervising the cast of the log i was wondering about what you said sir that the local french fishermen would stay closer to shore and no stiff wind couldve blown them this far out where they might run into some of our ships on close blockade aye mister caldwell lewrie prompted feeling a shiver that he might be wrong in thinking that they had blundered into only small boats he was used to being wrong might the french have tried to sneak a convoy of invasion boats up the coast and got caught the same as us in this odd turn of the weather mr caldwell posed theres a good sheltered inlet south of us by avranches and saint hilaire he said referring to the chart for a moment were they building caiques and such in there they might have thought to sneak them as far as cherbourg in one night and if they are a convoy of invasion craft they might have an escort or two is what youre thinking lewrie asked him feeling yet another shiver of dread do we blunder up close to one sir perhaps theyll take us for one of their big threemasted prames lt westcott said shrugging moowa lowed from larboard once again sounding much closer to them than before followed by a thin voice quelqun labas allo houghtons boat must be upon it whatever it is lt westcott snapped going to the larboard side in more haste than officers of the royal navy usually displayed french for certain by god qui va la that distant voice came again caution or alarm in its tone qui vive more sharply and urgent that demand was answered by a volley of musket shots soft pops and cracks muffled by the fog from midshipman houghtons men or the french they could not tell but there came a human wail of surprise or pain and thin cheers whatever it is it sounds as if mister houghton thinks he can board it and take it sir westcott called over his shoulder even as he turned back to look outboard there came a few more muffled cracks too soft for muskets it sounded as if houghton his sailors and the marines might actually be aboard and close enough for pistolshots dear lord if theyve troops aboard mr caldwell cautioned doesnt sound like it lewrie said after listening intently for more clues there were no more shots and only one more chorus of cheers triumphant sounds before the day went still once more and he could not tell if it was british cheers or from the french who might have outmanned swarmed and overawed midshipman houghtons party to take them all prisoner all lewrie could hear was the groans from the barely swaying masts the tilting yards and reliants hull timbers more shooting sir from starboard the sailing master yelled lieutenant merrimans at it somethin orf th starbd bows a lookout shouted from the forecastle with the fog so thick they had kept nighttime deck lookouts posted as well as the day lookouts placed high aloft in the topmasts strange boat tstarbd close aboard it took a few more seconds for that strange boat to appear to the people on the quarterdeck first there was nothing but whiteness and fog then a faint and darker shadowy bulk that magically materialised only slowly taking solid form what the devil is that the sailing master barked as the oddity fully emerged salvation from that threatened courtmartial lewrie thought in sudden glee the french boat looked to be no further off than a long musketshot a twomasted thing with its lugsails and jibs hanging limp and the booms sweeping uselessly to either beam it resembled an inverted serving platter or shallow soup tureen with a long rectangular box on its back that ran down the centreline from the small cockpit to the rhinolike proboscis in the bow a beetle lt westcott deemed it sounding awed that was a fairenough first guess for near its forward third there were widebladed oars jutting to either side at least half a dozen on the larboard side that faced them and they were being worked like scoops to crawl it forward just like a waterbeetle that had lost most of its legs qui vive heu mort de ma vie the lone frenchman aft at the things helm wailed just aft of him at its taffrail stood a staff from which a small french tricolour windlessly dangled mister spendlove lewrie yelled to the gundeck take that thing under fire one of the biguns i think lewrie adjudged after a dash for the starboard bulwarks for a better look fourtyfive or fifty feet in length the type peel said could carry an hundred french troops as you bear fire lt spendlove cried in singsong even with the wood quoins fully inserted under the breeches of the guns the odd french invasion barge lay so low to the water that half the shots only scythed away the two masts and lugsails crashed clean through that long centreline box that should protect french soldiers and let them reload in shelter carrying most of it away in a whirl of shattered lumber it was the carronades on the quarterdeck with their screw adjusters under their breeches that could be depressed low enough to score solid hits and they were awesome they were pounders firing solid shot and they punched huge holes right through the carapace of the beetles back and from the parroty rrawkscreech sounds which followed the initial timberscreams on entry carried on at a shallow angle out the boats starboard side the french boats helmsman before being cut in two by roundshot had put its helm hardover and though the rest of its crew that had been manning the paddles had abandoned them and come rushing on deck the strange craft swung its bows shoreward coasting along on a scant momentum what little wind there was that moved the banks of fog blew the gunsmoke back into the faces of the gun crews as they swabbed out and began the ritual of reloading blinding everyone for long moments with thick yellowwhite clouds of sulfurreeking smoke by the time the guns were run out inbattery once more and the guncaptains could take aim the range was just long enough for surer aim as you bear fire lt spendlove screeched again thats better lewrie cheered thats the way lads before a fresh bank of gunsmoke blotted out their view again lewrie could see shotsplashes all round the boat close aboard its waterline and more holes punched into her larboard side and sternquarters overhaul tackle staunch and swab out lt spendlove was hoarsely ordering cartridges up sir sir midshipman munsell shrilled still at his post in the mainmast shrouds shes sinking sir shes sinking the french build em out o papiermache lewrie wondered as he leaned far out over the quarterdeck bulwarks to see for himself damned if the boat wasnt sinking instead of an upturned soup tureen the thing now moreresembled a largeholed colander with shot holes riddling its stern and larboard side there was no sign of the other french sailors who had dashed to the deck it was both down by the bows mostlikely dragged by the weight of the rumoured pounder bow gun and heeled over to starboard the result of the pound shot from the carronades the smashers that had gone completely through her hull to her starboard side below the waterline it rolled onto its beam ends revealing a clean new bottom but without the normal protection against barnacles weed and woodboring worms the french had not coppered her bottom the curve of the lower hull was shallower than the upperworks and most of its length was flatbottomed like a river barge they think to dare the open sea the channel in that lieutenant westcott hooted in derision as the odd alienlooking boat went down by the bows cocking its riddled stern in the air for an instant like a feeding duck then sank in a welter of foam and released air pray god they do mister westcott lewrie said laughing out loud with his arms outstretched in joy fetch em up to half a cable in clear weather and one broadsidell do for each when they come we can make a meal of em what was that sir mr caldwell asked a french secret weapon mister caldwell lewrie happily told him one that doesnt seem worth a tupenny shit theyre supposed to paddle themselves right onto a beach use that twentyfourpounder in the bow tclear the way and land about one hundred frog troops each then bonapartes dafter than i thought sir caldwell replied with a chuckle though he shook his head in amazement you knew of them sir westcott asked unofficially lewrie admitted some months ago before they saddled us with the torpedo experiments dye hear there strange boat off the starboard quarters a deck lookout aft by the transom shouted hoy reliant a voice shouted from the fog merriman here hold your fire were returning with a prize lewrie returned to the starboard bulwarks clambering atop one of the carronades slides for a better view another of the strange boats swam slowly into view its broadbladed paddles clawing at the sea all out of coordination and the first part of it that seemed completely solid from out of the thick fog was that snout at the bows that pounder ahoy mister merriman lewrie called back through his cupped hands is that bow gun loaded no sir theres no shot or powder aboard lt merriman gaily called back weve two prisoners one of them wounded and one of our marines slightly hurt coxn desmond is ready to pass a towing line when youre ready shes an ugly bitch aint she lads liam desmond yelled to the ship as he stood just beside that large gun with a heavy coil of line readied ant worth half a crown in prizemoney his mate furfy just had to add capering a jig on the boats sloping foredeck the hell she aint lewrie thought theres people in london at admiralty wholl turn saint catherine wheels tsee one close up the surgeon mister mainwaring came up from his surgery in the cockpit on the orlop accompanied by a party of loblolly boys bearing a pair of mess tables for stretchers as the odd boat and the borrowed barge came close alongside to transfer all the marines the two french prisoners and lt merriman back aboard we can take it under tow but that may slow us to nothing lewrie said looking up hopefully at the sails and commissioning pendant which still hung limp only its free end being lifted welcome back aboard mister merriman and congratulations on carrying out your action so briskly thank you sir it was simple really merriman said the thing loomed up we scrambled up the slope of the hull gave them one volley and cold steel and it was done the hardest part was climbing the slope whatever that thing is its only sixteen or eighteen feet abeam and it looks as if it rises about eight feet to the turtleback or beetleback ha ha a bit slippery he said with a glad shrug metalled hull was it lewrie asked hoping that it was not that box down the centreline armoured was it lord no sir just wood lt merriman laughed the box is made of oneinch deal planking over fourbyfour posts dye hear there another lookout cried from up forward a boat off the larboard beam tis another o the things stand by the larboard battery lt spendlove on the gundeck warned his gunners ahoy reliant barge number two with prize that you mister houghton lewrie shouted back with a brass speakingtrumpet this time aye sir permission to come alongside weve a wounded man and a prisoner midshipman houghton called out very well mister houghton lewrie agreed pass us a line and well try ttake you under tow weve a second prize tdeal with as well the fogs thinning to seaward sir and theres a bit of wind from the west houghton informed him as his capture solidified from the fog she could be made out nearly two hundred yards off about the range of lewries breechloading ferguson riflemusket with any luck the seabreeze would spring to life and would be strong enough for towing both prizes out on larboard tack one bound to reliants stern and the second bound to the stern of the first barge and alter course at last a bit more norwesterly and clear the french coast before the fog burns completely off lewrie schemed listen sir westcott pointed out it seems weve upset the french the mournful baying of fog horns had turned urgent and rapid more like a pack of hounds that had run a fox to its earth added to that baying were a couple of trumpets i didnt know the french were much fond of foxhunting sir lt westcott said with a laugh hear that tataratara yoicks tallyho there must be one sporting fellow out there it does sound like a foxhunt doesnt it lewrie mused are you a hunter mister westcott were smallholders sir just fiftyodd acres lt westcott said with a dismissive shrug so we only get invited the once each year and i never saw the point steeplechasing at the gallops more to my liking and i could do that any time in fact ive always felt sorry for the fox tried to make a pet of one when i was little and you can imagine how that played out he added chuckling fox kits and otter cubs my son hugh was mad for either or both lewrie rejoined with a laugh damn my eyes is that a breeze sir westcott said turning to look seaward then aloft not much of one but its from the west lewrie replied as he looked aloft to the sails which were rustling uncertainly trimmed to cup the landbreeze and now presented with one from the opposite tack hands to the braces and sheets mister westcott lets make the most of it and get a goodly way on her mister merriman here sir rig towing lines from the stern to one boat and another to the second lewrie ordered and have the prize parties take in those paddle things with an experienced helmsman in each aye aye sir once were trimmed to the wind mister caldwell shape course nornorwest so we pass between jersey and alderney lewrie told the sailing master once were out in the channel well take a beeline for portsmouth book v ye true honest britons who love your own land whose sires were so brave so victorious so free who always beat france when they took her in hand come join honest britons in chorus with me should the french dare invade us thus armed with our poles well bang their bare ribs make their lantern jaws ring for your beefeating beerdrinking britons are souls who will shed their last blood for their country and king popular tavern song circa chapter thirtynine anyone who was anyone in the navy wished to see the odd french contraptions once reliant towed them into portsmouth harbour the surveyor of the navy sir william rule and the deputy controller of the navy captain henry duncan came down from london to gawk and wonder in company with the port admiral lord gardner and the commissioner of hm dockyards at portsmouth captain sir charles saxton bart the foreign office sent down a functionary and there were some redcoat army types rather high in rank who evinced great curiosity about what sort of threat the landing barges might make there were representatives from the pitt government along with a select group of navy captains charged with patrolling the channel so they could recognise the damned things should they run across them in future lieutenants westcott and merriman prepared detailed sketches of the things several sets done by hand for no one wanted to trust the drawings to even a government printer and lewrie was on show for each curious visitor to explain their capture and how they handled in the open sea but if he had imagined a heros welcome he was greatly disappointed there was no celebration dinner no presentation sword or set of silver plate no band no parade through the streets with a cheering crowd or several dozen sailors replacing the horse team to draw him in an open carriage either and a fireworks show and a te deum mass at st thomas abeckets church were right out too the pair of boats that reliant had captured were hurriedly covered with great swaths of sailcloth and towed into an empty graving dock then placed under armed marine guard well damme captain lewrie but ye do keep popping up with one surprise after another admiral lord gardner commented after making a clumsy arthritic way aboard one of them in company with his flagcaptain niles theyve a lot of these things dye imagine the rumours say three or four hundred my lord lewrie said first that nonsense about torpedoes now these lord gardner went on peering down into the bowels of the barge where the soldiers would sleep sup and shelter three or four hundred did ye say so i was told by a friend in secret branch my lord this tour was the fifth that lewrie had given to various officials and it was getting old by then the lack of praise beyond the usual good show was irksome too he imagined that if nelson had come across them that famehungry fellow would have commissioned special editions of all the london papers with illustrations to boot damned waste of good artillery packing a twentyfourpounder in the bows lord gardner went on in a grumble do the french think they can use them as gunboats too wheel them round with those huge paddles i saw armed galleys in the mediterranean in my youth but it looks iffy to me concentrating all the paddles in the forward end too captain niles added i suppose they work well enough in a river but not at sea has anyone tried paddling them about once we made port sir lewrie told him with a grimace to shift them alongside they dont row worth a damn nor steer either theyre fitted with a tiller to the exposed rudder and my helmsmen about wore themselves out on the way here under tow tryin to follow the stern posts of the leadin barge or my frigate a handful o lee helm then a handful o weather helm we did hoist their sails to steady em but that didnt help much id imagine that did one try em under sail without bein towed theyd wallow from beamtobeam be slow as cold treacle and with their flat bottoms theyd make leeway like a wood chip heh heh heh the port admiral softly evilly cackled bending down to survey the interior more closely how many soldiers might it carry lewrie these large versions are said to carry an hundred my lord a shorter one may carry about eighty lewrie told him one hundred frogs cooped up down there on those benches or in those slat beds my my lord gardner said enjoying the image cold rations i see no galley facilities no heads either rations for five or six days i heard sir lewrie supplied though part of that might be for after they landed in england before they could loot and pillage the countryside or hope to bonaparte must not have much regard for his soldiers milord captain niles imagined if he expected them to use wooden buckets as their necessaries then have to pass them up from below the reek would be horrid he said with a sniff as if reeks already existed the staleness of the air lord gardner happily fantasised the reek of their cess as well niles and the stench of seasickness which would naturally engender even more sickness why after a day or two of that with these daft things wallowing like hogs in the mud and rolling like logs itd be a bloody wonder that they could fight at all right niles stagger ashore reeling like tars off a whaler thats been at sea two years running and be so cropsick even our militia can round them up milord captain niles hooted theyre a completely daft idea and if the french really mean to employ them theyll pay an ungodly high price in dead and in prisoners drown nigh a quarter of their men should the channel whip up rough during the crossing admiral lord gardner estimated looking highly pleased with his conclusion what was it that bonaparte was reputed to have said sirs give me six hours mastery of the channel and we shall be masters of the world bah bah i say lord keith in the downs estimates so large an invasion armada would take two tides to get across in sufficient strength milord captain niles gleefully pointed out twentyfour hours with the sea and tides scattering them sickening them and our ships clawing at them like so many tigers let them try is what i say congratulations to ye captain lewrie lord gardner said as he stood erect going so far as to offer his hand it was a brave thing to snatch them up in such a thick fog with no thought for the presence of escorts and to get them away for study well it seemed a good idea at the moment my lord lewrie replied shaking hands with the old fellow and trying to sound modest damme lewrie had you not already been granted a knighthood this deed surely would have earned you one captain niles said in praise as well well damned if it mightve lewrie thought feeling for the first time as if he had done something worthy of the honour instead of secretly scorning his sash and star as a sop given for his usefulness and the usefulness of his late wifes murder to ignite revulsion and hatred of the french and bonaparte long after the fact though niles lord gardner said dashing cold water on that speculation our possession of the damned things is to be of the utmost secrecy same as lewries torpedo devices least said the better what did the crown decide lewrie was worthy itd not be announced for years damme even weve been put on strict notice to forget we ever saw them and to not go blab to anyone they even exist do we dream about them wed best not talk in our sleep hah lewrie felt his ears reddening he had blabbed in letters at least to lydia stangbourne sir hugo his sons at sea and one of his inlaws burgess chiswick and had nigh broken his neck running to the post office to retrieve them before they left the dockyard offices if youve seen all you wish milord there are other matters pending the jovial captain niles prompted as yet another light rain began to fall oh aye ive seen quite enough niles lord gardner told his aide help me off this monstrosity before the weather turns even more nasty that involved an embarrassingly awkward clamber out of the after cockpit of the french barge down the slick slope of the upper deck and hull to the waterline where a jollyboat awaited to bear them the short distance to the dry stone cobbles and blocks of the upper end of the graving dock where they could step onto dry land getting on for autumn lewrie lord gardner said as he stumped his way towards the tall flight of stone steps that would take them to street level it will be october in a week and the weather in the channel might force bonaparte to hold his invasion til next spring where does the time go when were havin so much fun lewrie cynically thought now or never perhaps my lord lewrie said with a grin pray god by then well lord gardner agreed nettlesome as bonaparte is surely hell so worry some other continental powers that they form another armed coalition against him forcing him to take his huge army off to defend his borders or look to expand his empire somewhere else all our fears may amount to nothing good grief whats that about i wonder captain niles said as the sound of a loud argument reached them have they caught a french spy or a nosy newspaper man shoot either on the spot instanter lord gardner snarled as they reached the top of the stone stairs they could see that the marines had nabbed an intruder whod found a way through the newlyerected wooden screen wall and sailclothcurtained gate the marines had him pinned to the wall surrounded with fixed bayonets on their levelled muskets bloody hell do you mean i cant enter you puppy im a postcaptain in the royal navy captain speaks and i know that captain lewries in there i must speak to him at once and bedamned to you if you think oh bloody hell lewrie groaned sure hed seen the last of the fellow speaks speaks whos he niles lord gardner grumbled the mysterious torpedo fellow milord the one in charge of testing those gosport wonders niles told his admiral its all very hushhush theres entirely too much of that going round lord gardner tetchily snapped aint there just lewrie silently agreed there he is speaks barked pointing accusingly theres the fellow i must see damn your eyes sir he railed at the young marine officer in charge of the guard unit you did not stay on station as i ordered you lewrie i should prefer charges get in line lewrie told himself niles go tell that noisy jackanapes to stop his gob or ill have him stood against the wall and shot for entering a secret area i can have him shot can i not sir well ordinarily no milord but given the circumstances and the secrecy of our possession of the french devicescaptain niles mused aloud with a slyboots grin go threaten him into next year gardner demanded at once speaksll take his rebuke out on me lewrie mournfully thought yed think after bringin these things in id get fresh orders but am i still his damn his eyes chapter forty captain speaks refused to come aboard reliant he despised cats as sneaking vicious imps from hades the familiars of warlocks and witches no lewrie had to go aboard penarth the boughtin collier for his dressingdown where speakss own familiar his loquacious parrot ruled the after cabins speaks did not offer refreshments why did you not strictly obey my verbal orders lewrie the choleric fellow seethed seated behind the wee desk looking down his nose at lewrie with the fierce air of a lord justice regarding an habitual criminal about to be sentenced to hang you told me to go make a nuisance on the french coast sir lewrie calmly replied that we did and in the process we stumbled onto some secret french devices in a thick fog off coutances and took two of them and sank a third id been apprised tkeep one eye out for em and that should i encounter any i should secret devices speaks barked what sort of devices im afraid i cant tell you sir lewrie answered finding it too tempting to keep to himself theyre secret very secret and just who the devil or when were you apprised hah just before we began experiments with mister mactavishs cask torpoedoes sir as for the when lewrie went on seemingly seated at ease in a folding chair clubman fashion with one leg over the other as for who sir it was mister james peel of foreign office secret branch with whom ive worked in the past now and again he had had correspondence from sources in france alerting the government and admiralty that they existed i gathered that is his brief sir the recruiting and handling of intelligence sources keelhaul the bastard keelhaul rwark from the parrot and you deemed these things you captured were more important than our secret work lewrie speaks sneered i did sir lewrie firmly stated your orders charged you to safeguard penarth and her cargo of devices from capture by the french at all hazards lewrie at all hazards that phrase slip your mind did it speaks accused what do i find when i return to the rendezvous nothing no one to safeguard this vessel or her vitally secret weapons no aid in conducting fresh experiments either and no message left with the authorities at guernsey explaining why you just up and left and i couldnt very well commandeer another warship from the blockading squadron and expose the secret of the torpedoes existence to just any damned fool given the importance of my find though sir i acted as i deemed best lewrie insisted saucy rascal flog the bugger toowheep from the bird christ theyve been together so long they even think alike lewrie told himself the parrot had an eerily impressive vocabulary indeed forcing me to cancel experiments and return to portsmouth captain speaks said in a huff failing in my express orders from admiralty experiments which have become even more vital than before sir vital i tell you by god i really should lay courtmartial charges against you turn you over to admiral lord keith and let him deal with you so you can explain to him why the weapons that he intends to employ might be wanting lord keith commanded in the downs subordinate to admiral lord william cornwallis of channel fleet making lewrie wonder why speaks would prefer charges with him instead of cornwallis or admiralty directly weapons he intends to employ lewrie wondered these damned french things you brought in lewrie captain speaks said turning too mellow and chummy too quickly for lewries taste we both have access to high secrets what are they really i cannot reveal that sir truly lewrie insisted bosun lay on two dozen lashes rwark the parrot uttered prefaced and concluded with what sounded like a throaty and rasping gargle or catpurr as it paced along its perch have the french developed a form of torpedo lewrie perhaps anchored torpedoes speaks further asked almost cajolingly i can assure you that theyre not torpedoes sir but thats all i can tell you lewrie cautiously replied about admiral lord keith though he intends to employ catamaran torpedoes did ysay before the weather in the channel turns foul you will be informed at the proper time captain lewrie the choleric older fellow snapped seeing that the nature of lewries secret would not be forthcoming and keeping his own til the last minute he turned snippish once more thanks to you sir there will not be time for further testing and the catamaran torpedoes will be employed before their ultimate perfection and speaks gravelled levelling a finger at lewrie like a pistol barrel should they fail to achieve the desired results such failure will not be placed upon my head but upon yours sir for your lack of support to me despite our suggested improvements of drogues and rudders that drifted them quicker and straighter sir lewrie asked having a hard time stifling his anger at such a threat and the unfairness of it i and my men have been very supportive to you as you told me earlier damn my speaks said spluttering with fury you are to keep your bloody frigate ready to sail at a moments notice you are to restrict access with the shore and except for victualling you are to keep your people aboard where they cannot blab well reliants people have earned a brief spell out of discipline after lewrie countered instantly regretting how tongueincheek that sounded absolutely not sir speaks roared you will sit and swing at anchor til ive need of you do not be obstreperous or insubordinate with me ill not have it do you hear quite clearly sir lewrie replied abashed dismissed captain lewrie speaks ordered stonefaced mutinous dog mutinous dog rwark from the parrot once out on deck in the fresh air lewrie let out a deep pented breath puffing out his cheeks and sharing a rueful glance with lieutenant douglas clough penarths captain who had wisely found another place to be while speaks was tearing a strip off lewries arse clough looked sympathetic might there be something up mister clough lewrie asked him in a closeby mutter as he made ready to board his waiting big ye dinna hear it from me sir but weve been ordered to take a fresh load of torpedoes aboard in a tearing hurry mind and once done im to take her down to saint helens patch and wait for a favourable wind for the downs sir to join admiral lord keith captain speaks gave me a hint its to be boulogne sir the roughfeatured scot muttered back though with an eager grin explosive boats fireships our torpedoes and even some rocketfiring vessels mister william congreves explosive rockets whats a congreve rocket lewrie wondered aloud in a soft conspiratorial tone i know signal rockets but dont rightly know sir for no one ever tells me things if they dont pertain to our torpedo trials lt clough said with a wee and wry laugh mark my words captain lewrie well be a part of a grand attack on boulogne sure as fate and that soon thankee mister clough lewrie said grinning back for the news now ill have tplay dumb til our superiors decide ttell us for certain with no shore liberty for anyone even officers clough mournfully agreed boulogne though well well lewrie whispered imagining what that would be like on the day ordained play dumb til im told the details lewrie thought as he went through the ritual of departing honours i was born tplay dumb its what people expect o me chapter fortyone at least its a pretty day for it alan lewrie thought as the coast of france loomed up from the southern horizon as a squadron of which hms reliant was a part sailed for boulogne lewrie did wonder though why the expedition was so small if the undertaking was of such vital importance to englands survival the squadron was led by admiral of the blue lord keith in hms monarch a twodecker gunned third rate not the lofty first or second rate more suitable to his seniority with monarch were two gun twodeckers and two much older fourth rate twodecker s a type of warship more commonly seen on convoy duty or troop carrying these days not in the line of battle it was smaller ships that made up the bulk of the squadrons numbers there were bomb vessels with their big seamortars some older warships converted to fire william congreves infernal rockets brigsloops and frigates and a host of cutters and armed launches along with at least four fireships and the collier penarth bearing their catamaran torpedoes lewrie savoured the last few sips of tepid coffee in his pewter mug as he stood by the windward bulwarks of the quarterdeck slouched a tad it must be admitted as he surveyed the lines of warships the sea and sky did the emperor napoleon bonaparte wish for fine weather in which to launch his titanic invasion force he could not ask for a milder day for the conditions were rarely seen in the channel in late autumn this first day of october of the sky above was a soft and milky pale blue almost completely blanketed by vast swathes of thin cirrus clouds the sunlight softened and almost shadowless further up the channel nearer to the straits of dover and further downchannel on the west horizon there were thicker taller and more substantial clouds through which the sun speared down in bright shafts there were sootier darker shafts too as if there might be rain there or as superstitious old salts maintained the sun was drawing up columns of water for a later deluge the waters of the channel usually boisterous crosschopped and sparkling with whitehorses and whitecaps were calmer too the waves longer and shallower for once and the muted sunlight turned the seas colour to steely greyblue close aboard and a paler blue that mirrored the sky further away france off the bows was a thin smear of dull green and sand a single coloured pencilstroke so far the only stark colours were the solidities of the warships and their hulls and sails dark brown weathered oak the shiny black of the painted upperworks or the matte black of tarred wales and the yellows reds ochres or buffs of their hull stripes with here and there glints of giltwork on transoms entryports or carved figureheads pale new white canvas or aged and weathered buff or parchment tan sails made a ragged scudding cloudbank above those hulls above them all and aft on wooden staffs all ships sported blue ensigns with vivid redwhiteblue union flags in their cantons and all flew yardslong commissioning pendants from their mainmast tops streaming and flickering like snakes tongues licking the wind for the taste of prey lewrie finished his cold coffee set the mug down on the deck and strolled to the break of the quarterdeck to peer over the hammock stanchions now full of tightly rolled bedding down into the waist admiral lord keith had not yet ordered the squadron to quarters and lewrie felt it odd to be sailing into action with his crew acting as if it was just another day far out at sea with their frigate alone and without a threat on the horizons the ports were still shut and the greatguns were still snugly bowsed to the gunport sills each of them still plugged with redpainted wood tompions in their muzzles a few men idled round the companionways but only half the crew of the starboard watch stood the watch well there were the marines if action was expected in an hour or so lt simcock was going to be ready for it and properly dressed too his men had doffed their everyday slops and had changed into cockaded hats red coats white waistcoats and trousers and black canvas halfspatterdash leggings with all of their martial accoutrements hung about them france dammit lewrie muttered as the squadron closed to within six or seven miles of the shore bloody bloody france well some of their young ladies are fetching sir lieutenant westcott breezily commented near lewries side recall the fair madamoiselle sylvie at kingston oh is that why you insisted you lead the boats lewrie said with a laugh youve a taste for french mutton have you i rather doubt thered be any aboard the invasion boats sir westcott replied all whimsy though one might hope lewrie wished to keep lt westcott aboard reliant should they run into opposition from french gunboats but westcott had asked for a private word and had claimed the honour of leading the boats that would tow the torpedoes in it was the senior lieutenants role by right and tradition and how else may i make a name for myself and gain notice for advancement sir if im held back hed posed with a wry laugh and lewrie had acceded to his desire charging him to look after his coxn liam desmond and desmonds longtime mate patrick furfy he would send his oldest midshipmen he could spare them and were men to be lost it was better to lose mids than officers that was traditional too and after all houghton entwhistle and mister warburton had as much need of a bit of fame and notice at admiralty and in the papers as any other man how else might they advance and lewrie grimly considered even the most seasoned midshipmen were as hungry for honour and glory as lion cubs its taking long enough captain speaks impatiently snapped as he strolled up to join them such a pretty day til he ruined it lewrie thought stifling a groan keeping his gaze fixed on the bowsprit and pretending that he had not heard the man just before they had sailed from portsmouth to join lord keith off the downs speaks had come aboard reliant without specific ordersand thankfully without his damned parrotclaiming that making passage in penarth would interfere too much with lt clough and his preparations though he also alluded to unseen orders to see the job right through to the finish and a duty to see his torpedoes successful lewries orders were to accompany penarth and use his men and boats to launch the devices and they made no mention of speaks but speaks was senior to him and lewrie couldnt drive speaks back into his hired boat at swordpoint or even demand to see those hintedat orders so he was stuck with the pest and a garrulous peevish and annoying pest hed turned out to be practically presiding and ruling meals with lewrie and his officers and constantly on the quarterdeck when lewrie was never interfering exactly with reliants captain and officers of the watch but hovering with many a disapproving scowl sniff grunt questioning cocked brow or muttered comment theyre my torpedoes lewrie my collier from which youll fetch them speaks had briskly rattled off a calculating little smile upon his face and im damned well going to see them handled properly a kindly and charitable man might have deemed captain speakss zeal admirable the sort of fellow captain alan lewrie definitely was not even before the bastard had come aboard no what the fellow wanted the most lewrie suspected was a chance to be at sea aboard a proper frigate not a hiredin collier that mounted only popguns and damned few of those reliant was a warship very much like speakss last command of which had he not come down with pneumonia and had had to be replaced he might have sailed into the baltic as a lone ship to scout the danish swedish and russian fleets then returned in time to take part in the glorious battle with nelson at copenhagen and felt robbed of the opportunity lewrie was deadcertain that speaks had no orders his brief had been to test the catamaran torpedoes then turn them over to some other officer to be employed he might have felt a trifle sorry for the old fellowhad he not been as bristly as a currying brush nowhere near the firm but fair and wellliked officer of old and if he wished to be close to his charges and take part in a battle at long last more power to him lewrie thoughtso long as he did so anywhere else but aboard his ship signal sir midshipman munsell high aloft called down in a thin and shrill voice reading off a string of number flags general to all ships with two guns it is come to anchor sir midshipman rossyngton said after a quick scan through his code book anchor captain speaks barked were still five miles off have the signal repeated mister rossyngton lewrie told his mid but id admire did we fetchto mister westcott not anchor as ordered do the french come out wed be immobile too long for my liking and caught tryin tgo to quarters and heave up the best bower and the entire length of a cable at the same time hms reliant was put up into wind foreandaft sails still drawing to drive her forward but with topsls aback to act as brakes and let her make just a bit of stern and leeway practically immobilised but still able to pay off and get back to speed in a mere minute avoiding getting caught by a french sortie with her pants down it was an order captain speaks muttered half to himself just loud enough to irk ahem he covered loudly clearing his throat interpreted by all but the twodeckers and the flagship according to captains best judgement sir lewrie pointed out through gritted teeth in a rictus of an outwardly pleasant smile the rest have fetchedto the other frigates and such as you can see he added as he swept an arm towards the lighter ships which stood a little closer to the coast i doubt the cutters have anchor cables long enough now what sir lt westcott said after coughing into a fist to change the subject we sit here long enough mister westcott we might heave up the rum keg then serve the midday meal lewrie cynically replied with a grimace i thought wed just barge up to gun range and blaze away at once but thats up to admiral lord keith mister rossyngton pass word for my steward and hes tbring my collapsible chair up captain speaks no fan of lewrie already goggled at the order utterly convinced that lewrie was the idlest lubber hed ever met and my pennywhistle too mister rossyngton lewrie added sure that that would dismay the fellow even further far enough perhaps to leave the quarterdeck and leave them all in peace whatd ye like thear mister westcott spanish ladies to lewries wicked delight captain speaks produced a gargling sound belched up a muffled pah and took himself a brisk stroll up the larboard sailtending gangway swinging his arms like a man working up an appetite faarewell and adieu to you fine spanish ladies faarewell and adieu to you ladies of spain foor weve received orders too sail for old england lewrie sang out damn my eyes but i do know how trile em he gaily thought chapter fortytwo it was late afternoon before the squadron got under way again with lord keiths flagship monarch leading all three frigates bomb vessels fireships the penarth collier and all the brigsloops and cutters closer to boulogne now well see something speaks enthused pacing the quarterdeck with jaunty steps and clapping his hands in eagerness for action but no they didnt for monarch signalled for all ships to anchor again this time just outside of the maximum reach of french cannon in much shallower water even the cutters could put down an anchor and find good holding ground without paying out too much scope of cable a word sir lt westcott whispered near lewries shoulder aye lewrie allowed just as guarded this doesnt make any sense sir westcott grumbled his face set in a beetlebrowed frown we havent even been ordered to clear for action and here we are sitting ducks should the french come out as you feared round noon when we fetchedto instead of anchoring well it doesnt make any sense tme either if theres comfort in mutual perplexity lewrie gravelled back shaking his head i wouldve thought wed bring the other four liners along if monarch can anchor this closely so could the sixtyfours and the fifties one hates to question the judgement of superior officers but surely sir were nelson here one would think wed have been hot at it hours ago westcott said secondguessin superior officers lewrie said with a cackle damme mister westcott thats the navy meat and drink hmm he went on after a long moment of pursing his lips and staring shoreward perhaps lord keiths of a mind tlaunch the attack tonight when fireshipsd cause even more panic than they would in daylight you may be in the boats and right under the french guns by midnight one can only hope sir westcott eagerly agreed mister spendlove lewrie called out to the officer of the watch you have the deck im goin aloft for a looksee since his first days as a raw and callow midshipman in he had always been pluperfectterrified of going aloft hundreds of feet from the sane safety of solid decks yohohoing out the futtock shrouds to hang like a spider nigh upsidedown instead of using the lubbers hole to the fighting top platform scrambling higher up the narrowing shrouds and ratlines to the crosstrees or the fearful mast caps going out to the tip of a topsl tgallant or royal yardarm to fist canvas with upper arms locked over the yard and his feet teetering on a footrope that shimmied like a circus performers high wire with a bare second of clumsiness dooming him to plunge overside to drown or go splat on the upper deck he slung his telescope over his shoulder and went up the starboard shrouds of the mizen mast damn what captain speaks thought of him he eschewed the futtock shrouds and transferred to the counterbracing catharpings to reach the top through the lubbers hole i aint a twentyyearold topman he grimly told himself nor a twentyyearold anything any longer uh evenin sir a spry young sailor bade him as lewrie took a deep breath to steady his twanging nerves before extending his telescope evenin grimes lewrie replied sparing a moment to grin back recalling that grimes was one of the twodozen or so that his old bosun will cony now the owner of the olde ploughman public house in anglesgreen had recruited as volunteers when reliant had been fitting out ehm dye think we might see a bit of a fight tonight sir grimes asked with a wolfish expression ye never can tell grimes lewrie told him if we dont get ordered in i dont see the frogs comin out to us whats your station do we go to quarters well i would be here sir ttend sail and see to damage but if we get tlaunch those torpeder things im down for mister houghton in his boat and handle the swivel gun youd have more fun in houghtons boat lewrie assured him as he turned his attention to the shore we might blow some french boats to hell and some frogs with em theres a lot of em sir grimes commented god aint there just lewrie thought as he levelled his telescope on the topmast shrouds and ratlines and got a good view even as dusk began to fall there was still enough light for him to make out hundreds of vessels in boulogne harbour everything from prames first rate gunboats to the smallest singlemasted caiques they were lined up against the inner harbour piers several rows deep along the minor jetties where small fishing boats would tie up in row after row round the harbour in deeper water and all alongside the inner side of the stone breakwaters with only their masts showing a deep forest of masts boulogne was so full of invasion shipping that any vessel attempting to sail out would have to pick a tortuous way without ramming into something closer to the outside of the breakwaters was lined with long rows of every sort of barge and caique arrayed twodeep and there seemed to be at least two hundred of them as lewrie tried to keep a running count wee lanthorns were winking to light aboard them among the vessels he could still see inside the harbour and he began counting them instead of masts or hulls but gave it up after a moment it was as futile as trying to count all the stars in a clear west indies night warehouses along the piers houses taverns and shops began to blossom wee glims too and they all blended together and beyond the harbour town thousands of points of light emerged as the evening drew on until every clifftop every open field every overlook above the sea was transformed to a faeryland of winking lights and boulogne became a city as great as london as welllit as paris when he had been there during the peace of amiens the campfires and lanthorns and candles of a vast army encamped for miles and miles about in tents and huts and the french were ready for them long before their revolution in the time of french kings boulogne had been fortified guarded by stone forts wellarmed with good artillery and with the ascendancy of napoleon bonapartean artillerymanthe defences had gotten even stronger with batteries erected on the breakwaters and flanking high ground in stout stone redans or in thick earthen batteries every three miles along the french coast the entire length of the channel from ushant to dunkerque smoke not from cookfires arose from some of the stouter emplacements furnaces and forges for heated shot near the harbour entrance between the enveloping arms of the breakwaters lewrie could barely make out some threemasted gunboats swinging at single anchors to the wind and tide where they could sortie if lord keith launched his attack out beyond them and the lines of boats along the outer breakwater faces large armed launches were rowing keeping a wary eye on the british squadron this could turn hopeless fast lewrie whispered to himself say somethin sir grimes asked enjoy the view lewrie said louder then turned to begin his descent to the safety of the deck the tides beginning to run well sir the sailing master mr caldwell pointed out just after lewrie stowed his telescope in the compass binnacle cabinet though the winds both perverse and scant for an assault perhaps we wont be going in after all mister caldwell lewrie replied with an impatient shrug and a peek aloft to the commissioning pendant which was streaming the wrong way if we send in the fireships theres a chance theyd just drift back onto us weve the bomb vessels in place the rocket ships anchored and in good range captain speaks grumbled if the wind wont serve at least we could begin to shell them tonight stap me this delay and dithering is maddening shouldve stayed aloft lewrie thought and avoided the pest a while longer the bomb vessels that lewrie had seen while aloft were of the newer type with their two masts set far back to leave their two mortars free play up forward set deep in reenforced wells theyd been anchored by a single stern kedge and both their bower anchors set out at extreme angles so tensioning or loosening their bower cables could swing their aim in great arcs the older converted rocket ships were beamon to the shore anchored from bows and sterns with springs on their cables to shift their aim all seemed ready aye but how many rockets have we to fire lewrie speculated aloud how many shells are aboard the bombs we shoot off half of our bolts without usin the fireships and torpedoes at the same time he added finishing with another greater armlifting shrug were to sit here and wait for tomorrow nights tide and hope the wind cooperates captain speaks groused pah well at least we may savour a good supper in peace lewrie said with a chuckle my cook assures me hes a cured ham for us and if we dont have to go to quarters well dine on a hot meal a hot supper captain speaks barked incredulously sneering at lewries priorities an inarticulate growl followed youll join me mister caldwell lewrie offered grinning gad yes i will sir and thankee most kindly mr caldwell quickly responded rubbing his hands in expectation speaks turned away to mumble something which made lewrie grin impishly dye know mister caldwell this puts me in mind of copenhagen the night before the battle with the two fleets anchored not two miles apart like ancient armies glarin at each other with the battlefield between em lewrie knew how much that would rile speaks and determined he would expand on the subject over supper which captain speaks would not turn down unless he intended to sulk and fast in his hammock chapter fortythree god only knew what the french made of it but it was the following evening october nd that admiral lord keith ordered the assault on boulogne to begin the winds had come round from a favourable quarter the tide was running shoreward at a brisk pace and perhaps far aft in hms monarchs greatcabins a chicken had been sacrificed and the auguries had been deemed auspicious boats from the flagship had rowed lastminute orders to all the ships and alerting them to begin when monarch fired a twogun signal lewrie ordered reliants crew to supper in the first dog watch so the galley fires could be extinguished early then had the frigate brought to quarters at the start of the second dog at pm on your way mister westcott and the best of fortune go with ye lewrie bade the first lieutenant and his midshipmen and the hands who would man the towing boats the penarth collier had already hoisted all her torpedoes from her holds and tethered them alongside ready and waiting give the frogs hell reliants well fetch you some frogs legs flambe sir westcott gaily promised as he ordered his men overside and into the boats and they were all four well on their way and about to go alongside penarth when the long anxious peace between the french and the anchored squadron was broken at last by the sharp reports of two guns aboard hms monarch signal flags soared up her halliards ordering engagement mister merriman you may open upon the boats anchored outside the breakwaters lewrie shouted down to the waist aye aye sir lt george merriman loudly replied then turned to his waiting gun crews raise the ports run out monarch and the other frigates fired first the edgy peace of a fine mild early evening shattered by the deep earsplitting bellows of guns prime your guns lt merriman was roaring captains take aim we will fire by threes quartergunners see to your charges and direct them to point at single targets ready guncaptains fiddled with elevation by raising the breechends of their pieces with crowlevers and wriggling the wood quoin blocks a bit aft or a bit forward to raise the muzzles to their best guess of the range some called for their gunners to lever the truck carriages left or right so the barrels pointed directly at specific boats in that long twodeep line of invasion vessels only then did they stand erect clear of the guns recoil drawing the trigger lines to the flintlock strikers taut and raising fists in the air to signal their readiness by threes fire merriman shouted chopping the air with his right arm and the guns erupted in groups from bow to stern with lungflattening roars spurting great clouds of burned powder smoke shoreward shot through with stabs of bright yellowred flame and firefly sparks of vivid orange swab out slow and steady does it lads merriman directed overhaul recoil tackle overhaul runout tackle load cartridge the smokebank was drifting shoreward rapidly thinning and rising as it went on a fair breeze allowing lewrie and lt spendlove on the quarterdeck to lift their telescopes and survey the initial results there were shot splashes near the invasion vessels but so far they saw no evidence of hits that would be far too much to hope for from the very first shots it would take several more broadsides til the guncaptains honed their aims and perhaps a couple of hours more of slow and steady hammering to inflict substantial damage not too bad for first broadsides sir lt spendlove said optimistically mostly short but in line with their chosen marks excuse me sir midshipman warburton intruded what duties might you assign me sir now that captain speaks took my place what lewrie gawped what the devil are ye doin here mister warburton took your place he spluttered at the last moment sir mr warburton explained looking miserable to be deprived his shot at danger and glory he said that you had allowed him that they were his torpedoes and mine arse on a bandbox lewrie exclaimed just shy of an outraged screech idve never well maybe i wouldve he told himself if only tget rid of the bastard for an hour or so god rot him he gets killed fine assist mister merriman on the guns mister warburton and im truly sorry your chance was stolen he told the deeply disappointed sixteenyearold aye aye sir warburton said doffing his hat and dashing by threes fire merriman roared again as did the guns a moment later the french have opened upon us sir lt spendlove pointed out enter that and the time in the sailing masters journal mister rossyngton dusk was rapidly turning towards full dark as the return fire from dozens perhaps an hundred shore guns sparkled all along the low shore the overlooks and the fortifications the firstclass prames the largest french gunboats anchored in the entrance channel erupted in gouts of smoke and daggers of flame too though they showed little sign that they would sortie they remained at anchor oh i say mr caldwell declared jerking an arm towards the great flashes and volcanic explosions from the bomb vessels thirteeninchdiametre mortar shells soared aloft in great arcs their burning sputtering conical fuses making pyrotechnic trails cross the darkening sky some of them incendiaries that seethed like shooting stars when they reached their apogees they seemed to pause for an instant before dashing down and regaining their initial speed to crash into the waters of the inner harbour and burst with loud blasts impressive lt spendlove commented though he shook his head in worry one would hope they aim well and dont land in the town though sir oh look at that the sailing master declared again as a wave of congreve rockets whooshed skyward talk about your royal firework shows hah now those are truly aweinspiring oooh aaah lewrie thought snickering though such a fiery display was worthy of his awe for a moment the rockets dashed upwards long yellow tongues of flame trailing them almost bright enough to espy the long bamboo poles to which the bodies and explosive charges were affixed to steady them like arrow shafts and fletchings or should have one swerved straight upwards as if trying to spear the moon yet another swooped up then back towards the launching ship in a circular arc a couple more levelled off prematurely and darted shoreward nigh at sealevel wheeling left or right like lost sparrows prettily flaming sparrows some waddled up and down before diving into the sea far short of the breakwaters and one perversely wheeled to the right just after launch and looked determined to crash into reliant growing bigger and brighter and closer before exploding in a shower of stars a halfmile short well hmm mr caldwell said mightily disappointed need some work lewrie said relaxing his tense dread and letting out a whoosh of relieved breath even if they aimed at us as you bear by threes fire lt merriman shouted again and reliant was shoved a few inches to larboard by the brute force of recoil amid the bellowing of their frigates guns came the howlinghumming of french shot as they passed overhead or wide of the bow and stern lewrie lifted his telescope to look over the shore batteries fearing that neither side had much of a chance for accurate fire and that it was all futile lord keith had ordered them to anchor at the extreme edge of the french guns maximum range and even with quoins full out and the barrels of the squadron elevated almost to the safe limit for a naval gun which was fired at low elevation and very close rangethey werent howitzers after all designed to loft shot over fortress wallseven monarchs lowerdeck pounders stood little chance of reaching that far either the french might even have the advantage over them for the fortress guns and the batteries mounted on the overlooks stood higher above sealevel and could elevate safely to give them the required reach and they had howitzers flameshot smoke burst from batteries to either side of the breakwaters the flat booming coming seconds later and the shot they fired lifted high into the night burning fuses tracing arcs as the shells came darting downwards the thin wailhiss of their passage through the air rising in volume and tone like an opera diva trilling for a higher note before they burst prematurely due to tooshort cone fuses or plunged into the sea and exploded in great whitish gouts of spray another shoal of congreve rockets soared shoreward in reply to the french artillery the slowerfiring mortars of the bomb vessels belched out another salvo and the night sky was crisscrossed by opposing streaks of fire explosive shells burst near the british ships and over the french batteries inside the harbour beyond the sheltering breakwaters some reaching as far as the townside warehouses and piers they must see that theyre shelling the town lt spendlove fumed quite out of character and the coldbloodedness demanded from a navy officer we must not do that its not christian sir its as narrow as a razors edge at this range sir lewrie told him shouting a bit over the continual din strike short hit the anchored ships or the piers and the town if youre over deck there a lookout at the masthead called down in a thin screech theres french launches comin out that changed the subject quickly as lewrie spendlove and the sailing master lifted their glasses to spot the enemy launches they were under oars as big as admirals barges and mounted cannon fore and aft they werent coming far lewrie noted only two or three hundred yards beyond the rows of vessels anchored outside the breakwaters but when the boats went in with the torpedoes in tow they would prove dangerous mister rossyngton my compliments to mister merriman and hes to shift his fire onto the launches closer to us lewrie ordered aye sir the midshipman snapped crisply dashing forward for the waist reliants guns fell silent for a moment as the aim was shifted the smoke thinned and lewrie peered hard down the long line of barges outside the breakwater looking intently for any sign of damage they might have inflicted but spent powder smoke from the french batteries cloaked them and the night was too dark only fitfully and briefly illuminated by the passage of flaming carcase shells or rockets he slammed the tubes of his telescope compact shaking his head in mounting anger over how useless the assault seemed so far by the faint candlelight of the compass binnacle he checked his pocketwatch and nighgroaned aloud to note that it was nearly pm the both of us blazin away half the night with nothing to show for it he thought a feeble anger growing inside him looking seaward towards monarch whose starboard side was lit up with stabbing flame from her guns deck there fireships is goin in cutters launches an ships boats is goin in the lookout wailed sounding cheerful mister westcottll be having himself some fun mr caldwell hooted with glee one hopes lt spendlove glumly replied at least fireships are conventional weapons unlike rockets was what he meant or the lofting of explosive mortar shells into boulogne itself lewrie felt a faint stir of hope it had been fireships that had panicked the spanish armada when sailed into their anchorage at gravelines in driving them to cut their cables and flee to the open sea never to reassemble in strength with any luck hundreds of those anchored vessels would be set afire and the few french sailors aboard each one would be unable to fend off or extinguish the fire aboard their own abandoning it and fleeing as the conflagration spread from theirs to the next and the next and when the blazes reached the tons of gunpowder stored in the fireships holds went off even more of them would be blasted to fiery kindling the french saw the threat recognised it for what it was and shifted their aim to counter the fireships and the swarm of sailing launches and cutters escorting them hoping to sink them before they reached those anchored lines their armed launches dared to come out further from shore in anticipation their oars flashing in unison as they rowed out and swung to point their guns at the british launches lewries orders from admiral lord keith had stated that some of those unmanned explosive boats would be employed as well and lewrie hoped that the french might concentrate on those going in before reliants torpedotowing barges and cutters and ignore his men who would come to a stop then turn about and flee seaward after letting their primed torpedoes free he found that hed crossed the fingers of his right hand deck there th fireships is lit there was a fiendish science to how a fireship was rebuilt for maximum effect its gunports hinged down not up the lines to them fashioned to burn through so that long tongues of flame could dart out once the conflagration reached its height hatches were widened to let in more air to stoke the fires slowmatch was strung to fire the few old guns still aboard and down to the holds and the tons of gunpowder fire rooms were packed with combustibles amidships and below planned by skilled pyromaniacs to spread quickly to other points where barrels of tar and turpentine lamp oil and opened bales of straw waited for a single spark if the masthead lookout could spot the first winks of flame then they had been ignited minutes before and the last few men of the small crews had already lashed the helms trimmed the braces and sheets and scrambled into their boats to make their quick escape two three four of them began to light up the approaches to boulogne almost turning night to a ruddy flickering day as they surged shoreward shot splashes bursting to life all round them drawing the bulk of french fire from the shore batteries damned near apocalyptic aint it sir the sailing master said quite pleased with the sight of burning ships screaming fiery rocket trails and the rush of burning incendiary shells from bomb vessels something was engulfed in flames on the far side of the arms of the breakwaters to make the scene even more hellish mr caldwell leaned his head over to cock an ear in appreciation of the continual thunder screech or howl of guns and bowling roundshot of the stench of spent powder and propellants and the sickly yellowwhite clouds of powder smoke that reflected the fires the sailing master sniffed deep and smiled in pleasure ghastly was lt clarence spendloves dour opinion sir midshipman warburton cried as he came to the quarterdeck mister merrimans duty sir and he says that the guns cant elevate enough to shoot over the heads of our small boats yonder he requests that we cease fire til our boats are clear very well mister warburton my compliments to him and pass the word to cease fire lewrie ordered wondering just how much shot and powder they had expended the last few hours he looked over the full hammock stanchions to the waist and saw that many of the loaders had powder ladles in their hands as if they had fired away all of the premade flannel powder cartridges and had run short of flannel bags too in the dull red glows of the battle lanthorns between the guns his gun crews bare to the waists and heads swaddled with neckerchiefs to protect their hearing were so begrimed with powder smoke that they resembled weary junior demons who stoked the fires of hell the rest of the squadron monarch and the two other frigates had ceased fire too and the loudest sounds of firing came from shore the duller ovendoor slams punctuated by sharp barks and cracks from lighter boat guns as the french launches and british boats fired upon each other he could almost hear the rushing crackle of the fireships as they burned well alight and turned into floating braziers that illuminated the night by then sails and tarred rigging were afire too with mousetiny fires scampering up the shrouds finding sources for combustion in the cooking fat slush that kept the running rigging supple too they were close to the french barges but would they make it all the way before their sails vanished or the slowmatches reached the explosives there was a titanic blast near the anchored french boats with a great sheet of flame and smoke and a mountainous pillar of seawater one of the unmanned explosive boats i think sir caldwell speculated pursing his lips and frowning in disappointment perhaps the others will get closer deck there ships boats comin out a lookout shouted not just ours but everybodys lewrie thought after an intense look through his glass the singlemasted cutters and armed launches that had gone in with the fireships were retiring emboldened by their seeming retreat french launches and peniches were warily edging further from the protection of their shore batteries as well mister merriman lewrie shouted down to the ships waist i wish you to open upon the french launches once our own boats are clear aye sir lt merriman replied sounding a touch weary as he took off his hat to bind a neckerchief over his ears once more tired gun crews slouched back to their pieces after a last sip of water from the scuttlebutts like overburdened miners returning to a coal face making lewrie fear that with no sure signs of success his crew was becoming dispirited the long inexplicable delay after anchoring just out of gun range the sitting idle all day might have made good sense to them and the excitement of action the novel sight of rockets and mortar boats might have enthused them at first but lewrie had to admit that he felt dispirited too for the lack of urgency and daring and for the seeming lack of success so far he wavered between anger that the expedition looked like a failure and a sense of futility that as a captain he took so little part in it his people tending the guns had been doing something active and necessary as had the hundreds more officers and sailors away in those launches and boats while he stood about like a useless fart in a trance seniority could take all the joy of battle away all the frenetic neckornothing intensity of a boarding action a cuttingout raid or amphibious landing all the duties lewrie had been given as a young midshipman or junior officer he looked over to admiral lord keiths flagship and wondered if that worthy had had a single thing to do once his guns had begun to roar and the fireships had gone in the fellow had a flagcaptain to run his ship a captain of the fleet to handle the daytoday mundane matters so what was left for him to do tend to the supper menu for all the good that lewrie was doing for all the good that lord keith was doing they both might as well have gone aft to their cabins for a pot of tea lewrie almost had to shake himself to get rid of his bad mood becoming aware of the reduction of noise and of lights the rocket vessels must have run out of their horridly inaccurate contraptions for they no longer soared off in shoals but went aloftand far off coursein irregular singletons the mortars in the bomb vessels had fallen silent too so there were no more spectacular airbursts or swooshing fiery incendiary carcases it was the fires ashore and the drifting fireships that threw great angry glares cross the waters there sirs midshipman rossyngton cried pointing overside to starboard small boats approaching from eyesearing glare and the inkiest shadows a ragged line of boats slowly appeared two were under lugsails a third loomed up under oars trailing the first two a fourth appeared at last in tow of the third mister rossyngton do you go below and warn the surgeon that we may have wounded men returning lewrie ordered aye sir the first two boats both of them thirtytwofoot barges passed across reliants bows lowering sails and fitting oars into the tholes midshipman houghton stood and waved looking immensely pleased and excited the second barge was lt westcotts any hurt lewrie called to him as the barges rounded up near the larboard side slowly stroking to hook onto the mainmast channel platform not a man sir lt westcott shouted back not for lack of trying on the frenchs part he added with a triumphant laugh and a brief flash of a smile mr houghtons boat was hooking on the man in the bows with the gaff young grimes his swivel gun still stood in its bracket muzzle to the sky and he looked pleased with himself too and thankfully there was liam desmond his black irish coxn at the tiller of westcotts barge and patrick furfy ploughing forward to the bows with a gaff pole in his hand to serve as bow man staggering over his mates as clumsily as ever welcome back lads good bit o work lewrie called as his men came up the battens and manropes to gather on the larboard gangway mister houghton id admire did ye see to leadin the barges towing lines aft for later aye sir ehm have any of our torpedoes gone off yet houghton asked none of ours no lewrie had to tell him ah glad tsee ye in one piece mister westcott how did it go wet wild and woolly for a time sir westcott told him with another laugh shot splashes all round and i got soaked to my chest when i misjudged my leap back into the boat from our torpedos back the tide was still running fairly strong when we let them go so he said with a shrug you were closer to those anchored boats lewrie said did you note any damage not all that much sir no sorry lt westcott said more softly like in macbeth sound and fury signifying nothing monarch and the other frigates began firing again their boats were back alongside and no friendly craft lay between them and their new targets the french launches and gunboats resume fire mister merriman lewrie took time to order do you take those frog launches under fire now it was midshipman entwhistles boat crew coming back aboard to be congratulated then captain speaks and his crew must apologise to your young gentleman for supplanting him lewrie but i wished to see our torpedoes delivered properly the older fellow briskly said stonefaced as if to fend off any criticism of his actions excuse me sir surgeon mr mainwaring intruded as he came to the base of the larboard gangway ladder are there any wounded he had his shirt sleeves rolled to his elbows and wore his usual long bib apron of leather both thankfully were still pristine and bloodless dont think so mister mainwaring lt westcott told him well sor patrick furfy piped up holding up his bloodied left hand tis nought a glass o neat rum wont cure the lummox caught it on one o th torpedo grapnel hooks sor liam desmond related thought hed git towed ashore tfrance before he got free we must see to that sew it up mainwaring determined after a quick inspection be painful sor furfy asked looking skittish youd feel a pinch or two yes the surgeon told him arrah sor rumd ease th pain and faith if i dont feel all weak an faint of a sudden furfy declared shamming wooziness below to the cockpit furfy with your rum for pain the surgeon said rolling his eyes lets go there was a tremendous explosion close to shore as one of the fireships blew up there was a monstrous fire ball and an expanding cloud of broken planking shattered timbers and flaming tar barrels every chunk and slightest splintered bit a bright torch all of it pattering down hundreds of feet away to extinguish in the sea leaving the ruptured hull smouldering and smothered in black smoke huzzah from lewries weary gunners enthused once more excuse me sir midshipman warburton said doffing his hat as he came to the quarterdeck casting a brief bitter glance at captain speaks mister merriman reports that there is so much dark smoke from the fireships that he cannot find targets the french launches have retreated behind the smoke sir he is to cease fire again mister warburton lewrie decided after a long moment but stay ready should any launch reappear there was so much smoke that monarch and the other frigates had to stop firing and after a few minutes so did the french guns but for those still trying to sink the remaining fireships for one hopeful moment one fireship drifted right between the ends of the breakwaters pummeled by both stone batteries that guarded the entrance channel the gunboats lurking just inside the harbour began to blaze away desperately to save themselves and it looked as if the fireship would succeed before she exploded prematurely and unsuccessfully scattering fiery debris far and wide this aint a grand assault lewrie sourly thought its another bloody experiment it would be the coming winter gales rough seas and foul winds that would stave off bonapartes invasion til spring he angrily realised sincerely hoping that before france could launch that dread expedition the royal navy would come back the next time in full force and intent and with someone in command who would press the issue more aggressively and much more cleverly without torpedoes he also hoped hed seen only two work so far lewrie let his attention drift as he contemplated how he would frame his report to admiralty and how to praise his officers and christ ill have tsay nice things about captain speaks he gawped he could not laud his own without and if he left speaks out hed never hear the end of it captain joseph speaks the director of torpedo development gallantly volunteered to take charge of one of our cutters and daring fire and shot expeditiously oh bugger lewrie whispered in disgust he was drawn back to full attention by the swelling of gunfire monarch and the other frigates had reopened now that the smoke from the failed fireships had thinned the bombardment of boulogne resumed in full cry with more mortar shells soaring aloft in fiery trails and more congreve rockets screaming shoreward in great arcs will we ever run short of rockets and mortar shells i ask you lt spendlove wondered aloud the bombardment of boulogne looked and sounded less furious but it went on relentlessly if slowly i should take charge of the guns sir spendlove asked ill dry out here on the quarterdeck sir lt westcott offered ill resume my place damp but willing go mister spendlove lewrie ordered slow but steady fire on the anchored boats he doubled his coat over his chest and buttoned up wishing for a blanket as he sat down in his canvas chair it looked to be a long and fruitless night he had managed to doze off in spite of the occasional shrieks of congreve rockets and the deep drumming of gunfire and exploding shell in the wee hours and came awake from a slumped nap with a start snapped to wakefulness by the lack of gunfire did i miss something mister westcott lewrie asked once hed creaked to his feet and padded to the bulwarks facing the shore it seems everyones lost enthusiasm at last sir westcott told him yawning or run out of shot and powder us and the french both except for captain speaks he added in a furtive whisper that worthy was still awake pacing the starboard gangway and muttering to himself nighurgently constantly peering shoreward with his telescope then consulting his pocketwatch hope springs eternal what any idea whether any of our damned torpedoes worked lewrie asked yawning himself i only could spot two some big explosions but those were hours ago sir and short or wide of the mark as per usual lt westcott said shrugging it is long past the run of any of the clocks so bawhoom a lurid sheet of flame rose from the sea a pillar of water an hundred feet tall then a shriek from captain speaks there there sirs right alongside one of those damned frog gunboats speaks yelled in triumph by god it worked and we sank something there sir speaks roared almost in lewries face after hed dashed from the gangway to the quarterdeck an arm flung in the general direction of the blast she was right alongside it when it blew up i saw it plain perhaps they thumped against it and the pistol lewrie countered no matter speaks cut him off one out of six succeeded in sinking an enemy ship with better clockworks with better pistols and more waterproofing weve proven torpedoes valuable dye see oh fuck me lewrie thought appalled now well never be shot of the goddamned things you wish twaste more time and money on em go right ahead ye poor deluded prick captain speaks turned about and capered round the deck raising a cheer from reliants weary crew with his cries of success mine arse on a bandbox mister westcott lewrie gloomed only a small gunboat for six expended sir westcott whispered back almost cheerfully and that by accident if there really was a gunboat alongside it when it went off hes the only one who saw it so how much do they cost each and what sort of rate of return is that youre a sly devious pessimist mister westcott lewrie said suddenly inspired ill take that as a compliment sir westcott said beaming if gods just and i write my report well well never see or hear of torpedoes again in our lives epilogue this little boney says hell come at merry christmas time but that i say is all a hum or i will no more rhyme some say in wooden house hell glide some say in air balloon een those who airy schemes deride agree his coming soon now honest people list to me though income is but small ill bet my wig to one penney he does not come at all the bellman and little boney popular ditty circa chapter fortyfour midshipman warburton sah the marine sentry guarding the entrance to the greatcabins bellowed slamming his musket hutt and his boots in punctuation enter lewrie bade seated at his desk in the daycabin his coat was off despite the chill of an early november evening and his choice of preprandial tipple this night a tankard of brown ale sat by his elbow as he penned a letter yes mister warburton your visitors boat is approaching sir warburton reported ah ha just about time thankee mister warburton he told the mid stowing away his pen and ink and sliding the letter that he was composing into the top drawer of his desk lewrie rose and took his coat from the back of his chair and put it on to go on deck to welcome mr james peel from the foreign office who had sent down a note from london even before reliant had put back into portsmouth requesting that they meet lewrie assumed it would be about the failed expedition against boulogne or those two odd boats hed captured but with peel one never really knew so though he would put a gladsome face on lewrie did feel a gurgle of trepidation in his innards or perhaps that was simple hunger he took a last swig of ale clapped on his hat and strode out past the marine sentry then up the starboard ladderway to mount to the sailtending gangway and entryport just as peels boat bumped against the hull dye require a bosuns chair peel he called down in jest be with you directly peel called back as he scaled the side spose ye came hungry lewrie laconically said as peels hat and head appeared over the lip of the entryport its uncanny how you always seem tturn up just at mealtimes hallo old son and yes i did peel rejoined once hed gained the deck and briefly doffed his fashionable curlbrimmed hat to the flag then to lewrie id never miss a chance for one of yeovills excellent suppers lets go aft then and get you a drink lewrie offered peel would have a brandy to ward off the chill of his boat from the docks while lewrie settled for a second tankard of ale they sat at the starboardside settee so how are things in london lewrie asked him folk are in calmer takings now winters getting on and they see that bonaparte wont cross the channel in bad weather peel said with a grin shifting and squirming to get more comfortably seated at his end of the settee toulon and chalky leaped down from their naps on lewries desk and came to remake peels acquaintance we heard an interesting bit of news from france about the invasion fleet by the way he paused to let the cats sniff his hand then began to pet them something that may give boney more pause than any winter gale or the attack on boulogne bad luck that but congratulations to you for your part in it even if it went so badly lewrie replied with a groan of remembered futility damn all torpedoes and their inventors yes well it seems that bonaparte and his generals thought a dress rehearsal was a good idea see how quickly and efficiently his army could board their ships and put out to sea a few miles with bonaparte watching from a clifftop like xerxes watched the ancient battle of salamis peel happily related all went swimmingly how apt that til the wind and sea got up and he discovered how much a pack of amateurs his sailors were god only knows how many barges and boats were wrecked but our report from a witness to the event wrote that thousands of french soldiers and sailors were drowned and that within a few miles of boulogne not out in the middle of the channel he might be reconsidering though hes spent so much money time and effort on the business already that he cant just abandon hopes of invading us more fool he if he persists lewrie chortled in glee and if he insists on usin those turtleback monstrosities well congratulations on fetching two of them in so we could inspect them peel said bowing his head in gratitude for a second nothing official mind just my personal congratulations still secret very hushhush though you must be used to that by now having worked with mister twigg so long god arent i just lewrie griped though goodnaturedly saw some people known to you in london peel blithely went on seemingly content to sip his brandy stroke the cats and slough at ease he did though give lewrie a sly underbrow gaze oh who lewrie asked wondering if he should begin to worry and quickly running through a list of characters best avoided lord percy stangbourne and his sister peel told him looking waggish leftenantcolonel lord stangbourne rather i thought horse guards had taken his regiment into service and sent him down to the kent coast lewrie said puzzled and trying to look innocent back in barracks til spring peel went on and back in his old haunts like boodles and the cocoa tree his sister seems nicer than her repute rather fetching in point of fact peel peered at him as if expecting lewrie to gush like a schoolboy in creampot love make quibbling noises or halfheartedly agree with his assessment of her shrugging it all off damme does he know everything about everybody lewrie thought the letter hed been writing had been to lydia whose latest post to him contained an offer to coach down to portsmouth and spend a few days togetherdid he still wish damned right he still wished and had already booked lodgings for her at the george inn and was writing to tell her so when peel had intruded or had he known that too aye she is devilishhandsome and fetchin lewrie agreed most assuredly peels response was a very broad smile and a nod of approval wellblessed with gods own tremendous dot too peel said i dont give a toss for her dowry lewrie bluntly told him percyll mostlike gamble them into debtors prison anyway usually when a man says a thing like that that it isnt about the money it usually really is peel said chuckling in worldlywise fashion you though alan i can take you at your word i could bank on it what i dont know whether thats a compliment or not lewrie wryly replied too honest for my own good or a bloody fool contemplating marriage though are you peel tooidly asked no and neither does lydia lewrie told him with a guffaw of denial once bitten twice shy for her and me well i never got the hang of it and if she wed me her reputationd be utterly ruined mean tsay james im a bounder a cad and a rakehell well some might say you were made for each other peel said with a shrug both of you scandalous he added with a twinkle a bad marriage to a depraved animal was not her fault and i think you demean the lady peel lewrie shot back my pardons pray forgive me peel quickly retracted placing a hand on his breast for i only know what the papers made of it for years the divorcement and all i meant but to tease but forgiven lewrie allowed more slowly heard from your nautical sons lately peel asked smiling benignly as he changed the subject aye i have lewrie enthused hughs with thorn charlton on the brest blockade foul weather cold victuals two days out of four but he seems tlove it sewallis well hes more guarded yet he sounds as if he prospers ive written his captain an old friend benjamin rodgers to enquire but tentatively havent gotten his letter back yet you know that sewallis got his place by fraud and forgery so your father sir hugo spoke of it to mister twigg and twigg related it to me peel admitted keep it in petto sub rosa what damme if he doesnt know evrything bout evrybody lewrie had to tell himself he cocked a wary brow over that admission you have a letter sent to us too peel said offhandedly oh shit here it comes the secret branchs leash indeed lewrie said over the rim of his tankard keeping his phyz as inscrutable as he could recall i told you back in the summer how hard it is to maintain communication with people willing to keep us informed of doings over in france peel said beginning to peel the onion at it were the french open and read every letter and have cut off all correspondence with great britain yes i recall lewrie stonily replied refusing to be drawn yet we still have ways tradecraft which we hope keeps a step ahead of french snoopers peel continued shifting on the settee and making it creak he was heavier than in his household cavalry days or his early years with foreign office as zachariah twiggs pupil wee notes some coded sewn into shirt collar bands pasted into book backs that sort of thing ah cleverness lewrie warily commented heavyeyed as draconian as the french policestate is with the guillotine the reward for espionage and treason against the emperor napoleon there are few whod dare keep us informed peel continued sounding like a chapman trying to flog a dubious product so we must do all we can to maintain contact with them and at the same time do all we can to protect them from exposure what they do for us is incredibly brave and rashly dangerous should they be discovered those brave few are rather admirable i doubt the frogsd think so lewrie said cracking a smile a damned weeun depends on ones point of view you are familiar with one of them peel hinted all atwinkle again i rather doubt its guillaume choundas lewrie scoffed i think i put paid tthat ugly bastard no not him peel informed him laughing do you ever fight a duel let me know when and where so i can get a good seat and see how accurately you shoot the fall from that cliff would have killed him anyway but that shot of yours with a smoothbore musket from a heaving boat at nigh an hundred yards was spoton right in the fiends heart we have that as gospel from a witness peel hinted again there were only two people i knew who were there when no lewrie gasped that murderin bitch let us say that mademoiselle charite angelette de guilleri has lost her faith in the revolution in bonaparte and her raison detre hey peel said smirking when bonaparte sold new orleans and all of louisiana to the united states he cut the very heart out of her making the deaths of her brothers and her cousin and their romantic but damnfool revolt against the spanish and their piracy that funded it meaningless that had been lewries doing requiring him to go up the mississippi to new orleans in mufti with a commercial traderinformant and sometime secret branch asset to smoak them out then escape and use his proteus frigate to smash the pirate encampment on grand terre in barataria bay slaying the lot and burning their vessels the bitch shot me lewrie exclaimed in heat with a girandoni airrifle like thatun yonder he said jerking an arm towards his personal weapons rack wouldve killed me too if the flaskd had enough compressed air in it for which the crown mister twigg and i are grateful that she did not peel said sounding earnest broke her wee black heart did bonaparte lewrie sneered in babytalk bloody good i hope she suffers dammit peel she had a hand in killin my wife on that beach i know lewrie alan jemmy peel sombrely said and for her forlorn loss her gallant stab at fomenting a french creole revolution in new orleans charite de guilleri won the admiration of the finest salon society in paris admiration pity and entre what lewrie she rubs shoulders with french generals admirals the head of bonapartes national police that brute fouche the foreign minister talleyrand has tucked his arse under her sheets and she has been to tea with anyone whos anyone in french government with empress josephine and bonaparte himself bloody good for her lewrie sneered again shes the highest and closest placed source we ever could hope to have peel pressed on she quite cleverly found a fellow in our employ and used him to get a letter out to us offering to supply us with information unless fouches caught your fellow and is usin her access as bait lewrie countered with scorn use both tfeed you useless twaddle thatll have ye runnin in circles like all the people who specialised in skullduggery for king and country whom lewrie had encountered james peel all but goggled at him as if toulon and chalky had begun to sing god save the king in perfect twopart harmony no one ever thought lewrie clever we considered that quite seriously for a goodly time peel confessed after a long moments contemplation but decided that it would be too convoluted a scheme fouche or his associate msieur real are rather direct sorts do they find a spy their usual course of action is round him up his family too torture them til they sing like larks then behead them publicly as a warning its not as if we have threesomes or larger groups of agents organised over yonder for all of the exiled royalists schemes and gold bonapartes nailed the borders shut so tightly that sending funds to support espionage is out of the question too damned heavy for one no the fellow as you put it is with the treasury peel revealed and charite de guilleri is with everybody but before she begins to produce for the crown she wishes to hear from you what lure me tthe back o some deep inlet for a reunion lewrie sneered no thankee nothing facetoface no peel quickly countered that would be much too dangerous for the both of you she wishes you to reply to her letter she asks for your forgiveness he softly added forgiveness lewrie exclaimed not this side of hell i wont theres some things unforgiveable quite a lot hangs on it peel pointed out i know very well what you and twigg and his irregulars can do forgeries and such lewrie gravelled if she ever saw a note in my handwritin it was seven years ago and after what i did to her her kin and their scheme i doubt she saved one out o sentiment why cant your people cobble up a reply she wouldnt know the diffrence forging or altering documents or agents reports on military matters are one thing alan peel gently objected theyre much too dry concise and impersonal whereas personal thoughts and feelings are very hard to reproduce surely ye forge credible love letters ttrip up traitors and expose em lewrie scoffed or embarrass people who need tbe given a public comedown yes we do peel cheerfully admitted but in those cases we have samples from both parties and can imitate their repartee with you we have nothing to work with oh we could cobble up something hire on a poor unknown romance scribbler and send her a letter full of highflown tragedy worthy of drury lane dramas but after a third or fourth reading it wouldnt sound like you it would not ring true and she would know mind i told you shes clever that it was a fraud no alan it must not only be in your hand but from your mind your soul i spose she wrote it in french lewrie stated well yes peel said his head cocked over seeing as how she is french peel dye imagine on your rosiest days that im anywhere near fluent in french lewrie wryly pointed out christ i was damn lucky tget through latin and greek at school and most o that was on paper not spoken i read french even worse than i speak it and if ye wish charite tmake heads or tails of it id need a translatin dictionary and a bilingual tutor first tread hers then twrite mine peel frowned heavily and puffed out his cheeks in a long exhale of frustration this was an emmerdement he had not preconsidered ehm she knew of your lack when you spied on her in new orleans peel hesitantly asked as if crossing his fingers we spoke in english lewrie told him with so many british or yankee doodles tradin in new orleans settlin upriver in the pine woods round baton rouge she and her kin couldnt avoid learnin but she despised them and english fluent though even in bed lewrie added with a faint smile of pleasant reverie james peel smiled back and raised an eyebrow in congratulatons so you would write her if you could peel said perhaps a reply in english which she understands would be more believable to her than any attempt on your part in french hmmm too many grammatical errors and misspellings in your poor french might make you look weak and clownish after all shes the one pleading with you for forgiveness hard to accept from an illiterate fool now i didnt exactly say id lewrie quickly objected and does she receive a letter in english and if it is ever found on her person in her effects it would be a death sentence peel cleverly pointed out then pretended to think better of it no wed hate to lose her access just after we get it better we alright lewrie suddenly declared liking the sound of death sentence and unable to think of anyone who could deserve it more you will peel asked surprised if its intercepted and they lop off her head thatd be fine with me lewrie said in a level tone though mr peel who had known him long enough to see the danger signs noted that lewries clear and merry greyblue eyes had gone as steelygrey as arctic ice damn the wishes of the crown or secret branch well i was going to plead that the intelligence she could give us would bring this war to a victorious end bring down the french empire and put napoleon bonaparte before a firing squad but if you are amenable ill not question your reasons peel mosthappily said with a broad grin and an air of relief uhm when could i expect it dont press lewrie sternly told him findin forgiveness for what she didll take some time and as you say itll have tring true it wouldnt if its rushed if my replys too quick and smuggled to her a week or two later shed know im lyin and then where would ye be ill think on it tomorrow lewrie said once back at sea i have more than enough time tponder it my dear alan i didnt expect to coach back to london tomorrow with it in my hand peel said with a laugh i my compatriots and the crown will be deeply in your debt though there was a bustle at the forward door as yeovill entered the greatcabins with a large covered metal barge evening sir supper is ready to be served capital lewrie declared before he tossed off the last dregs of his ale and rose to go to the table in the diningcoach i trust youve a hearty appetite mister peel come take a seat the rest of the evening passed in a much cheerier manner with peel regaling lewrie with the latest london doings and lewrie describing the details of the raid on boulogne complete with all the bravery of his officers and mids and what a partially amusing folly it had turned out to be in turn peel related a recent visit to mr zachariah twiggs retirement estate at hampstead where lewries own father sir hugo had been visiting at the same time bitter enemies at loggerheads long before in the far east in the late s theyd become the best of friends as thick as thieves in their later ages twigg the old cutthroat crown agent and sir hugo the rakehellish were mad for threehorse chariots though they were both old enough to know better and raced each other daily like the idlest henheaded young blades who thought themselves immortal terrorising the county thereabouts and all accompanied by shrimp remoulade a drippybacon salad a guinea hen apiece and a slab of beefsteak each slathered with a bearnaise sauce that yeovill had whipped up washed down of course by several bottles of wine peel departed a little before lights out at one bell of the evening watch at pm in fine fettle and halfway foxed lewrie took a last glass of brandy back to his desk in the daycabin and sat staring off at nothing while pettus and jessop finished cleaning up and stowing away and readying his bedcot for sleep he brooded shaking his head now and again in amazement that peel would even think to ask him to write charite de guilleri in even more amazement that hed even thought to agree much less to promise that he would chalky gave out a preparatory here i come murf before leaping atop the desk and butted under lewries free hand for pets toulon sat by lewries right boot whining for a little cooperation so lewrie turned to offer his thigh for a steppingstone a second later his heavier blackandwhite ramcat was in his lap kneading the front of his waistcoat purring lustily lewrie gave up brooding to stroke them both smiling and glad to have their company and affection and the chance to turn all of his attention to them and nothing else for a long moment dont chew on that chalky he chid the younger cat which had flopped onto one side and begun to claw at his letter to lydia drawing a corner to his sharpfanged mouth for a nibble chalky adored any balledup sheet of paper for footballs and chewtoys lewrie took it away from him and held it at midchest to reread what he had penned so far hed meant to finish it and send it ashore before peels arrival completed victualling and taking aboard fresh stocks of shot and powder now that is done i am promised by the port admiral that i can place the ship out of discipline for at least two days giving the people a welldeserved and muchneeded carouse most happily the weather remains bad and the winds remain foul dead muzzlers precluding sailing so do come down soonest and i imagine that we will be in port even longer that was where he had been forced to break off when peel arrived make way lads lewrie told the cats as he scooted his chair closer to the desk opened the ink well and took up his steelnibbed pen once more these last few months had been a trial the details of which i cannot trust to paper but will gladly speak of do i have the pleasure of imparting it all to you one whom i trust has a sympathetic ear for a poor sailors talessome parts may be deemed amusing now theyre past and done most of all i am in need of your genial company whether my tales are amusing or not make all haste without risk to your pretty neck of course i have arranged for shore lodging for you know that i shall burn with anticipation til your reply to my offer and to your arrival should you agree to come down to portsmouth most passionately and affectionately alan aboard hms reliant portsmouth harbour november th peace now catlings he pled as he sanded and dried the letter then folded it over they sat as intent as buzzards over an expiring eland as he fetched sealing wax and his ornate new brass signet stamp from the desk and melted a wax stick over the candle he got a large blob of red wax dripped over the corners of the folds then pressed his stamp down into it forming an emblem of shield topped with helmet his bloody escutcheon i still think its damned foolishness he muttered eying the result before taking up his pen again to inscribe lydias name and address on the backside as he brushed glue from a small pot on the last of his stamps he thought of sending it ashore by the next passing guard boat but no he would take it ashore himself in the morning to be sure that it went into the london mail bags and not be lost in a midshipmans pockets or soaked illegible in the rain after stowing glue pot wax and stamp in the desk he mused over the completed letter for a moment before placing it out of harms way in a drawer too he took a sip of his brandy as reward feeling a stir of delight that hed soon see lydia again which stir abruptly vanished as he thought of that other letter hed promised to write tell that murderin bitch that i forgive her he gravelled to himself i never will but he recalled a jape that hed heard about what anxious mommas told their virgin daughters of how to act on their wedding nights lay back and think of england the things i do for king and country he whispered before he tossed off the last of his drink lay back and think of england indeed afterword readers may recall in lewries earlier misadventures that the british spent a lot of time effort and lives trying to wrest saint domingue haiti from the french because its wealth in sugar and its other exports were worth as much as all the other british west indies colonies combined when the french completed their last evacuations in november of the general feeling was sour grapes and if we cant have it then no other world power will eitherso there henceforth haiti would belong to its own people to make of it what they would which as weve seen hasnt amounted to much since yes there was a lt josiah willoughby a young officer whom william laird clowes in the royal navy a history from the earliest times to called one of the most gallant officers ever to serve under the british flag an actinglieutenant at the time aboard the hercule he went aboard the grounded french frigate chlorinde and worked her off before the haitians could set her afire with heated shot imagine my delight to discover him with the same surname that i chose for lewries rakehell father so long ago imagine lewries wariness to address the shared relations imagine josiah nisbet willoughbys dismay that he is blessedly distant kin to two utter rogues before they gave up saint domingue as a bad go the french had conducted a policy of genocide intending to slaughter every disaffected black in the colony and replace them with docile new slaves imported from africa quite a change from the heady proclamations of the early revolution when liberty equality and fraternity were the watchwords and slavery was condemned and intended to be abolished early french governors sent to the west indies before the war began in some of them partblack had declared freedom upon their arrivals in sad point of fact though the chaining together and drowning of several thousand blacks right there in cap francois harbour really happened and after the french were expelled the victorious exslave generals dessalines christophe clairveaux petion and moise turned on each other as revolutionaries do and in the process all the petites blancs the lowerclass tradesmen and shopkeeper whites who had stayed hoping against hope were massacred in turn when lewrie and reliant returned to england in the spring of the freedom and survival of the nation were very much in doubt and england stood alone against the might of napoleon bonaparte and france after the savage drubbings that bonaparte had inflicted upon britains continental allies none of them were eager to jump into a new coalition against him and britain couldnt buy support from the austrians or anybody else no matter how much silver was offered to them the austrian empire was licking its wounds the kingdom of naples and the two sicilies had been overrun along with the rest of the italian states and some of them were firmly in bonapartes camp either from progressive jacobinrepublican enthusiasm or from conquered subject states which went along to get along the netherlands was the batavian republic and at war with england too the prussians had had the stuffing beaten from them and been rendered impotent and spain which had been a british ally in the first coalition had earlyon lost its zeal to crush antireligious antiroyalist divine right of kings and had become a french ally the royal navy had cut off their control of spains vast overseas empire and all their trade so spain was sitting things out toothough they would take hands with france again to their utter ruin in december of the damned fools england mightve turned to the baltic states like sweden denmark and russia under its new teenaged tsar alexander had england not destroyed the danish fleet at copenhagen in and cowed the others for details of which see baltic gambit a preceding alan lewrie adventure and a crackingood read if i do say so myself into backing down from their league of armed neutrality they were sore losers that summer of there sat napoleon bonapartes army just a few miles across the english channel massed round boulogne and adjacent harbours that were crammed to bursting with invasion vessels of all kinds and sizes as i described those caigues prames peniches and whatnots had to be reduced in numbers hence torpedoes believe it or not id strongly advise believe it there were trials done with cask torpedoes the american robert fultons coppersphere chainedtogether torpedoes and catamaran torpedoes of the size dimensions and explosive charges cited all were what we would today properly call drifting mines for they had no motive power and were to be carried in by a strong making tide as they proved at their use during the assault on boulogne in october of they were all prettymuch duds on the night of october ndrd clowess history of the royal navy says that only five catamaran torpedoes got released but hey six is a nice round number the last of them did not go off til around am and the only french vessel which was actually badly damaged or sunk was peniche number one of those armed launches which had the misfortune to stumble across a torpedo that had drifted in decksawash and drew their curiosity just as they came alongside it with much headscratching sacre bleuing and mort de ma vieing its recalcitrant clockwork timer pulled the trigger line and blew no to kindling killing its commander and thirteen crewmen lieutenant clarence spendloves worries about the use of torpedoes along with those horribly inaccurate congreve rockets famed later as the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air gave bonaparte and france an invaluable propaganda plum which they touted worldwide to nighunanimous outrage and revulsion against perfidious albion in those days people and nations took matters of honour much more seriously than we enlightened and politically correct folk of later centuries one did not indiscriminately bombard cities and civilians indeed there were many in england even with their backs to the wall by that point who were disturbed and there were many who could see the other side of the coin if england used such sneaking and low weapons such as torpedoes and shelled harbours with seamortars and rockets how long would it be before the french or someone else employed such hellish engines against great britain anyway after the attack on boulogne the french protected their harbours and their hundreds of invasion craft which had to anchour outside the breakwaters with long chainandlog booms to catch fireships unmanned explosive boats and torpedoes before they could burst among their vessels making any further attempts fruitless those two ufolooking barges designed by monsieur forfait that lewrie took as prize off normandy were real too and built in the same numbers cited i could find no contemporary drawings of them but i did have good written descriptions of their two types and sizes the number of troops to be carried and the crews to sail them their sets of large fat paddles with which to beach them and so on an english spy in paris mr paul sullivan sneaked out a report on them to admiralty an unnamed british admiral who inspected one called them contemptible and ridiculous craft and even a knowledgeable french academician m denis decres sneered that they were monstrous ideas which are as wrong as will prove to be disastrous in actual fact a royal navy vessel did capture one of them and brought it in for inspection though neither clowes nor robert harveys the war of wars said just who it was that did it so i took dramatic license and gave the honour to lewrie and god only knows that hes in more need of honourable deeds to polish up his repute than most so heres our hero at the tailend of a momentous year shivering in the november chill shivering also in some dread that bonaparte might still have a go at invasion in shivering too in anticipation of a few days ashore with the fascinating and hellishlyrich lydia stangbourne should we believe him when he told james peel that he didnt give a toss for her dowry and has no plans for another marriage or might his new amour beguile him to the altar once more we must remember that alan lewrie can be so easily beguiled will lewrie ever be reconciled to the fact that for whatever use the government made of the tragic murder of his wife caroline by the french he really is captain sir alan lewrie knight and baronet justly and honourably earned or not and what will he write to that expirate that murderous mlle charite de guilleri is her offer to play spy really a clever french ploy to pass along harmful disinformation to his majestys government or might she really be sincere in her vow to punish the emperor napoleon bonaparte for selling her beloved new orleans and louisiana to the odious americans and ending her dreams for a french creole empire in the new world and now that his experiments with all forms of torpedoes are over where will the new year of take alan lewrie hms reliant and his men and into which new and fascinating young miss might a change of latitude take his randy first officer lieutenant geoffrey westcott and will lewrie get any ideas in that direction too one wee hintits warmer climes than english home waters til next year god willing stay wellread
