jeffery deaver the lesson of her death copyright book with every passing mile her heart fled a little more the girl nine years old sat slumped in the front seat rubbing her finger along the worn beige armrest the slipstream from the open window laid a strip of blond hair across her face she brushed it away and looked up at the unsmiling grayhaired man of about forty he drove carefully with his eyes fixed beyond the long white nose of the car please the girl said no she put her hands into her lap maybe when he stopped at a red light she would jump out maybe if he slowed down just enough would it hurt she wondered to leap from the car into the tall grass beside the road she pictured herself tumbling through the green blades feeling the cold sprinkle of dew on her face and hands but then what where would she run to the first click of the turn signal interrupted these thoughts and the girl jumped as if a gun had fired the car slowed and rocked as it pulled into the driveway aiming toward a low brick building she realized that her last hope was gone the car eased to a stop brakes squealing like a sob give me a kiss the man said reaching over and pushing the buckle release the seat belt retracted she held on to the nylon like a lifeline i dont want to please sarah just for today please no dont leave me out you go im not ready do the best you can im scared theres nothing to be dont leave me look his voice grew stony im going to be right nearby just over at blackfoot pond thats hardly a mile away her inventory of excuses was depleted sarah opened the car door but remained sitting give me a kiss she leaned over and kissed her father quickly on his cheek then climbed out of the car standing in the cool spring air heavily scented with bus exhaust she took three steps toward the building watching the car pull out of the driveway she thought suddenly about the garfield toy stuck to the back window of the family station wagon sarah remembered when shed placed it there licking the cups before squeezing them against the glass for some reason this memory made her want to cry maybe he would catch a glimpse of her in the mirror change his mind and return the car vanished behind a hill sarah turned and entered the building clutching her lunch box to her chest she shuffled through the corridors although she was as tall as any of the children swarming around her she felt younger than them all tinier weaker at the fourthgrade classroom she stopped sarah looked inside her nostrils flared and she felt her skin prickle with a rash of fear she hesitated only for a moment then turned and walked resolutely from the building buffeted and jostled as she forced her way through the oncoming stream of shouting calling laughing children not thirty feet from where they had found the body last night he saw the note the piece of paper pierced by a wild rose stem the shade of dried blood fluttered in the moist wind sending out a morse code in the low morning sunlight bill corde pressed toward the paper through a tangle of juniper and maple saplings and stubborn runners of forsythia had they missed it how could they he barked his shin on a hidden stump and swore softly but continued toward the scrap corde was six foot two and his short hair was persiancat gray which because he was just about to turn forty made him maybe seveneighths premature his skin was pale the month being april and corde having been fishing only twice so far that season he looked lean from a distance but his belt curled outward more than he would have liked cordes most strenuous sport these days was gentlemens softball this morning as always his new lebanon sheriffs department shirt was clean and stiff as a sheet of new balsa wood and his beige slacks had razor creases corde was by rank a lieutenant and by specialty a detective he remembered this place not twelve hours before last night lit only by the deputies flashlights and the edgy illumination of a halfmoon he had sent his men to scour the ground they were young and austere the ones trained in the military or young and arrogant state police academy grads but they were all earnest although they were virtuosos at dui arrests and joyridings and domestics what the deputies knew about murder they had learned mostly from pulp thrillers and tv just like they knew about guns from stubbly autumn fields not from the state pistol range up in higgins still they had been ordered to search the crime scene and they had doggedly and with fervor but not one of them had found the piece of paper toward which bill corde now struggled through thick brush oh you poor girl who lies at the foot of a tenfoothigh earth dam who lies in this chill wet dish of mud and low grass and blue flowers whose dark hair is sideparted whose face is long whose throat thick her round lips curl prominently each ear holds three wirethin gold rings her toes are lanky and their nails dark with burgundy polish who lies on her back arms folded over her breasts as if the mortician had already done her up the pink floral blouse is buttoned high her skirt extends so modestly below her knees tucked beneath her thighs we got her name here we go its jennie gebben shes a student last night bill corde had crouched down beside the body his knee popping and put his face next to hers the pearlish halfmoon was reflected in her dead but still unglazed hazel eyes he had smelled grass mud methane transmission fluid mint from her lips and perfume like pie spices rising from her cold skin he had stood and climbed to the top of the dam which held back the murky waters of blackfoot pond he had turned and looked down at her the moonlight was otherworldly pale specialeffects light in it jennie gebben seemed to move not living human movement but shrinking and curling as if she were melting into the mud corde had whispered a few words to her or to whatever remained of her then helped the men search the ground now in the morning brilliance he pushed his way through a final tangle of forsythia and stepped up to the rosebush with his hand inside a small plastic bag corde pulled the paper from the russet thorns jim slocum called the whole shebang corde did not answer him the boys from the department had not been careless last night they could not have found this scrap of paper then because it was a clipping from the mornings register slocum asked again the whole uhm place corde looked up and said the whole thing yeah slocum grunted and continued unwinding yellow policeline tape around the circle of wet earth where the girls body had been found slocum after corde was the next senior new lebanon town deputy he was a muscular man with a round head and long ears hed picked up a razorcut hairstyle in complete with sideburns and had kept it ever since except for theme parks hunting trips and christmas at the inlaws slocum rarely left the county today he whistled a generic tune as he strung the tape a small group of reporters stood by the road corde would give nothing away but these were rural news hounds and well behaved they looked all filled up with reporters zeal but they left the two officers pretty much alone content to shoot snaps and study the crime scene corde figured they were sponging up atmosphere for tomorrows articles which would brim with adjectives and menace corde lowered the newspaper clipping now wrapped in the plastic bag and looked around him from the dam off to his right the ground rose to a vast forest split by route a highway that led to the mall then to a dozen other county roads and to a halfdozen state highways and to two expressways and eventually to fortynine other states and two foreign countries where a fugitive killer might hide till the end of his days pacing corde looked over the forest his lips pressed tightly together he and slocum had arrived five minutes before at eightthirty the register started hitting stores and porches at about sevenfifteen whoever had left the clipping had done so in the past hour listening to the hum of wind over a strand of taut barbed wire he scanned the ground beneath the rosebush it was indented by what seemed like two footprints though they were too smeared to help in identification he kicked over a log that appeared newly fallen a swarm of insects like tiny armadillos scurried away striding to the top of the dam he placed his hands on green metal pipes sunk into the dirt as a railing he squinted deep furrows into his forehead as he looked through the morning sunlight that crackled off the windroughed water of the pond the woods stretched away from him endless acres encased in a piercing glare listen he cocked his head and pointed his ear at the stream of light footsteps he gazed once again into the heart of the forest he lifted his hand to his eyebrows to shade the sun yet still the light dazzled it stung his eyes he could see everything and he could see nothing where when he lowered his palm it came to rest on the grip of his service revolver she ran most of the way the route from new lebanon grade school to blackfoot pond was three miles along which she was forbidden to walk on but only a halfhour through the forest and that was the path she took sarah avoided the marshy areas not because of any danger she knew every trail through every forest around new lebanon but because she was afraid of getting mud on the shoes her father had polished the night before shiny as a birds wings and on her roseprint knee socks a christmas present from her grandmother she stayed to the path that wound through oak trees and juniper and pine beds of fern far off a bird called ahhooeeeee sarah stopped to look for it she was warm and took off her jacket then rolled up the sleeves of her white blouse and unbuttoned the collar she ran on as she approached blackfoot pond she saw her father standing with mr slocum at the far end of the water two or three hundred feet away through the thickest part of the forest their heads were down it looked as if they were searching for a lost ball sarah started toward them but as she stepped out from behind a maple tree she stopped she had walked right into a shaft of sunlight so bright it blinded her the light was magical golden yellow and filled with dust and steam and dots of spring insects that glowed in the river of radiant light but this was not what made her hesitate in a thicket of plants beside the path she saw she thought she saw someone bending forward watching her father with the light in her eyes she couldnt tell whether it was a man or woman young or adult maybe it was just a bunch of leaves and branches no she saw movement it was somebody her curiosity suddenly gave way to uneasiness and sarah turned away off the path starting downhill to the pond where she could follow the shoreline to the dam her cautious eyes remained on the figure nearby and when she stepped forward her gleaming black shoe slipped on a folded newspaper hidden under a pile of dry leaves a short scream burst from her mouth and she reached out in panic her tiny fingers found only strands of tall grass which popped easily from the ground and followed her like streamers as she slid toward the water corde called to slocum you hear anybody over that way thought i might have slocum lifted off his smokey the bear hat and wiped his forehead some footsteps or rustling anything now nope corde waited four or five minutes then walked down to the base of the dam and asked you through yessiree slocum said we head back now ill be taking a midwest puddle jumper over to st louis to talk with the girls father should be back by three or so i want us all to meet about the case at four fourthirty at the office you stay here until the crime scene boys show up you want me just to wait not do anything theyre due here now shouldnt be long but you know the county could be an hour slocums way of protesting was to feed you bits of information like this we gotta keep it sealed jim you want slocum didnt look pleased but corde wasnt going to leave a crime scene unattended especially with a gaggle of reporters on hand i just dont want to get into a situation where im sitting here all day i dont think itll a crackle of brush footsteps coming toward them the officers spun around to face the forest cordes hand again fell to his revolver slocum dropped the tape which hit the ground and rolled leaving a long thick yellow tail behind it he too reached for his pistol the noise was louder they couldnt see the source but it was coming from the general direction of the rosebush that had held the clipping daddy she ran breathlessly toward him her hair awash in the air around her beads of sweat on her dirty face one of her knee socks had slipped almost to her ankle and there was a thick streak of mud along a leg and arm sarrie my sweet lord his own daughter hed had his hand on his gun and hed been five seconds away from drawing on her oh sarah what are you doing here im sorry daddy i felt all funny i got to school and i thought i was going to be sick rehearsed the words stumbled out in a monotone jesus lord corde crouched down to her he smelled the scent of the shampoo she had received in her easter basket not long ago violets you should never never be where daddys working you understand that never unless i bring you her face looked puffy with contrition she glanced at her leg then held up her dirty forearm i fell corde took out his sharpironed handkerchief and wiped the mud off her limbs he saw there were no cuts or scrapes and looked back into her eyes there was still anger in his voice when he demanded did you see anyone there were you talking to anybody in the woods the fall had not bought the sympathy shed expected she was frightened by her fathers reaction he repeated answer me what was the safest answer she shook her head you didnt see anyone she hesitated then swallowed i got sick at school corde studied her pale eyes for a moment honey we talked about this you dont get sick you just feel sick a young reporter lifted a camera and shot a picture of them corde stroking a slash of blond hair out of her eyes corde glared at him its like i have pitchforks in my tummy you have to go to school i dont want to i hate school her shrill voice filled the clearing corde glanced at the reporters who watched the exchange with varying degrees of interest and sympathy come on get in the car no she squealed im not going you cant make me corde wanted to shout with frustration young lady get in that car im not going to tell you again please her face filled with enormous disappointment now when sarah saw her plan wasnt going to work she walked toward cordes squad car corde watched half expecting her to bolt into the forest she paused and scanned the woods intently sarah she didnt turn her head she climbed into the car and slammed the door kids corde muttered find yourself something slocum asked corde was tying a chain of custody card to the bag containing the newspaper clipping he had found he signed his name and passed it to slocum the brief article was about last nights killing the editor had been able to fit only five paragraphs of story into the newspaper before deadline the clipping had been cut from the paper with eerie precision the slices were perfectly even as if made by a razor knife auden coed raped murdered was the headline the picture accompanying the story had not been a photo of the crime scene but was a lift from a feature story the register had run several months ago about a church picnic that corde had attended with his family the cut line read detective william corde chief investigator in the case shown here last march with his wife diane and children jamie and sarah damn bill slocum was referring to the words crudely written in red ink next to the photograph they read jennie had to die it could happen to them they climbed the stairs slowly one man feeling the luxurious carpet under his boots the other not feeling a single thing at all outside the wind howled a spring storm enveloped this lush suburb though inside the elegant house the temperature was warm and the wind and rain seemed distant bill corde hat in hand boots carefully wiped watched the man pause in the dim hallway then reach quickly for a door knob he hesitated once again then pushed the door inward and slapped the light switch on you dont have to be here corde said gently richard gebben did not answer but walked into the middle of the pink carpeted room where his daughter had grown up shes going to be all right gebben said in a faint voice corde had no idea whether he meant his wife who was in the downstairs bedroom drowsy from sedatives or his daughter lying at the moment on a sensuously rounded enamel coroners table two hundred miles away going to be all right richard gebben was a crewcut businessman with a face troubled by acne when young he was midwestern and he was middleaged and he was rich for men like gebben life moves by justice not fate corde suspected the mans essential struggle right now was in trying to understand the reason for his daughters death you drove all the way here yourself gebben said no sir took a commuter flight midwest air gebben rubbed the face of his rolex compulsively across his pocked cheek he touched his eyes in an odd way and he seemed to be wondering why he was not crying corde nodded toward her dresser and asked may i i remember when she left for school the last time she was home thanksgiving im sorry her dresser id like to look through it gebben gestured absently corde walked to the bureau but did not yet open it thanksgiving shed left the bedclothes all piled up in a heap after shed gone to the airport jennies mother came up here and made the bed and arranged it just like that corde looked at the three pinkandwhite gingham pillows on top of the comforter a plush dog with black button eyes sticking his head out from under them my wife she took a long time to arrange the dog gebben took several deep breaths to calm himself she the thing about jennie was she loved what was he going to say loved life loved people loved flowers kittens poetry charities gebben fell silent perhaps troubled that he could at this moment think only of the cheapest clichés death corde knew makes us feel so foolish he turned away from gebben to jennies dresser he was aware of a mix of scents she had a dozen bottles of perfume on the mirrored dressing table the lair du temps was full a bottle of generic cologne nearly empty he lifted it looked at the label and set it down his hand would retain for days the sharp spicy smell which he recalled from the pond last night the bureau contained nothing but clothes above it a hundred postcards and snapshots were pinned to a corkboard jennies arm twined around the waists of dozens of boys faces different poses similar her dark hair seemed to be darker in summer though that might be a trick of kodak convenience photography she often wore it pinned back her sport was volleyball and a dozen pictures revealed her playing the game with lusty determination on her face corde asked if he could have one of these a closeup of jennie pretty face glossy with sweat gebben shrugged how corde hated this part of the job walking straight into the heart of peoples anguish corde touched several recent snapshots of the girl with friends gebben confirmed that all of them were away at other schools all except emily rossiter who was jennies current roommate at auden corde saw her high school id card ticket stubs from a cowboy junkies concert a bon jovi concert a billy joel concert a paula poundstone show a greeting card with a silly cartoon rabbit on the front offered her congratulations on passing her driving test corde pulled the chair away from her desk and sat he surveyed the worn desktop in front of him nicked scratched marked with her doodlings he saw a bottle of india ink a framed picture of jennie with a scruffy cocker spaniel a snapshot of her coming out of church one recent spring maybe at easter blue crocuses at her feet she died on a bed of milky blue hyacinths in a lopsided clay cup was a chewed yellow pencil its eraser worn away corde lifted it feeling beneath the thick pads of his fingers the rough indentations and the negative space of jennie gebbens mouth he rubbed the wood thinking that it had once been damp from her he replaced the pencil he went through her desk which held high school assignments squares of wrapping paper old birthday cards no diaries or letters gebben focused on the detective i dont know thats where theyd be he nodded toward the desk corde again looked carefully no threatening letters no notes from spurned boyfriends no personal correspondence of any kind he examined the closet swinging aside the wealth of clothes and checking the shelves he found nothing helpful and closed the double doors corde stood in the middle of the room hands on his hips looking around him was she engaged have a steady boyfriend here gebben was hesitating she had a lot of friends nobodyd hurt her everybody loved her did she break up with anybody recently no gebben said and shrugged in such a way that corde understood the man had no idea what he was saying anybody have a crush on her nobody who knew jennie would hurt her gebben said slowly then he added you know what i was thinking since i got the call i havent told anybody ive been working up courage for all those people her grandparents her friends my brothers family jennies still alive for all they know shes sitting in the library studying ill leave you now sir if you can think of anything that might help us id appreciate a call and if you find any letters or a diary please send them to me as soon as you can theyd be very important he handed gebben one of his cheap business cards gebben studied the card he looked up sloeeyed and earnest its going to be all right he said this with such intensity that it seemed as if his sole purpose at the moment was to comfort bill corde wynton kresge sat in his office in the main administration building of auden university the room highceilinged paneled in oak was carpeted in navy blue pretty much the same color as that in his cutlass supreme though this pile was twice as thick his desk was a large mahogany piece occasionally when he was on the phone listening to someone he had no desire to be listening to which was pretty often kresge would imagine ways to get the desk out of the office without knocking a hole in the wall on particularly slow days he actually considered trying to remove it he would have been a good candidate for this project kresge was six foot four and weighed two hundred and sixty pounds his upper arms measured fifteen inches around his thighs were twentyfour and only a minor percentage of those dimensions was fat he had never lifted a barbell in his life but had retained much of the muscle he cultivated when he was a college linebacker for the tigers not the missouri tigers the dan devine tigers the top of the desk held one telephone with two lines one brass lamp one blotter one leather desk calendar opened to this week one framed photo of an attractive woman seven framed photos of children and one piece of paper the paper held down by kresges massive hand as if he were afraid it would blow away contained the following words jennie gebben tuesday ten pm blackfoot pond mcreynolds dorm lovers students teachers robbery rape other motive susan biagotti beneath this was an awkward diagram of the campus and the pond and the road around it kresge touched his earlobe with the butt of his schaeffer sterling silver ballpoint pen which he had polished just the night before and considered what hed written kresge drew additional lines on the paper crossing off words and adding others he was drawing a dotted line from the campus to the pond when a knock on the closed door made him jump by the time his secretary walked into the room without announcing herself further the piece of paper was wadded up and slamdunked into kresges wastebasket she wants to see you said the secretary a pretty woman in her late thirties she does the secretary paused then said youre holed up in here i beg your pardon she said i used to think that that phrase was hauled up like they hauled somebody up in a tower so he could escape from the police or something the police kresge asked but then i found out it was holed up like go into a hole i dont really know now she said now kresge nodded he unlocked his top drawer and from it took out a dark gray taurus mm semiautomatic pistol he looked to make certain there was a full clip in the grip of the gun then slipped it in a belt holster he left the room with what the secretary sensed though kresge himself did not was a look of intense almost theatrical determination on his face this was how she would build the house she would find some land there that beautiful field with the gold and white flowers in it there through the window surrounded by greensilver trees she could see from her cell the tall grass waving in a breeze soft as a kittens lazy tail then she would call her friends the animals and sarah are you with us her head snapped away from the window and she found thirtytwo children and one adult staring at her her breath escaped in a soft snap then stopped completely sarah looked at their eyes and felt her heart shudder then start to beat at a fast gallop i called on you come up here sarah sat still and felt the pure heat from her face flood into her arms and chest mrs beiderson smiled her face as sweet as sarahs grandmothers mrs beiderson smiled a lot she never raised her voice at sarah never shouted at her never took her hand and walked her to the principals office like she did the boys that drew pictures on their desks or fought mrs beiderson always spoke to sarah in a voice like a pussy willow sarah hated her more than anyone in the world sarah now come along this is just practice youre not being graded the girl looked at her desk inside was the pill her mother had given her but it wasnt time to take it yet now sarah sarah stood her hands at her sides too heavy to lift she walked to the front of the dungeon and turned to face the class she felt mrs beidersons smile pelt the back of her neck like a whip of snakes she glanced at the trees outside the window oh the freedom of the trees she could smell the bark she could feel the fuzz on the bottom of an elf cap growing up through ivy she could see the doorway to the secret tunnel in her house looking out over her classmates faces she saw priscilla witlock laughing dennis morgan twisting up his fat lips into a mean grin brad mibbock rolling his eyes laughter roaring so loud it struck her face and stung she saw boys holding fists above their youknows and moving them up and down she saw girls with long red fingernails and dangling bracelets girls her age but with round perfect breasts and sleek makeup and high heels girls taunting her and mrs beiderson who saw only the bored faces of her class and heard nothing but sarahs whimpering said sarah your word is clarify the sound hit sarah with the jolt of a schoolyard punch her daddy had helped her with this word but she knew it had several updown letters which were very hard for her she began to cry youve done it before smiling mrs beiderson said in her soft lying cheating snaky voice youre not trying sarah we all have to try mrs beiderson touched the rose cameo at her throat clarify is on the list didnt you study the list sarah nodded if you studied the list then theres nothing to cry about now everyone would know she was crying even the students in the back i cant you dont want us to think youre being difficult do you clarify between sobs sarah said c very good the snake smiled her knees quivered i dont know i dont more tears whats the next letter i dont know try ca mrs beiderson exhaled a sigh all right sarah sit i could do it at home down anyone else and priscilla witlock didnt even rise from her seat but was staring right at sarah slinging out the letters c then l then a then r spelling the word in the time it took sarah to take a huge gulp of air to try to quench her fear and then she felt it first a trickle then a flood as her panties grew wet and she put her hand downthere to stop herself but knowing it was too late the flowing warm moisture running around her leg and mrs beiderson saying oh dear oh dear and some of the class looking away which was as bad as the rest of the class staring as bad as knowing the story would be all over town and everybody would know even her grandfather up in heaven would know sarah threw her arms around herself and ran to the door pushing it open with her shoulder the glass burst into a spiderweb of cracks she leapt down the stairs two at a time and ran blindly down the corridor to the front door of the school leaving on the linoleum the swirls and drips of her shame like fragments of the letters that had beaten her once again the woman said whatever has to be done and i mean it dean catherine larraby was fiftyfive and if you squinted looked like margaret thatcher gray hair round face stocky reassuring jowls eyes tired but severe a coolness around the edges that bill corde thought was permanent and had not arisen with the killing she had not applied her makeup well and the powder had accumulated in the creases around her mouth and on her forehead he breathed deeply he was still queasy from the bumpy flight back from st louis and more so from the frantic drive from the county airport to make this meeting through the windows of her breezy office corde saw the manicured grass of the quadrangle bordered with luminous green trees students walked along the sidewalks and paths it seemed to corde that they moved in slow motion he remembered college as much more frantic he was constantly hurrying walking briskly into class sweating unprepared a man appeared in the doorway a tall heavyset black man ah the dean said detective corde wynton kresge head of campus security corde shook his callused wad of hand and did a double take when kresges expensive suit coat swung open revealing the nononsense automatic pistol the dean looked at kresge but when she spoke it was to the sixteen thousand parents of her eight thousand wards weve got to catch this man were going to catch him corde said id like to start interviewing jennies friends and professors as soon as possible the deans stubby fingers aligned a pen three times of course she said after a moment is that necessary corde took out a stack of blank threebyfive cards id like to ask some preliminary questions i have an address for her mcreynolds hall thats correct right she was gdi kresge answered the dean frowned corde began to write he printed his notes and used only capital letters which with their many curved strokes gave a vaguely oriental appearance to his handwriting gdi thats a sorority no kresge explained gdi is what the dormies call themselves people who arent in frat or sorority houses it means god damn independents the dean kept staring at him and kresge said well thats what they say the dean said there are so many implications corde said i beg your pardon we may get sued she said when i talked to her father last night he said he may sue the university i told him it didnt happen on campus it didnt kresge said happen on campus i mean corde waited a respectful time for either of them to make some point then continued id like a list of all the residents and employees handymen and so on in that hall its a very large dorm the dean said that might cause i dont know panic and also her professors and students in all her classes corde noticed dean larraby wasnt writing any of this down he heard rustling next to him kresge was jotting notes with a silver pen in a soft leather diary corde asked id like to know if she was seeing a therapist or counselor and id like a list of any employees of the school convicted of violent crimes as icily as a deposed prime minister dean larraby said im sure we dont have any youd be surprised corde said ill find out kresge said ill guarantee you that we have no criminals on our staff probably not corde said agreeably he turned to kresge youre going to be my contact here sure corde shuffled his index cards he said to kresge if you could get this info to me asap no problem detective kresge said and id be happy to interview some of the students for you or the professors i know a lot of them personally and corde found hed been ignoring kresge he looked up and smiled sorry when kresge repeated his offer corde said not necessary thanks im just saying if you need a hand corde turned to the dean id like a room of some kind dean larraby asked room for the interviews wed prefer to do it on campus kresge said the student unions got a lot of activity rooms corde marked a note on one of his cards book one for me would you there was a slight lapse before kresge said will do detective the deans voice contained an element of desperation both men looked at her she put her hands flat on the desk as if she were about to rise and lecture her fingers touched the wood with twin clicks and corde noticed rings a thick purple stone on her left hand an even larger yellow one on her right presents to herself corde thought we have a contradictory problem here she said you read the register you must know this schools in the midst of a fiscal crisis our enrollment is the lowest its been in twentythree years she smiled humorlessly the baby boomers have come and gone corde did read the register he had no idea what shape the finances of auden university were in its of course in our interest to find the man who did this as fast as possible but we dont want it to appear that were panicked ive already gotten a call from one of the schools benefactors hes quite concerned about what happened corde looked at her blankly when benefactors get concerned detective i get concerned kresge said weve beefed up security patrols in the evening corde said that was good the dean continued as if neither had spoken were getting applications now for the fall term and theyre running much lower than wed expected she caressed her cheek with her little finger and missed an uneven streak of prime minister makeup by a millimeter isnt it most likely detective that it was a drifter or somebody like that somebody not related to the school kresge said we cant assume anything dean the dean was ignoring kresge too she was his boss and could do a better job of it than corde corde said we just dont know anything at this point kresge said one thing i wanted to mention the biagotti killing the dean clucked wynton susan lived offcampus she was killed in a robbery attempt isnt that what happened detective susan biagotti it seemed to be a robbery i recall the dean continued the school had nothing to do with it so it was never solved dean kresges baritone droned i was just speculating why bring it up corde said to both of them i dont think theres any connection but ill look into it there was no connection the dean said sourly yes maam im sure thats the case now the sooner i get back to work the sooner well catch this fellow youll get that information william wynton sorry uhn detective i wanted to ask you something about motives for this type of crime i corde said im sorry im running pretty late if you could just get me as much of that information as you can in the next hour or so id appreciate it and the room dont forget the room kresges spacious unsmiling face nodded slowly youll get it when you want it diane corde pressed the phone tight against her ear she still held a grocery bag in one muscular arm oh no she listened for a moment longer then lifted the phone away from her mouth she called sarah sarah are you home silence broken only by the click and whir of the refrigerator no she hasnt come back yet when shes upset sometimes she hides in the woods diane cocked her head as she listened to sarahs teacher explain how concerned they all were mrs beiderson also added delicately that the girl had been daydreaming all morning before the practice test i sympathize mrs corde i really do but she simply must try harder shes bringing a lot of these problems on herself diane nodded at the phone finally she said the words that seemed to end so many of these conversations well talk to her about it well talk to her they hung up diane corde wore blue jeans and a burgundy cotton blouse with her high school graduation cross gold and glistening at her throat she looked like a pretty bornagain countrywestern singer her husband said she had thisaway hair because she wore it moussed up and brushed back wideshouldered and thinhipped diane had a figure that had pretty much withstood two children and fortythree years of gravity on her forehead was a small scar like a crescent moon which mimicked by half the end of the iron pipe shed run hard into when she was four diane set the groceries on the counter and returned to the back door to get her keys from the lock no keys she tried to recall she had hurried inside from the car when she heard the phone ringing she looked on hooks on counters at the bottom of her purse in the freezer it had happened more than once on the off chance that shed left them in the station wagon she walked outside and ducked her head through the open window they hung from the ignition she shook her head at her absentmindedness and plucked them out she started back to the kitchen she stopped cold one foot on the doorstep how had she gotten inside without the keys the back door had been open the dead bolt was the only lock on the door and it could be secured only with a key diane clearly remembered locking it when she left for the a p somebody had entered the house and left without bothering to relock the door bill had been a cop for twelve years and had made his share of enemies hed instructed the children a thousand times always to lock the door when they left but sarah of course could ignore a thousand stern warnings the girl had probably returned home to wash up after the incident at school then run outside to hide in her magic woods forgetting to lock the door ill have another talk with her but then diane decided no the girl had been through enough no scoldings today she returned to the kitchen dropped the keys into her purse and began to think about supper she sits in the woods hugging herself knees up to her lowered chin in the circle of magic stones sarah corde is now breathing slowly it has taken hours to calm down by the time she got here running the entire two miles from the school her dress and underpants were dry but still she feels dirty as if a sorcerer had thrown a potion on her she is no longer crying sarah lies back in the grass that she pulled out of the nearby field and spread in the circle like a bed she lifts the hem of her dress up to her waist as if the sunlight will clean the poison completely away and she closes her eyes sarah is sleepy her head grows heavy as a stone and she feels that she is floating in the moat of an old castle beiderbugcastle sarah looks up at the clouds a huge dog with wings big as the county a chariot pulled by a flying fish and there there a towering thunderhead is a god carrying a fierce club he wears golden sandals magic shoes that carry him high above this terrible place the earth as she falls asleep she pictures the god turning into a wizard when she wakes an hour or more has passed the chariot is gone the flying fish is gone the god with his club is gone but sarah finds that she has had a visitor she sits up pulling her skirt down then reaches forward cautiously and picks up bedford t redford the worlds smartest bear who sits beside her the shaggy face staring at her with humorous glassy eyes she left him that morning propped on her bed after she hugged him a tearful goodbye and left for school how he got here she has no idea in the ribbon around his collar is a piece of paper sarah unfolds it panicking for a moment as she sees that it contains words she must now read but then she relaxes and takes one word at a time after fifteen minutes of agonizing work she manages to read the entire note she is shocked and terrified by its message suspicious of words she decides she must have read it wrong she tries again and finds that no she read it correctly her first thought is that she could never do what the awkwardly printed letters suggest but as the girl looks around her at the dense woods where she has hidden so often after fleeing from school the woods in which she feels more at home than in her own living room that fear slowly fades and eventually becomes joyous anticipation sarah rises to her feet thinking that one part of the note certainly is true there really is nothing left for her to do the new lebanon sheriffs department was a small place four private offices for the sheriff for detectives corde and slocum and for emma the radio dispatchersecretary the central room contained eight gray gi desks for the deputies to the side was a long corridor that led to the two cells of the lockup on the wall was a rack containing three shotguns and five black ars the room was filled with enough unread and unfiled paper to go head to head with any smalltown law enforcement office in the country jim slocum fresh back from the pond looked up from his desk where he was reclining in a springbroken chair and reading the register sheriff steve ribbon stood above him ribbon solid and sunburnt red as the flesh of a grilled salmon was slapping his ample thigh with a book whats the pocket fisherman want now slocum raised an eyebrow damn mess he held up the paper like a crossing guard with a portable stop sign it was folded to the article on the gebben murder ribbon crooked his head to say yeah yeah i read it come on into my den would you jim slocum followed the sheriff five feet into his office ribbon sat slocum stood in the doorway thiss right clever we just reversed positions bill here ribbon asked he flew over to st louis this morning to talk to the girls father he did what flew up to st louis to talk to the girls ribbon said the girl was killed that girl whyd he do that for he think were made of money slocum chose not to answer for bill corde and said only he said he wants us all to meet about the case at four i think it was we gotta watch our pennies i hope he knows that anyway i wanted to kick something around with you this killings got me bothered i hear it wasnt a robbery doesnt seem to be i was noticing there were some parallels between what happened and a couple other cases id read about it occurred to me that we might have a cult killer problem here cult slocum asked carefully the book dropped onto the desk a paperback fanned from bathtub or hammock reading bloody rites on the cover were three blackandwhite photos of pretty girls over a color photo of a bloodspattered pack of tarot cards whatsis slocum picked it up i want you to read it i want you to think about it its about this satanist down in arizona a couple years ago a true story there are a lot of similarities between what happened here and that fellow slocum flipped to the pictures of the crime scenes you dont think its the same guy naw they caught him hes doing life in tempe but there are similarities ribbon stretched out the word its kind of scary damn they were goodlooking slocum gazed at the page of the book showing the victims high school graduation pictures ribbon absently stroked his black polyester tie and said softly what id like you to do is get yourself up to higgins the state police have a psychology division up there follow up with them on it you think slocum read a passage where the writer described what the arizona killer had done to one coed he reluctantly lowered the book and said ill mention it to bill naw you dont have to just call up the boys in higgins and get an appointment slocum grinned okay i wont fly what i wont fly up there why would you oh yeah haw the sheriff added we gotta make sure word gets around about this hows that ribbon said well we should make sure the girls in town are warned about it wouldnt that kind of tip our hand its our job to save lives too slocum flipped through the pictures again ribbon leaned forward and tapped the book hang on to that youll enjoy it its a real what do they say pageturner the incorporated town of new lebanon reluctantly owned up to its mouthful of a name by the time the village was chartered in the s all the good names the european capitals and harmonioussounding biblical locales had been taken the final debate had pitted the new lebanonites against new luxemburgians because the former had a respectful ring of old testament the vote was predictable the town was in harrison county named after william henry not because of his thirtyday term as president but for his tenure as indiana territory governor during which he decimated native indian tribes tippecanoe of campaignslogan fame and allowed counties like this his namesake to congeal into what they were today mostly white mostly protestant mostly rural new lebanons economy floated on milk corn and soybeans though it had a few small factories and one big printing plant that did a lot of work for chicago and st louis and new york publishers including the everscandalous and anticipated mon cher magazine scrap bin copies of which flooded the town monthly thick as shucked cobs at harvest also located in new lebanon was the only fouryear college for a hundred miles auden university goosed the town population up to fourteen thousand from august to may and gave locals the chance to sit through performances of secondtier orchestras and avantgarde theater companies which they boasted about being able to attend but rarely did the ncaa was about the only real contact between auden and the natives virtually none of whom could afford the seventeenthousanddollar tuition which bought you times four just a liberal arts degree and what the hell good was that the residents had ambivalent feelings towards the students the school was a bounty no denying thousands of young people with nothing to do but eat out go to movies and redecorate their dorm rooms and whats more there was a new brood of them every year just like hogs and veal calves and some locals even felt a nebulous pride when auden university economics professor andrew schoen appeared on meet the press or a book by english professor john stanley harrod was favorably reviewed in the new york times to which a grand total of fortyseven new lebanonites subscribed on the other hand auden was a burden these moneyshedding young people got drunk and puked and sneered and teepeed trees with toilet paper and broke plate glass they shamelessly bought trojans and ramses in front of gradeschool children they walked around looking important as bankers they burned effigies of politicians and occasionally a flag they were gay and lesbian they were jewish and catholic they were eastern bill corde was not a product of auden though he was of new lebanon born and reared here hed ventured away only for four years of service standing guard with his m over missiles in west germany and a few years in missouri as a patrolman then detective in the st louis police department he returned to new lebanon and after six months of feed and grain teaching sunday school and thinking about starting a contracting business he applied for a job at the town sheriffs department his experience made him a godsend to steve ribbon whose closest approximation to police training had been the air force he and his rifle had protected bs in kansas after a year as the departments oldest rookie corde was promoted to detective and became the towns chief felony investigator on the neat wall above his neat desk in the hundredandfouryearold town building were some framed documents a diploma from southwestern state university and certificates from the icmas police business administration institute of training in chicago as well as one from the southern police institute in louisville the proof was absent but he had also taken various fbi training seminars and courses in law and visual investigation analysis he had just returned from sacramento and a weeklong session at the california department of justice the certificates he had proudly tacked up were simple vouchers of completion corde was a bad student he collected words that described himself he was persistent he was industrious he had sticktoitiveness but bill corde was born cplus material and that didnt change whether the subject was one he hated english social studies or loved criminal psychology or linkanalysischarting techniques he wrote slowly and produced leaden meatandpotato reports and although as detective his official hours were pretty much eight to six he would often stay late into the night muscling through an article in forensics today or the journal of criminal justice or comparing the profiles of suspects in his cases with those in the naspds felony warrants outstanding bulletin some people in town that is to say the people who worked for him thought corde took his job too seriously new lebanon being a place where the state penal codes thousanddollar threshold between petty and grand larceny was not often crossed and four of last years six deaths by gunshot were from failing to open a bolt or breach when climbing over a fallen tree on the other hand cordes arrestperfelony rate was a pleasure to behold ninetyfour percent and his convictiontoarrest ratio was corde kept these statistics in a thirdhand ibm xt computer the departments major concession to technology he now finished reviewing the coroners preliminary report on jennie gebben and stood up from his desk he left the sheriffs office and strode across the hall to the lunchroom as he walked a quarter materialized in his hand and he rolled it over the back of one finger to the next and so on around and around smooth as a poolhall hustler his father had taught him this trick corde senior made the boy practice it with his hand extended over an old well on the back of the family property if he dropped a coin plop that was that and his father had made him use his own two bits corde had seen a lot on tv recently about mens relations with their fathers and he thought there was something significant about the way his father had taught him this skill he had learned a few other things from his old man his posture a loathing of second mortgages an early love of hunting and fishing and a more recent fear of the minds wasting before the body that was about all corde was real good at the coin trick he entered the lunchroom which was the only meeting place in the town building large enough to hold five brawny men sitting aside from the main meeting room which was currently occupied by the new lebanon sesquicentennial celebration committee he nodded to the men around the chipped fiberboard table jim slocum tt ebbans the lean exmarine felony investigator from the harrison county sheriffs department and new lebanon deputy lance miller at the far end of the table surrounded by two empty chairs was wynton kresge corde thought antsy as a tethered retriever on the first day of season he dropped the quarter into his pants pocket and stood in front of a row of vending machines he was about to speak when steve ribbon walked in corde nodded to him and leaned back against the coke machine howdy bill just want to say a few words to the troops about this case you dont mind the sheriffs ruddy face looked out over the men as if he were addressing a crowd of a thousand ribbon scrutinized wynton kresge who represented two oddities in this office he was black and he wore a suit kresge took the look for a moment realized he was being asked a question then said im from the college oh well ribbons voice enlarged to encompass everyone i just want to put my two cents in you all are the task force on this thing now bills in charge he looked at ebbans which i think is what sheriff ellisons agreeable to yessir said ebbans im just a hired hand here now between all of you ribbon continued you got a flatbed full of investigating experience his burdened gray eyes rose to cordes and im busiern a dog in a fire hydrant factory corde nodded sympathetically youre running and theres an election come november so i cant get as involved in the case as id like but keep remembering peoplere going to be watching us theyre going to be real curious how we do on this one so i want us to be pretty you know aggressive now ive been doing some research and im pretty bothered by this cult business corde was silent it was ebbans who asked cult what i want you to do is first come up with a profile of our killer jim slocum said in these situations thats what you always have to do wynton kresge wrote this down absolutely ribbon said i know we havent had any of these kinds of killers here in new lebanon before but i think its important for us to get up to speed what you have to do with cult murderers is peg them find out what makes them tick kresge scribbled rapidly corde glared at him and he stopped writing ribbon continued now a profile should include two things the physical description of our man one and whats going on in his mind two stuff like is he sexually repressed does he hate his mother does he have trouble you know getting it up was he beaten as a child corde who had a wellused ncavc criminal profiling flowchart tacked up on his wall nodded solemnly and let the embarrassment for his boss trickle off sounds important miller said and brushed his hand over his excessively short crew cut absolutely ribbon said ive been reading up on investigations like this one thing thats troubling is this moon business think about it she was killed on the night of the quarter moon that could be lunar fixation for you and this ones particularly troubling you know why because weve got two quarters and a full and a new so thats four potential strike windows whats that wynton kresge asked the question that corde had been about to ribbon said patiently thats the entire period when our mans likely to kill again in this case id say its from thirtysix hours in front of the full moon till thirtysix hours after corde and ebbans whod worked together on investigations for four years got to play the eyerolling game ah kresge said and wrote corde and ebbans played the game again well thats my two cents ill let you boys be do me proud and go catch this sickle ribbon left the room corde took center stage he searched for something politic to say all right i suppose we might be looking at the possibility of a serial killing here but i wouldnt go spreading that around we dont want to give anybody any ideas slocum seemed about to speak but remained silent and corde continued now im going to give us ten days to get a suspect under and i want an id within two or three from his st louis days corde remembered the fortyeightfour rule in homicide investigations if you dont identify the perp within fortyeight hours of a killing the odds are it will take at least four weeks to find him also slocum said the full moons coming up in seven days or so he was scanning a farmers almanac corde said delicately i think steves got a good point weve got to be aware of this moon business but we dont want to drop other leads because of it itll be something to consider is all corde opened the envelope kresge had brought and pulled out several sheets wynton here was good enough to bring us some dope on the victim and i want to go over it now corde also opened an envelope of his own he shook out the glossy photograph of jennie gebben on the volleyball court it showed clear eyes a competitive smile patches of sweat soaking her tshirt more throat than a girl that age would want he noticed in the photo two metal hoops in each ear when had the third hold been added he wondered corde handed the photo around miller glanced quickly then passed it on no corde said solemnly take a good look remember what she looked like miller was flustered for a moment then did what hed been told when the picture had made the rounds corde said i flew over to see her father this morning and he wasnt much help there were no diaries or letters i could find but hes going to keep looking he says he doesnt know of anybody who mightve wanted to hurt her but i put the bug in his ear and he might not know it but hes going to be looking at people at the funeral whos there and who isnt maybe hell remember a boyfriend or somebody who had a grudge against her kresge said thats why you went this soon to see him i was wondering why you did that you were corde asked absently he turned to the files that kresge had brought jennie gebben was twenty she was a junior at auden no loans or scholarships so i guess daddy paid for most of it she was an english lit major gpa two point nine seven say id like you to take notes on this slocum and miller picked up pens corde continued treasurer of the folklore club meals on wheels volunteer once a week early in the semester but she gave that up after a couple months worked three days a week in the office of the dean of financial aid her classes this semester were french reading iii her professor was dominique lefevre the civil war to the centennial taught by randolph sayles contemporary literary criticism by elaine adlerblum chaucer by robert ostopowiscz well thats a mouthful and heres another one the relation between psychology and literature the nineteenth and twentieth centuries her teacher there i mean her professor was leon gilchrist and a seminar group of that same class taught by brian okun finally the roots of naturalism charles gorney corde wondered momentarily what the courses were about corde had graduated in the top half of his class because his school had plenty of engineering courses he shuffled through the file kresge had brought him then stapled the class roster sheets together he set them aside kresge said excuse me corde glanced up yes just wanted to tell you i checked with the clinic she wasnt seeing a therapist and had only one visit this year it was to get antibiotics for bronchitis no therapist corde repeated the fact was recorded neatly on a threebyfive card he did not notice slocum and miller play a round of eye rolling also the security chief added personnel has a policy of never hiring exfelons so if there are any on staff they lied about it on their résumés ebbans asked was she ever up before the udb university disciplinary board kresge said she wasnt now corde said jotting down these facts as for the murder at around ten oclock on tuesday night she was raped and strangled possibly by someone she knew how could you tell that kresge asked and corde glanced at him with irritation look corde began ebbans answered kresge because she didnt run and because he got close enough to subdue her before she fought back how do you know that if shed fought thered be tissue under her nails kleenex slocum laughed ebbans said skin the mans skin oh kresge added but then if she knew him he probably wasnt a you know cult killer slocum lectured not so chief a good percentage of sacrifice killers know their victims oh i didnt know that the meeting was meandering away from corde he said emphatically we have a lot of unknowns here maybe robbery wasnt a motive but maybe it was maybe he got scared before he could take her valuables slocum laughed bill she had a diamond necklace when he was through doing it to her he couldve snatched it just like that he illustrated ripping a chain off his own neck wouldnt take more than two seconds ebbans said whats the coroner say about cod just what it looked like traumatic asphyxiation pinpoint hemorrhages in the eyes fractured hyoid our man used his hands at first then he finished with a wire or rope we didnt find any weapons the coroner said the man was a foot or so taller than her he wasnt so strong he had to rearrange his grip on her neck several times he did it from the front oh and the coroner guessed he wasnt married or he had a bad sex life with his wife whys that miller asked quantity of the semen probably hadnt had sex for four five weeks jim slocum said then you mean he had a good sex life with his wife miller laughed out loud the others except corde snickered corde looked at his cards fanned some out now what i want to do is focus on four areas first on the mall and on drivers along id like you to handle that jim its a tall order but thats a real busy road and we probably had some people coming home from the mall around ten that night corde jotted a note on an index card oh and check out if anybody picked up any hitchhikers now second tt i was thinking maybe you could hit the houses around the pond ebbans nodded and corde said third lance and ill set up shop at the school and start talking to students and employees yessir even sitting miller seemed to be at attention he reminded corde of a color guard marine what exactly well go over it later i also want you to talk to the phone company and find out what calls went out from the phones in the dorm from last saturday through tuesday night miller whistled softly must be a lot of students making a lot of calls wouldnt you think you would corde said and we need a warrant for the dorm room itll be pro forma but youve gotta do the paperwork right and finally i want all the prints on everything we found at the scene matched against known sex offenders in the county tt if you could coordinate that with your office will do ill order the printout wynton i dont suppose you folk fingerprint students and professors been my dream and desire but no we dont corde referred to his notes again and started to say something to kresge then paused he scanned everyones face one thing steve said is right the register and wral are going to be looking at this thing real close no talking to reporters refer everyone to me or steve or sheriff ellison echoes of yup or uhhuh filled the room corde turned back to the security chief you get us a room william uh wynton i mean in the student union off the cafeteria room you got it all week next too if you let me know by friday predate it kresge cleared his large throat with a snapping sound one thing i thought i should mention i was driving past the pond on my way to work this morning i just took a stroll around what time corde noticed something challenging in his own voice he wished hed used more of it sixthirty i left about seven you see anybody there yessir kresge said enthusiastically a con ed tent up the road forty yards past the dam you know the kind they use for emergency repairs and corde said they werent there last night they set up at five am branch took down a line i already checked oh kresge said with disappointment you see anybody else no he consulted his supple leather notebook theres a whole nother thing i wanted to bring up what you and i and the dean were talking about susan biagotti corde and ebbans exchanged looks but this time there was no eye rolling whos that miller asked rings a bell auden student killed last year ah right corde had been away on a joint countystate task force in fredericksberg for a month the case had landed in ribbons lap and by the time corde returned to new lebanon many leads had gone cold they had never even idd a suspect let alone made a case its my intention to look into it corde said abruptly like i told the dean ive got my own file on the case kresge said you want you can have a copy of it corde smiled in a meaningless way ill let you know if we need it as he rearranged his papers the plastic bag containing the clipping he had found that morning at the pond fell to the floor he stooped and picked it up he stood his knee didnt pop thirtynine years of knee five of it popping he wondered if hed gone and cured himself he passed the clipping around the table this is another thing we have to consider the deputies frowned with suitable concern as they read im sending it up to higgins for analysis today unless we find prints though or the rest of the paper it came from in somebodys back pocket i dont think itll help but you might want to keep an eye on yourselves and your families you know most threats like this are just cranks but you never can tell most threats kresge asked you mean this happens a lot corde hesitate then said actually its never happened ebbans looked up from the note then slid it back to corde i know something else about this guy he announced whats that jim slocum asked well you could nearly see the girl from the road even if you werent looking why didnt he drag her behind the truck at least then he came back in the morning to leave that note it was like he didnt care if anybody saw him that says to me hes a real gutsy fellow corde lifted the plastic bag away from miller gutsy he said or crazy either ways a problem by the time she approached her house sarah had memorized the note which now rested in her skirt pocket along with the five twentydollar bills that had been wrapped in it dear sarah i heard you fighting with your daddy today about school i know hell keep making you go back i want to help im just like you we both hate school you have to leave get away go to chicago or st louis theres nothing left for you to do youll be safe ill look out for you your friend this idea is not new to her sarah had thought of running away a dozen times last march the week before the arithmetic test she had spent an hour at the greyhound station working up courage to buy a ticket to grandmas place before her courage broke and in tearful frustration she returned home running away sarah paused at the front doorstep on tiptoe she saw her mother in the living room she ducked the motion made the paper in her pocket crinkle while she waited for her mother to leave the room she pulled out the money and studied the bills cautiously rubbing them as if they were pages from a book of witchs spells she folded them tight again and put them back into her pocket sarah corde nine years old cared nothing for school hopscotch simon says housework nintendo sewing cooking cartoons on tv but she believed fervently in magic and wizards and she believed that this message was from a particular wizard who had been watching out for her for years he was allknowing and he was kind and with all the money he was pretty darn rich too it seemed sarah was nobodys fool she was going to do exactly what the wizard suggested she also noted to her vast joy that although she would probably take this advice and go to chicago he had given her enough money to surely take her halfway around the world the front door slammed and the feet were up the six stairs in three fast thuds before diane could get to the front hall she dried her hands as she continued to the stairs pausing beside the coat rack and a wooden plaque of a goose wearing a blue bonnet and scarf she straightened it absently and called honey sarrie there was no answer a moments later honey come on down here a weak voice said im taking a bath mommy ill be down before supper honey mrs beiderson called silence sarah i want to take my bath mommy can we talk about it you know later like please come on out she told me what happened at school they continued this tugofwar for a few minutes diane slowly edging up the stairs toward the girls room there was no lock on the door but diane was reluctant to invade her childrens territory come on honey you can help me make dinner i dont want to sarah answered shrilly in these words diane heard reason start to shatter this was the time to back down no hysteria please not that sarahs attacks nailed her mother with tearful pity and they also made her seethe unable to distinguish between the moments sarah was truly panicked and the times she was faking diane invariably backed down coward the phone began ringing she glanced at it all right sarah well talk later as she walked into the kitchen diane noticed that it was five pm she knew who the caller would be she was married to him bill would ask about the kids and how dianes day had gone and then hed get suddenly sheepish and tell her he had to work late again every other day for the past month he skidded home just as supper was landing on the table and on more than a few occasions he had missed the evening meal altogether and worse news he now had a murder case she remembered seeing the thick black type of the headline in the register and reading the scant words about that poor dead student and feeling a wave of utter regret for herself as well as for the poor parents of the murdered girl she knew she was going to see even less of bill until the man was caught she picked up the beige phone it was not her husband she heard odd sounds in the background like eerie electronic rock music the sort she chided jamie for listening to she assumed it was one of his friends corde residence she said wholly polite thiss mrs corde the voice was tenorpitched but it seemed smoother than an adolescents more confident she knew all of jamies friends and this didnt sound like any of them yes this is she who is this say could you please turn that music down the volume of the music diminished youre jamies mother you want to speak to jamie im calling from new lebanon high im the senior advisor of the freshman section of the yearbook and this is really a hassle but we lost a bunch of the bio sheets of some of the students you know were way past the deadline and im calling people and filling in the forms over the phone well jamie wont be home for another couple hours could you just give me some information about him well i dont know diane said she knew the risks mothers ran making decisions for their teenage boys todays the last day we can get anything typeset what do you want to know whos his homeroom teacher this seemed harmless enough she said thatd be mr jessup and is he on any teams the advisor asked wrestling he also does gymnastics but he doesnt compete and hes going to do the triathlon next year triathlon so hes a bicyclist you cant hardly keep him off it hed ride it to the dinner table if we let him the boy laughed overloud at what he must have thought was a stupid joke he then asked what kind of bike does he have its italian a fifteenspeed i dont remember the name is it important no i guess not what clubs is he in science club and latin club he was in photo club for a while but he quit that to spend more time working out say will he have a chance to look this over not really no were going to press tomorrow but he wouldnt want just a blank space under his picture would he i guess not whats his favorite music video i have no idea his favorite movie i couldnt say how about his favorite groups groups music groups diane was disturbed to find how little of this she knew she said abruptly can you wait a moment then set the phone down and fled into his room she picked up several handfuls of tape cassettes and hurried back to the kitchen she read the labels into the phone tom petty uhm paul mccartney well i remember him of course ha then u and metallica and ice cube and run dmc whatever that is and hes got three tapes of this group geiger i guess theyre from germany everyone knows geiger well excuse me she continued i

yearbook coming out wont be long maybe ill bring jamies by myself the voice lowered a few tones id like to meet you diane laughed but silently she understood fragile adolescent pride well that would be very nice hit on by a high schooler maybe youve got some of the old allure after alleven if its just in your voice when he got the note hed been saying the phrase that some soldiers used was horizontal refreshment medical records tell us that at the height of the war nearly ten percent of union troops suffered from some form of vd associate dean randolph rutherford sayles took the slip of paper from the teaching assistant he recognized dean larrabys elegant scrawl as distinctive as her ubiquitously disquieting choice of words summoning him immediately to her office silence rose he found he was looking past the paper staring at the whorls and lines of the lectern at an ink stain in washington dc the south side of pennsylvania avenue contained dozens of houses of prostitution a locale where i believe a number of lobbyists now maintain offices sayles was in his trademarked posture standing both hands on the lectern hunched forward sayles nurtured a classic professorial vogue unkempt and preoccupied and tweedy flaunting this style in the face of brooks brothers chic passé on wall street but au courant in cambridge hyde park and ann arbor he had sandy hair that he kept unruly and would grin like the absentminded scholar he had never been when it flopped into his face and more astonishing there are hundreds of documented cases of women disguising themselves as soldiers and circulating among the men to provide sexual favors for a profit perhaps this is where the phrase military service arose these tidbits sounded frivolous but the students who had waited in line since six am on registration day to sign up for the civil war to the centennial loved them sayles had worked hard at perfecting his lecturing skills nothing was more important to him than bestowing knowledge he was tenured at thirty two years after his doctoral thesis was published and one year after his book the economics of freedom garnered a favorable times review and started its record sixmonth run as number one on the national association of historians recommended list as the war which both yanks and rebs truly believed would last no more than six months stretched on and on the moral thread of the resoundingly protestant and predominantly evangelical armies frayed more problematic was sayless second job as an associate dean which he did not enjoy at all but he was sophisticated enough to know that he could not survive forever without the yoke of administrative duties and he had struggled to master the perversity of collegiate infighting besides his bailiwick was the civil war and what better metaphor could there be for a college campus he was like grant marshaling forces and riding herd over a bunch of brilliant feisty generals that is students who drank too much whored too much or who railed loud against drinking and whoring while he somehow managed to fight a war and like grant sayles had happened to rise to this position at the most difficult time in the history of his institution but it wasnt until after the dynamic duo of defeat gettysburg and vicksburg that the southern troops embraced fundamentalist revivalism with a gusto a warm spring breeze eased through the auditoriums huge windows so high they could be locked and unlocked only with a twelvefootlong pole the class was half empty sayles considered the reason why attendance was poor and his eyes fell on a particular empty seat surrounded by a blossom of other vacancies ah yes the memorial service he had not had the strength to attend the only place he could possibly be was here the bell not an electronic wail but an oldfashioned clapper on steel rang and sayles dismissed the class he stood at the lectern while the class departed then he reread the deans note he too left the room and walked along a broad sidewalk campus buildings on one side the fiveacre quadrangle on the other to the universitys administration building on the second floor he entered a large anteroom he walked past the rooms only occupant a secretary with whom he had long ago had an affair a mousy woman with a bony face he vaguely remembered breasts like fat pancakes oh did you hear professor a student was without answering he nodded and walked past her into the large inner office he closed the door and sat in one of the oxblood leather chairs across from the deans desk randy she said we have a real problem he noticed her hand was resting on that mornings register the article about the murder was circled and above the headline was written dean larraby fyi he looked at bill cordes picture then back to the dean sayles said she was in my class dean larraby nodded without expecting any further response she closed whatever massive work she had been reading it appeared more legal than scholarly and pushed it to the corner of her desk her fingers caressed the edges of the purple stone on her left hand sayles said have you talked to the police what the police she responded querulously yes there was a detective here this man in fact she nodded at the paper he wanted to know all about the gebben girl the gebben girl sayles whose brilliance like that of many professors was in large part memory recollected perfectly how the dean had greeted him a few moments ago and asked what kind of problem what else did the police say the gebben girl student number the police thats not what im talking about she said this is serious ive finished meeting with the price waterhouse people there are no funds to move into the loans accounts what do you mean shock pummeled sayles the image of jennie gebben fell from his thoughts none but there was going to be an operating surplus this term he whispered i thought wed worked that out well she said testily there isnt oh how he hated her shed told him shed promised him there would be money the shock yielded to a maelstrom of anger he swallowed and looked out the window at the grassy quad whose sidewalks he had crossed perhaps ten thousand times the fact is the money isnt there what are we going to do his voice rose with panic can we cover it up cover it up were long past that point she smiled but cruelly and he thought her face looked like a malicious tortoises randy without that money the school is going to close what happened to it we were supposed to have two and a half million she tossed her head at a question he himself knew the answer to why does a college lose money auden university had been skimming the surface of insolvency for ten years competition from cheaper state and trade schools decreasing collegeage population escalating salary demands and costs this murder its going to focus a lot of attention on the school and its problems thats the last thing we need not now we cant afford people pulling their children out and for gods sake we dont need profiles of the school in the press she did not look at the register but her fingers absently tapped the grim headline sayles said coldly her death was most inopportune the dean missed his irony she asked does anybody know about our arrangement long dark hair it often dipped down over one eye which her right eye she would keen with passion the gebben girl student number she would cry at the scent of a forest filling with stiff fall leaves does anybody know he mused nope not anymore she doesnt sayles shook his head the dean stood and walked to the window her back was to him she had a solid figure rubbery and strong this was appealing the severity and solemnity one wants in airline pilots and surgeons a large stern woman hair going a little wiry eyes puffy from wrestling with an injustice only partially of her own making jennie gebben who would grip his cock with her prominent teeth and rasp up and down along his swollen skin who could not without prompting analyze european motives behind civil war foreign relations but who had the far more enduring gift of pressing her knees into sayless midriff and with a stonebuffed heel square against his asshole force his pelvis against hers student number randy we can expect an audit by midjune if you dont raise three million six hundred thousand dollars in cash by then how am i supposed to get that much money he heard his voice rise to a strident whine which he detested but could not avoid you she asked dean larraby polished the purple stone against the fabric of her skirt then looked up at sayles i think its pretty clear randy you better than anybody know whats at stake if you dont find that money she got the idea from a madefortv movie it had been a film about a thirteenyearold girl and her mother and stepfather hated her once they locked her in the house while they went away to gamble and the girl ran away from home by jumping out a window then grabbing onto a freight train that went to new york city sarah shut off the water running in the bathtub which though it was filled with steamy water and fragrant violet bubble bath did not as she had told her mother contain her she had run upstairs and taken a fast shower then dressed quickly now wearing a tshirt overalls nikes and a nylon windbreaker her traveling clothes she listened to her mother fixing dinner downstairs in the film when the girl ended up in new york she lived in the alley and had to eat bread somebody had thrown out and she smoked a cigarette and just before this big guy was going to take her up into his apartment and do something for her sarah didnt know what the girls mom showed up and hugged her and brought her home and dumped the stepfather and they showed an number you could call if you knew any runaways what a stupid movie about as real and interesting as a cereal commercial but it solved a big problem for sarah because it showed her how to save all of the wizards money and still get to chicago she was thinking of the railroad train there were no railroads in new lebanon but there was a truck it was a big one that looked sort of like a train and it passed the house every afternoon the truck had a platform on the back that she thought she could hold on to and it went past the house real slow she could catch the truck easily and then climb onto the back and sit there when he stopped for the night she could ask the driver where to find another truck going to chicago sarah packed her barbie backpack she took mr jupiter her shooting star bank pairs of levis and sweatshirts and socks and underpants her toothbrush and toothpaste and a skirt and a blouse her walkman and a dozen books on tape of course redford t redford the worlds smartest bear would be traveling with her and she took some things from her mothers dresser lipstick mascara fingernail polish and panty hose it was now fivethirty the truck usually went past the house about six sarah walked around her room she suddenly realized shed miss her father she started to cry shed miss her brother some she thought shed miss her mother but she wasnt sure then she thought of the wizard telling her ill look out for you and she thought about school sarah stopped crying she lifted the window which opened onto the backyard of their house she tossed the backpack out hearing the coins in mr jupiter ring loudly she climbed out hanging from the ledge her cheek pressed hard against the yellow siding then she let go and dropped the few feet to the soft ground when he hung up the phone brian okun recognized a contradiction that would have made a tidy little philosophical riddle as the black receiver started downward he thought hes got no right to talk to me that way as it settled in its cradle hes got every right to talk to me that way okun was lanky as a cowboy and his face was obscured by the strands of black beard that weaseled unevenly out of his wan skin inky brillo hair hung over his ears like a floppy beret he sat in his tiny cubicle overlooking the quad his tensed hand still clutching the telephone and developed his thought he has no right because as a human being im entitled to a mutual measure of dignity john locke he has every right because hes in charge and he can do what he fucking well pleases niccolo machiavelli cum brian okun the man he was thinking of was leon gilchrist the professor for whom okun worked when gilchrist joined auden two years before the horde of eager phd candidates seeking jobs as graduate assistants largely bypassed him his reputation preceded him from the east a recluse a foul temper no interest whatsoever in campus sports politics or administration while this put off most grad students it merely upped the ante for okun who was as intrigued by gilchrists personality as he was impressed by his mind any doubts that remained about the professor were obliterated when okun read gilchrists the id and literature the book changed okuns life he stayed up all night zipping through the dense work as if it were an illustrated classics comic book he finished it at exactly threeten in the afternoon and by four was sitting in gilchrists office being obnoxious insisting that gilchrist hire him to teach the seminar sessions of his famous psych lit course gilchrist asked a few innocuous questions about the subject matter then grew bored with okuns answers and silenced the grad student by hiring him on the spot okun almost as quickly regretted the decision the professor turned out to be more reclusive and odd and aggressively prickish than rumoured narcissistic and anal expulsive okun observed he too like gilchrist was dualdegreed psychology and english lit he gave the man wide berth and had to improvise his professorhandling techniques like a doctor developing new antibiotics to meet particularly virulent strains of bacteria gilchrist was impossible to outflank okun was not surprised to learn that he was more savvy than he seemed and had pegged okun early as having designs on his job but by now after two semesters of continual jockeying if not outright combat brian okun chic moody himself brilliant an enfant terrible of the modern language association brian okun had nothing but wounds to show from the runins with his scholastic wellington today for instance the phone call the professor had left for san francisco last week to read a paper at the berkeley poetry conference and had been expected back tonight in time for tomorrows lecture gilchrist had called however to say he would be staying another week to do research at san francisco state he abruptly told okun to have another professor prepare and deliver his lecture tomorrow the session was entitled john berryman selfharm and suicide through the poets eye okun considered himself a berryman scholar and fervently wanted to deliver that lecture but gilchrist was on to him he ordered okun with a tinny insulting laugh to find a full professor he used that phrase full professor a painful reminder of what okun was not okun agreed extending his middle finger to the telephone as he did so then he hung up and the interesting philosophical dilemma occurred to him okun now paced to the extent he was able to do so in a cluttered eightbyeight room as his mind leapt backward zigzagging through time he found he was picturing vague scenes of victorian tragedy charles dickens had given a lecture in this very building as part of his us tour in the s a fact okun had collected and cherished but the image that he arrived at was not from one of dickenss books it was of a girl wearing a white layered nightgown her long hair spilling like dark water on the pillow a girl with a pallid face mouth curling outward eyes closed her name was jennie gebben and she was dead at only one point since his graduation from yale had brian okun ever doubted that he would be a nobel prize winner there was some question as to whether he would win for nonfiction writing some quantumleaping analysis of say the relation between yeatss haywire obsession with maud gonne and his art or whether he would produce a series of showy anxious quote updike coomer ford quote new yorker novels ridden with quirky characters and heavy with the filigree of imagery and dialectladen talk either was fine only twentyseven on the verge of doctorhood brian okun felt mastery of his scholarly self he also believed however that his right brain needed more life experience and like many graduate students he believed that life experience was synonymous with fucking he intended to fill the next five years with as many female students as he had the stamina to bed and the patience to endure afterward eventually he would marry a woman who was brilliant and homely enough to remain utterly devoted to him the nuptials would have happened by the time the swedish girls hair glowing under the blaze of the burning candle wreaths woke him up in stockholm on the morning of the award presentation but these dreams were disrupted by a particular individual jennie gebben had been a curious creature when hed first read her name in class hed paused his mind had tricked him and he misread it he thought hed seen jennie gerhardt one of theodore dreisers tragic heroines and a character that professor gilchrist discussed at length in his famous paper in which he psychoanalyzed dreiser okun had looked at jennie across the ushaped classroom table and held her eyes for a moment he knew how to look at women after a moment he commented on the name error several people in class nodded in selfindulgent agreement to impress him with their familiarity with naturalistic writing jennie gave a bored glance at okun and responded brashly that shed never heard of her near namesake he asked her out three days later a record in selfrestraint at a university like auden located in a twocinema fourscreen town inappropriate liaisons cannot proceed as they would in an anonymous city okun and jennie spent their time walking in the woods or driving out to the quarry or spending nights in her room or his apartment he brooded to the point of fetish why this fierce attraction jennie wasnt gifted artistically she wasnt brilliant she was a bminus student with a solid midwestern artistic sensibility this meant that she had to be told what was valid and what was not he was stung by these limitations of hers when he inventoried what he loved about her he came up with shrinkage the way she covered her mouth with her delicate hand at scenes of violence in movies the way she let slip little murmurs from her throat as she looked at a chill spring wash of stars above them the way she could drop her shoulder and dislodge a satin bra strap without using her fingers of course some aspects of jennie gebben he loved intensely her suggestions when they were making love that he might like to try something different did he enjoy pain would he please bury his finger in her no no not in my cunt please yeah there all the way did he like the feel of silk of womens nylons and she would bind a black seamed stocking tight around his balls and stroke his glans until he came forceful and hurting on the thick junction of her chin and throat several times she dressed him in one of her nightgowns and on those occasions he emptied himself inside her within seconds of fierce penetration these were the bearings of their relationship and as impassioned as okun felt he knew they could not be trusted not when your lover was jennie gebben the murmurs and whimpers had taken on too great a significance for him out of control he crashed it occurred when one night he had blurted a marriage proposal to her and she less intelligent a common person had suddenly encircled him in her arms in a terrifying maternal way she shook her head and said no honey thats not what you want honey she called him honey it broke his heart he raged jennie was what he wanted his tongue made a foray into the crevice of his lips and he tasted her that was proof that was the metaphor he hungered for her he cried in front of her while she looked on maturely head cocked with affection he blurted a shameful stream he was willing to do whatever she wanted get a job in the private sector work for a commercial magazine edit he had purged himself with all the hokey melodrama of midlist literature brian okun radiant scholar of the esoteric grafting of psychology and literature recognized this obsessive effluence for what it was so he was not surprised when in an instant love became hate she had seen him vulnerable she had comforted him this the only woman who had ever rejected him and he detested her even now months after this incident a day after her murder okun felt an uncontrollable surge of anger at her for her simpering patronizing mutterheit he was back on the nobel path yes but she had shaken something very basic in his nature he had lost control and his passions had skidded violently like a car on glazed snow he hated her for that ah jennie what have you done to me brian okun pushed his hands together and waited for the trembling to stop it did not he breathed deeply and hoped for his heart to calm it did not he thought that if only jennie gebben had accepted his proposal his life would be so unequivocally different the smell of the halls suggested something temporary pasty cheap paint sawdust air fresheners and incense covering stale linens like a barracks for refugees in transit the color of the walls was green and the linoleum flecked stone gray bill corde knocked on the door there was no answer ms rossiter im from the sheriffs department another knock maybe shed gone to st louis for the funeral he glanced behind him the corridor was empty he tried the knob and pushed the open door a smell wafted out and surrounded him jennie gebbens spicy perfume corde recognized it immediately he lifted his hand and smelled the same scent residue from the bottle on her dressing table at home corde hesitated this was not a crime scene and students in dormitories retained rights of privacy and due process he needed a warrant in hand to even step into the room ms rossiter corde called when there was no answer he walked inside the room jennie and emily shared had a feeble symmetry bookcases and mirrors bolted to opposite walls the beds parallel to each other but the desks turned at different angles looking up from a textbook one girl would look out the small window at the parking lot the other would gaze at a bulletin board on one bed rested a stuffed rabbit corde examined jennies side of the room a cursory look revealed nothing helpful books notebooks school supplies posters souvenirs photos of family members corde noticing that the young jennie bore a striking resemblance to sarah makeup hair curlers clothes scraps of paper packages of junk desserts shampoos lotions sheer pastel underwear hung on a white string to dry a u poster stacks of cassettes a stereo set with a cracked plastic front a large box of condoms latex he noted not the lambskin found at the crime scene thousands of dollars worth of clothes jennie was a meticulous housekeeper she kept her shoes in little green body bags corde noticed a picture of two girls jennie and a brownhaired girl of delicate beauty emily was it the same girl in one of the pictures on jennies wall at home corde could not remember they had their arms around each other and were mugging for the camera their black and brown hair entwined between them and made a single shade a clattering of laughter from the floor above reminded him that he was here without permission he set the picture down and turned toward jennies desk he crested the rise on just in front of his house corde had ticketed drivers a dozen times for sprinting along this strip at close to sixty it was a straightaway posted at twentyfive after a long stretch of fifty so you couldnt blame them for speeding corde supposed but it was a straightaway in front of his house where his kids played when he wasnt in the mood to ticket he took to leaving the squad car parked nose out in the drive which slowed the hotrodders down considerably and put a slew of brake marks on the asphalt just over the crown on the rise like a grouping of bullet tracks in a trap setting a good example corde braked hard then signaled and made the turn into his driveway he parked the cruiser next to his ford pickup which was fourthhand but clocked in at only sixtyseven thousand miles he stepped out into the low sun and waved to jamie who was in the garage lifting his bike up onto pegs in the exposed twobyfours in jamies hands the bike seemed to weigh only a pound or two the boy was fairskinned and slight but he was strong as sinew he worked out constantly concentrating on many reps of lighter weight rather than going for bulk he waved back to his father and headed toward the backyard where he would pitch a tennis ball onto the crest of the roof and snag the fly with all sorts of fancy catches the expression on his face was the same one that corde had puzzled over for over a year until he finally recognized it as a look of dianes contentment corde liked to think though also caution and consideration he was proud of his son quiet and easygoing a devoted member of the freshman wrestling team a bplus student without trying good in latin and biology and math the secretary of the science club corde believed his boy would grow up to be gary cooper detouring through the rototilled earth of the side yard corde turned on the sprinkler which began to saturate the patch of mud that the seed package had promised four weeks ago would be luxurious green in six corde watched the wave sweep back and forth for a minute then walked toward the splitlevel house aluminumsided bright yellow corde had an acre of land all of it grass or soon to be ortho assured him punctuated with juniper bushes and saplings that in fifty years would be respectable oaks the property bordered the panhandle of a working dairy farm to the north beyond which was a forest surrounding houses all modest splitlevels or colonials sat on similar plots along route he heard a chug of a diesel engine up the road the driver of a white semi hauling a maersk line container started shifting down through his many gears as the truck rolled over the crest of the highway probably right on the posted speed corde watched the majestic truck for a moment then started toward the house a motion caught his eye and smiling still he glanced to the corner of his yard something nosing out of the bushes toward the road a dog no sarah his daughter stood up and looked at him in panic a deer spotting a hunter she turned and ran at top speed toward the truck whose driver was oblivious to the girl sarah stop corde shouted in astonishment no he ran after her she was squealing with terror running ahead of herself tripping as her feet windmilled her arms flailing in panic she was aiming right for the trucks massive rear wheels which were as tall as she was oh honey stop please he gasped and ran flat out the mace canister and a speedloader falling from his sam browne belt handcuffs thwacking his back leave me alone sarah wailed and plunged ahead toward the trucks tires she dropped the backpack and made a frantic spring for the truck it seemed like she was going to leap right for the huge thundering disks of tires firing pebbles into the air behind the trailer sarah was three feet from the wheels when corde tackled her they landed skidding in a pile on the messy shoulder as the truck rumbled past them the stack burping as the engine revved and the driver upshifted unaware of the struggle he left behind sarah squealed and kicked panicked corde rolled to his knees and shook her by the shoulders his hand rose palm flat she squealed in terror he screamed what are you doing what are you doing corde who had spanked jamie only once and sarah not at all in their collective twentyfour years on earth lowered his hand tell me leave me alone diane was running toward them what happened what happened corde stood the panic was gone but it had left in its place the sting of betrayal he stepped back diane dropped to her knees and held the childs face in her hands she took a breath to start the tirade then paused seeing the despair in her little girls face sarah you were running away running away from home sarah wiped her tears and nose with her sleeves she didnt respond diane repeated the question sarah nodded why her father demanded because sarah corde began sternly the little girl seemed to wince its not my fault the wizard told me to the wizard the sunshine man this was one of the imaginary friends that sarah played with corde remembered sarah had created him after the family attended the funeral of cordes father and the minister had lifted his arms to the sun speaking about souls rising into heaven it was sarahs first experience with death and corde and diane had been reluctant to dislodge the apparently friendly spirit she created but in the past year to the parents increasing irritation the girl referred to him more and more frequently he made redford t redford fly out to the forest and he told me dianes voice cut through the yard no more of this magic crap do you hear me young lady what were you doing leave me alone the tiny mouth tightened ominously corde said its going to be okay honey dont worry im not going back to school diane whispered in a low menacing voice dont you ever do that again sarrie do you understand me you couldve been killed i dont care dont say that dont ever say that mothers and daughters strident tones were different only in pitch corde touched his wifes arm and shook his head to sarah he said its okay honey well talk about it later sarah bent down and picked up her knapsack and walked toward the house with boundless regret on her face she looked back not however at the ashen faces of her parents but toward the road down which the silver truck was hurrying away without her they stood in the kitchen awkwardly like lovers who must suddenly discuss business unable to look at him diane told him about sarahs incident at school that day corde said contritely she didnt want to go today i drove her back this morning and made her i guess i shouldnt have of course you should have you cant let her get away with this stuff bill she uses us whatre we going to do shes taking the pills every day but i dont think theyre doing any good they just seem to make her stomach upset she waved vaguely toward the front yard can you imagine she did that oh my corde thought why now with this case and everything why now he looked out the window at sarahs bike standing upright on training wheels a low pastel green schwinn with rainbow streamers hanging pathetically from the rubber handle grips he thought of jamie and his high racing bike that he zipped along on fast and daring as a motocross competitor sarah still couldnt ride her tiny bike without the trainers it embarrassed corde when the family pedaled to town together corde tried to avoid the inevitable comparison between his children he wished whatever god had dished out for them had been more evenly divided it was difficult but corde made a special effort to limit the pride he expressed for jamie always aware of sarahs eyes on him begging for approval even as she was stung by her own limits a more frightening concern some man offering a confused little girl a ride home corde and diane had talked to her about this and shed responded with infuriating laughter saying that a wizard or a magic dog would protect her or that she would just fly away and hide behind the moon corde would grow stern diane would threaten to spank her the girls face became somber but her parents could see that the belief in supernatural protectors had not been dislodged oh sarrie although bill corde still went to church regularly he had stopped praying hed stopped exactly nine years ago he thought if it would do anything for sarah hed start up again he said its like shes emotionally dis diane turned on him dont say that she has a high iq beiderson herself told me shes faking she wants to get attention and brother you give her plenty corde lifted an eyebrow at this diane conceded okay and so do i corde was testy well weve got to do something we cant let that happen again he waved toward the yard like diane reluctant to mention his daughters mortality shes got her endofterm tests in two weeks we cant take her out of school now corde said we cant hold her back another grade he looked out the window why did the sight of a bicycle standing upright bother him so it encouraged him that she could read some books by herself it encouraged him that she had made and kept a few friends it encouraged him that she was pretty it destroyed him that she wasnt like jamie theres something i ought to tell you corde said hesitating not knowing how shed respond he pointed to the register which rested with odd prominence on top of four cans of tomatoes in the middle of the table it was open to the article about the murder somebody left a copy of that story at the crime scene it was saying that maybe we shouldnt be investigating this case too hard now it could be a prank and even if the killer left it i dont take it all that serious but im going to have a deputy here at the house this however seemed to be just another small burden on his wifes shoulders diane said matteroffactly we shouldnt let sarah play by herself then not outside the yard no well have to tell her somehow but we dont want to scare her she spooks so easy diane said you keep babying her shes never going to grow up if you keep treating her that way i just think we have to be careful is all corde lifted his eyes to the postandrail fence two hundred feet away and saw a hereford grazing in the field beyond it reminded him of a picture sarah had once tried to draw of a dalmatian the drawing had been pathetic an infants scrawl it comes close to breaking my heart he said its like shes she isnt retarded diane hissed i didnt say that my daughter is not retarded she turned her attention to the refrigerator i dont want to talk about it anymore rockets rising from grass from mud no no not mud servo rockets datkar man hes great muscles ripping them all apart shooting with leasers their bodies falling falling into flowers falling into mud philip halpern sat behind the twobedroom house under the sixbysix back porch which was for him at this moment the control room of his dimensioncruiser he listened he heard footsteps from the house they receded falling in mud in flowers nonono philip was blond five feet eight and he weighed two hundred and fortyfive pounds he was the second heaviest person in his freshman high school class tonight in size fortyfour levis and a dark green shirt he sat in a pile of leaves that had drifted under the porch the boy lowered his head and stared at the bag at his feet it was small a sandwich bag the sort that would contain lunch when his mother made his lunch of bologna sandwiches smeared with hellmanns and potato chips and bananas and oreos and eighty cents in dullclinking coins for chocolate milk although what the bag contained tonight was small his hand moved slowly when he picked it up as though the contents were very heavy phathar a nearby voice whispered philip jumped then answered jano that you he squinted and saw a boy his age crawling through a secret gate they had built together in the chickenwire fence that surrounded the halpern property jano shit be quiet between themselves philip and his friend had taken the names of characters in a recent science fiction film theyd seen four times it was like a code a secret that bound them together in this alien world phathar ive like called you ten times janos voice was agitated phathar whispered harshly just chill will you shut up jano full name janoiv of the lost dimension climbed through the lattice gate of the porch he said why didnt you call me back i thought youd been arrested or something man i almost puked this morning i mean like really chill out okay although phatharvii also a warrior from the lost dimension was calm and in control philip halpern young and overweight was close enough to panic without his friends adding to it he said so what is there to do i dont know i almost puked jano repeated looking as if he had his mouth was wet and his eyes red and though it was too early in the season for serious freckles the brown dots stood out on his face in sickly contrast to his pale skin phathar said how can they even find us oh jesus youre like a total pussy i am not janos eyes blazed philip whom jano could have pounded to the dirt floor with a single fist backed off all right dude all right jano said weve got to destruct the files you know how long it took us to make those up jano said weve got the names of half the girls in class on them all the codes all the pictures ive got them in a secret file if anybody tries but the pictures jano whined in a voice that wasnt at all the voice of a dimensional warrior no listen phathar said if anybody tries to open the drawer everything selfdestructs its automatic jano gazed into the night oh man i wish we hadnt done it stop talking that way phathar whispered ruthlessly a fleck of saliva shot onto janos arm the boys revulsion showed in his face but he didnt brush the dot away phathar continued we did do it we did it we cant bring her back to life dathar could jano sniveled well we cant so quit like crying about it i almost puked above them a squeak of opening door a low voice snapped phil both boys froze phillip his fathers voice stabbed through the night like a dimensioncruisers engine kicking into antimatter mode the fuck are you you got school tomorrow philip wondered if he himself was going to puke even phathar was trembling you can hear me you got ten minutes i have to come looking for you itll be with the handy man when the screen door slammed phathar said you gotta leave he finds you here hell whip me jano stared at the underside of the porch above them then said tomorrow he left silently to his shadowy receding form phathar lifted his arm and closed his fingers in a dimensional warrior salute oh she struggled she wrote the words a dozen times careful always to tear up the ruined note and drop it into a garbage can shed failed him once she wasnt going to make it worse by letting her mother and dad find out about him sitting at her desk she hunched over the tricky letters willing her pen to move one way then watching it move the other she would tell it to go up to make the top of a b and instead it went down and became a p left instead of right is how an s goes no yes sarah corde hated ss she heard the crickets playing their tiny squeakfiddles outside in the cool night she heard the wind brushing the trees neck and back cramped with tension she wrote for another half hour then looked at her work im sorry i cant go awya they wont let me and a police man is coomign comming in the mourning to watch us can you help me you can have yor mony back you are the sunshine man arent you can i see you she signed her name carefully she felt a moment of panic worrying that the sunshine man might not be able to read the note then she decided that because he was a wizard he could probably figure most of it out sarah folded the paper and wrote his name on the outside she put on her jacket then she paused she opened the note and added some words at the bottom im sorry i dont spell good im realy sorry then she snuck out the back door into the windy night and ran all the way to the circle of rocks the deputy showed up at eightthirty almost to the second he was young pinkscrubbed beefy eager and he wore on his hip a combatgripped colt python with a sixinch vented barrel he was in short everything a husband could want to protect his wife and kids morning tom corde picked up the register from the driveway and held the screen door open for the deputy howdy detective nice house you got here corde introduced him to the family diane offered him some coffee he declined regretfully as if this were a slap at her cooking the deputy retreated to the comfort of his dodge watchtower parked in the driveway and the family sat down to breakfast jamie and diane were talking about something animated near to an argument sarah sat quietly but was overjoyed at the news that she could stay home from school today only today mind you one day just one but no more absences for the rest of the year you understand young lady oh yes and how many times had they said the same thing corde wasnt listening to his wife and son and he wasnt observing his daughters elation because he was reading a short article in the register and he was shocked cult suspected in auden coed murder he set his coffee on the table and knocked the syrup over he didnt notice it fall diane glanced at him frowning and righted the bottle sheriffs department investigators are looking into the possibility that a cult or religious killer may be stalking the town of new lebanon his eyes jumped through the article and robbery was not a motive because she was killed on the night of the first quarter of the moon there has been speculation that miss gebben may have been a sacrifice victim possibly one in a chain of such killings sources close to the sheriffs department also disclosed that death threats have been made against its personnel threats plural sheriff steve ribbon stated emphatically however that they would in no way impede the investigation we arent going to be bullied by these people whoever they are however sick they might be ribbon said we have some strong leads and were pursuing them real hard damn corde muttered bringing an end to breakfast table arguments and meditations on freedom he looked over the paper to find his family staring at him what is it hon he handed diane the article and told the children it was nothing jamie glanced over his mothers shoulder as she read a cult he asked diane finished the article jamie picked it up and continued to read his wife asked him whats wrong with the story i dont get it too much publicity he muttered i think its best to play cases like this close to your chest i suppose she said and began clearing away dishes corde stood to fetch his gunbelt but before he left the kitchen he glanced at his wife she was intent on dishes and seemed to have missed what was so troubling to him that this story was a huge sign for the killer which said in the vernacular of steve ribbon you mayve threatened corde but no matter hes going ahead full steam and he dont give a good goddamn about your threats you do your worst you arent stopping our boy bui they wouldnt go so far as to blurt out i was at a frat party or i was on a date the night it happened or you can ask anyone i didnt even see her that night even though thats what they wanted to blurt but they were defensive and they were scared dodging cordes cool green eyes the boys glanced from his face to his gun the girls to the floor some of them seemed inconvenienced some were near tears often they did cry room in the student union had never been put to such a sorrowful purpose the room was worse than any interrogation cubicle at the new lebanon sheriffs department it was painted beige and smelled of adolescent perfume and aftershave lotion chalk poster paints bitter bad coffee and food cooking in grease corde sat at a lightweight metal desk he could lift with his knees by flexing his toes and he felt ridiculous lance miller was in the opposite corner of the room throughout the morning students and staff workers of the school gave corde their version of the essay the jennie gebben that i knew they put their words to many uses exonerating themselves pressing the wound of loss putting their names into the public record some even tried to help him catch a killer in the morning alone corde filled two packs of threebyfive cards at one pm they took a break corde opened his briefcase to get a new pack of cards as he cracked the cellophane wrapping miller glanced into the briefcase and noticed corde staring at a photo taped to the inside it was the one of jennie gebben face shiny with sweat corde was aware of millers watching him and closed the lid miller went to the cafeteria to buy sandwiches after lunch miller looked out the window and said oh boy here he comes again corde looked up and saw wynton kresge coming up the sidewalk whats that man want corde asked the security chief entered the small room carrying an envelope hiya wynton corde said what can we do for you kresge set an envelope on cordes desk whatd this be the detective asked i dont know i was over to town hall and i saw detective slocum there i mentioned i was going to be nearby the student union and he asked me if id mind dropping this off and i said id be happy to he stopped abruptly looking pleased hed given the explanation so smooth on the outside was stamped forensic lab interoffice use only fredericksberg kresge asked him they have a division in the state that looks for clues thiss the county lab jim slocum was in the office hes supposed to be checking out the roads and the mall corde snapped kresge asked you want me to check out anything at the mall id be happy to no corde was miffed he walked out of room to a phone booth disfigured with innocuous messages kresge remained in the activity room for a moment looking awkwardly at the blackboard then he left walking past corde and waving goodbye corde the phone crooked under his neck nodded and watched his broad trapezoidal back disappear down the corridor a deputy in the office said that slocum wasnt there did corde want him to call in corde answered no and hung up angrily he returned to the room and looked inside the envelope kresge had brought oh no miller looked at him we missed ourselves a knife at the crime scene yup corde was looking at a bad photocopy the technician had merely laid the weapon on the copier platen the edges were out of focus and the background was smudged black it was a short folding stiletto with a dark handle and a thin blade which looked about four inches long two shorter than the state limit for concealed weapons there was a design on the handle an insignia of some kind in the shape of crossed lightning bolts it looked vaguely like a nazi insignia corde thought he read the brief report from the harrison county crime scene division the knife had been found in the flowers beneath where jennie gebben had lain the blade closed it had not been used on her there were no traces of blood tissue on the blade though it might have been used to cut the rope the killer strangled her with steve ribbon had added a handwritten note bill offering sacrifice more evidence of cult action you should follow up stupid of us lance damn stupid missing something like this and i went over the site twice slocum and i both cordes skin felt hot from this lapse he pulled another report from the envelope about the newspaper clipping and its threatening message there had been no fingerprints the red ink in which were found several marker fibers was from a flair pen sold in millions of stores around the country on the analysis request form he had filled out to accompany the threat corde had asked what was used to cut the clipping out of the paper a technician had replied something sharp finally the envelope contained the warrant permitting them to search jennies half of the dorm room he handed it to miller and told him to get over there with a crime scene unit as he did so he happened to glance at millers notes and he realized he should have been paying more attention to what the young deputy was doing you wrote down the score of the homecoming game she went to shouldnt ive no oh i thought you wanted specifics corde said and youre supposed to be asking the girls in her dorm when jennie had her period you cant go asking somebody that ask miller turned fire red cant we look it up somewhere ask corde barked okay okay corde read one of millers notes roommate and jg just before dinner on tuesday night they had discussion serious fight couldnt tell what was said jg unhappy as she left roommate emily rossiter corde tapped it thats interesting i want to talk to emily get over there now and have her come in bill corde was irritated at the fluorescent tube that flickered frantically above his head and he was exhausted from sifting for hours through the goofy and theatrical attitudes of young people on their own for the first time he was thinking of closing up for the day and returning to the office when a young man appeared at the door he was in his midtwenties a squat mass of black crinkly hair was tied in a ponytail his face was very narrow and he had high ridges of cheekbones under which was a dark beard he wore blue jeans and a black tshirt you detective corde thats me come on in i got a message that you wanted to see me whats your name here sit down brian okun is this about jennie gebben thats right corde was flipping through the index cards slowly card by card reviewing his boxy handwriting it took a long time he looked up now how exactly did you know her she was in professor gilchrists class psychology and literature he lectures i teach the discussion section she was in youre on the faculty im a graduate student phd candidate and what did you do in your section theyre discussion groups as i said what do you discuss okun laughed puzzled do you really care im curious the question last week was how would john crowe ransom and the school of new criticism approach the poetry written by someone diagnosed with bipolar depression do you know what the new criticism movement was all about officer no i dont corde answered do you know if jennie was going with anybody going with what does that mean thats a vague term was she seeing anyone okun asked in a voice crisp with irony seeing anyone do you mean dating it seemed to corde that the boy wasnt hostile he looked genuinely perplexed as if the detective were asking questions that could not be answered in plain english id like to know about anyone jennie may have had more than a passing friendship with okuns eyes ricocheted off cordes cards i suppose you know i took her out a few times corde who did not know this answered i was going to ask you about that do you usually date students thiss a college town who else is there to ask out okuns eyes met cordes isnt it unusual for a professor to ask out his students im not a professor i told you that im a doctoral candidate therefore we were both students corde rubbed his finger across a styrofoam cup of cold coffee he shuddered at the squeaky sound id appreciate you answering my questions in a straightforward way this is a pretty serious matter how long were you seeing her we broke up several months ago wed dated for three months off and on why did you break up its not your concern it may be son look sheriff we went out five or six times i never spent the night with her she was sweet but she wasnt my type corde began to ask a question okun said i dont feel like telling you what my type is what were the circumstances of you breaking up okun twitched a shoulder you cant really call it breaking up there was nothing between us nothing serious and neither of us saw any point in going on with it do you know who jennie began seeing after you i know she went out i dont know with whom corde fanned through his threebyfives thats interesting several of her other friends also told me they arent sure who she was dating recently okuns eyes narrowed and his tongue touched a stray wire of beard so a mystery man corde asked what kind of student was she slightly above average but her heart wasnt in studying she didnt feel passion for literature he pronounced it litrature corde asked was there anybody in class she was particularly close to other than you i dont know did you see her personally in the last month okun blinked personally he asked the ceiling i suppose id have to see her personally wouldnt you think how else can one see anyone do you mean did i see her intimately or do you mean socially corde thought of the time he managed to cuff and hogtie george kallowoski after the man had spent ten minutes swinging a fourbyfour trying in his drunken haze to cave in cordes skull he thought a lot better of kallowoski than he did of this boy outside of class i meant i hadnt seen her socially for a month i assume you remember that i told you i didnt see her intimately at all do you know if there was anybody who had a gripe with her anybody shed fought with recently no did she get along well with her roommate i guess i dont know emily that well but you knew jennie well enough to know that emily was her roommate okun smiled ah ratiocination does this mean youve trapped me corde fanned his cards like a las vegas blackjack player now emily he looked up frowning i thought you told me you never stayed overnight in jennies room okun observing the interrogation from a different plane sighed he descended to say emily has a big mouth i was being euphemistic when i mentioned spending the night euphemistic okun said it means i was not being literal i was being metaphoric i know what euphemistic means said corde who did not i mean i didnt have sexual relations with her we stayed up late discussing literature that was all officer it seems to me like this is some kind of personal vendetta i dont believe youre right about that okun looked out of the small window as if he were stargazing then said i dont know whether you went to college or not but i imagine you dont have a lot of respect for what i do corde didnt say anything i may look like a what would you call it hippie thats your era i may look like a hippie but its people like me who teach half this illiterate world to communicate i think thats a rather important thing to do so i resent being treated like one of your local felons corde asked will you submit a blood sample blood for a genetic market test to compare with the semen found in jennie gebbens body brian okun said fuck you then he stood up and walked out of the room do you drive your man crazy diane corde sat in the paneled office and flipped through a redbook a taking skydiving lessons together b making love outdoors c going skinnydipping d taking ballroom dancing classes diane didnt like the place it reminded her too much of the office of the vet who spayed their puppies and dispensed worm drops it was nothing but a cheap paneled waiting room and a sliding glass window behind which was a gumchewing receptionist who seemed about to ask time for fluffy distemper shot is it diane swallowed drymouthed and returned to the magazine question how surprised would your mate be if you called him up one afternoon and told him to meet you after work in a ritzy hotel room where you would have champagne and caviar waiting for him a not surprised at all b somewhat surprised c very surprised d astonished corde and diane had met at a methodist church singles supper sixteen years before held in the boathouse on seever lake corde had shown up with only bags of potato chips getting mileage out of a bad joke sure i know its a pot luck supper yallre lucky i didnt bring a pot corde then spotted diane claudia willmot arranging pickles in a tupperware bowl and asked her if shed like to go for a walk she said she would only wait a minute she wanted to get her purse which she did and they wandered around in the park until thank you lord a roaring cloudburst forced them into a little shack and while the other potluckers were eating beans and franks and making fortydaysandfortynights jokes corde and diane kissed wet and hot and she decided she was going to marry him she was four years older than corde which is a big difference between people at only one age their midtwenties which is where the two of them happened to be crying diane asked him what are you going to do when i turn thirty youll still be young and bill corde who was in fact worried about the age difference but because he thought she might leave him for an older man told her something that turned out to be completely true that he didnt think shed go too ripe before he himself went gray one problem he hadnt counted on though diane was divorced married two years to a salesman up in fredericksberg theyd split up before corde met her and when shed confessed the marriage nervous about the response hed smeared on the nonchalance real thick but later he got to thinking about diane and stuart together and he claimed it turned his stomach into a cloverleaf diane was tolerant at first but then cordes insecurity began to wear on her she didnt know how to placate him it didnt even seem to make him feel better when she repeated over and over the partial truth that she and stu hadnt had a good sex life although she didnt dwell on it she assumed that corde had had his share of women and hoped it was true so that he had sowed all the wild grains he had in him but it wasnt the sex that tormented corde it was something trickier jealousy that the woman he wanted to marry had confessed secrets to another man that she had cried in front of him that she had comforted him corde could not be allayed looking sheepish and sorrowful at this retroactive betrayal but it was before i even knew you diane snapped and he got a look at her spirited side as shed intended corde brooded plenty and finally diane called the bluff you gonna mope like that go find yourself a virgin you think is worth all this heartache youre making for yourself their wedding the following month was appropriately punctuated by an inundation to match that of the day theyd met they both took this as a good omen which had proved to be pretty accurate sixteen years of marriage and when they called each other darling they more often than not meant it diane said the secret to their success was that they had faulty memory circuits and tended to forget rather than forgive the transgressions the closest either of them had come to an affair were unpure thoughts along the lines of those about susan sarandon and kevin costner when corde and diane made love the night theyd rented bull durham they had weathered a nearbankruptcy the deaths of dianes father and cordes mother a stroke that made cordes father forever a stranger and then the old mans death and some bad problems when the family was living in st louis lately corde was spending more and more time on cases away from home yet oddly the brooding sense of threat she felt did not come from his long hours or moody obsession with his work rather diane corde felt that for some reason it was the trouble with sarah that was driving them apart she did not understand this at all but she sensed the momentum of the rift and sensed too in her darker moments its inevitability she looked at her watch felt a burst of irritation at having been kept waiting then looked at the receptionist who moved the gum around in her mouth until she found it a comfy home and continued addressing bills question does your husband the door to the inner office opened and a woman in her late thirties stepped out she wore a beautiful pink suit radiant vibrating diane studied the dress before she even glanced at the womans face that is a tarts color a formal smile on her lips the woman said hello im dr parker would you like to come in ohmagod shes a fake here she is just a mary k rep who won the buick and is on to better things as she stood diane thought hard how to escape vets office pink suit and the womans only references had been the yellow pages but despite the misgivings diane continued into the office she sat in a comfortable armchair dr parker closed the door behind them the room was small painted yellow and another glitch contained no couch all psychiatrists offices had couches that much diane knew this office was furnished with two armchairs across from a virtually empty desk two answering machines a lamp and a clean ashtray on a pedestal a cube box of kleenex the doctors thick gold bracelet clanked on the desktop as she uncapped a pen and took a notebook from the desk on the other hand the doctor passed the wall test one side of the room was filled with somber stout books like psychodynamics in the treatment of nearfunctioning individuals and principles of psychopharmacology on the facing wall were the diplomas dr parker had graduated from the university of illinois cum laude from northwestern medical school and from the american college of psychiatrists three schools diane who had limboed out of mccullough teachers college with a bminus average looked at the squirrelly proclamations full of latin or greek phrases and seals and stamps then turned back to find the doctor gazing expectantly at her well diane said and folded her sweating hands in her lap she felt the wave of tears slosh inside her she opened her mouth to tell the doctor about sarah and said instead are you new in town i opened my practice a year ago a year diane said new lebanon a little quiet for you i like small towns small towns diane nodded a long moment of silence well it is a small town thats true dr parker said when you called you mentioned your daughter why dont you tell me about her dianes mind froze well the doctors pen hovered ready to scoot along the paper dragging the eighteenkarat bracelet behind diane blurted our sarahs been having some problems in school how old is she nine and how many months uh six thats fifth grade fourth we held her back a year tell me about her problem shes a smart girl she really is some of the things that come out of her mouth examples vanished from dianes mind but she has this attitude and shes lazy she doesnt try she wont do her homework she fails her tests i was reading this book your hidden child she paused waiting for dr parker to approve the paperback the doctor lifted her eyebrows quizzically which gave diane the impression she didnt think much of the book it said that children sometimes behave badly because they want attention you said shes smart do you know her iq i dont remember diane said flinching this was something she should have looked up im sorry i it doesnt matter we can get it from the school but she acts hostile she acts stupid she has temper tantrums and you know what happens she gets attention i think thats a lot of why she seems to be slow we have another child sarahs the second so we think that she feels jealous which is crazy because we spend lots of time with her much more than we do with jamie i dont let her get away with it i dont put up with any nonsense from her but she doesnt listen to me anymore its like she tunes me out so what id like you to do is talk to her if you tell her has she ever seen a therapist or counselor about this just a counselor at her school the new lebanon grade school he recommended that book to me then i talked to our pediatrician about it dr sieving hes an expert with children dr parker apparently did not engage in the practice of confirming parents opinions she looked at diane pleasantly and said nothing anyway we went to dr sieving and he prescribed ritalin for her for attention deficit this gave diane a burst of relief thinking that at least dottering old sieving had diagnosed the problem correctly dr parker continued was she behaving in an unruly way overly active any compulsive behavior like washing her hands frequently oh shes restless a lot jittery always running around nervous she drives me to distraction did dr sieving give her any psychological testing no he took a blood sample diane was blushing and looked away from the doctor but hes known her all her life i mean he seemed to think it was the best form of treatment well said stern dr parker if attention deficit is the diagnosis what brings you to see me i think the medicines working diane hesitated but not too well in fact sometimes i dont think it does any good to be honest with you it makes her very i dont know spacy at times and it upsets her stomach and seems to make her more jittery she says it gives her the tummy squabbles she looked down at her hands and found to her astonishment her knuckles were white as ivory the truth is she seems to be getting worse her grades are still terrible yesterday she tried to run away shes never done that before and her temper tantrums are more violent too she talks back more than she ever did she also talks to herself let me ask you a few things an avalanche of questions followed diane tried to understand where the doctor was headed but it was useless just when diane would think she understood what the doctor had in mind she would throw a curve does she watch much tv two hours in the evening only when her homeworks done actually she likes movies more she thinks most sitcoms and commercials are stupid she calls them yucky a miniature smile made a reappearance im inclined to agree go on she pretends she doesnt learn things quickly i know shes i dont want to say faking diane realized she just had well she picks up some things so fast that when she acts stupid it rings false whats easy for her remembering movies and stories weve read to her and the characters in them she can act out scenes perfectly she can remember dialogue oh and guessing the ending of movies dressing up in costumes she loves costumes but its all things like that pretend things anything having to do with real life school cooking gym bike riding games sports sewing all that seems beyond her diane looked away from the doctors eyes the other day she wet her pants in front of the class dr parkers mouth tightened and she shook her head diane watched her record in a tiny cold notation a fact that would probably dog her daughter for the rest of her life diane took a kleenex and pretended to blow her nose then twined the paper between her strong fingers and slowly shredded it into confetti more questions this was hard diane tried oh she did but her way was to keep family flaws hidden like her mothers jewelry anything real anything diamond anything gold was to be trotted out only on rare vital occasions it took all her strength to give this sleek chicsuited stranger these facts about bill about jamie about the grandparents about sarahs shyness and her wily manipulation dr parker glanced at her watch is she bored the doctor asked when you were pregnant did you drink or take any kind of medication i didnt drink no occasionally i took a tylenol but only a couple of times i knew it wasnt good how is your relationship with your husband excellent good do you quarrel openly have you ever talked about divorce no never do either of you drink now or take drugs we drink socially is all an offended diane said we never do drugs we go to church there was a pause while the doctors hand sped along the page diane said so we were thinking that if somebody like you a doctor told her she should cut out this nonsense and get down to work well then her voice tapered off the doctor chewed her thin lower lip lifting off a fleck of lipstick the expensive pen got capped the teeth released the lip and the doctor leaned back in her leather chair ive worked with learning disabled children before but shes not disabled diane said quickly i told you her iq dr parker said a learning disability isnt a function of iq its doctor diane explained patiently sarah is a smart shy little girl shes learned a diane remembered a phrase from the hidden child book pattern of behavior to get attention from my husband and me and her teachers weve played into her hand now we need an expert like you to tell her to buckle down and get to work shes gotten away with too much from us shell listen to you thats why im here dr parker waited a moment then spoke i want to say something to you and you can think about it and talk it over with your husband first i should tell you based on what youve told me im not sure your daughter suffers from attention deficit disorder some psychiatrists feel that add is a condition different from hyperactivity from my own research i think theyre intertwined if i understand correctly sarah doesnt show general overactivity what we call hyperkinetic behavior her restlessness may be secondary she has other problems and they in turn make her jittery and anxious ritalin is a temporary measure at best but dr sieving said it would help her to learn now and that shed retain what she did learn i understand and theres something to be said for that but with all respect for your internist i feel doctors are prescribing ritalin a little too quickly many parents prefer a diagnosis of add because theyd rather see a physical than a psychological explanation for their childrens troubles sarah is not crazy diane said icily absolutely not the doctor said emphatically a developmental disability is a common and treatable problem in our days it translated as stupid or lazy or recalcitrant professionals dont think of it that way anymore but a lot of people do diane felt the sting of criticism coming from the doctors placid face she said abruptly why how can you say that you should see all the work bill does with her and every day i march her downstairs and make her do her homework sometimes i spend an hour before breakfast with her the doctor said in a soothing voice im sure its been very difficult for you and your husband but if s important to put aside our thoughts that shes lazy or stupid or just ornery it was very hard to come here in the first place diane blurted angrily i just want you to tell her to buckle down to dr parker smiled i know this is difficult for you mrs corde youd like a quick fix for your daughters troubles but i dont think were going to find one if she has a developmental problem as i think she does then the treatment requires the parents to expect less from the child not more we want to reduce the stress and pressure on her but thats just what she wants dr parker lifted her hands and although she was smiling diane believed the gesture meant the doctor had won this round she boiled at this woman who was making the meeting into a contest over her daughters fate she didnt grow any calmer when the doctor said first ill do a series of tests to determine exactly what the problems are oh i can psyche you out honey the dollar signs are looming then ill have her come in for regular sessions and well treat her probably in conjunction with learning specialists well diane said coldly still stupefied by what she saw was a dressingdown dr parker asked shall we schedule an appointment diane summoned sufficient etiquette to say politely i think i should talk it over with bill she stood up and watched the pinksuited bitch also rise smile warmly and extend her hand saying i look forward to hearing from you its been a pleasure for you maybe unsmiling diane shook the doctors hand then walked out the door outside the office in the parking lot she tore the doctors card in four pieces and smiled them into the breeze corde and tt ebbans stood over a desk in the main room of the sheriffs department poring over the computer printout that ebbans had ordered from the county data base it was headed known sex offenders convicted by offense in the past three years the district attorney had prosecuted or pled out eleven rapists four aggravated sexual assaulters three child molesters three exhibitionists hell flashers you mean a couple of peepers and three excessively embarrassed residents whose offenses involved livestock we got ourselves a relatively unperverse community ebbans commented noting that these numbers except for the sheep were considerably lower than the state average per thousand residents corde and ebbans had just learned that every one of the rapists and the assaulters was accounted for ebbans said hed do an informal check of the exhibitionists and peepers he was not enthusiastic about the prospect itll be a waste i know corde said but we gotta do it ribbon had come up and was tugging at an earlobe as he looked over the list and chuckled lance miller walked into the office just returned from the dorm corde noticed that he was vastly uncomfortable whatcha got lance the young man plunked his hat onto a rack beside the door and buffed his crewcut with his pink fingers he walked to the cluster of senior officers his eyes fished around the office well bill i went over there to that mcreynolds place the dorm with the crime scene fellows like you asked corde motioned impatiently with his hand she coming in to be interviewed emily well i just talked to her for a minute shes real pretty whos that ribbon asked corde said jennies roommate she was damn upset miller continued she said it seems somebody broke into the dorm and stole all of jennies letters she well well well the sheriff said thats interesting she went to a memorial service they had for jennie over at one of the churches yesterday and left the door unlocked when she got back somebodyd stolen this folder with all jennies letters and important papers corde was nodding i asked around but almost everybody was at the service and nobody had any leads on the breakin members of the cult maybe ribbon offered looking eyebrowsup at corde miller said theres something else too his eyes had fallen to the desk and had focused on the phrase that said in green computer type incidents of forcible sodomy to date emily gave me a few things that this guy hadnt stolen good said corde one of them was a calendar from last year miller cleared his throat and ribbon said a pocket calendar thing it was in emilys desk and thats why it wasnt stolen what about it lance corde was growing impatient miller seemed relieved that he could now rely on visual aids he flipped the battered gray booklet open to the prior year january written in the square for a saturday night toward the end of the month were the words bill corde nine pm my place i interviewed her part of a case the biagotti case corde said his eyes were on the rumpled page of jennies calendar for the last week in january on thursday she had to pick up her dry cleaning on friday she was going to the drugstore for shampoo tampax and sudafed on saturday shed seen bill corde nine pm her place neither ebbans with his affection for corde nor miller with his inexperience on the job wanted any part of this ribbons eyes looked into cordes which were two uneasy pools of green the sheriff squinted memories back into his thoughts and said that was after you got back from the task force sure it wouldve been around the end of january he seemed measurelessly relieved at this you didnt know her otherwise no then ribbons face clouded again and his eyes fell to the calendar she called you bill what do you make of that ebbans wandered away to his temporary desk and sat down to make a phone call real or imaginary corde said calmly when i called jennie up to see when i could interview her about the biagotti case she and i got to talking and it turned out wed lived near each other in st louis we you know chatted for a while about that by the end of the conversation i called her jennie i guess she wrote down bill you knew each other in st louis what exactly are you getting at nothing bill im not suggesting a single damn thing i just have to keep an eye out for this sort of situation what sort of situation i just want everything on the table everything is on the table good but while your danders up im just gonna ask one more question and then well say goodbye to it in the biagotti file youve got a record of that conversation you had with jennie no why not i didnt write anything down i stopped by the dorm that saturday nine oclock jennie and i talked about fifteen minutes she knew the biagotti girl a little but that was it jennie was one of maybe fifty students i talked to about the case you didnt talk to fifty of them on saturday night but i talked to a lot of them then and on sunday morning too and on sunday night and thats a good answer thats the true answer corde shot back okay bill dont get riled if i dont ask somebody else might lets forget the whole thing ribbon tapped the sex offender printout this was a good idea this sex stuff id also check out you know occult bookstores and that sort of thing i think theres one of them not far from the campus on waverly street or stinson theyve got a bulletin board in the doorway see if they have announcements for cult what do cults have services or meetings or something probably services miller said helpfully being religious i mean well id check that out absolutely ribbon returned to his office the floor wheezed under his solid footsteps corde found ebbans and miller staring at him ebbans punched a number into the phone corde handed jennies calendar to miller log that into evidence deputy and lets get back to work for a time after hed met with dean larraby he felt like general george thomas who in earned his nickname the rock of chickamauga by preventing braxton braggs counterattack from becoming a total rout of the union forces faced with overwhelming odds and bowed under losses but infinitely confident and strong by now though professor and associate dean randolph rutherford sayles is pierced with a despair as sharp as any triangular musket bayonet he sits where he has sat for the past three hours smoking his thirteenth cigarette of the afternoon in the holiday inn on the business loop with four auden university trustees from the east coast their transcripts he is not familiar with but this he has finally concluded about them they are men who view auden as a trade school two are lawyers one is the director of a large nonprofit philanthropic organization and one is a doctor their interest in the school derives from the poli sci department the business school the biology department they never glean of course that sayles holds them in patient contempt for their philistine perspective on education he cant afford for them to catch on either personally or through their fundraising efforts these four are responsible for close to eleven million dollars a year of funding for the school sayles the history professor thinks they are rich fools sayles the associate dean of financial aid immersed presently in hot fucking water charms them effusively as they indulge in dishes of bad fruit salad in the riverside dining room occasionally they seem to grow tired of professor sayles and their eyes dip toward a fivepage document which the professor prepared earlier in the day and which he views the way faa inspectors might study the jagged remains of a gentlemen auden university is a qualifying notforprofit corporation which exempts the institution under the internal revenue code section c from paying federal income tax and from a parallel section in the state revenue code from paying state tax being a notforprofit corporation however does not mean that it can lose money with impunity ha ha ha he catches each of their eyes seriatim so while the terms red and black dont have the same meaning they might for say gm or ibm we are seriously considering changing the schools colors from black and gold to crimson he is passionate and funny teasing his audience in the manner of a toastmaster a serendipitous skill he has learned from years of lecturing to twentyyearolds with attitudes yet these easterners are immune and actually seem embarrassed for sayles one says weve got to start thinking more global on this lets start a law school or hang some balls on the mba program move up into the wharton frame of mind hmm high capital expense for that sayles offers try fifty million minimum maybe a noncredit continuing education program sayles nods gravely considering you stupid prick farmers and kmart checkers arent going to pay good money to study heidegger at night hmm small market for that he says one trustee a trim golfplaying lawyer who turned down even the fruit cup as too caloric says i dont think we should be too fast to give up on section f aid under the state education law private colleges can qualify for grants if they admit a large number of minority students regardless of their academic record the others gaze at him in puzzlement at least here sayles has allies the lawyer says it was just a thought three point six million sayles says slowly and the discussion goes round and round again sayles begins to understand something these men court clients and patients and chief executive officers who routinely write them checks often twenty a hundred thousand dollars they live with streakedhaired facelifted wives and are limoed to art museums and restaurants and offices aside from semiyearly meetings at auden palm springs and aspen they are never seen west of amish country he decides their interest in their alma mater is just that an interest nothing more he is sickened by their suggestions which are paltry and worse obvious they are student responses to the assignment how to save auden university by the time the last dots of syrup have been sucked out of the fruit cups randy sayles senses with a feeling of terrible waste that he is alone in this struggle to keep the school afloat the school and his own career and perhaps his freedom the easterners promise to keep their thinking caps on they promise to increase their personal pledges they promise to mount a campaign among their peers in the east then they shake sayless hand and climb into the limo universityfinanced fiftysix dollars an hour for the ride to harrison county airport sayles is in terrible despair he returns to his office and with the help of one of the schools lawyers fills out a section form requesting emergency state aid for private educational institutions too little at best auden might receive six hundred thousand but sayles urges the lawyer to file the application anyway and to do so by fax in a daze he watches the graysuited lawyer leave his office and he has a vivid image from one of his own lectures not of george h thomas rallying his troops to a bloody defiant stand but rather of union general irvin mcdowell at manassas junction watching in confused despair the spirits of his many men fly to heaven under the shocking clatter of jacksons guns special to the register the carcass of a recently killed and skinned goat was found in a fourthgrade classroom in the new lebanon grade school yesterday the carcass was discovered by a janitor at six am and had apparently been left after the school was closed at midnight the vandal gained access to the school by breaking through a groundfloor washroom window no one was in the building at the time a large quantity of blood believed to have come from the animal was smeared on the walls of the classroom the room will be closed for cleaning for several days fourthgrade students will attend class in the schools recreation room investigators feel this incident may be related to the rape and murder of an auden university coed by the socalled moon killer on the night of april school officials reported that the vandal wrote the word lunatic on the classroom wall in blood this word comes from the latin luna meaning moon board of education officials approved emergency funds to hire a security guard who will be at the school during school hours through the end of the term meanwhile the teachers union and officials ofthe pta have contacted the office of john treadle harrison county supervisor with a request for a town curfew and for additional police to help investigate the crime one pta official who insisted on anonymity said that if the killer is not found within the next few days parents should consider keeping children home from school the next full moon will occur five days from now on the night of wednesday april this is getting out of hand bill corde said steve ribbon brushed the newspaper delicately he seemed to decide not to reply to cordes tightlipped comment the sheriff instead asked a goat this kind of stuff corde shook his head i mean people read this people believe it we cant control the press bill you know that what was the handwriting like on the classroom wall what was it like i dont know you want to get a graphoanalyst lunatic its latin for this moon thing is making people crazy corde protested theres some nofooling hysteria out there cant deny the facts steve it was kids kids a prank or something high school kids i dont know bill even if it was jennies killer all he did was leave some showy clues making it look like this was related to the moon somehow well if the shoe fits naw corde said hed do it to throw us off i mean why kill a goat why not another victim not killing anybody dont mean anything maybe the strike window was narrower than i guessed corde debated for a moment well steve isnt it possible that this wouldntve happened if the guy hadnt read that story in the register about cults my interview the other day youre saying corde could think of no response he shrugged we didnt find any evidence of cult or satanic stuff around jennies body the knife youre forgetting the knife corde pulled at his lip for a moment i dont know what to make of the knife thats true he could see no reason to pursue this line of talk with ribbon he said another thing i want to do i want to take out an ad and ask for witnesses tell them everythingll be confidential the sheriff said whatll it cost the beacon wont be much but well have to do it in the register too i think itll be about four hundred for the week we get a discount we havent got that in our budget its already dented from you taking that flight to st louis corde said i think weve got to nobodys come forward we need some help do the beacon but i cant afford the register ribbon said ive got another idea though you ought to ask all the county shrinks about their patients and all releases for the past month from gunderson thats an approach a lot of investigators take in serial killings a lowsecurity mental hospital two hundred miles away corde asked a lot of crazies go through gunderson and every one of them shrinks is going to plead privilege i dont much care about that at least itd be on record that we asked and wed keep ourselves covered pretty damn good we dont have the manpower to do what were doing now let alone send somebody around to every therapist in the county the men looked at each other for a lengthy moment and finally corde said firmly ill take responsibility for the way im handling the case ribbon stroked his bulbous red cheek with a raw knuckle no need to have words over it bill he smiled youre absolutely right its your case and your responsibility you do what you think you ought the low late afternoon sun fell on her desk and onto the piece of paper she had in front of her sarah reached forward and the square beam of light seemed to warm her hand specks of dust floated along the beam and sarah had this image if she were no bigger than a bit of dust she could float away sail right through the open window and outside nobody would see her nobody would know she hunched over and smoothed the paper which was all crinkly and limp she felt some slight disappointment it looked just like red ink on typewriter paper she was hoping that hed leave messages in stone or on a big sheet of brown burnt paper a comma of tongue touched the dimple in her upper lip and she leaned forward in concentration sarah found reading harder than writing because even though she had a terrible time remembering spelling and how the letters were supposed to go at least she decided which words to use reading was the opposite you had to look at words somebody else had picked and then figure out what they were this was torture she sighed lost her place and started over finally after twenty minutes she finished a wave of happiness swept over her not just because she managed to complete the note but at what the words themselves said sarah i got your note i was real glad to get it dont worry about your spelling it doesnt matter to me how well you spell im watching you ill come visit very soon ill leave a surprise for you in the garage and yes i am the sunshine man happy yes although she felt a bit of disappointment he had left the note while her mother had been out tom the deputy had been reading on the front porch and sarah herself had been watching an afternoon movie why she wondered hadnt the sunshine man waited for her and given her this message in person instead of leaving the note where she found it under the pillow of her bed whoa diane corde paced through the kitchen she was a fourstar flaming you know what whoa corde said hold on here he opened his first of two afterwork beers this one was his favorite and he really enjoyed the sound of the tab cracking today the ritual wasnt giving him any pleasure diane tore open the freezer door pulled out a fourpound pack of ground round and tossed it loud into the sink frost flew like shrapnel corde stepped back he said i just asked how it went how it went is it cost us a hundred and ten dollars one hundred and ten for this woman you shouldve seen a doctor wearing a pink dress no you shouldntve seen for this woman to tell me about my own daughter honestly simmer down now and tell me what she said i was perfectly civil with her i was polite i tried to make a few friendly jokes diane turned to her husband i think shes from the east tell me what she said corde repeated patiently she insulted dr sieving and she talked to me like i was keeping sarrie from getting help because i was afraid peopled say she was crazy corde squinted trying to work this out i mean what she wants to do is for us to pay her a hundred and ten dollars my word a hundred and ten dollars an hour just i got my insurance to give sarah some tests she crossed her arms and paced some more i mean she was practically looking me in the eye and saying shes got learning disabilities does she corde asked diane stared at him he added have learning disabilities i mean oh okay diane thundered youre taking her side fine corde sighed im not taking sides he retreated youd think a hundred ten dollarsd buy you more than that id say you would two potatoes crashed into the sink sarah appeared in the doorway and dianes pacing slowed the little girl watched her and said cautiously mommy its time for my pill two more potato hand grenades were lobbed into the sink no diane said youre not taking them anymore give me the bottle im not corde asked shes not no good i dont like them they taste pukey and they give me tummy squabbles now you and your father are going to work on your spelling for the test next week and im not going to take youll do as youre told young lady diane pulled onions out of the refrigerator thunk into the sink and on saturday im taking you to see dr parker shes a nice lady and shes going to help you in school okay sarah caved fear of tests having a heavier specific gravity than fear of an angry mother honey corde told her you run into the den ill be there in a minute when she left corde cocked his head and said to his wife excuse me diane looked exasperated excuse me what i thought i mean what you just said i thought you werent going to take sarah to see her meat loaf diane asked uhm sure of course im taking her diane aimed a bunch of carrots at him and whispered harshly that woman is a bitch and shes a fashion plate and if she doesnt help my daughter then heaven help her philip halpern nervously carried the paper bag as he wound through the cluttered backyard to a greasy stone barbecue pit piled high with cinders and burnt steak and chicken bones the boy set the bag in a cone of ashes and dug through pockets compressed by his fat body finally he took a book of matches from his shirt pocket he did this with the reverence of someone whos afraid not of the fire itself but of unguessed risks that hes been warned fire holds the match ignited with a burst of pungent sulfur he lit the bag it began to burn philip wondered if the smoke would be poisonous he wished he had asked his friend jano to do this oh no philip heard the footsteps he looked up and in the dusk he saw the vague form of his father a heavy man with a crew cut wearing blue jeans and a tshirt the only distinct thing about the lumbering shape was the red dot of his cigarette held between his fingers at his side philip felt his heart freeze whatcha doing son asked the benign voice nothing you ask me if you could burn something no sir you lit the matches yourself i was just fooling around fooling around with matches its in the barbecue philip said trying to keep his voice steady i can see its in the barbecue did you ask me if you could light a match no sir whatd it be huh whatd i say about answering me that way you forget the rules im sorry philip said quickly so what is it that youre burning just some paper i found more of those magazines no sir please please please just leave me be please philip felt tears dribbling down his cheek he was thankful for the darkness the surest way to get smacked was to cry just some paper where dyou get those magazines it wasnt magazines the bag flared suddenly as the contents caught fire philip believed he sensed a terrible smell a human smell he had an image of a small space creature enveloped in swirls of flames he swallowed in the flickering light he saw his fathers face a frown etched into the matte skin you were out tuesday night the man said i looked in your room and you were out philips voice clogged his heart beat like a roaring car engine and shoved all the blood out of his chest and into his face and temples werent you philip nodded his father said a man answers a girl nods yessir i was out where just went for a walk uhm his father said all right handy man please dad dont whine i just im sorry i was just just what philip didnt know what he could say he couldnt tell the truth about the bag he wanted it to burn to silent ash he wanted his father to die he wanted to be thin he wanted to stop thinking about breasts about girls about mud please hold out your hand please but even as he was saying this his hand rose he found that it hurt less when he looked and he now stared at his own knuckles you get one for the matches one for the magazines one for lying im not two for lying his father raised his fist and brought down his knuckles hard on the back of philips hand the boy wheezed in pain philip knew how he would kill his father it wouldnt be strangulation the way the honons had killed princess nanya it would be with some kind of gun he wanted to pierce his fathers body he fantasized on this as the mans thick knuckles rose and fell bone like iron bone like xaser torpedoes again the searing pain philip pictured his father lying by the roadside blood easing from deep wounds the flames in the barbecue flickered in the cool breeze the radiation of heat ceased his fathers hand rose a final time philip pictured his father lying by the roadside he pictured his father dying in a bed of blue flowers dying in a patch of mud bill corde shudders once and wakes it is two am he is a man whose dreams are anchored in logic a man with a solid belief that images in sleep are replays of the weeks events as sensible and sure as spark plugs firing according to the electricity sent to them by a newscraped distributor dreams are not omens from wily gods they are not inkydark desires long ago snuffed tonight however bill corde lies awake with trembling heart and legs so wet that he wonders for a horrid moment if he let go of his control as did his father every night of the last two months of his life he reaches down and feels with meager reassurance the sweat along his thigh the dream was this corde was sitting on a porch the one he remembers from childhood only he was now an adult full grown and gray as the paint on the split oak of the floorboards there had been a terrible mistake a misunderstanding so shocking that corde was crying with agony i know he answered the unseen person inside the house who had just told him the news i know i know i know but i thought different all these years i believed different oh no oh no how could he have been wrong what the bodiless voice had told him and what corde finally and tragically acknowledged was that although he believed that he had two children he in fact has but one the other being just a bundle of cut grass hunched up in the backyard of his house in his dream he sobbed and then he woke now lying in his damp pajamas listening to the tick of dianes breath he feels the slam of his heart he supposed the dream itself lasted no more than five or ten seconds yet he thinks he will carry with him for the rest of his life the memory of those dream tears he cried for his lost child and for himself because half his joy all these long years with his family has been false the burgundy cadillac eldorado pulled into the parking lot and eased into a slot painted in black letters mr gebben the driver of the car looked at the sign for a moment and thought of the parking space he had just left one at the stolokowski funeral home up the road the sign there which read families and guests had been painted not in black but in bright blue richard gebben thought there was sad irony in this the blue of the sign at the funeral home was the exact shade of his companys corporate logo he climbed out of the car and slouching walked into the low pebblewalled building an airliners roar filled the sky for a moment and a jumbo jet began its takeoff roll at nearby lambert field as the thick glass door swung shut behind him the sound diminished to a whisper oh the receptionist said and looked at him with a surprised stare neither spoke as he walked past in his outer office gebben accepted the hug of his tearful secretary you didnt she began i mean you didnt need to come in today mr gebben he said softly yes i did and then escaped into his own sanctum he sat in a swivel chair and looked out over a weedy lot surrounded by razorwiretopped chain link and an abandoned siding gebben this stocky bull of a man a midwesterner with a pocked face founder from scratch of gebben preformed inc a simple man able to make whipcrack decisions today felt paralyzed he needed help he had prayed for it he now spun slowly in his chair and watched the man who was going to provide that help walk up to his office door a man who was cautious and respectful but unafraid a man who had an immense physical presence even among big men this man stood in gebbens doorway patient his own huge shoulders slumped this was the only man in the world gebben would leave his daughters wake to meet the man entered the office and when invited to sat in an old upholstered chair across the desk im very sorry mr gebben though gebben did not doubt the sincerity of those words they fell leaden from the mans chapped lips thank you charlie charles mahoney fortyone years old was six three and he weighed two hundred and eighty pounds he had been a chicago policeman for thirteen years five years ago a handcuffed felonymurder suspect in mahoneys custody had died when two of the mans ribs broke and pierced his lung a perfect imprint of the butt of a police service revolver had been found on the suspects chest mahoney couldnt offer any suggestions as to how this freak accident occurred and he chose to resign from the force rather than risk letting a cook county grand jury arrive at one very reasonable explanation mahoney was now head of gebben preformeds security department he liked this job better than being a cop when people were found inside the chain link or in the warehouse or in the parking lot and they got impressions put on their chests and their ribs broken nobody gave a shit except the people with the broken ribs and mahoney could tell them point blank to shut up and be happy that their ribs were the only things broken they were rarely happy but they did shut up richard gebben who by fluke of age had missed military service knew the chicago story about mahoney because the security chief was gebbens surrogate platoon buddy they drank together on occasion and told war stories and travel stories though most of them involved mahoney talking and gebben saying it mustve been a fucking great time or ive really gotta do that gebben always picked up the check gebben now held mahoneys eyes for a moment im going to ask you to do something for me charlie sure id let me finish charlie mahoneys eyes were on a toy truck that gebbens human resources department passed out at christmas on the side of the trailer was the blue company logo mahoney didnt have any kids so hed never been given a truck this irked him in a minor way if you agree to help me ill pay you ten thousand dollars cash provided ten thousand provided that what im about to tell you never leaves this room she put the words one right after another in her mind she said them aloud as virtuous men pass mildly away and whisper to their souls to go the girl lay in the single bed on top of a universityissue yellow blanket under a comforter her mother had bought at neimanmarcus the room lamps were out and light filtered through the curtains light blue like the oil smoke of truck exhaust tears escaped from her eyes saliva dripped onto the blanket beneath her head she remembered the last thing jennie gebben had said to her ah kiddo see you soon emily rossiter spoke in a frantic whisper whilst some of their sad friends do say the breath goes now and some say no they werent working the words were powerless she rested the book on her forehead for a moment then dropped it on the floor emily who was twenty years old and intensely beautiful had a large mass of curly dark hair which she now twined compulsively around her fingers she recited the poem again at the knock on the door she inhaled in shock emily rossiter a mans voice was speaking the doors were thin she felt the knocking resonate upon her heart its deputy miller i was by before we were wondering if you could come in and speak to detective corde for a bit hes pretty anxious to see you a womans voice that of the housemother asked emily are you there this gentleman wants to talk with you ill drive you over she heard their voices speaking to one another she couldnt make out the words she oh no the key the housemother has a key emily flipped off the covers she scooted off the bed and stood in the middle of the room like a child knees together panicked another knock emily stepped into her closet and sat on the floor which was strewn with fallen hangers and dust balls and tissue from the dry cleaners she quietly pulled several of her winter coats off the hooks above her and covered herself entirely emily breathe slowly breathe slowly they cant get you here youre safe with me kiddo but there were no keys in the door after a moment she heard footsteps walking away the jangle of the awful police equipment receding it would be safe to climb out but there was something so comforting about lying under satin and cashmere so hidden that she was compelled to stay such wilt thou be to me who must like the other fool obliquely run she wrapped the coats tighter about her they took jennie away they took her letters away and now they want me too ah kiddo emily lay her head on the thick hump of a suede jacket thy firmness makes my circle just and makes me end where i begun the green schwinn bicycle sat in the garage standing upright twined around and around the small bike were little lights a string of christmas lights from the indoor tree wound around the handlebars the fenders the training wheels the lights were on and the bike glowed like a city seen from an airplane landing they glowed too in reflection on the surface of the puddle of water on the garage floor sarah stood in the doorway and looked at the spectacle in awe it made her think of the movie e t which shed seen five times the scene where the creature makes the bikes fly through the sky she walked around it studying the lights with fascination this bicycle had terrified her when shed received it two years ago at her mothers insistence she had tried riding it several times without the training wheels and nearly fell headlong onto the concrete of the driveway shed leapt off and run into the house screaming in panic even with the wheels on she avoided riding it when other children or jamie who rode his tall fifteenspeed so fast might see her but what she was looking at now didnt scare her it was a bike but it was also something else something more something pretty and something mysterious with the cord plugged into the wall socket to light the bulbs she couldnt ride it of course but she could sit on it and pretend she was pedaling riding through the sky she could fly to the sunshine mans cottage and thank him she could be the queen of the sky as if the dots of yellow lights were the stars in her own constellation stepping forward into the puddle of still water she reached for the handlebar sarrie like what are you doing jamie stood in the doorway pulling on his brown leather biking gloves he slipped off his styrofoam helmet and set it on a shelf he stood with his hands on his hips for a moment then walked toward the bike nothing she stepped away looking down did you do that she didnt answer thats like totally stupid im not stupid she said meekly he walked to the outlet and yanked the plug out of the wall then began unwinding the lights no dont he shouted look look at this he held up a portion of wire that had been wound around the frame of the bike the plastic insulation was missing and several inches of copper wire were exposed and wrapped around the foot pedal he pointed at the floor beneath the bike and theres water spilled there dont yell at me if you do stupid things youre gonna get yelled at stop it stop it dont lay one of your effing tantrums on me it wont work he shot back he wound the electricians tape around the exposed wire then carefully rolled the wire into a circle and replaced it in the box marked xmas lights she muttered ominously you shouldntve done that diane appeared in the doorway what is going on out here i heard you all the way in the bedroom jamie said sarah was playing with the christmas lights sarah were you the little girl puckered her lips into an angry pout he called me stupid diane turned on him jamie well she was being stupid she couldve like electrocuted herself or something it was pretty and he ruined it mom he said utterly exasperated diane turned to her daughter you know to leave the decorations alone if you broke any itll come out of your allowance i didnt do anything sarah shrieked then stormed out of the garage jamie pulled his bike off the pegs stuck in the garage wall and lifted it down diane walked over to him and spoke in a menacing whisper how many times have i told you not to call her stupid she was playing with i dont care what she was doing its the worst thing in the world for her dont do it mom just dont do it you dont under did you hear me his strong hands squeezed the brake levers on his bike diane repeated her question yes he grumbled formally dianes voice softened if you see her doing something like that again come tell me your sisters going through a very rough time right now little things are really hard on her i said all right he angrily wheeled his bicycle back and forth diane wiped her hands on her skirt im sorry i lost my temper okay he muttered no problem you have the match tonight right yeah well be there you and sarah your fathers going to be working its a very important case he leapt on the high bike and rolled down the driveway i wish youd let the deputy take you to school your father doesnt want you two going places alone he shrugged jamie she shouted looking on the shelf beside the door wait your helmet but the boy seemed not to hear and leaned sharply into the turn as he sped out of the driveway and into the road he thought it was a skull but he couldnt be sure you watkins that i am now couldnt be jim slocum walked into a small windowless office in the state building in higgins he introduced himself he wasnt impressed his own office in the new lebanon sheriffs department was bigger and had a window to boot this room smelled of onions and was filled with books and telexes and photocopies of memos he glanced at some and thought how boring they must be justice department monthly homicide demographics report intrafamily violence review midwest edition slocum squinted at the glassenclosed bookcase behind watkins no it was a grapefruit the guy had put in there and forgotten about maybe an ostrich egg earl watkins was short and round and wore a tight blue buttondown dress shirt round metalrimmed glasses hung on his nose his mouth was a squooshed o above a deep cleft chin take a pew slocum settled onto the hard oak chair say what is that he followed the deputys finger that its a skull see the bullet hole watkins a huge capitol rotunda of a man with flags of sweat under his arms was a special agent violent crime division state police slocum said were hoping you could shed some light on this situation weve got ourselves help us out with a profile of the killer ill tell you theres some spooky stuff involved watkins asked slowly spooky stuff slocum gave him a summary of the gebben murder then added happened on the night of the halfmoon and underneath her was this cult knife he handed watkins a photocopy the large man looked at it briefly without emotion uhhuh when was her birthday slocum blinked he opened his nearempty briefcase and looked into then closed it remembering the exact spot where hed left the rest of the file on his desk uhm ive got somebody compiling all that stuff ill get you a copy watkins then asked multiple perpetrators dont know were a lot of footprints around mostly mens i had pictures taken of them ill get you copies if you want naw watkins studied the photocopy of the knife ohhuh uhhuh did he cut her no strangled watkins said i dont know what this insignia is you have any idea they look sort of german like the nazis you know its not a swastika no slocum said i dont mean that i saw this tv movie the gestapo had these insignias not the gestapo the ss the schutzstaffel thats it yeah lightning bolts only those were parallel these are crossed watkins waved the sheet knife have any manufacturer no just korea stamped into the end the hasp watkins said when the guy raped her how much come was there slocum sought the answer in the ceiling of the office he thought that watkins asked this too eagerly and he wondered if watkins who wore no wedding ring was gay the me estimated three ounces uhhuh watkins said he linked his fingers and cradled the back of his head he asked slocum dozens of questions whether restraints were used if the killer found the victim or kidnapped her if there was evidence of alcohol how jennies body had been arranged in the flowers whether foreign objects had been inserted into her anus or vagina how attractive she was if there were lip marks or other evidence that the killer had drunk her blood or urine thats pretty damn gross slocum said offended at the question any fingerprints on the knife yeah then a mess ofem other places too im having somebody check those against known sex offenders thats a good place to start im making damn sure this situation isnt gonna happen again slocum said with relentless sincerity are you now the state detective seemed amused he scratched at the photocopy then gazed absently at the black toner that came off on his thumb watkins interrupted slocums account of the goat found in the grade school by saying tell me about number two only one goat i heard about the other victim weve got no other victim just the gebben girl when you called watkins said examining a slip of paper you said killings did i theres only one now but were worried that well have a repeat in the next week with the full moon you know steve ribbons your sheriff right yep sure is and hammerback ellison hes harrison county sheriff theyre both up for reelection next fall the dividing line between what he should say and what he shouldnt had always been blurry for jim slocum yep i believe so im not sure theyre running watkins wiped a wave of sweat off his forehead that was the smell slocum recognized sweat not onions watkins grinned lotta folk say steven ribbons bubbles a little offplumb slocums eyes weaseled away from watkinss and he studied the spine of modern sociopathology i dont know about that naw i suppose you wouldnt watkins smiled like hed hit a hole in one well you want to make this moren what it is hey thats your alls business then the smile left his face and he said with only one killing and on these facts its way too early to know what youve got you need more information cant you give us some idea going on the assumption its a cult i can give you the textbook profile for a classic cult killer if you want but dont take it to the bank ive got no idea whether it applies or not i understand that sure that said you want me to go ahead shoot slocum straightened up and flipped his notebook open as he did so he glanced at the skull and had a passing thought where could a man get himself one of those dogit amos trout said whyd it have to happen just now always the way you oughta cant afford a new one you gotta patch her trout stood with the mechanic in the left bay of the oakwood malls carcare centre looking down at the tub of water so grimy it might have come from higgins creek downstream of the old paper mill in the tub was a goodyear tire and out of its side was escaping a steady stream of greasy bubbles trout fortyfour was wearing dark slacks and a shortsleeved white shirt he had thinning hair cut short and combed back in his plastic pocket protector were three pens a tiny calculator and a sales tax chart trout sold carpeting at floors for all he looked sadly at the bubbles whatll it cost for a patch five seventyfive i could do it myself i was home trout said you aint home looks to be a pretty slow leak and she got me all the way here this morning i could just pump her up and take my chances you could you wouldnt want to do that without you had yourself a good spare thats my opinion trout wouldnt have been so concerned about the tire if after he closed up tonight he and the wife werent driving up to minnesota to catch big lazy muskies and sit in lawn chairs while they drank cocktails out of the back of their beige accordion travelall and it was going to be four weeks before he got back to thirteenninetyfive acrylic pile your choice of colors pad included free if you buy today plug her he said and do a good job im about to put some road under that buick four blessed weeks thank you lord though im sorry about the wife part the tire man went to work after a moment he held up a piece of glass like a dodge city doctor whod just extracted a bullet from a gunslingers arm there she be you had steel belteds it wouldnt evenve dented em trout studied the glass i knew i picked up something tuesday night i was coming back late on and you know that curve by the dam blackfoot pond where everybody fishes the mechanic slicked a plug with glue and began driving it into the puncture uhn well i went around the curve and this fellow comes running up right into my lane maybe your lightsre on the blink i could check theyre fine except one high beams out of whack i can just thats okay and so i went off the road sos not to hit him wham bam just like that he froze i went over a beer bottle you know its those fishermen they leave all kinds of crapola around they dont do that in minnesota they dont trout said scared the living you know what out of me seeing that fellow he looked scared as i was dont blame him i wouldnt wanta be buick feed myself yessir trout looked at his watch it was two oclock he paid for the plug you sell propane you got a tank you can fill it no i mean for a coleman naw gotta go to the outdoor store for that guess i better long lunch hour today but hell with it im almost on vacation the sound of the gears buzzing was just audible over the wind that hissed past his ears jamie corde upshifted as he came to the crest of the hill on old farm road below him a hazy mile away the school sat in a field tartopped brick buildings squatting in a couple of acres of parking lots and limegreen grass this was his favorite stretch of road a sharp decline of smooth asphalt which if you caught it at the right time of day was pretty much traffic free although he now rode a fifteenspeed italian racing bike the boy often surged down this road on his old threespeed schwinn which was mounted with a speedometer on a summer day with tires fat from the heat inflation he could hit fifty miles per hour before he had to brake for the stop light where old farm crossed route he started downhill jamie corde loved to run and he was a ragingly fast runner but he knew that nothing could beat the feeling of speed not of your own making flying down a mountain of snow in colorado or racing down a slope like this one effortlessly the gears ratcheting beneath your toeclipped feet as if the powers of nature were taking you someplace you couldnt find by yourself the bike was steady under his strong arms as the dotted centerline became a single gray blur he leaned forward to cut the drag and concentrated on nothing but steering around patches of pebbles he did not think of his mother or his sister he did not think of his father with the exception of a few images of greg lemond in the tour de france jamie corde thought of speed and speed only halfway down the incline to his enormous delight he passed a car true it was an old volkswagen diesel and it was being driven by someone who resembled mrs keening his antiquated latin teacher but it was nonetheless a car and he had outraced it feeling with utter ecstasy the motion of the drivers head as she glanced at him with disapproving awe a half mile ahead at the foot of the hill lay the intersection he noticed with disappointment that he had timed his assault on the slope wrong if he had waited three or four minutes at the top and started his descent just as the stoplight had turned red he might have arrived when it was green and he would have swept smoothly through but the light was now changing to yellow route was heavily trafficked and was favored by this particular light which kept drivers on old farm road waiting impatiently for long minutes he slowly squeezed the rear brake lever thonk a sudden sensation something had struck his right calf he believed he had hit a small animal a field mouse or chipmunk and it had been flung up against his leg by the hissing wheel almost simultaneously his hand on the brake lever began to cramp he glanced at the handlebars and noticed that the lever was all the way to the metal jamie looked down at the rear wheel what had struck his leg had not been an animal it was the rubber pad of the rear brake shooting from its housing the metal seemed slightly bent and he realized with horror that when he had lifted the bike onto the pegs in the garage last night he must have hit the steel jacket that held the pad loosening it his father had warned him a dozen times to be careful when he placed the bike on the wall he continually ignored the advice he was two hundred yards from the intersection and still accelerating approaching fortyfive or fifty the bike began to vibrate he gripped the handlebars with trembling fists as he swept over stones and branches he was going too fast to maneuver around them sweat of panic burst from his neck and under his arms he felt the icy chill as the moisture evaporated in the slipstream jamie gently squeezed the front brake no effect he squeezed harder and the rear end of the bike rose suddenly nearly sending him tumbling headforward over the front wheel he was now a hundred yards from the intersection he kept as much pressure on the front brake as he dared but still the bike continued to speed up a stand of tall oaks flashed into his vision and vanished a roadside truck some fence posts the shoulder here was narrow paralleling his mad course was a barbed wire fence that would lacerate him if he were to set the bike down in the gravel beside the road jamie corde an aminus science student knows that terminal velocity in earth atmosphere is approximately one hundred and thirty miles an hour he knows that human organs cannot withstand instant deceleration from any speed about fifty he glances up at the crosstraffic along route trucks and cars whizzing past tears from the wind from his panic streak from his squinting burning eyes and disappear into his hair he sits up to increase wind resistance he remembers a prayer from sunday school he drags his feet on the asphalt but shreds the running shoes nylon toes quickly he lifts his feet to the pedals and the bike hurtles forward once again seventyfive yards the hill had bottomed out but the bicycle tore along the road at close to sixty the noise of the wheels and gears wholly obscured by the howl of the slipstream several bugs died against his face with sharp stings the lightweight frame of the bike shuddered painfully with every stone jamie eased onto the centerline of old farm road where there was less debris a fragment of bottle or a smear of grease could kill him fifty yards from the intersection he believed he heard a horn behind him maybe the volkswagen driver trying to warn him forty yards the man in a car waiting at the light glanced in his rearview mirror and jamie saw astonishment in the glossy rectangle that reflected the mans eyes thirty two japanese imports and a buick dashed through the intersection on going north a tanker truck rumbled south and jamie corde began to pedal he couldnt stop in time that was clear either he was going to dart between cars or he was going to get nailed he lowered himself into his best aerodynamic huddle clicked into his highest gear released the front brake lever and pedaled as he never had before he felt a warm sense of calm envelop him the cars were on a different plane the wind the barbed wire the road too the bike itself the fear vanished he was above all of these things the bluehaired woman piloting the volkswagen the driver whose eyes gaped in the mirror the trees the birds startled and fleeing from jamies own speed nothing was of the least importance he smiled and struggled to pedal fast enough to keep up with his trilling wheels propelling himself faster and faster fifteen yards the car waiting for the green light was a nissan and its license plate number was drt ten an old skid mark in the shape of a sine curve crossed both lanes pedal pedal pedal pedal a wooden crate that had contained rock island peaches lay shattered by the roadside wads of blue tissue paper bleeding into the ground faster than light the southbound taurus station wagon doing about sixtyfive began its skid thirty feet from where the bike was entering the intersection the gray vehicles end drifted to the left as the frozen wheels howled the driver steered into the skid expertly which had the effect of moving the car into the oncoming lane and aiming the grille precisely at where the speeding bicycle would cross the highway the frontseat passenger lowered her face below the dashboard the baritone detroit horn blared the driver flung an arm over his eyes ping jamie corde had an impression of fingers snapping beside his head as he passed in front of the station wagon the bumper missed his rear tire by no more than six inches their combined speed was close to one hundred ten miles an hour his ears filled with the horn and the endless scream of the locked wheels then he was past route dancing over what was otherwise a risky patch of pebbles and transmission fluid as confidently as if the road were a smooth banked racetrack he relaxed his numb legs and coasted horns shrieked behind him and he knew he was getting cussed out by at least one station wagon full of people but what could he do except keep going leaving them far far behind jamie corde continued to pedal furiously to keep his speed up as he approached the school he stood high on the pedals he gazed up into the sky and breathed in hot oily air waving a fist above his head laughing and howling like a desertloco cowboy jim slocum opened the candy bar and took a bite pressing the candy up against the roof of his mouth he dropped a dollar on the counter be right with you officer the young woman behind the counter said take your time slocum leaned against the counter in the sweets n things shop at the oakwood mall he took another bite of milky way which was still his favorite candy bar always had been always would be the door to the candy store opened and slocum watched a teenage boy enter fat wearing grimy clothes blond hair long and stiff with spray or grease slocum recognized him as philip halpern the boy glanced at slocum in unconcealed surprise he walked to the wall of glass canisters of penny candy and began to fill a bag slocum was put off he felt angry at the boy for his weight and his lack of willpower he wanted to say you keep eating like that youre gonna stroke out by the time youre twenty son he kept these thoughts to himself though like all new lebanon deputies slocum had answered domestic violence calls at creth halperns shabby bungalow the father could be frightening his eerily confused eyes as much as his temper the exsailor would slouch on the couch picking at a flap of skin from his righthook knuckle and smiling at the bloody streaks on the dented front of the kelvinator his wife pungent with gin holding ice to her pretty face would look up with a drunks sincerity and say we was fooling around is all philip himself sometimes bruised usually hid in the bedroom there was a daughter too slocum bet shed be knocked up and remingtonmarried by the time she was sixteen boy you stay that fat they wont let you join the army and whatre you gonna do then jim slocum was convinced that all emotional troubles could be cured by varsity football or basic training the clerks customer left the store miss slocum said to her im asking all the merchants here in the mall if they were open late on tuesday night this have to do with the student girl who got killed yep sure does is this fellow you know two furrows of concern appeared on the young womans brow hows that she touched her heavily moussed brown hair what i heard was debbie lipp told me whos ever behind that killing hes looking for brunets i bought some clairol yesterday i mean i had my colors done and going blond would throw it all off but slocum watched a tear center in her eye and roll over the edge of the eyelined lid i wouldnt go doing that miss hes not looking for brunets that we know about your hair looks real nice just the way it is he smiled sexy too im scared officer her brittle voice cracked i gotta drive home at night and earl hes my husbands shifts not over till eleven sitting there in the trailer for three hours by myself i cant watch tv for the noises outside i cant read i just sit im too addled to even knit and im going to miss my nieces birthday with the vest i promised her she cried grim and silent for a moment were doing everything in our power to get this son of a gun now i was asking about tuesday i cant help you im afraid we close at seven on tuesday well there you have it dead end tell you what give me a quarter pound of those jelly beans what flavord they be the watermelon ones yeah slocum paid he took the change and smiled a flirt at her i get by here on occasion ill look in on you and see how youre doing she swallowed and lifted away a tear with a corner of her sleeve id rather you was out catching him well were doing that too he said stonily and took the candy walking to the door he glanced at the halpern boy you want a snack eat apples he snapped slocum ambled through the recessionbattered wasteland of the mall until he came to the last store on his list floors for all inside a young man with trim hair sat at a desk carefully writing in an order book afternoon slocum said howdy officer what kind of carpet you interested in today we got a special this place here open late on tuesday yessir lot of carpet stores close down weeknights but were number one with carpet number one with service nightsre important we get men come in after work to check out the carpet their little ladiesve chose earlier in the day you working this last tuesday no sir thatd be mr trout amos trout will he be coming in today oh hes in hes not here right now because he got car problems he took a late lunch should be back any time ill stop back later slocum left the store and halfway to the exit nearly walked into adeline kraskow well well well slocum circled her hey jim she said in her husky voice she was young and might have been pretty if shed forced her saltandpepper hair into staying put the strands reminded him of bx cable she also needed to move some of the boob weight down to her toothpick legs a rearrangement slocum never thought hed recommend to any woman addie had dry skin and high cheekbones and she wore little makeup this made slocum think that she was desperate for a man he asked whats happening doing a story on how this cult murder thing is affecting business bad yep peoplere scared staying home and not spending money what are you doing here i cant really talk about it they stood for a minute silent slocum had a fast series of thoughts that hed been promising to bring the wife to the mall that he could do that on sunday and that while she did her shopping he could talk to this guy amos trout at the carpet store he asked im taking kind of a break you interested in getting a drink adeline kraskow said sure i guess and she stuffed her notebook into her huge purse and together they strolled through the mall they had known each other for exactly one year ever since she started covering the police beat for the harrison county register the topheavy ms kraskow didnt know that slocum regularly had acrobatic sexual intercourse with her and had been fellated by her dozens of times each instance of course in his technicolor imagination while he was engaged in considerably more mundane sexual activity with his wife of eleven years or with his right hand he supposed that if in real life addie had ever stubbed out one of her chainsmoked cigarettes and unzipped his fly hed have gone limp as monthold rhubarb but still he liked to sit with his knee pressed accidentally on purpose up against her thigh while she asked her reporters everserious questions now he maneuvered her into a dark corner booth of the malls only fullfledged restaurant tk hoolihans youre on duty she asked im undercover i can drink youre wearing a uniform how can you be undercover well im wearing jockey shorts no thats underwear not undercover he laughed to show it was a joke addie smiled with flirtatious contempt they ordered neat scotches and he paid thanky she lit a cigarette inhaled and shot out a stream of smoke at the plastic tiffany lampshade decorated with robins so you got any leads yet i told you is there a connection with the susan biagotti killing bill wouldnt want me talking on that im sure he wouldnt but i cant ask only questions people want me to ask the biagotti killing never got solved here steve ribbons revving up for reelection and he flubbed that case bad now theres a second girl dead addie she said you dont know how persistent i am tell me something anything i promise your name wont appear anywhere in the story slocum sighed addie leaned forward strategically and whispered cross my heart the warmth she denied the parents she spent on the children diane corde could at least say that for the woman hello sarah the woman said ebulliently im dr parker how are you today in the silence that followed the three of them standing in the veterinarian waiting room diane said honey you know how to answer im not going to take the spelling test sarah said in a dour snappy voice and im not going back to school well now sarah the doctor said cheerfully weve got some other things to talk about lets not think about your spelling test today all right sarah diane barked i wont have you behaving this way dr parker didnt intrude between mother and daughter she simply kept the smile and extended her hand sarah shook it abruptly then stood back looking diane thought sadly like the little brat shed become come on inside the doctor said ive got some things id like to show you she motioned the girl into her office diane looked through the door and noticed a number of dark green boxes on her desk the letters wiscr were stamped into them she then glanced at dr parker to appraise todays fashion choice a closefitting red silk dress with dark stockings in new lebanon didnt some famous gangsters moll wear a red dress when she turned him in diane stepped forward after sarah but dr parker shook her head and nodded to the couch in the waiting room just sarah and me today oh sure diane feeling chastised retreated to the couch and watched the receptionist open a pack of trident and slip a piece into her mouth the woman noticed diane staring at her and held up the package i dont chew gum thank you as the doctors door closed diane caught a glimpse of her daughters face staring fearfully down at the boxes the door latch clicked diane sighed and aimlessly picked through a basket of wilted magazines she lifted one to her lap with substantial effort and turned the pages a few minutes later diane closed the unread magazine and slumped on this rec room couch awash with defeat defeated by her husband in whose presence sarah relaxed and laughed her husband who could speak sarahs flawed tricky language while diane could not defeated by sarah herself with her wily tactics of tears and panic by this harlot of a shrink who was taking their scarce money so eagerly and by her own guilt diane corde gazes with unseeing eyes at a glossy magazine peppered with giddy photos of models while her legs shake with the terrible anguish of retribution diane corde fairly good methodist has been taught to believe in divine justice taught to believe that revenge is fair and cleansing but it is not because the person who is paying the exacted price for the sins is not the mother who committed them but the daughter did you drink while you were pregnant no of course not what a question no one drank when they were pregnant no one took sleeping pills no one took aspirin all you had to do was read the science and health section of the postdispatch or register or even readers digest for heavens sake and you knew how to behave when you were pregnant drinking liquor no sane pregnant woman would drink unless unless unless for instance someone you loved had perhaps done something very bad your husband maybe and after word got out in the newspapers the neighbors would look at you funny or not look at you at all and people would call late at night and just listen for a moment before hanging up as if they were curious to hear if your breathing was more monstrous than theirs unless that person your husband maybe kept doing nothing and saying nothing nothing nothing until the money ran out and the only solution was to move from a nice shipshape suburb to a small tired rural town and start life over again his life and yours in the process so even if you were pregnant wasnt that reason enough to take a drink now and then just to kill the silence of a man doing nothing the heaviest silence that there is a pill now and then a few more drinks and a few more to break the mournful web surrounding the seven am breakfast table to help you sleep even if you woke up with a dogjaw pressure in the back of your head every other morning nobody drinks when theyre pregnant oh sarah diane corde looked at the cheap door separating herself from her injured daughter and focused on the magazine again she read every word of an article about a boat trip down the loire as if she were going to be tested on the subject in the morning i dont like her sarah announced in the car on the way home why not she gave me all this stupid stuff to do drawing pictures and answering questions i did it at school already wasnt she nice to you mrs beiderbug beiderson mrs beidersons nice to me and she makes me feel all yucky i felt yucky when i did those tests in dr parkers office shes trying to help you i hate her sarah dont talk that way shes going to make me take the spelling test at school i saw you talking with her after thats what she told you isnt it yes it was diane hesitated then said dr parker wants you to keep studying next time you see her shes going to give you some tricks to help you take tests im not going back to school dianes patience had just about evaporated and she said nothing i hate it i feel stupid in school the sunshine man her voice faded we all hated school thats what your father and i keep telling you everybody does this was spoken through firmly clenched teeth you remember what a good job you did on your story this spring about the birds sarah got a c plus her highest grade ever in english and had written a single page other students had filled four or five sarah whined i dont want to take the tests dont make me im going to work with you on the words tonight then were going to jamies match no she announced i want daddy to help me your fathers working late diane pulled the car into the driveway she waved at the deputy in the cruiser parked in front of the house he nodded back and returned to the newspaper diane braked to an angry stop sarah said hes always working they got out of the car and walked through the garage to the back door no he isnt he spends a lot of time with you hes missing jamies match too tonight wrestlings stupid dont criticize your brother hes doing just fine in school diane was horrified at these words she glanced at sarah surreptitiously but the girl hadnt notice the unintended slight mommy look theres something on the back steps diane saw a small white envelope sarah scooped it up eagerly and looked at it she frowned then handed it to her mother they continued into the house diane paused in the hallway the sunlight pouring through the open door it fell on her hands turning them blood red go on upstairs and get your books the little girl gave an extended sigh and clomped the stairs the envelope was addressed to officer corde red ink sloppy handwriting diane tore it open lifted out the contents what is it sarah yelled diane jumped nothing honey she dropped the glossy square polaroid back into the envelope which she shoved into her pocket she called the sheriffs department she got the dispatcher emma its diane corde find him and tell him to get home tell him were okay but i need him and i need him now she hung up and started toward the front door to summon the deputy she got only as far as the living room before she paused leaned against the wall and surrendered to her tears bill corde crouched casually in front of sarah he measured his words then said honey i have to ask you something and youll tell me the asyouloveme truth sure daddy the girl returned his gaze cautiously did i do something wrong im sorry no no honey cordes heart cried as he looked into her penitent eyes im just curious to know something has anybody maybe taken your picture in the last couple days my picture no or maybe just asked if he could take your picture some stranger on the way home from school no youre sure did i do something wrong she seemed about to cry no nothing its okay you didnt do anything wrong i was just curious you run get washed up for dinner corde returned to steve ribbon and tom who were walking in slow paces around the fence behind cordes property nothing bill ribbon said not a footstep dry grass what do you expect the deputy said i was here all afternoon he was defensive i cant be both at the front and the back at the same time im not blaming you tom ribbon shielded his eyes like a plains warriors and gazed off into the forest anybody live thataway corde leaned on a cockeyed termitechewed fence post squinting against the sunset light five hundred acres of forest mostly private a few houses beyond thats the river and the other ways the preserve and the university and downtown beyond that he couldve come from anyplace he couldve parked on by the bridge and walked none of the neighbors saw anything corde examined the photograph again through the plastic bag in which it now rested it was of a girl about sarahs age the face wasnt visible lying in grass her skirt was pulled up to her waist and the v of white underwear filled the center of the shot on the back was printed in red marker youre working too hard detective hell he winced as if the message brought him physical pain i dont think its her she says nobody took her picture recently and i know she wouldnt lie to me but goddamn the deputy said we should get a handwriting analysis the newspaper clipping at the pond and this im sure theyre the same corde said even i can see the similarity nobody saw nothing your son nope nobody was here brother im sorry about all this bill ribbon offered youre sorry corde muttered walking inside diane was sitting on the couch her hands together corde sat beside her and cradled her hands in his this could be just a prank maybe it has nothing to do with the case a prank it was our daughter she whispered violently we dont know that for sure it could be anybody she tells me nobody took her picture she tells you oh bill you know sarah half the time shes off in her own world hes trying to spook me is all look if that was sarah in the picture and hed wanted to hurt her why didnt he she pressed her eyes closed wrinkles blossomed into her face and for a moment she seemed ten years older than she was if anybodys at risk its me corde said that sure makes me feel damn better she shot back at him honey this fellow isnt stupid murdering a law enforcement officers a capital crime does he know that she blurted diane she stormed into the kitchen there was nothing more to do corde went back outside to talk to ribbon ten minutes later diane poked her head out the door and told him in an ominous monotone that dinner was ready corde asked steve ribbon and the deputy if they wanted to stay but they couldnt or more likely didnt want to they left corde walked into the dining room then jamie and sarah joined their parents and the family sat down to dinner corde told the children with gentle words that there might be some people who werent real happy with what he was doing to solve this case so not to go anywhere by themselves and to stay close to home dont talk to strangers then corde somehow found the strength to turn the conversation funny and talked about a sports blooper tape hed seen recently the only time a pall filled the room was when corde realized he had stopped talking in mid sentence and was staring out the black window at the backyard he stood up fast and closed the drapes everybody looked at him then he sat down and ate a huge third helping of string beans even though he didnt want them but it seemed like a comic thing to do and the evening returned more or less to normal tt ebbanss practice was to question people at home at night hed try not to conduct interviews during business hours at offices where guards are up and minds instinctively think up lies and excuses for bosses for fellow workers for clients for creditors ebbans also happened to enjoy the evening it reminded him of a wholly different era of his life years before the oily smell of night the stillness the bleaching to monotone of the deep colors of the day and the feel of his heartbeat quickening a prelude to the fiveman searchanddestroy night missions that were both the peak and the valley of his life at tenthirty he came to the last house a colonial on one acre sloping down to blackfoot pond this hour was usually postbedtime in new lebanon for anybody under fifteen and over thirty but lights shone in the windows of this house he thunked the brass lionshead knocker once and the door swung open almost immediately he found the couple waiting for him communication was good among blackfoot pond homeowners they all introduced themselves churchsocial formal tall paunchy bushyhaired hank said come on in officer get you anything maybe if i could trouble you for a glass of water surely lisa still in her real estate brokers white blouse and trim red skirt vanished like a spooked mouse hank motioned ebbans into a living room spotless as an operating theater plush white carpet a creamcolor sofa covered with clear plastic the furniture was antiqued white and gold lisa walked into the room and handed the water to the deputy they both stared at him as he drank it all down he wasnt so thirsty as this but he didnt know where to set down the glass he handed it to her thank you she returned a moment later they sat plastic crinkled loudly hank said youre here about the murder im asking everyone in the area if they saw or heard anything around the time of the killing that would be ten oclock that was tuesday right lisa asked gesturing moving her fingers in a circular motion to count back on an invisible calendar nothing hank said we didnt see anything no lisa echoed not a thing sorry we cant be more help hank said he wished they could but well ebbans knew how it was the deputy let them stew in a lengthy silence then asked lisa but do i understand that you saw something another night lisas busy hands spread apart for a moment ebbans noticed they had left sweat stains on her crimson skirt pardon hank said we didnt see ebbans said to his wife you asked if it was tuesday i was just wondering if that meant you saw something some night other than tuesday she stared for a minute then gave a fast burst of a laugh oh i see what you mean no the only reason i asked if it was tuesday was to you know orient myself because of sean he she blinked hanks head turned slowly to her ebbans figured they had debated all evening about keeping their secret lisa began to tremble ebbans wondered how loud the discussion between these two would be after he left sean is ebbans asked our son hank muttered lisa said he was here on tuesday thats right id forgotten she swallowed hard and ebbans wondered if she was going to cry sean got home from a rifle club practice late what time would that have been she looked at her husband and decided not to lie about ten ebbans asked is sean here now well he is hank conceded but i doubt he can help you lisa said it was pretty dark i dont think he saw much anything you tell me is confidential nobodyll know he gave us any information hank walked to the stairs and called his son a tall boy in jeans and a tshirt appeared in a minute looking assured smiling staring ebbans right back in the eyes ebbans who had two daughters and had never for one minute regretted that thought he would love to have a son like sean you heard about the girl was killed over by the dam yessir we heard the next day i understand you got home about ten from the rifle club what kind of gun you shoot winchester with a target barrel thats a good gun whats your rank sharpshooter all positions ebbans jutted out his jaw impressed and asked you were outside about ten on tuesday after i dumped the garbage bags in the bin i saw this raccoon and i chased him off down toward the lake i saw two people sitting on the other side of the dam what were they doing lisa said dont be afraid to say you dont know if you dont looked like they had tackle but it might just have been gym bags or something they werent fishing can you describe them sorry sir not too good he nodded vaguely toward where the dam must have been its a ways all i could see was their you know outlines silhouettes ebbans said could you tell if they were men or women boys white or black well i got the feeling they were guys kids from school i mean he added formally i dont believe they were africanamericans what did you see them do after a couple minutes they stood up and picked up whatever they were carrying and walked to the dam there was this flash from one of their hands i thought it was a knife the way he held it ebbans said might it have been a bottle or a soda can yessir couldve been they sat on the dam for a while then i saw one of them point and they ducked down and ran off into the bushes i thought they might be hatters so hatters you know like geeks or something so i put the bikes in the garage and you didnt see them again nosir but i did see someone who walked by close to them an old guy he was fishing he was about sixty id guess about my grandpas age he was casting spoons but he had a fly fishermans hat on a red one you havent seen him since nosir you want me to keep an eye out for him ill be happy to do that no honey lisa said i mean youve done plenty with the authoritative voice of a middle manager hank said thats not our job son you wont use his name will you lisa asked you wont talk to reporters all names are confidential i promise you that ebbans looked at his watch and said he had to be going and thanked lisa for the water and hank for the time he said to the boy i sure appreciate your help it was a brave thing to do and id appreciate anything else you can do for us at the door the only hand he shook was seans in the dark they talked brian okun said think about what youre saying what youre calling melancholia was cynicism the young woman considered this then said no i dont think so how much of wallace stevens have you read they were in okuns apartment in downtown new lebanon a half mile from the quadrangle this was the towns sole urban tenement neighborhood which consisted of one block of threestory walkups eighty years old enough to know that he was sad dahlia answered sad men dont write poetry like his skeptics do theres a power about him what about sunday morning she asked you call that power the woman has no energy shes almost paralyzed at the thought that theres no god sunday morning is the most okun found a word that conveyed contempt accessible poem it doesnt count but since youve brought it up i maintain that only a cynic would create that imagery in the first place dahlia was from wichita but was of eastern indian ancestry she was short and voluptuous okun called her plump another nod to dickens he wished she knew more about the modern poets he said you forget stevens was a lawyer for an insurance company a businessman wait wait okun who was lying naked between dahlias dark smooth thighs tensed for a moment slipped his penis out of her and came generously on her black fur of pubic hair he squeezed against her and lay still for a moment he kissed her breast and said are you okay by which he meant did she have an orgasm when she said a hesitant im fine he rolled off her and began reciting from memory the stevens poem notes toward a supreme fiction they had been dating off and on for a year when okun fell in love with jennie gebben after the breakup with jennie okun and dahlia continued to see each other on occasion and more rarely to have lethargic sex not a word was ever spoken about marriage monogamy or even vaguer commitments although he was more frank with her than with anyone else at auden tonight she was unknowingly taking part in an experiment okun was just about to commence he turned on the overhead light and lit a cigarette he stared at a flap of paint on the ceiling a flap that for some reason always made him think of the severed portion of vincent van goghs ear i was in leon gilchrists office today hes off someplace isnt he san francisco poetry conference at berkeley he doesnt seem like the ucb sort i have no idea what sort he is the strange sort dahlia said hes brilliant stating the obvious diminishes you okun said a homemade aphorism he used often hes cute she said cute bullshit well i dont know maybe not hes intense i have trouble picturing him hes nondescript oxymoron how can he be intense and nondescript at the same time she blotted her sable groin with his sheet i dont know he had a draft of my evaluation for the faculty committee in his desk you went through his desk do you know what he wrote on it she asked how could you burgle his desk he said he did not want to work with me next semester and he recommended that my advisor look long and hard at my dissertation she was shocked he what he said i was arrogant and lacked sufficient depth to be a talented professor he said if the school insisted on hiring me after conferring the degree it should be as a librarian this was all true when okun had first read the words on gilchrists evaluation form he had felt physically ill he now had some distance but reciting the professors scathing critique made his hands quiver with rage brian why did he say that hes a vengeful prick is why im as smart as he i have more social skills and i want his job hes figured that out why were you going through his desk okun barked im his graduate assistant if i cant have access to his desk who can he then added coyly can you keep a secret brian its something ive been wrestling with ive got to confide in somebody its about him gilchrist youre dying to tell me i shouldnt tell me did you know that he and jennie gebben had an affair the girl who was killed ohmagod from almost the first week in september no hes into s and m i knew that dahlia said surprising okun who had fabricated this detail as he had the fact of the affair itself he asked where shed heard this she shook her head dont know okun continued he used to tie her up and whip her tits oh and hed piss on her i think she pissed on him too god her wideeyed expression of shock was delicious okun smiled then chuckled silently dahlia frowned across the pillow at him then grimaced and slapped his arm youre making this up you fuck he laughed hard i doubt gilchrist knew jennie from excuse the expression a hole in the wall but you swallowed it raw prick so you going to start a rumor are you okun said hes not going to crater me with a bad evaluation hes dumped on the wrong person but he could be arrested divorce yourself from simplicity darling he was in san francisco when she was killed theyll find that out soon enough i dont want him to go to jail i just want to make him sweat you know what i think im vindictive and petty he asked curious i think you should cut out the part about getting pissed on thats too sick for words nobody around hered buy that good point okun said always willing to take good advice a little paraphilia goes a long way kiss me no why not because you scare me brian me yes you kiss me no yes he commanded and she did the security guard led corde and ebbans through the garbage room of jennies dorm to an emergency exit it was early the next morning and the air was humid and filled with smell of lilac dogwoods and hot tar from roofers forty feet above their heads corde and ebbans had returned to the dorm to see if they could find emily corde thought they might catch her before she left the dorm she wasnt there although her bed had been slept in and the bar of camay in the creamcolor soap dish was wet the detectives had waited in her room for nearly twenty minutes but she never returned just as the antsy guard seemed about to complain corde glanced out the window into the parking lot huhn hed written a note to emily on one of his business cards and had left it on her desk he then had said to ebbans follow me ebbans did trailed by the guard a man with a huge swelling of latticed nose who hadnt smiled at the men all morning bill corde pushed the stained bar on the gray fire door and stepped into the parking lot behind the dorm the three men walked along a small grassy strip that separated the building from the parking lot grass and weeds and oil drums painted green and white corde asked the guard are those the school colors nope theyd be black and gold ugly ebbans said you salute it you dont wear it the guard grumbled least i dont they saw however that not all the oil drums were green and white one was black fire corde asked now as he walked up to the drum pranks the guard rubbed his great crosshatched nose and muttered that the way they be think they own the world the students you know what im saying be spoiling stuff for everybody corde peered into the drum lets get it over but slow together they eased the heavy drum to the ground a small avalanche of ash puffed up gray cloud corde and ebbans went onto their knees and probed carefully trying not to shatter the thin pieces of ash there were two blackened wire spirals that had been the spines of notebooks the rest was a mostly unrecognizable mound of ash and wads of melted plastic corde found several fragments of unburnt white paper there was no writing on them he eased them aside he then found half a scrap of green accounting printout paper filled with numbers whats this ebbans shrugged i dont do brainy crimes corde put the scrap in a plastic bag ebbans plucked a small pair of tweezers from the butt of a swiss army knife and reached forward he gently lifted a bit of crinkly purple paper all that remained was the upper lefthand corner march jennie ge mcreyn aude new her letters ebbans said there was triumph in his voice there you go bill a pile of ash is all they are ebbans often worked like a dog on scent maybe maybe not lets keep going and see what we can find together the men crouched down and began their search again when they finished an hour later they had nothing to show for their effort but the scraps of paper they had found right off and two uniforms filthied it seemed beyond saving even from the distance he sees fear in their eyes in their posture in their cautious gait driving along cress street a shortcut to the sheriffs department bill corde watches people on the sidewalks of new lebanon shades are drawn more than the usual number of stores had not yet opened this morning although it is a glorious spring day in a town that has wakened early for a hundred and fifty years the people are skittish like cattle in thunder corde drums the steering wheel and wishes he hadnt compared his good citizens to fedout slaughter animals ace hardware lamstons longs variety webbs lingerie and foundations stores or the descendants of stores identical to them that have been here forever stores he has walked past for years stores he has shopped in and answered calls at stores whose owners he sees at pta meetings but today as he cruises slowly in and out of elongated morning shadows corde hardly recognizes the street and its occupants he feels what a soldier feels in an occupied foreign city he thinks of his own time in uniform when he once got lost in an old quarter of berlin corde stops his cruiser at the main street light a sudden crack on the window makes him jump gail lynn holcomb a high school class mate of his knocks again with red knuckles he cranks the glass down and looks up at her frowning overly powdered face bill hows this thing going there is no need to be more specific she continues should i keep courtney out of school im thinking i ought to he smiles to reassure her and says she doesnt have to worry but he sees that the words are pointless she is worried oh shes terrified and as he tells her that he thinks the gebben killing is an isolated incident he observes something else too he sees that she resents him corde has been a smalltown deputy for nine years which is about eight years longer than it takes to understand the ambiguous status of cops in towns like new lebanon people here respect him because theyve been taught to and what smalltown people are taught when young stays with them forever people knock on his windows with fat nervous hands and ask his advice and invite him to rotary club lunches and buy peanuts from him at the pta fall fundraiser they josh and nod and shake his hand and cry against his solid shoulder but theres a distance thats real and its big and it never shrinks because if bill corde stands for anything its that the long arm of malice can reach into the center of this safe little town where it ought not to be new lebanon doesnt deserve the same fate as east st louis or the south side of chicago or the bronx and bill corde is uniformed proof that its fate is different in degree only not kind what corde sees now in this agitated blond bundle of gail lynn gone heavy on potato chips and cola and cellowrapped cookies unskilled with the makeup brush but a good mother and a good wife is this very rancor oh how she resents him because she now must fight daily amid the noise of soap operas and sitcoms with her husband and daughter about locking doors and latching windows and chaperoning dates and which routes to take to and from jobs and shopping centers and schools because tomorrow morning courtney with her thick wrists and bright blue eye shadow might walk uncautiously into a middle school girls room where a man waits in a stall holding a narrow wire destined for a young girls throat because life for gail lynn holcomb is already a relentless series of burdens and she surely doesnt need this one too this murmur of utter fear that grows louder and louder each day that bill corde sitting calmly in his safe and secure blackandwhite dodge fails to catch this lunatic were doing everything we can corde concludes the light changes dont you worry now he adds and pulls into the intersection she does not respond beyond pressing her flecked lips together and staring at the car as it turns onto main street special to the register investigators from the new lebanon and harrison county sheriffs departments have developed a profile of the socalled moon killer who raped and murdered a yearold auden university coed on april the register has learned criminal behavior experts have reported that the man whose motive may have been to sacrifice the victim as part of a cult ritual is probably in his late teens or early twenties and white and he lives within ten miles of the murder site the man might be obsessed with occult literature much of which will be pornographic in nature he may have a history of sexual problems and may himself have been abused as a young child he may come from a broken home and at least one parent was a hostile disciplinarian he is a loner there is no known religion or cult in which human sacrifice to the moon is or was practiced this means that the moon killer might have created his own religion as did charles manson or jim jones the moon may be significant because in mythology and certain religions it represents the female it is women that the killer fears and hates investigators are considering the possibility that the recent murder is related to the beating to death last year of another auden coed susan biagotti a resident of indianapolis it is believed that the killer may act again on the night of the next full moon wednesday april deputies and auden campus security police have intensified patrol efforts and are urging young women to avoid going outside alone corde dropped the register on jim slocums desk and said howd this happen slocum rubbed his cheek you got me steve had an idea to have me go up to higgins and talk to the state boys just a spurofthemoment thing didnt you check out the roads and the mall like i asked did that too put nearly two hundred miles on the cruiser didnt find diddly well did you talk to a reporter why would i talk to a reporter he frowned and slapped the newspaper with his hand where i was maybe a little careless was i wrote up a memo after i talked to the state police and circulated it to everybody on the case its in your in basket didnt you see it you know what ill bet happened is something got leaked from the state corde was angry he shouted throughout the office no reporters nothing goes to the press without clearing it with me understood four deputies nodded stifffaced with unjust accusation but bill slocum said theres a lot that adds up look at this moon thing the lunatic message the knife corde snapped damned coincidence everybody knows about the full moon remember ed wembkie corde said this is not some guy got foreclosed out of his farm and went crazy ed killed that banker on the night of the full moon was also the day the marshal tacked up the auction notice and whats this talk about biagotti who brought that up slocum shrugged we are looking into it or at least you said you were going to jim i dont care that its accurate corde said in a low voice i care that its being talked about in the press he punched the newspaper theres nothing we can do about it now but in the future in the future i wont trust them state boys slocum said earnestly thats for damn sure corde stared at the article for a moment he clicked his tongue okay whats dones done now id like you to get out to the truck stops and along put up some fliers asking for witnesses that routes a feeder for the interstate if youre coming from hallburton that towns mostly dead bill i doubt thered be any truck traffic do it just the same fastcopys delivering them this afternoon uhn slocum said corde continued into his office he cracked open the window before he could sit down tt ebbans walked up to his desk carrying his own register ebbans said angrily weve got ourselves a leak looks like corde snorted and swung his door shut its not a leak if the sheriff doesnt mind he dug into his in box and found slocums memo it presented most of the same information that was in the article across the top slocum had scrawled something to think about corde handed the memo to ebbans who read it and said watkins knows what hes about but its too darn early for this sort of profile he should know better corde nodded toward ribbons office you know something tt he whispered steved look like a genius he stops a cult killer in his tracks dont you think especially if he could tie the biagotti killing to this guy i guess ebbans said but he wouldnt you know hurt the case just to do something like that corde shrugged we catch this guy fivell get you ten ribbon mentions biagotti at the same press conference also with this moon killer poop hes taking a lot of focus off the school which is where he doesnt want the focus to be why not you dont live in new lebanon tt hell the school damn near pays our salaries if auden goes whatve we got precious little farms a few dealerships insurance corde tossed the register into the trash he began pacing slowly and then stopped abruptly you know i cant let that go ebbans looked at him quizzically woman came up to me today and she was mighty spooked like she had the killer on her trail some paperboy or milkman comes to somebodys front door and hes going to get himself shot whos going to come forward with evidence if they think theyre going to get gutted by a werewolf or something ebbans said the storiesve run already bill theres nothing you can do about it yeah there is corde picked up the phone he called the register and then wral the local tv station in higgins he asked them about deadlines and if theyd be interested in a statement about the auden coed case by the chief investigator he took down some information then hung up after corde hung up ebbans glanced toward ribbons office and raised an eyebrow he sang he aint gonna like it corde shrugged and proceeded to spend an agonizing half hour composing a release after a dozen rewrites he slipped it over to ebbans new lebanon sheriffs department investigators are following several leads in the rape and murder of an auden university coed although it has been suggested that the murder was cult or sacrifttial investigators have said that this is only one possibility and they are also exploring the possibility that a friend or acquaintance of the victims from auden university may have been somehow involved anyone with any information is urged to immediately contact the new lebanon sheriffs department in complete confidentiality you spelled sacrificial wrong and also it doesnt sound like a newspaper story they write things different smoother or something well i dont care about that theyll doll it up what do you think about what it says ebbans read it again he shrugged i think you hedged pretty good at least sos ribbon wont get too bent out of shape but you know one thing bill if we keep playing it up that were after a cult killer the real perp might be you know lulled into thinking hes safe he wont be as likely to carry out those threats against you you run this well he may come looking for you corde had not considered this he smoothed the copy of his release in front of him its a risk true but its my risk and i think i have to take it weve got to get ourselves some witnesses returning to work from lunch corde parked in the town hall lot and saw steve ribbon climbing out of his cruiser the sheriff grinned a vacuous smile and motioned to him corde walked over to the car they leaned buttfirst against the fender howdy steve the sheriff nodded the sunlight hit ribbons face and revealed a speckle of red on his cheeks it reminded corde that ribbon volunteered every christmas to play a jaycees santa and slogged around in the snow and mud on new lebanons east side visiting trailers and maimed bungalows occupied mostly by single parents and their kids whenever he formed opinions about steve ribbon like the one hed shared with tt ebbans that morning corde tried to temper them with the memory of how the man spent december say bill theres a situation ive got to let you know about the register was tucked under ribbons solid arm shoot i was just over at county hammerbacks office last night he got a call from dean larraby over at auden you know her right corde grunted affirmatively well heres the scoop ribbon cleared his throat i seen that report on the burntup letters the gebben girls letters yup ribbon exhaled long through closed teeth stopping his breath with his tongue every second or so thup thup thup when his lungs emptied he took another breath and said somebody saw you coming out of her room the day they were stolen corde looked down at the pebbly asphalt wednesday afternoon ribbon said the day after she was killed wednesday i was there yeah i wanted to talk to jennies roommate well you didnt say anything about it when lance told us the letters were missing and steve i was there without a warrant the door was unlocked and people knew the girl was dead i was afraid evidence would start to disappear i took a fast look around the room and that was it did you see the letters werent there no well jesus bill ribbon chose not to mention the most serious offense the one that would be filling an uneasy ninety percent of his thoughts that corde had destroyed the letters himself instead he said anything youd picked up wouldntve been admissible that wouldve thrown the case all catercorner if id found anything i wouldve phoned in for a warrant then just babysat until lance or tt showed up with it all i was worried about was evidence disappearing which is just what happened anyway yes it did ribbons eyes swung like slow pendulums from town hall to a chevy pickup and back i dont think thiss a problem not yet hammerbacks got more important things to worry about and the dean didnt know diddly about warrants or anything she just had her tit in a wringer cause she doesnt like the way were going after the school and not letting her know what were about but for petes sake bill theres stuff about this case that could bite us in the ass we arent careful corde held ribbons eye i didnt burn those letters steve absolutely i know you didnt the thought never crossed my mind im just telling you what some people who dont know you as good as me might think just sort of be on your guard you know what im saying good now how bout we get back to the salt mines the front door of the sheriffs department office swung open and into the office strode wynton kresge corde had a permanent image of kresge walking into a room just this way swaggering and carrying a manila folder it was becoming a cliché kresge dropping the envelope on a desk and standing like a proud retriever thatd set a shot quail one inch from a hunters boot thankya wynton corde sat in a chair at an unoccupied desk opening the envelope still stewing about what ribbon had told him he added dismissingly thats all kresge went from bangtail to a pit bull in less than a second ebbans saw it coming and winced corde was caught completely off guard im just curious bout something detective kresge said loudly in a james earl jones baritone corde looked up i beg your pardon what would you like me to call myself hows that i was just hoping you could provide some enlightenment should i call myself messenger oh boy ebbans muttered kresge said maybe stepnfetchit ebbans said again oh boy corde blinked whatre you talking about im talking about i dont work for you i dont get a damn penny of town money so everything i do for yous gravy and you treat me like im delivering pizza corde looked at ebbans for help but the county deputys face was a mask corde asked kresge what are this girl gets herself killed and i say let me help you interview people i say let me help you look for clues i say let me help you put up fliers and you treat me like a busboy you say i didnt kresge shouted you say no wynton no thanks youre a black man i dont need your help oh boy ebbans said youre crazy corde yelled i dont see so many deputies working for you i dont see so goddamn many suspects lined up you can cart em off in a bus i offer you some help and what do you say you say thats all run long now ill call you when i need some impohtant paypahs menace was deep on his brow work throughout the department had stopped even the dispatcher had walked into the doorway of her office leaning sideways her head held captive by the pluggedin headset corde stood up redfaced i dont have to listen to this im just curious what youve got against me i dont have anything against you you dont want my help cause im black corde waved his arm angrily i dont want your help cause you dont know what youre doing how would you know you never tried me out you never asked me if you could help hell i didnt kresge looked at ebbans did i ask to help did i volunteer ebbans said to corde he did ask bill corde glared kresge said i wish you lots of luck detective you need any more help from the university security department you talk to one of the guards they wear uniforms they make seven twentyfive an hour theyll be happy to pick up things for you you can even tip you want ebbans and corde both squinted waiting for the rippled glass window in the door to explode inward from the concussion of kresges slam instead he closed it delicately and stomped off down the serpentine path to the driveway ebbans started laughing corde his face red with anger turned on him this isnt goddamn funny sure it is whats with him what did i do ebbans said dont they teach community relations in these here parts thats not funny they heard a car squeal away from the curb outside corde said goddamn i dont understand what i did ebbans said he could be helpful why dont you apologize apologize he roared for what you werent taking him seriously hes a security guard you still werent taking him seriously corde said i dont care if hes black where did he get that idea dont get so riled son of a bitch ebbans said he might sue you discrimination it took corde a minute to realize that ebbans was joking go to hell you take everything else seriously just not him corde shook his head in anger then stood he walked to the coffee vending machine and returned a minute later sipping the burnttasting liquid he grabbed the envelope kresge had delivered without seeing them he looked at the half dozen résumés it contained for a few minutes then said i hope he does sue id like the chance to say a few things to him in court ebbans said bill simmer down corde started reading the résumés he looked up a moment later was about to speak then closed his mouth and went back to reading a half hour later hed calmed down he asked ebbans these things say cv on them what does that mean i dont know where at the top oh wait heres one its spelled out curriculum vitae whats that maybe its greek for résumé corde said professors and went back to reading after he finished he read them again and then said to ebbans may have something here interesting whats that corde handed ebbans a copy of randolph sayless cv whats this tell you ebbans read carefully got me hes one of jennies professors over the last twelve years hes been a visiting professor at three other schools two of them were for oneyear terms but at that one loyola in ohio he left after three months so after loyola it says he spent the next nine months researching and writing a book before he came back to auden nine months thats the rest of the oneyear period after you subtract the three ebbans said well these professors travel around a lot dont they maybe he took time off but he hasnt published any books since hes been back from loyola that was four years ago maybe its about to come out well lets speculate doesnt it seem possible lets just say he got dumped from loyola and didnt want to come back here right away it would look strange hed have to explain why he got kicked out thats a reach bill corde picked up the telephone he dialed longdistance directory assistance then the number hed been given as he did ebbans continued i dont know getting fireds pretty thin grounds to make him a suspect isnt it not if he was fired because he slept with a student then assaulted her when she threatened to report it the dean at loyola college outside of columbus ohio took some convincing before he would tell corde this and even then he did so only after hed patched in the schools lawyer on an extension to tell the dean what questions to answer which turned out to be all of them after he hung up corde said to ebbans the assault charges were dropped nothing ever came of them but sayles agreed to resign what do you think now i think theres something else ebbans pointed at the résumé randy sayles is the associate dean in charge of financial aid rings a bell jennie gebben worked for him they were outside in the yard lapped by bands of cool air then hot as corde and diane sat pressed together on the picnic blanket he remembered this phenomenon from his teenage days they called it hotcolds waves of warm breeze alternating with waves of cold drifting through fields around the new lebanon high school at dusk a schoolmate had an explanation when a man and a woman did it the air around them got real hot and stayed that way for hours what the boys felt was proof that somewhere upwind a dozen girls had just gotten laid corde and diane had come outside to watch what was advertised as a meteorite shower after the threatening photo he had made an extra effort to get home early and once there stay put for the evening hed noticed the story about the meteorites and after sarah and jamie were in bed asked his surprised wife if shed like to have a date in the backyard diane had spread the blanket down and with half a bottle of wine beside them they sat close together fingers twined listening to crickets and owls and feeling the hotcolds wash over them the sky was clear and dominated by the nearfull moon theyd seen only one meteorite in fifteen minutes though it had been spectacular a long pure white streak covering half the sky the afterimage remained in their vision long after the burning rock disintegrated do you wish on em diane asked i think you can i dont know i dont know what to wish for if you decide corde said dont say it out loud meteorsre probably like birthday candles and wishbones she kissed him gripping his lip with her teeth they lay on the dewmoist blanket kissing hard sometimes brutally for almost five minutes his hand slipped up under her sweater and into her bra he felt her stiffen as her nipple went instantly hard passion he whispered grinning cold she said exhaling a laugh i know a place where its warmer so do i his hand started toward her jeans diane grabbed it with both of hers follow me she stood up and pulled him towards the house does this have anything to do with your wish he asked they lay in the same pose as in the yard now though they were naked and atop a hexpattern quilt dianes mother had begun the year of the iran embassy takeover and finished the year of the challenger explosion the threeway light was on dim and corde had licked off the last bit of her lipstick he rolled her over on her back wait a minute she said bounding up let me put it in the promised minute passed then several others he heard running water he heard a toothbrush he rolled over on his back gripping himself and squeezing to keep hard he heard the toilet flush he squeezed harder he heard the medicine cabinet opening and closing he stopped squeezing he was firm as a teenager for about ten seconds ohhhh bill the heartsick cry the alto moan of dianes voice was pitiful a scream would have been less harrowing corde was on his feet and running into the bathroom thinking only when he arrived that he should have taken the time to unlock the bedside table and pull his pistol from the drawer the blue diaphragm case lay at her feet the rubber disk itself rested like a pale yellow blister on the sink diane was sobbing her arms around herself covering her nakedness even from her husband bill saw a small white square on the floor at her feet he picked it up while diane pulled her red terrycloth bathrobe off the back of the door and slipped it on tying the belt tightly around her it was inside she whispered spinning a stream of toilet paper off the roll and using it to pick up the diaphragm she carried it like a crushed wasp to the wastebasket and dropped it in she did the same with the plastic case then began scrubbing her hands with soap and hot water this polaroid had been taken at the same time as the one left on the back steps the scene was of sarah or whoever the girl might be lying in the grass her skirt still up to her waist the angle was about the same so was the lighting there were in fact only two differences the photographer was now much near only several feet from the girl and the message in red marker on the back was different it said getting closer corde unlocked the gun rack and lifted out his long battered remington he slipped three shells into the tube and from a desk drawer took a cylindrical chrome lock he separated it and fitted the two parts on either side of the trigger guard he squeezed them together with a soft ratchety sound he put one key on his keychain and carried the other key and the gun itself into the living room where diane sat staring at the floor her mouth was a thin line how is he doing this dianes voice broke in frustration i dont know honey how does he get past the deputy i think he mightve left that note the same time he left the other one hes probably long gone by now mightve probably doesnt anybody know anything about this man corde kneaded the key absently no we dont we dont know a damn thing at all after a moment he said ill talk to tom tomorrow have him make trips around the house and into the woods corde set the gun in the corner i didnt chamber a round youll have to pump it once the safetys off just pump and pull you know how to do it aim low he handed her the key and she stood up and put it in her purse she seemed calmer now seeing the gun having some control wait a minute corde said he took the key out of her bag and walked into their bedroom he returned a moment later with a thick golden necklace he slipped the key over the end and then clasped it behind her neck he kissed her on the forehead she said thiss the chain you gave me when you gave me your class ring figured that was the right length to let everybody know to keep their hands off the key rested at the shadow of her cleavage she smiled and hugged him and cried some more corde said its plate you know the chain isnt a girl alive cant recognize plate from solid but it was the ring i was most interested in corde held her face were going to get through this just fine nothings going to happen to you or the kids hes just doing this to rattle me i promise diane dried her eyes and walked toward the bedroom she said god give me strength at first no one in town paid much attention it was mostly little things like when the register came out more people than usual bought it and what they turned to first was the almanac page which showed the phases of the moon for the next thirty days sales of shotgun shells and rifle ammunition were running twice what they usually did this time of year being nowhere close to season yet the sporting goods section of sears which normally sold tons of ted williams baseball gear this month was doing most of its dollar volume in lowcostss and even grossman co air pistols business at the quad and hojos and baskinrobbins fell to nothing as parents refused to let their daughters go on dates after dark exam grades at auden went up as students who would normally be outside groping under clothing or pledging fidelity over the long summer months stayed home and broke the spines of books a number of students were taking incompletes and returning home three weeks early a lot of town dogs were kept hungry cordes awkwardly phrased press statement meant to reassure the people of new lebanon in short had no effect on the hysteria bob siebert came home late to his trailer on route he opened the door and in the dark kitchen found himself staring at his fiveyearold son who was aiming sieberts ruger deer rifle more or less at his fathers heart standing silhouetted in the moonlight afraid to speak siebert froze it was only after the short click of the firing pin that he began to breathe again he lifted the gun away laughing madly and thanking the lord that his son had not known how to chamber a round his smile faded when he opened the rifles bolt and the misfired shell spiraled out sieberts legs went slack his pants went wet and he dropped sobbing to the floor the boy said i thought you was the moon man daddy and on tuesday one day before the full moon the first graffiti went up no one saw whod done it and in fact hardly anyone recognized the drawings at first clara and harry botwell were returning home in their buick electra from the shrimp n salad night at the wrangler clara driving being the less impaired harry pointed to the wall of the first bank of new lebanon and said look somebody had painted a big gumdrop on the side of the bank and clara studied the wall and asked why was it on its side and anyway why would anybody paint a gumdrop sweet mary she said thats no gumdrop its a halfmoon in panic she gunned the big engine and shot through a red light broadsiding a celica the couple escaped unhurt though the driver of the toyota went to memorial with a broken arm the bank wasnt the only site of a halfmoon three hundred citizens punched in that night most of them for the first time in their lives to report a half dozen of the graffiti moons the callers were all pretty shaken up the paint the artist had used was blood this evening randolph sayles professor and dean student of union economics and apologist for the noble confederate states of america sat in his backyard smoking a cigarette and staring at the evening sky bright with moonlight he held a drooping fax in his hand sayles tapped an ash to the ground in front of him and looked at it beside his muddy boots a tree root had grown out of the earth and then only a few inches away had returned underground as if even this short excursion into the world was intolerable he heard footsteps he recognized them joan sayles was an angular woman with shortcropped blond hair and abrupt hips and long breasts tonight she wore a white blouse tied in the front la lana turner and skimpy baggy shorts she sat beside her husband dimpled bands of white flesh hung from her upper legs a full professor of sociology at auden she was one year older than sayles and had an iq two points higher than his though they both fell in the ninetyninth percentile when they met their last year of undergraduate school on this same campus one of them had been a virgin and it hadnt been joan even as a grad assistant she had professorial drive and an instinctive grasp of institutional politics he appreciated these talents in her although he realized too late that she used these to pursue not only tenure but sayles himself she was successful on both fronts they were married the day after he sat for his doctoral orals and if hed never felt a moment of resounding passion for her nothing close in fact to what he felt when he stood at the lectern that was all right he loved her he believed anyway he needed a wife he was pretty sure stability and a brainy spouse being doric columns of midwest university success what are you doing out here she asked squinting in the violet moonlight the gesture pulled the corners of her mouth up in a wet grotesque smile that randy sayles did not want to look at she noticed a small muddy shovel next to him and her eyes dipped to his boots moonlight gardening he imagined that her question which sounded simply curious was in fact laced with mockery he thought what does she know taking in the air he answered you had a meeting tonight completed she was holding a batch of white stapled papers rubberbanded together she had made many notes and marks on the first page of the top paper he noticed cc she was a bitch of a grader what are you doing she repeated when he did not respond she asked are you ignoring me for a reason he apologized with a sincerity that surprised them both then handed her the fax the state had rejected audens application for an emergency loan ah she handed it back and lit a cigarette it hung from the side of her lips and this made her mouth even sloppier and more lopsided joan inhaled then lifted a long finger to her tongue and touched away a fleck of something im sorry sayles squeezed her knee in response she said do you know what one of my students wrote the issue was whether a population center like new lebanon had an inner city he wrote that it didnt rather he said it had a wrong side of the tracks i gave him an a minus solely for that sayles said clever you know if i had it to do all over again id pick something frivolous romance languages or art appreciation no i know russian literature she touched the side of her tongue again probing as if she wanted to make sure it wasnt numb he said the police want to see me about that girl in your class the one who was killed sayles nodded you were sleeping with her this was not truly a question so she does know his silence was an answer she could read did you enjoy it she asked on occasion they dont think you had anything to do with it do they of course not how does she know joan finished her cigarette and dropped it on the ground she did not step on it after a moment she shuffled the papers in her hand and said you know im astonished at how college sophomores cannot put sentences together and walked back to the house along a narrow patch stained red and purple by droppings from a row of mulberry trees where tt ebbans wanted to be standing in the exact position of the man he was talking to the man leaning on the bent branch beside the muddy des plaines and connected to a hook sunk in murky water by twenty feet of fishing line via a sears rod and reel the man in the red hat thosere some flies ebbans said nodding at the hat yessir ebbans leaned over and looked into the rubbermaid bucket where three pale catfish floated motionless a fly fisherman doesnt get bored feeding stinkballs to suckers i dont fly sonly the hat was a present from my wife a moment later he added i got a license only i left her at home uhhuh ebbans said you by any chance fishing on tuesday evening down at blackfoot pond this is my evening hows that ebbans asked i work owl at the container plant get off at seven in the am go to bed eat fish go to work thats my life your evenings my day some fella there saw someone fits your description he grunted ebbans said we had a girl killed over there on tuesday that was there shitabrick i didnt know yeah i was there on tuesday when did you leave mustve been ninethirty or ten got off to a late start because of the storm you see anybody else when i was leaving i seen two kids come up they had tackle but they werent fishing i figured they maybe had a delco or a handcrank and were just going to jolt up some worms they were kids looked to be teenagers you know them didnt see em up close they were down at the foot of the dam walking up to the pond one of them was fat so they were going slow the fat one was wearing something dark the other one was thin and was wearing a jacket mayve been gray how old high school i dunno both white ebbans asked what else round here id like to have a talk with those boys or one of them you see them id appreciate your letting us know you bet you do that ill forget to tell fish and game about the license you left at home ive been meaning to get me one he said you know how it is one thing after another the first methodist church of new lebanon announced today that sunday school classes will be canceled until further notice following the vandalism of the school by the man authorities are calling the moon killer authorities are calling a painting of a halfmoon in blood was found on the door of the firstfloor girls room in the sunday school building located at maple street adjacent to the church the blood matched that from a goat whose carcass was found several days ago in the new lebanon grade school how do they know that i didnt know that attendance at the towns schools has fallen dramatically since the moon killer began stalking the streets of new lebanon stalking the streets tonight will be the first full moon since the murder of the auden coed jennie her name is jennie gebben and residents are urged to stay home from sunset to sunrise bill corde sitting in room of the auden student union stared at that mornings register for five minutes before pitching it out he opened an envelope he had picked up at the office on the way over here it contained a report from the county lab about the match between the carcass blood and the graffiti blood how did they know i didnt a man appeared in the doorway corde looked up at him excuse me im professor sayles you wanted to see me come on in sit down corde shoved aside the lab report and motioned with his palm toward the chair across from his miniature desk sayles sat folding his long legs slowly he scooted the seat back this has to do with the jennifer gebben murder corde asked she was in your class yes she was sayles looked at his watch a wrinkled frayed shirt cuff appeared outside his blue blazer and stayed there and she worked parttime for me in the financial aid department did you know her well i try to know all my students but you knew her better than the others corde said the class she was in is large the civil war centennial course is very popular i try to know as many students as i can i think its important any personal attention in class can be very inspiring dont you remember corde who had spent most of his school years trying to avoid the attention of teachers said why was she working for you i assume she didnt need the money why do you assume that sayles asked dourly she wasnt in the workstudy program and didnt have any student loans or scholarships seems she wouldve followed those routes before shed get a parttime job paying fiveten an hour theres something altruistic about disbursing money to needy students jennie helped organize last years aids walkathon and she was also a meals on wheels volunteer for a month or two corde said for a month or two but how did she come to work for you we got to talking about how curious it was that i a history professor ended up in charge of financial aid and she asked if she could assist me what were the circumstances of this conversation officer sayles was riled i hardly recall was there anybody in class she was particularly friendly with i never paid any attention did you ever see her with anyone who wasnt a student sayles shrugged no how often did you work together several times a week you see her socially no not socially wed have dinner after work sometimes often with other people that was all you dont consider that social no i dont corde watched the mans dark eyes which in turn studied three dirty fingernails on his right hand professor were you asked by loyola college to stop teaching there sayles started to reach for his redandblue striped tie he stopped and tilted his head slightly adjusting the needle valve on his indignation i was yes that was because youd been involved with a student involved with yes and you assaulted her i did not we had an affair i broke it off she wasnt happy about that and called the police to report that id assaulted her it was a lie were you having an affair with jennie gebben no and i believe i resent your asking me that i have my job to do corde said wearily and if you think anyone from the university had something to do with her death sayless voice grew harsh youre badly mistaken there are enough unfounded rumors about the murder already its hard enough running a school and raising money for it without spooking parents and benefactors read the paper your department said it was a demonic killing we have to look at all possibilities the watch was again gravely consulted i have a class in five minutes where were you on the night she was killed professor he laughed are you serious corde lifted an eyebrow and sayles said i was home is there anyone who can verify that corde glanced at the narrow gold ring your wife maybe his voice grew soft in anger i was by myself my wife was doing research at the library until midnight i understand that brian okun was seeing jennie seeing her id say he was seeing her he was sleeping with her in his chinese handwriting corde made a small notation on a threebyfive card could you tell me who you heard that from i cant recall whats your opinion of him of brian you cant suspect brian of hurting jennie your opinion hes brilliant he needs to temper his intelligence somewhat hes a little arrogant for his own good but hed never hurt jennie sayles watched corde slowly write may i go now corde completed the card and looked up i look i cant help you i have nothing more to say sayles stood and his grim surliness was at a high pitch now this anger seemed out of proportion to the circumstances of the questioning at first this reinforced cordes suspicion of the man but one look into sayless face told another story the source of the professors indignation was contempt contempt at himself for loving jennie gebben whatever her talents in bed which corde guessed were pretty damn plentiful if both sayles and okun had risked their jobs to have her jennie was still nothing more than an average student a suburban girl fat at the throat the daughter of a smallbusiness man a meals on wheels volunteer a very ordinary young woman and here was randolph sayles phd just blistered with humiliation for the love hed spent on this common girl so corde released him and like a squirming cat escaping at last from his masters arms the professor stalked out of room neither dallying nor fast absorbed with forgetting the prior moments of troubling captivity returning to the office corde found on slocums desk the stack of fliers from fastcopy which were supposed to be tacked up thick as litter along route slocum was out he learned looking into reports of missing goats the difficult night at home had now caught up with him the second photo his guilt at missing another of jamies wrestling matches tonight a tempestuous dream that woke him at one unable to sleep he had sat for two hours in the back bathroom with the shotgun on his lap scanning the forest for any sign of the intruder once he was sure hed seen a facelooking at the house and had gone so far as to chamber a shell and walk outside hands shaking in anticipation as much as from the predawn chill but as he stood shoeless on the slab back porch the image became a moonlit tangle of trees and leaves hed turned to walk back into the house and sarah had scared the utter hell out of him bounding forward from the stairs they stared at each other corde shocked the girl more disappointed than anything she was headed for the back door and hed thought for an instant that she was sleepwalking but no she was only after a glass of water whats wrong with your bathroom corde asked as his hearts gallop slowed she had drunk the water staring out the window until he impatiently shooed her off to bed he did not get to sleep till five then thered been a fight at breakfast sarah had shrilly refused her mothers demand that she study before going to school corde had had to both comfort his wife and calm his daughter he tried not to take sides and they both ended up mad at him now in his office the door closed corde sat at his desk for ten minutes arranging and rearranging the tall stacks of his threebyfive cards fat and limber from all the shuffling he spread them out until they covered his desk a dull bicentennial quarter appears in his hand and begins flopping over the backs of his fingers he stares at the cards and after a few minutes bill corde is no longer in the sheriffs department but is on the auden university campus and the day isnt today but is tuesday april it is fourthirty pm corde pictures jennie gebben leaving professor sayless lecture hall and walking to the university bookstore three blocks away to cash a check for thirtyfive dollars her picture is taken by the cashiers security camera and the film shows her wearing a white blouse with a buttondown collar her dark hair is straight a thick strand sloping over her forehead the shutter catches her with eyelids half closed the time on the film is jennie continues to the dorm and arrives there at about five she and emily rossiter remain in their room with the door closed for about an hour the girls on the floor can detect the roommates having what seems to be an argument though no one hears enough to know the substance of their discussion lance millers report on the phones shows that during the hours jennie was at the dorm today there have been no outgoing longdistance calls and most local calls are to innocent recipients the only local call whose recipient cant be ascertained is to the auden school of arts and sciences which of the sixtyfour extensions the call is transferred to cannot be determined both randy sayless and brian okuns numbers are among those sixtyfour as is emilys she works as an assistant in the sociology department at about sixfifteen jennie takes a shower and with hair still damp walks with three other girls to the cafeteria they have asked emily to join them but she moodily declines the four eat dinner and talk jennie eats quickly and leaves early she too is moody her dinner companions return to the dorm at seventhirty and watch a tv game show for a half hour jennie enters the lounge and watches tv for a few minutes then looks at her watch she seems distracted edgy at about eightfifteen she leaves the lounge and tells one of the girls that shell be back by midnight the next time jennie gebben is accounted for it is tenfiftyeight she has been raped and strangled to death and her body is lying in a bed of blue hyacinths at the muddy base of blackfoot pond dam at the site of her death nineteen shoe and boot prints around the body most of them mens or teenage boys sizes the ford pickup covered with partial and full fingerprints scraps of standard virtually untraceable typing paper cellophane wrappers from several snack foods sold by wise and fritolay and nabisco cigarette butts beer and soda bottles and cans a condom the semen in which doesnt match that found in the victim and the knife whose source even the fbi has not been able to identify despite the assistance of the seoul prefecture of police and faxed inquiries to twelve professors of religion criminology and parapsychology around the country none of the fingerprints found at the crime scene matches those on file in harrison county the prints are now in higgins and in washington dc for similar crosschecking in state and federal files fingerprinting the dorm room netted partial and whole prints sixtytwo of which belonged to jennie and other students on the floor the others are as yet unmatched after reporting the theft of jennies letters emily rossiter has turned uncooperative she still has not appeared at room and she has not returned his calls corde has looked carefully through the file on the biagotti case the case that introduced him to jennie gebben on january of the previous year susan biagotti was in her offcampus apartment when she was beaten to death with a hammer during a robbery as corde told ribbon jennie could offer no insights into the crime the girls did know each other but only casually susan lived two buildings away from brian okuns apartment but corde can find no other connection between the two of them the phase of the moon on january was three days after new the burnt scraps found in the oil drum behind jennies dorm include three types of paper hammermill longgrain recycled white typing paper cranes laid stationery tinted violet and sprocketed greenandwhitestriped computer paper whose manufacturer has not been determined ninhydrin analysis has revealed two partial fingerprints on the cranes stationery and one complete print on the computer printout all three are jennies the county lab reports that the amount of ash in the drum would be equal to about fifty to seventyfive sheets of eightandahalfbyeleveninch paper the ash was so badly destroyed that no latent watermarks writing or fingerprints are detectable the printing on the computer paper is of dollar amounts ranging from to the printer was a ninepin dot matrix the extreme faintness of the type suggests it was printed in the machines highspeed mode or that the ribbon was old both county and state bureau of investigation technicians report that the papers and ink are too common to provide further leads unless matching samples are recovered jennie died of traumatic asphyxia the killer strangled her with his hands then used a rope or cord to make sure she was dead the speed with which she died makes an erotic asphyxia interlude unlikely she did not die standing up the backs of her shoes kicked deep impressions into the mud before they flew off and the soles of her feet were clean the semen in and on her body is from a single individual and was serumtyped b positive there is evidence of both vaginal and anal intercourse no one has found the murder rope though a technician noticed a fresh cut on a short piece of plasticcoated clothesline dangling from a tiedown cleat in the abandoned truck the medical examiner said the injury to her neck was consistent with that type of rope the cult knife contains no particle residue from the cord but that is not conclusive moreover the blade of the knife is razor sharp and the county forensic lab reports that the clothesline on the ford was cut with a sharp instrument a particle of cotton fiber matching jennies panties was found on the stiletto of jennie gebben corde knows this she dated frequently though these were not typical burgerkingandamovie events she simply vanished in the evenings sometimes for the entire weekend she rarely talked about her companions on these outings though what she did share caused considerable stir sex was jennies favorite topic not boys or dates or engagement rings sex jennie had been found masturbating in the dorm bathroom a number of times and she didnt mind being watched she got pleasure from blunt talk one time jennie and i were in the study room okay and its all quiet and she like looks up and goes you ever take it up the ass and im like oh my god did you really say that her reluctance to discuss her lovers fueled the rumors that she slept with professors last year she supposedly went out with one professor for much of the spring term they kept it intensely secret though it was believed that he was in the education school and that they had contemplated marriage a number of girls call jennies sexual behavior disgraceful but when they do the disdain is transparent and there is envy beneath many students say that they considered her a searcher unsettled unhappy several give similar versions of the same incident late one night jennie was in the stairwell of the dorm by herself she was crying and the echoes of her voice on the concrete walls made a terrible mournful moan im so lonely one student believes she was saying another on the floor below heard if only i had him she was not religious and had never attended a church in new lebanon she had some tapes by new age musicians and several crystal necklaces but little interest in spiritualism or the occult students have given conflicting reports about her relationship with her parents jennie was cool toward her mother her connection with her father on the other hand was turbulent on the phone she sometimes told him in oddly passionate terms that she missed and loved him other times she slammed the phone down and announced about him what a prick bill corde drops his quarter on the table and scoops up his index cards considering all these facts and he tries to picture the killer but he sees woefully little far far less than the profile in the register which infuriated him partly because he doubted he himself could ever create such a vivid image of a criminal cordes own profiling technique that of the national center for the analysis of violent crime is charted on the yellowed sheet of paper pinned on the corkboard behind his desk it is a lengthy process of inputting voluminous facts arranging them into models assessing the crime and finally creating then finetuning the criminal profile he knows that the ncavc procedure includes an optimistic sixth and final step apprehension of the killer a stage that seems despairingly unattainable at this moment eight long days after jennie gebbens demure body was found in a bed of muddied hyacinths beside that gloomy still pond corde knows many details about jennie gebben he knows that brian okun has lied to him and that professor sayles might have he knows that two boys were near the dam shortly before her death and one of them may have had a knife the trail is cooling and there is so much more to learn more interviews more facts to unearth though he secretly wonders is he merely stalling hoping for a picture of the killer to flutter down from heaven a picture as clear as the portrait of jennie taped inside his briefcase bill corde riffles the index cards he believes much and he knows little a mass of information is in his hands but the truth is somewhere between the facts themselves in the gaps of his knowledge like the shadows between the flipping cardboard for now corde sees only darkness as dense as the water in blackfoot pond he sees no deeper than the reflection of double moons in the facets of a dead girl s necklace corde hopes for startling illumination and yet he fears it will be a long long time coming her trouble came with the first asymmetrical block resa parker flipped through the green booklet its cover printed with the large black letters vmi developmental test of visualmotor integration and noted the exact point where sarah cordes abilities failed her trying to copy a line drawing of an uneven rectangle setting this aside the psychiatrist reviewed the wechsler intelligence scale for children revised examining the snaky plot of the verbal and performance tests in the wiscr profile blocks the revised gray oral reading test which was strictly timed showed sarah a fourth grader reading at a firstgrade level without the stress of a clock she was slightly better the scores were worse than the doctor had expected sarah now sat in front of her struggling through the last of the diagnostic tests the informal test of written language expression dr parker saw the anxious behavior the darting eyes the quivering knees the frosting of sweat the psychiatrist who had at one time been in daily analysis for six years continually confronted her own anger and insecurity and the coldness with which they were manifest she struggled to instill serenity in the child take your time sarah big smile theres no rush she noted the process of internalizing sarah didnt sound out unknown or difficult words she stared at them without lip movement until she applied whatever phonetic skills she could muster and then wrote the words slowly in crude letters sarah leaned forward an intense frown on her brow as she tried to conjure up the words in her eyes the agony of repeatedly slamming into her limitations was clear children of policemen have a higher incidence of learning disabilities than those of other parents and dr parker noticed in herself a kernel of resentment toward bill corde it was a rancor that she would never reveal but that he would have to go a long way in rebutting diane corde refined much of what she said through a very complex series of filters and dr parker wondered just how much the man actually helped his daughter in contrast to how much diane believed or wished he did the doctor also knew something else how little the girl would ultimately improve and the immense effort and expense even that limited progress would require im afraid your times up dr parker said and took the notebook from the girl who was sweating and nearly breathless she examined the girls sad attempt to write a story about a simple illustration in the test booklet a boy with a baseball sarah had started his naem was freddie and he watnted to play bsebale baseball only the handwriting was abysmal the story continued for a half page an average child could easily fill three of four pages in that time all right sarah very good thats the last of our tests sarah looked mournfully as the written language test was slipped into the file did i pass you dont pass these tests theyre just to tell me about you so i can help you do better in school i dont want to go back to school i understand sarah but its not a good idea for you to stay back another year you dont want all your classmates to advance a grade while youre left behind do you yes sarah answered without hesitation id like that dr parker laughed well how about if i call mrs beiderson and have her agree that you can take your tests out loud would that be all right so i wouldnt have to write out the answers right would she do that im sure she would the call had already been made what about the spelling test im ascared of spelling the voice grew meek manipulatively meek the doctor noted sarah had tried this technique before with success id like you to take it would you do it for me ill be up in front of everybody theyll laugh at me no you can do it by yourself you and mrs beiderson thats all the childs instinctive sense of negotiation caught on that this was the best she could do she looked at dr parker and nodded uneasily i guess good now can i finish the story at home the story freddie and the baseball she nodded at the booklet im sorry sarah thats all we had time for the girls face twisted with enormous disappointment but i didnt get to write down the neat part no dr parker asked whats the neat part sarah looked up at the same diplomas the doctor had watched diane corde scrutinize so desperately the previous week the girl turned back looked into the doctors eyes and said what happens is freddie hits the baseball into the street and it goes rolling down the sidewalk and into a drugstore and theres mr pillsit sarahs eyes widened and he used to play for the chicago eagles that was a ball team that had real eagles that would swoop down and grab the baseball and sail out over the grandstand and they won every game there was and mr pillsit says to freddie dr parker held up her hand sarah did you read this story someplace she shook her head no i just made it up like i was supposed to i thought i was supposed to im sorry the eyes lowered theatrically did i do something wrong no not at all keep going and mr pillsit he says to freddie if you really want to play baseball i can make you the best player that ever was only you have to go find the tallest tree in the eagles forest and climb up to the top are you brave enough to do that freddie was of course up to the job and sarah enthusiastically continued with his adventures not noticing the psychiatrists braceletted hand reach forward and nonchalantly lift her gold pen recording in rapid oblique symbols of speed writing freddies quest for the magic baseball fighting hugo the claw the worst eagle that ever was building a new clubhouse for the team after their original one burned down running away from home and living in a big nest with a family of beautiful golden eagles freddie never returned home though he did become a famous baseball player by the time sarah finished dr parker had filled ten pages of steno paper that is a very interesting story sarah no sarah said sounding like a tv film reviewer but the picture was of freddie and a baseball so i couldnt think of anything else the doctor flipped through her notebook slowly then said all right ive got to look over all the work youve done for me and youve got to go study for your tests i want my daddy to help me after a moment the doctor looked up im sorry sarah what did you say i want daddy to help me study is that okay thatll be fine resa parker spoke absently her mind was wholly occupied by a boy and a baseball and a talking eagle this is my federal firearm permit and this is my missouri private investigators license sheriff steve ribbon studied the squares of laminated plastic in the mans wallet hed never seen a federal firearm permit or a missouri private eyes license he said looks in order charlie mahoney put the wallet back in his pocket he wore a businessmans suit in a fine faint plaid that looked gray but up close was tiny lines of pink and blue ribbon liked that suit a whole lot ribbon nodded him toward a chair observing that the man had two types of selfassurance the institutional authority of a longtime cop and the still confidence of a man who has killed another man mahoney tossed an expensive heavy tan raincoat onto an empty chair and sat down across the desk from ribbon he talked without condescension or interest about the beautiful spring weather about the difficulty of getting to new lebanon by air about the ruralness of the town he then fell silent and looked behind ribbon studying a huge topographical map of the county during this moment ribbon grew extremely uncomfortable he said now what exactly can i do for you im here as a consultant consultant im representing the estate of jennie gebben i was a homicide detective in chicago and i have a lot of investigatory experience and im offering my services to you free of charge the thing is ive apprehended or assisted in the apprehension of more than two hundred homicide suspects well what i was going to say was the thing is youre a you know civilian true mahoney conceded ill be frank i cant tell you how upset mr gebben is that this has happened this has nothing to do with your ability to collar the perpetrator sheriff sending me here was just something he felt he had to do jennie was his only child ribbon winced and felt genuine sorrow in his heart i appreciate what he must be going through ive got kids myself but you know how it is regulations you mustve had those in chicago sure plenty mahoney studied the great blossom of ribbons face and added some shitkick to his voice as he said cant hurt just to do a little talking that cant hurt nothing now can it no i suppose not youre in charge of the case well ultimately ribbon said but we got a senior detective here whos doing most of the legwork bill corde good man bill corde been doing this sort of thing for a few years yessir he has what approach is he taking well hes thinking that it was somebody who knew her most likely somebody at the school mahoney was nodding in a way that said to ribbon he was troubled playing the odds beg your pardon hes taking the cautious approach statistically most people are killed by somebody they know exactly but from what ive read about this case its a little stranger than most some twists and turns you know what im saying i hear you ribbons voice lowered ive got a load of trouble with whats happening here there are some you know cult overtones to the whole thing cult mahoney was nodding again this time agreeably like she was a sacrifice victim or whatever right those goats and that blood the moon and everything whoever picked up on that idea was doing some good law enforcement work ribbons caution was on the ebb but he said i still have some trouble with you getting involved mr mahoney i charlie mahoney chided charlie he lifted his thick hands with their yellowstained index fingers heavenward at least do yourself a favor and let me tell you about the reward reward mr gebben is a very wealthy man hes offering twentyfive thousand dollars for apprehension of the killer ribbon chewed on his cheek to keep the rampaging grin at bay well my thats generous of course you can imagine that rewards like that generate a mess of bounty hunting we got a lot of people in this county own guns and can carry them legally mahoney frowned as he corrected himself shouldve said the reward is for professionals only for law enforcers that way theres no risk of people who dont know what theyre doing getting hurt mr mahoney im a cop youre a cop charlie charlie it might not look good for well politically is what im saying to have an outsider here it might look like we dont know what were doing it might also look like you thought so highly of the community that you had the foresight to call in some special help mahoney took a leisurely moment to study his watch well there you have it now you can kick my ass out of here tomorrow if you want but im stuck in town for the night at least and dont know a soul how bout you and me get a drink and trade war stories theres not much else to do in this town is there ribbon almost made a comment about one pastime being raping coeds by moonlight but caught himself well there are he said but cept for fishing none of ems as fun as drinking she lifted the card off her desk with a trembling hand and stared at it the little white rectangle it was stiff and the corners were very sharp one pressed painfully into her nailchewed thumb which left a bloody smear on the card emily rossiter started to sit on the bed but then thought that they might have sat here theyd probably looked between the mattress and the springs theyd felt the pillow theyd run their hands along the same sheets where she and her lover had lain she dropped the card and saw as it flipped over and over the words please call me det william corde flash on and off then disappear as the card landed in the wastebasket she wondered if even the trash had been violated emily walked into the hall then into the telephone alcove she made a call and stiffened slightly when someone answered its emily i have to see you no now she listened for a moment to vehement protests then answered defiantly its about jennie the voice on the other end of the line went silent so i go like you are too much why dont you just sit on it and then donnas like he is too totally much its like you know like his eyes have this total hardon and i go philip halpern thought shut up in the room he and his sister shared there was one telephone his sister fourteen used it most of the time the cool breeze of an april evening flowed through the window rippling the green sheet that separated philips side from his sisters taped on the poorly painted walls were dozens of creased posters the sort that come stapled in the centerfold of teen magazines the wind momentarily lifted aside the kmart sheet studded with tiny red flowers and for a brief moment luke perry and madonna faced off against the road warrior and schwarzeneggers terminator in philips half of the stalescented space stacks of comic books science fiction novels drawing tablets plastic figures of comic book heroes and villains hundreds of magazines fangoria cinegore heavy metal many missing their covers unable to afford them philip regularly swiped the unsold stripped copies from trash bins behind new lebanon news on his dresser and desk rested elaborate plastic models of space ships perfectly assembled but coated with grime in the corner a hatrack project for shop class partially completed hid a massive dustball dominating the room was a huge handprinted sign in oddly elaborate script it read entry forbidden the message surrounded by dozens of letters from the runic alphabet and tiny sketches of gargoyles and dragons philip lay in his sagging bed on a mattress now dry but marred with a hundred old urine stains he had told his parents that he had to study for a test and went into the bedroom his father had seemed pleasantly surprised at this news then turned on wheel of fortune philip did not however study he read heinlein he read asimov he read philip k dick he believed at times he was possessed by dicks spirit he lay on the bed staring at flowers and mentally designing a laser until his sister came into the room and made the phone call to her girlfriend shut the fuck up their father opened the bedroom door abruptly and said off the phone lights out now his hand swept the light switch down the door closed naw my old man gotta go yeah tomorrow philip turned the laser onto the afterimage of his father to see if it would work it did spectacularly philip invented very efficient weapons his voice hissed as he fired it again rosy said asshole say that to him im talking to you she said he heard the zipper of her jeans he wondered what she was going to wear to bed philip said youre a ho she said you wish bitch fag the springs of her mattress squeaked as she flopped into bed philip lay unmoving for ten minutes until he heard her steady breathing fully dressed he sat up feeling the cool air from the open window wash over him he climbed through the window and as he fell to the spongy ground he slipped into the lost dimension it was phathar the warrior who staggered briefly then righted himself and strode confidently out of the moonlightflooded backyard professor randolph sayles wondered why there were no crickets or cicadas here he listened it was late april was it too early for them he didnt know entomology hed struggled through life sciences biology being the one course that had deprived him of a fourpoint grade average in undergraduate school twentysix years later he still resented this he stood in the veterans memorial park for ten minutes before she appeared he thought emily rossiter was one of the most beautiful young women hed ever seen she had curly brown hair surrounding a round face of italian or greek features very pale on her beauty alone he could have lived forever with her sufficiently happy sufficiently in love yet as she approached him now under a trestle of budding maples the defiantly glaring moonlight silver against the riffling underside of the young leaves what he saw shocked him she was like a homeless woman disheveled her face puffy her hair in tangles and unclean her mouth slack clothes dirty her eyes unfocused her weak smile mad yet despite her crazed demeanor despite his anger toward her despite his fear of her randy sayles wanted nothing so much as to make love to her here immediately on the grass on the dirt hot flesh on flesh in a sea of cool spring air he wanted to force her down and press on her harder harder he wanted to sample her vulnerability he wanted her salty unwashed flesh between his teeth he had once tried to seduce her an incident that ended unconsummated and dangerously close to rape she had finally repelled him with a slap drawing blood he had apologized and never approached her again curiously this scalding memory exponentially increased his hunger for her now he stood slouching hands pocketed as she stopped two feet away from him they stood under a streetlight that seemed duller and more eerie than the light from the full moon emily you know what happened to her dont you the words seemed to stumble from her mouth what is it you want to jennie you know what happened to her she began to walk suddenly as if she just remembered an appointment sayles followed slightly behind they moved this way together for five minutes then turned north along a path that led to a circle of brick surrounded by concrete benches and behind them a tall boxwood hedge they would have three of four minutes warning in case somebody walked toward them when speaking with female students sayles automatically considered escape routes where are you staying he asked in the room ah kiddo emily whispered to no one you should think about going home take incompletes ill arrange it if you like kiddo what were you trying to say on the phone you didnt sound very coherent i didnt know it would be this hard its so hard without her what do you want the moonlight shone on her cheeks in two streaks leading from her eyes to her mouth sayles stood with his hands still in his pockets emily with her arms crossed over breasts he had never seen she asked you saw her the night she died didnt you she spoke from some brink whose nature he couldnt fathom was it resolution or resignation sayles said no i dont believe you they were in the small park off the quad a place where lovers over the years had unzipped and unbuttoned all manners of fashions as they lay struggling on fragrant midwest grass tonight the park was or appeared to be deserted emily said you know what happened to her dont you after a moment sayles asked why are you asking me ah kiddo emily muttered ah kiddo kiddo kiddo sayles asked in a furious whisper what are you saying what do you know he was engulfed with emotion and couldnt will his strong hands to stop as they grabbed her shoulders she seemed to waken suddenly and stood back shaking her head crying youre hurting me hey anybody there a gruff voice called footsteps behind them someone walking in the woods nearby separated from view by the boxwood hedge emily broke away sayles started toward her she waved her hand wildly as if brushing away a riled bee tell me sayles whispered viciously emily walked quickly down the path he started after her but the intruder a security guard shone his light in their direction they both dodged it emily ran sayles whispered wait then he stepped through the bushes out of sight of the guard he hurried through the darkness in the direction he believed she had gone phathar jogged slowly down the path gasping for breath it reminded him of dreaded pe class tomorrow the students were going to run the the purest form of honon torture for him he pictured himself plodding along fat bouncing as the others whod all finished hooted and laughed way to go phil hustle phil hustle his bowel churned he came out of the woods and walked for fifty feet before he smelled the water and the mud he found himself at the foot of blackfoot pond dam phathar felt a stirring in his groin and he painfully admitted to himself that despite the horror of last tuesday night phathar wished in his dimensional soul he could relive the half hour he had spent here lights the sound of a speeding car he crouched and ran to a low hemlock the lights swept over his head like searchlights in a prison camp and the car disappeared with a hiss of tires loud in the damp air phathar walked into the dish of mud and began his search for the knife that he had discovered to his horror had been lost that night he was stung by this carelessness not worthy of phathar at all but typical of a fat clumsy high school freshman back and forth using a small penlight hed wrapped with black construction paper to mask the light he searched phathar slowly grew serene smelling the mud and water hearing the groan of bullfrogs reminded him of biology class his best course he remembered the time he had helped the teacher collect frogs from the banks of the des plaines one night and the man had thanked philip in front of the class the next day philips face had burned with rare pride at the compliment he had felt bold enough to volunteer to pith frogs for anyone who didnt want to he jabbed a probe into the heads of a dozen frogs that day one girl thanked him and said he was brave philip had stared at her dumbstruck after a half hour of futilely scanning the muck for the knife he gave up he couldnt stay any longer his father might make an unexpected raid on the bedroom he started for the path then footsteps the boy froze sweat bursting on his forehead his neck bristling with panic he retreated to the hemlock the steps grew closer and he cowered beneath the muffling boughs he leaned out and looked a girl philip calmed immediately and a thrill rippled through his plentiful body another college girl it seemed about the same age as the first one only prettier not so horsey he felt the stirring in his groin again almost a burning vibration she was alone he wondered what her tits looked like hidden under the thick sweater her skirt was loose and flowing philip felt a painful erection the girl walked right past the hemlock she stood in the center of the clearing pacing back and forth she stared at the ground until she came to a bed of blue flowers she dropped to her knees smearing her skirt with mud she leaned forward he couldnt see what she was doing he heard her muttering to herself emily a mans breathless voice called from the road philips erection vanished and he crouched beneath the tree the girl dropped lower and melted into the flowers ten yards away the man jogged along route he stopped and looked out over the pond the moonlight was in his eyes and philip could see him squinting he was looking right at where the girl was hiding but didnt see her he called once more then started back along the road soon he was gone the girl sat up philip heard a rustle of the leaves as she stood he heard an owl close by philip pulled a branch down to see her better he wondered what her ass was like he wondered if her breasts smelled the way the other girls had like pumpkin pie spices he wondered if she had blond hair or brown between her legs the erection returned and pressed roughly against his taut jeans slowly the beautiful girl stood and walked along the path philip saw shed forgotten her purse he let go of the branch it snapped up and cut off his view of her he stepped away from the tree and walked into the clearing where he picked up the purse and without opening it lifted it to his face he smelled the scent of lemon perfume and leather and makeup he slipped it inside his shirt and followed her the full moon is high above new lebanon most of the men are nearly invisible in their camouflaged hunting gear though you can see occasional glints off class rings and glossy blueblack barrels and receivers they hide behind stands of bushes dodging pricklers and feeling colder than they think they ought to it being nearly may they walk in clusters of two or three along trimmed streets they cruise in cars some veterans have blackened their cheekbones and are consumed by a lust they have not felt for twentyfive years a number of men pad through fields where they figure theres not much chance of finding any killers but where if they do the spotlight of a moon will illuminate their target their guns are loaded with rock salt or buckshot or deer slugs and some of the hunters have tapped the bullets and filled the holes with mercury then waxed them over again to make sure that even if they just wing the killer hes not getting up ever ever again some go out with beer and fried chicken and make a campfire hoping their presence alone will deter the man some take the job of guardian more seriously and believe that the entire future of a wholesome new lebanon depends on their vigilance and their aim jim slocum and lance miller stripped of their indicia of police authority are out with one such group there are no gunshots until eight pm almost exactly as bill corde turns onto route heading home the first shooting is not surprisingly one of the hunters putting a load of buckshot into another one fortunately the shooter had his choke wide and the victim got stung by only five or six pellets the second victim is a cat and the third is a movie poster of tom cruise which may or may not have been an accident it isnt until nearly nine that waylon sinks juggling a thirtytwoounce bottle of budweiser and a browning gauge forgets to put the safety on as he goes over a fence and kills himself unpleasantly the new lebanon sheriffs department as well as the county sheriffs dispatcher and for most of harrison county have been taking dozens of calls mostly they are sightings of the moon killer who is sometimes spotted carrying a long knife sometimes a rope usually hes standing in backyards and looking in windows though sometimes he is climbing walls or scampering over roofs there isnt much the deputies can do officers make their rounds and under their spotlights the offending shadows vanish completely the moonlight beats down on the town of new lebanon it beats down so hard you can nearly hear a buzz like a highwatt bulb or like the humming of blood in your ears when you hold your breath in fear the moonlight beats down and throughout the town you can see uneasy faces in windows and you can hear dogs howling though what they bay at isnt the white eye of the moon but the incessant forms of the prowling vigilantes bleached yet black in the eerie wash of illumination corde arrived home at eightthirty he sent tom the deputy back to his uneasy wife and children diane and jamie were at a wrestling match at the high school where corde himself oh so wanted to be he walked into the house half wondering if he should have tipped tom something the cheerful young man had been more a babysitter than a guard these past few days corde pulled off his muddy shoes and hugged sarah he washed his hands and face in the kitchen sink then poured a diet coke for her and a seltzer for himself only the warner brothers glasses were clean and he kept the road runner glass for himself he handed sarah porky pig they got to work she was particularly edgy tonight the study session went badly from the start she panicked often and began talking nonsense joking and giddy this put corde in a bad mood because diane had told him that mrs beiderson was making special arrangements for sarahs tests and he thought the silliness measured up to ingratitude they were in the livingroom on the couch surrounded by a mass of papers sarah looked so small and overwhelmed by the mess that corde picked up the papers and organized them into a single stack they were sarahs attempts at the practice spelling test so far twelve tries her best score had been twentytwo out of fifty thirtythree was passing corde had that day written a check to dr parker for which was exactly twice what it cost him to insulate the entire attic lets try again he said daddy i dont want to take the test please i dont feel good honey weve got to work on a few more words were only up to the ms im tired tired was the one thing his soupedup little daughter was not at battle stations again they sat with the spelling list between them okay the m words he joked the m for mouthful words i dont want to take the damn test sarah said sullenly dont cuss its a shitty test i dont want young lady dont you use that word again to take it i hate dr parker just the m words im tired she whined sarah spell marble eyes squinting lip between teeth back erect she said marble very good honey wonderful corde was impressed marble went on the plus side joined by make mark miss and milk sarah wasnt as lucky with middle missile makeshift messenger melon and mixer dr parker hadnt suggested it but corde took to drawing pictures of the objects next to the words this seemed clever but didnt help sarahs mood was getting progressively worse her leg bounced her tiny fingers wound together frantically now spell mother sarah started to cry corde was sweating hed been through this so many times and her defeats were always his he wanted to shake her he wanted to grab her by the shoulders and point her at jamie and say youve got the same blood theres no difference between you cant you understand that just work hard work hard why wont you do that he wanted to call up the psychiatrist and tell her to get her fashionplate ass over here this minute in a tired voice youre doing fine a lot better than when we started tonight no im not she said she stood up sit down young lady youve done the word before try it again mother mo corde heard her hyperventilating and thought momentarily of dianes long labor when the girl was born breathe breathe breathe its er no wait mot i got lost wait wait corde set the piece of paper on the table with the other failed tests and picked up a blank sheet he began to write moth no she screamed corde blinked at the volume of the wail and the terror it contained sarah i dont know it i dont know it she was howling corde standing up sending a chair flying believed she was having a seizure sarah he shouted again his neck bristled in panic corde took her by the shoulders sarah stop it she screamed again and tipped into hysteria he shook her hard her hair flying around her head like golden smoke the glass tumbled over a flood of brown soda poured onto the carpeting she broke away from him and raced up the stairs to her room sheetrock throughout the house shook as her door slammed corde hands shaking was mopping up the spilled soda with wads of napkins when the doorbell rang oh lord now what steve ribbon leaned on the doorpost looking out over the lawn talk to you for a minute bill corde looked toward sarahs bedroom then back to ribbon come on in ribbon didnt move your family home just sarah jamie and diane are at a meet should be home anytime the sheriff didnt speak for a minute why dont you step outside here corde shook his head i dont want to go too far sarahs not feeling well he stepped onto the porch ribbon closed the door behind him corde flicked spilled soda off his fingers the sheriffs squad car was parked in the driveway jim slocum was driving in the back was a blond man heavy craggyfaced eyes fixed on the headrest in front of him ribbons eyes scanned the moonlit ground studying the perfectly trimmed grass he said bill ive got to talk to you they found jennies roommate emily rossiter corde crossed his arms they found not we found corde understood the difference it was his turn to stare at the neatly edged front lawn from where he stood it was in some geometric shape whose name he couldnt recall a rectangle pushed to one side somebody hit her over the head then threw her in blackfoot pond right by the dam she drowned and theres some pretty unpleasant stuff he did to her ribbon paused theres a tentative match between shoeprints nearby her and those found by the dam the night jennie gebben was killed i know your opinion bill but it looks like there probably was a cult killer all along book the medical examiner was in a prickly mood for the second time in two weeks he stood in mud at night beside this dark pond his usual demeanor that of a cheerful tv doctor was absent streaks on her face hair muddy and plastered around her head the way a bald man hides scalp stillbeautiful emily rossiter lay on a blanket faceup a black hideous wound marred her temple a large fishhook was embedded deep in her groin in the center of a slick patch of dark pubic hair the hook was attached to a long piece of twentypound test line which had pulled her skirt up between her legs a crowd of locals and reporters stood on the fringe of the crime scene a sloping grassy backyard that bordered blackfoot pond the me a thin man of fifty said to tt ebbans blow to the right temple with a rough irregular object death by drowning rape not this time what about the hook ebbans asked after she was dead dollars to doughnuts jim slocum said to ebbans there youve got your postmortem piercing thats common in sacrificial murders ebbans pushed past the reporters telling them that sheriff ribbon would be holding a press conference in ten minutes he joined bill corde up by the road detective corde addie kraskow waved frantically her laminated register press pass bouncing on her chest you didnt think a serial killer was involved you feel differently now corde ignored her and ebbans repeated ten minutes press conference addie didnt pursue the question anyway she noticed a photo opportunity and sent her photographer to shoot the body being zippered up and carried toward the ambulance that stood in the driveway of a house next to a childs pinkandwhite tricycle the cameramen were scrambling like panicked roaches to get the tricycle and the body bag in the same shot the county rescue squad scuba divers arrived and suited up one of them looked at the pond and muttered whores pussy corde sternly told the man to act professionally on the periphery of the action wynton kresge leaned against an old beige dodge aspen crowned by a blue revolving light on the door was the auden university seal printed with the school name and the words veritas et integritas ebbans nodded in his direction corde and kresge ignored each other i step into a mantrap on this one or what corde asked ebbans you play it like you see it bill thats all you can ever do crime scene have a chance before everybody started padding around it was virgin we didnt find much other than the boot prints but it was a virgin corde glanced at the cluster of policemen beside the pond one was the blond man he had seen in the back of ribbons car ebbans followed his eyes charlie mahoney whats he doing here representative of the family uhn what family works for jennies father and dont ask me well lets see what weve got corde started down to the water wait up a minute bill he stopped ebbans stepped beside him and when he spoke his voice was a whisper corde lowered his ear toward the man i just wanted you to know ebbans began then hesitated well its bullshit is what it is corde was astonished he had never known ebbans to cuss what tt their eyes were on an indentation in the grass a wheel tread left by the gurney that had carried emilys body to the ambulance was there any connection between you and jennie corde looked up and kept his eye on the mesmerizing lights atop the ambulance go on what are you saying theres some talk at county just talk that you burnt those letters because you were you know i was what seeing her is what somebody said and because of that maybe you wanted to deepsix the evidence i dont believe i didnt do that tt i know that im just telling you what i heard its just a rumor but its one of those rumors that wont go away corde had been in town government long enough to know there are two reasons rumors dont go away either because somebody doesnt want them to go away or because theyre true whos behind it corde asked dont know hammerback seems to be on your side but with the election hes paying out his support real slow and if you turn out to be a liability hell burn you in a second who else it could be i just dont know at cordes feet drops of dew caught the flashing lights and flickered like a hundred miniature christmas bulbs predate your telling me tt ebbans walked to the ambulance and corde headed down to the pond whose turgid surface was filled with bubbles from the divers as they searched for clues to the death of this beautiful young woman whose story and whose secrets were now lost forever and would never be transcribed on one of bill cordes neatly ordered index cards he stood for a long time with his feet apart in a patch of firm mud looking over the water and found himself thinking not at all of fingerprints or weapons or footprints or fiber traces but meditating on the lives of the two girls murdered in this dismal place and wondering what the lesson of those deaths would ultimately be shes calm now diane corde was speaking to dr parker in her office ive never seen her have an attack like that bill said he asked her to spell a word and she just freaked out mother that was what sarah was supposed to spell diane didnt tell the prim doctor this neither did she say how much she resented cordes callousness in telling her which word so panicked sarah dr parker said i wish youd called me i could have given her a tranquilizer she had a panic attack theyre very dangerous in children although the doctors words were spoken softly diane felt the lash of criticism again she said in a spiny tone i was out and my husband had just got some bad news we couldnt deal with it all at once thats what im here for im sorry diane said then she was angry with herself why should i feel guilty ive kept her out of i know dr parker said i called the school after you called me you did diane asked of course i did sarahs my patient this incident is my responsibility the blunt admission surprised diane but she sensed the doctor wasnt apologizing she was simply observing i misjudged her strength she puts on a good facade of resilience i thought shed be better able to deal with the stress i was wrong i dont want her back in school this term we have to stabilize her emotionally the doctors suit today was dark green and highnecked diane had noticed it favorably when she walked into the office and was even thinking of complimenting her she changed her mind dr parker opened a thick file inside were a half dozen booklets on some of which sarahs stubby handwriting was evident now ive finished my diagnosis and id like to talk to you about it first i was right to take her off ritalin im sure youre always right she doesnt display any general hyperkinetic activity and shes very eventempered when not confronted with stress what i observed about her restlessness and her inattentiveness was that theyre symptomatic of her primary disability you said that might be the case diane said yes i did but of course ive given her the wechsler intelligence scale for children the gray oral reading test bender gestalt wide range achievement test and the informal test of written language expression the results show your daughter suffers from severe reading retardation i dont care what you say diane blurted sarah is not retarded that doesnt mean that shes retarded mrs corde primary reading retardation its also called developmental dyslexia dyslexia thats where you turn letters round thats part of it dyslexics have trouble with word attack thats how we approach a word weve never seen before and with putting together words or sentences they have trouble with handwriting and show an intolerance for drill sarah also suffers from dysorthographia or spelling deficit come on diplomas cut out the big words and do what im paying you to do she has some of dyslexias mathematical counterpart developmental dyscalculia but her problem is primarily reading and spelling her combined verbal and performance iq is in the superior range in fact shes functioning in the top five percent of the population her score by the way is higher than that of the average medical student sarah diane whispered its also six points higher than your sons i checked with the school diane frowned this could not be the doctors credentials were suddenly suspect again shes reading about three years behind her chronological age and it usually happens that the gap will widen without special education by the time shes fifteen sarahs writing age would be maybe eleven and her spelling age nine or ten what can we do tutoring and special education immediately dyslexia is troubling with any student but its an extremely serious problem for someone with sarahs intelligence and creativity creativity diane could not suppress the laugh why the doctor had mixed up her daughters file with another patients shes not the least creative shes never painted anything she cant carry a tune she cant even strum a guitar obviously she cant write mrs corde sarah is one of the most creative patients ive ever had she can probably do all of those things you just mentioned shes been too inhibited to try because the mechanics overwhelm her shes been conditioned to fail her selfesteem is very low but we always encourage her mrs corde parents often encourage their disabled children to do what other students can do easily sarah is not like other children encouragement like that is just another way of helping her fail well diane said stiffly you sure dont hesitate to call it the way you see it doctor dr parker smiled a smile that meant nothing at all to diane who was for once relieved that the psychiatrist had set a frigid atmosphere for these sessions she had no problem saying bluntly thats very well and good doctor but how the hell are you going to help my little girl i want you to find a tutor theyre expensive but you need one and you need a good one i recommend that you check with the auden lab school why cant we help her bill and me sarah needs a specialist but its important that she see someone who knows what theyre doing diane thought it was remarkable that you could both admire and detest someone at the same time second id like to work with her myself until we build up her confidence in herself shes never going to improve her selfesteem has been very badly damaged what can you do that we havent all right maybe the way we tried to teach her was wrong but you keep forgetting that weve always supported her we always tell her how good she is how talented but she doesnt believe you and how can she you push her to work harder and it does no good you tell her shes doing well but she isnt shes failing her classes you tell her shes smart but by all the outward manifestations she isnt mrs corde youve acted for the best motives but your efforts have been counterproductive we need to encourage sarah to do the things shes genuinely good at but havent you heard what ive told you she isnt good at anything she doesnt even like to help me cook or sew all she does is play games by herself go to movies and watch tv ah precisely dr parker smiled like a chess player calling checkmate diane blinked whatd i say id like to see sarah as soon as possible if you could make the appointment with ruth the cryptic eyes so talented at dismissals glanced at another file okay sure diane stood then she hesitated she sat down again say doctor yes diane blurted where does it come from dyslexia im sorry i should have discussed that with you she closed the second file and turned full attention to diane we dont know exactly it used to be that a lot of doctors attributed it to physical problems like memory confusion between the two hemispheres of the brain thats been discredited now though vision and hearing problems can be major factors my belief is that like many developmental problems dyslexia has both a nature and nurture component its largely genetic and the prenatal period is very critical but how parents and teachers respond to the child is important too prenatal diane asked then casually added so could it be that someone who had maybe smoked or drank or took drugs during pregnancy might cause dyslexia in their children to some extent though usually theres a correspondent decrease in iq dr parker squinted and flipped through her notes anyway i thought you said you largely abstained while you were pregnant oh thats right diane said i was just curious you know when someone you love has a problem you want to know all about it diane stood up she sensed dr parker studying her well ill make that appointment wait a minute please dr parker capped her pen you know mrs corde one of the underlying themes of my approach to therapy is that we really are our parents she was smiling diane believed in a heartfelt way for the first time since they had begun working together i call parents the quote primary providers and not just in a positive sense what they give us and what they do for us and to us include some unfortunate things but it can include a lot of good things too diane looked back at her and tried to keep her face an unemotional mask she managed pretty well even when the doctor said ive seen a lot of parents in here and ive seen a lot of people in here because of their parents whatevers troubling you mrs corde dont be too hard on yourself my opinion is that sarah is a very lucky girl technically this was trespassing but boundaries in the country arent what they are in the city you could walk hunt fish on almost anybodys land for miles around as long as you left it in good shape as long as the feeling was reciprocal nobody made an issue corde ducked under the wire fence and slipped into the scruffy forest behind his property he continued for a ways then broke out into a clearing in the center of which was a huge rock some glacier had left behind twenty feet high and smooth as a trouts skin corde clambered onto the rock and sat in one of the indentations on the west side she wears a turquoise sweater high at the neck half obscuring her fleshy throat to the south he could just see a charcoal gray roof which seemed attached to a stand of adolescent pines though in fact it covered his own house he noticed the discolored patch near the chimney where he had replaced the shingles last summer you used to live in st louis didnt you jennie gebben asks oh she is pretty hair straight and long abundant breasts under the soft cloth sheer white stockings under the black jeans she wears no shoes and he sees through the thin nylon rednailed toes exceptionally long well i did he answers as a matter of fact he clears his throat he feels the closeness of the dormitory room he smells incense he smells spicy perfume eight nine years ago i was little then but werent you in the news or something all cops get on the air at one time or another press conferences or something drug bust saturday night january a year ago branches click outside the dormitory window bill corde sits on a chair and jennie gebben tucks her whitestockinged feet under her legs and lies back on the bed it seems it was something more than that she says more than a press conference wait i remember it was she stops speaking bill corde sitting now on the fleshsmooth rock in the quiet town of new lebanon watched the sun grow longer to the horizon through a high tangle of brush and hemlock and young oaks soon to die from light starvation shots fired shots fired tenthirtythree unit to respond each inch the sun fell each thousand miles the earth turned away from it he sensed the forest waking smells grew loam moss leaves from last fall decomposing bitter bark musk animal droppings this session of the st louis police department shooting review board incident number detective sergeant william corde assigned to st louis county grand larceny currently suspended from duty pending the outcome of this hearing corde thought hed be happy just being a hunter he would have liked to live in the s oh there was a lot that amused and appealed to him about the midwest at the end of the twentieth century like pickup trucks and televised cardinals and cubs games and pizza and computers and noncorrosive gunpowder but if you asked him to be honest hed say that hed forgo it all to wake up one morning and walk downstairs to find diane in front of a huge fireplace making johnnycakes in the beehive oven then he and jamie would go out to trap or hunt all day long among the miles and miles of forests just like this one a well sir the perpetrators q you knew them to be armed with assault rifles a not with assault rifles no though we knew they were armed the perpetrators had taken the cash and jewelry and were still inside the store i ordered my men into the alley behind the store it was my intention to enter through a side door and take them by surprise corde listened to the snapping of some invisible animal making its way through the woods he thought how odd it was that a creature was moving past him probably no more than ten feet away yet he sensed no danger he felt if anything the indifference of the surroundings as if he had been discounted by nature as something insignificant and not worth harming q sergeant corde could you tell us then what happened a yes sir there were a number of exit doors leading from the stores into the alley i had inadvertently told the men to enter through door q inadvertently a that was a mistake the door that opened onto the jewelry store was number q you mixed up the numbers a yes sir in speaking with the fire inspector he had told me the correct number of the door i had written it down but when i radioed to the men which door to enter i read it backwards q so the men entered the mall through the wrong door a no they tried to but that door was locked as they were trying to get it open thinking it was the correct door the perpetrators ran into the alley and fired on the policemen their backs q whose backs a the policemens backs were to the perpetrators two police officers were killed and two were wounded q have the perpetrators been apprehended a to date one has the rest have not hed been suspended with half pay for six months but he quit the force a week before reinstatement he sat around in his suburban home thinking about the men whod died thinking of the kind of jobs he ought to get replaying the incident a hundred times then a thousand times he stopped going to church and didnt even have the inclination to turn a bar or the bottle into his personal chapel he spent his time with the tv doing some security jobs some construction work finally the mortgage payments on the trim suburban splitlevel outran their savings and with sarah on the way theyd no choice but to come back to new lebanon feed and grain planning and sawing teaching long long days then hes seen the ad in the paper for a deputy and hed applied after bill and diane had moved back to new lebanon he had five years with his father before the stroke five full years of opportunities to talk about what happened at the fairway mall but what the two men spent those years on was pheasant loads and movies and carburetors and memories of their wife and mother one day a month before the blood clot swapped a clear complicated mind for one that was infinitely simple corde was crouched down sharpening a mower blade in his fathers garage he heard the footsteps and he looked up to see the old man standing hunched and pale licking the top of a dannon yogurt container his father said bout time to deal with st louis wouldnt you say corde stood his knee popping and pushing him ohsoslowly upward he turned to face his father and cleared his throat the elder corde said solemnly ten bucks says theyll cave to new york corde rolled grass flecks off his hands and dug into his pocket for a bill youre on he said his father wandered into the yard while corde turned back to the iron blade in complete remorse q if someone else had read the number of the door to the policemen in the alley the mishap might not have happened or if you had taken your time and read the number slowly a garbled q could you repeat that please a the mishap probably would not have happened no hed never told anyone in new lebanon the facts were there somewhere in his file in st louis if steve ribbon or hammerback ellison or jim slocum or addie kraskow of the register wanted to go to the trouble to look it up they would find everything but the new lebanon sheriffs department simply glanced at his résumé and believed the truthful statement that the reason for termination from his last job was that hed quit they believed too his explanation that he had grown tired of fighting city riverfront crime and had wanted to move back to his peaceful home town after all he had a sixyearold son and a baby on the way whod think to look beyond that another snap nearby corde turned the animal materialized a buck he saw two does not far off he loved watching them they were elegant in motion but when they stopped always as if they were late for something vitally important and had time to give you just a brief look they were completely regal corde wished he was a poet he wanted badly to put into words what he felt at this moment the knowledge in the deers eyes the melting sun the unseen movement of the woods at dusk the total sorrow when you fall short of the mark that you know gods set for you with a single crack of wet wood the deer were gone bill corde scooted off the rock and slowly made his way to his twentiethcentury home with his pickup truck and television and his family special to the register two days after the slaying of a second auden university coed by the man known as the moon killer john treadle harrison county supervisor ordered sheriffs department deputies to step up nighttime patrols around new lebanon but he said i cant emphasize enough that girls shouldnt travel by themselves after dark until we catch this man the body of the student emily rossiter a resident of st louis was found floating in blackfoot pond on the night of the full moon she had been struck on the head and left to drown the body was reportedly mutilated were devoting a hundred and ten percent of our time to solving these cult murders steven ribbon sheriff of new lebanon said last night he added that he had taken the unusual step of asking an outside consultant to assist in the investigation this man has a number of years of homicide investigation experience with a big city police department and hes already provided some real helpful insights into the workings of this killers mind citing security sheriff ribbon would give no details on this consultants identity or exact role in the case the chamber of commerce estimates that the series of murders has cost the town one million dollars in lost revenues her biggest fear is that somehow her father has scared off the sunshine man it is now a couple of days in a row that her daddy has gotten up late had breakfast with them and then been home before supper but worse than that he had gone for long walks in the woods behind the house the woods where the sunshine man lived sarah considers herself an expert on wizards and she knows that they resent people who dont believe in them her fathers certainly a person like that although shes questioned redford t redford at length about the wizard the bear has remained silent she has left several presents and painstakingly written notes for the sunshine man in the magic circle he has not picked them up or responded she has thought about running away again but because her mother has agreed with dr parker to keep her out of school for a while sarah is willing to postpone her escape plans she listens to her books on tape she looks at her picture books she watches television she plays with her stuffed animals at night sarah sits and stares out the window once when the waning moon is bright she thinks she sees the form of a man walking through the woods she flashes her bedside light and waves whoever it might be stops and looks at the house but does not respond he seems to vanish she stares after him until the trees begin to sway and the night sky opens up in great cartwheeling streaks of stars and planets and giants and animals then she crawls under the blankets she holds tight to her piece of magic quartz and knowing the sunshine man may be out there sends him a message in her thoughts sarah wishes her father would start working late again and sure enough after just two days she gets this wish hes up and gone before breakfast and home long after shes gone to bed one morning when he hadnt seen her for two days her father left a note at the breakfast table for her it sounded all stiff sarah sadly thinks the sunshine man is much smarter than her father she hopes the wizard will come back and make her smart she believes he can do it she also knows though that this will be a very hard wish to grant so she tells herself to be patient she knows shell have to wait just a little while longer philip closed his bedroom door and immediately they were warriors once again tall and dignified and ever correct struggling to understand this strange dimension jano looked around the room your sister here nope the boys who knew philips sister and that was a lot of boys did not call her rose or rosy they called her halpern which seemed to philip to say everything there was to say about her jano whispered urgently well what phathar shoved a dripping handful of popcorn from a halfgallon bag into his mouth he whispered did you do it janos eyes were red and it looked like there was a streak of dried snot under his nose phathar wondered if his friend had been crying phathar assumed he was the only freshman boy who still cried jano repeated the girl at the pond emily something did you he ate another mouthful nope jano whispered i dont believe you i didnt do it dude you wanted to fuck her so you killed her i did not with a pudgy finger phathar worked a hull out from between an incisor and his gum i am like totally freaked what are we going to do have some popcorn you are like too much man shes dead too and youre like so what you saw the way the honons mowed down the valanies they just like went in with the xasers and totally mowed them down the women and the kids everyone thats a movie phathar repeated patiently i didnt like kill her did you find the knife i might have if i hadnt been alone i couldnt make it i told you maybe you didnt lose it i lost it jano said man weve got to get rid of everything i told you i put a destructor on the files its great here look phathar walked to a locked metal file cabinet he unlocked it and pulled a drawer open inside were stacks of charts and drawings and files resting on top of them was a coil from a space heater look this is a lock switch that i got from popular mechanics its great if you open the cabinet without shutting off the switch he reached inside the cabinet and pointed to two pieces of wood wound with wires pressing against each other like a large clothespin somebody opens the drawer and it closes the circuit the coil gets red hot in like seconds and torches everything totally excellent jano said with admiration what if it burns the house down phathar did not respond through the closed door they heard philips father singing some old song strangers in the night jano looked in the bottom drawer of the file cabinet whats that he picked up the brown purse smeared with mud phathar froze he was in a delicate position this was his only friend in high school he couldnt do what he wanted to which was to scream to him to put it back he said simply its hers jano clicked it open the girls the second one you did do it phathar reached out and closed it would you just chill i saw her but i dont see why youre denying it man i didnt kill her whyd you keep it i dont know phathar in fact had wondered that a number of times it smells nice you get over with her too jano had stopped looking shocked and was curious are you deaf like are you totally deaf come on phathar i tell you everything what was it like youre a fucking hatter i followed her for a while but then i took off there was some dude wandering around who i dont know they found her in the pond yuck if you did it with her your dickll probably fall off with that water whats in the purse i dont know i didnt open it phathar stood up and took the purse away from his friend he put it in the file cabinet and laid another heater coil on top of it he closed the drawer i dont think thats a good place for it jano said how come even with the destructor itd take a while for the leather to catch fire phathar decided this might be true he retrieved the purse he held it out to jano you take it throw it someplace no way i dont want to get caught with it why dont you burn it i cant my dadd whack me again maybe ill hide it under the porch and some night when hes playing cards ill burn it the terrible glasssplintering crash came from the living room the boys each stared at the dirtsmeared wall through which the sound had come philip dropped the purse into the empty popcorn bag and wadded it along with some trash into a green plastic garbage bag which sat in the corner of this room they stepped into the hall philips mother was on the floor on all fours her knees spread out skirt up to her trim waist the eyes in her pretty face were nearly closed and her head lolled as the muscles in her smooth arms tried to keep her shoulders from dropping to the ground mr halpern stood above her his hands gripping the stained orange blouse saying desperately itll be all right itll be all right no no itll be all right and she was repeating louder and in a shrill soprano lemmealone lemmealone in her hand was a white wad of cloth on the stained carpet was a fresher stain of vomit the smell of sour gin was thick in the air philip started to cry mrs halpern jano whispered philips father looked up get the fuck out of here both of you jano said but shes sick whimpering philip said shes not sick get the fuck out his father shouted both of you out out out he stamped his foot as if he were spooking dogs philip said to jano please but please philip said his friend fled outside staring out the front window philip heard the scuffling of his mothers shoes his father had lifted her into an armchair and was whispering to her philip walked past his parents and out the back door then he slipped under the porch philip hid the bag containing the purse under a mound of soft black dirt he rocked back and forth in the crisp dusty leaves oh he was tired he was tired of so much his father wore torn tshirts and made the handy man visit his mother packed him greasy sandwiches for lunch when she made his lunch and forgot to wash the clothes there were enemies everywhere everywhere you looked his sister was a ho he was fat she was halpern he was philip phillip he got a d in phys ed and a b in biology and while another glass shattered somewhere in the house above him a single thought centered in his head an image of a shy young girl leaning on a lab table and telling him how brave he was while philip stuck a needle way deep into a frogs brain then slit its belly open and watched the slick lump of a heart continue to beat on and on and on bill corde was sitting in infamous room of the student union he was alone surrounded by the now familiar scents of fatty meat bitter paper and burnt coffee more students more threebyfive cards todays questions were similar to last weeks but they were not identical today he was asking about two victims corde took notes jotting down the boxy oriental letters but the hours were unproductive he heard variations on what he had already learned or pointless obscure details emily wore this yoked dress a lot then one day it got stolen from the laundry room that was just before she was killed i mean like the day before corde nodded and recorded this fact unsure what it might mean or what he would ever do with it but afraid to let the item get away he had this feeling often many thoughts intruded on the interviews not the least of which was a vague disquiet about charlie mahoney the mysterious consultant ribbon had introduced them but the man had said little to corde and been in a hurry to leave the office corde had not seen him since when corde asked ribbon what real helpful insights mahoney had provided picking up the sheriffs phrase from the register hed been as elusive as corde expected mahoneys here as an observer is all what i said was mostly for public relations trying to calm people down a little well who the hell got em uncalm in the first place with all this talk of a moon killer i dont want a civilian working on this case corde said i know you dont ribbon had answered cryptically and returned to his office now in room corde looked at his watch four pm he wandered out to the cafeteria and bought an iced coffee he finished it in three swallows he was eager to go home he nearly did so but his resolve broke or discipline won and he stepped to the door and waved a final student inside then told the others to come back tomorrow it was just as well that he did not leave this last student was the one who told him jennie gebbens secret she was round and had thick wrists and was worried about a double chin because she kept her head high throughout the interview with that posture and the expensive flowered dress she seemed like an indulged east coast princess the lazy southern drawl disposed of that impression quickly i do hope i can help you officer its a terrible thing that happened did she know either of the murdered girls just jennie how long had she known her two years yes they shared some classes no they had never doubledated do you know either professor sayles or brian okun sorry do you know who jennie might have been going out with the fleshy neck was touched it reminded him compellingly of jennies throat corde looked from the white flesh back to the paler white of his threebyfive cards well would you be speaking of men she went out with students professors anyone or girls the tip of cordes pen lowered to a card please go on the girl played tensely with the elaborate lace tulle on the cuff of her dress well you know bout jennies affair with that girl dontcha after a pause he wrote bisexual in precise boxy letters and asked her to continue the girl touched her round pink lip with her tongue and made a circuit of cordes face just rumors you know how it is the plump mouth closed please finally she said one time the story goes some girls were in a dorm across campus and saw jennie in bed with another girl the flesh was no longer pale but glowed with fire who was this other girl i was led to believe their position in bed made it a little difficult to see her if you understand what im saying who were these girls who saw it i dont know i assumed you knew all about this the frown produced not a single wrinkle in her perfect skin you know of course about the fight she had tell me the sunday before she died jennie was on the phone for a long time it was late and she was whispering a lot but i got the impression she was talking to somebody shed dumped you know that tone like where you have to get meaner than you want to because theyre not taking no for an answer they all were carrying on and my room is right near the phone and i was going to go out and tell her to hush when i heard her say well i love her and i dont love you and thats all there is to it then crash bang she hung up loved her right im sure about that the call did she make it or receive it she received it no way to trace man or woman she sounded like she was talking to a man but maybe im projecting my own values with her i guess it couldve been either thats all i know nobody else has said anything about it she shrugged well did yall ask no then that pretty much explains it wouldn you say when she had gone corde bundled his cards together and tossed them into his briefcase he noticed that the phone booth up the hall was free and he walked quickly to it as he stood waiting for someone to answer his call two young men walked past lost in loud debate youre not listening to me im saying theres perception and theres reality theyre both valid ill prove it to you like see that cop over there but at that moment tt ebbans said hello and corde never heard the end of the discussion he lusted for her what a phenomenon he was actually salivating his nostrils flaring as if he could smell her and he wanted more than anything to pull open her white blouse and slip a highrider breast into his mouth brian okun said to victoria feinstein im thinking of doing a seminar on gender identity in the romantic era would you be interested in being on the panel interesting idea she said and crossed legs encased in tight black jeans they were sitting in the arts and sciences cafeteria coffee before them victoria was okuns most brilliant student she had stormed onto campus from central park west and seventysecond street he had read her first paper of the semester gynocriticism and the old new left and bolstered by her selfrising breasts and hard buttocks decided she was everything that jennie gebben was and considerably more alas this proved too literally true however and he found with bitterness that certain aspects of her knowledge semiotics for instance and south american writers currently chic topics in the mla vastly outweighed his a discrepancy she gleefully flaunted okuns hampered hope vaporized one day when he saw victoria feinstein kiss a woman on the lips outside his classroom still okun admired her immensely and spoke to her often it troubled him to use such a brilliant mind in this cheap way she said why romantic why not classic been done he dismissed maybe she pondered you could do it interstitially the augustan era interposed against the romantic you know latin dont you i do mirabile dictu but ive already outlined the program i hope youll think about it id like the panel to be straight gay transvestite and transsexual victoria said ah you want a crosssection he laughed hard why oh why dont you want to sit on my cock and scrunch around she was courteous enough to ask the question before he had to steer her there is this for gilchrists class leons no its my own idea hes out in san francisco wont be back for a couple of days gilchrist had in fact called okun the night before to tell him that he would be arriving in three days and had ordered okun to prepare a draft of a final exam okun noted that the son of a bitch called at exactly the moment a substitute professor was delivering gilchrists lecture he wanted to make certain that okun hadnt been standing before his class whats he doing out there she asked healing the wounds i guess hows that she asked you know the girl the girl he looked confused you told me didnt you i dont know what you mean what was her name the first one who was killed jennie something i thought you told me about the two of them she asked in astonishment gilchrist and jennie gebben they were fucking it wasnt you who told me no who was it he looked at the ceiling dont recall well anyway i heard they were a unit poor girl victoria said frowning gilchrist huh i wouldnt have guessed jennie and him i heard he was an s and m pup okun nodded knowingly quelling resentment that this was the second person who seemed to know for a fact something about his own professor that he had not been aware of she continued im surprised at the leather my opinion was that gilchrist would be more of your classic postwar british pederast you know i think they should castrate rapists okun thought for a moment that might make another seminar mutilation and castration as metaphor in western literature victorias eyes brightened now theres an idea for you she wasnt sure what the vibration was alignment maybe or a soft tire driving home from auden university diane corde noticed that the steering wheel seemed to shake her engagement ring hobbled noisily on tan gm plastic then she realized the station wagon was fine it was her hand that shook so fiercely the first time in her life that a reference to money had made her fingers tremble diane was returning from a meeting with the admissions director at the auden lab school the woman who looked sharp and professional no sultry pink no clattering bracelets no hussy makeup had explained the procedures sarahs file which dr parker had already forwarded to the school would be reviewed by the schools special education admissions board they would make a recommendation about placing sarah in one of the classes or arranging for private tutoring im sure the woman said your daughter will be accepted diane was grateful to tears at this news then the director had consulted a sheet of paper lets see tuition for a special education class at sarahs level is eight thousand four hundred now we a year diane had interrupted breathlessly the woman had smiled oh dont worry thats not per semester thats for the entire year oh dont worry eight thousand four hundred which exceeded dianes annual salary when shed been receptionist for dr bullen the oldest living gynecologist in new lebanon does insurance ever cover it medical insurance no thats a little steep audens lab school is one of the best in the country we just bought a new frigidaire well diane broke the silence dr parker mentioned a private tutor is an option three times a week she said how much would that be the woman had cheerfully parried that the total fee for a tutor would be two hundred seventy dollars a week oh dont worry diane had smoothed her navy blue skirt and studied a cleft of wrinkle in the cloth she felt totally numb maybe bad news was an anesthetic so you see the admissions director had said smiling the school is in fact the better bargain well diane corde didnt see that at all bargain what she saw was everybody taking advantage of her little girls problem all of them dr parker the harlot and this pert la law admissions director and the prissy tutors who werent going to do anything but get sarahs brain back up to the level where god intended it to be all along well ill have to talk to my husband about it just let me say mrs corde that i think we can be of real help to your daughter sarah has the sort of deficit that responds very well to our method of education well now miss hearing that makes me feel just jimdandy shall i start sarahs application theres no fee to apply oh a freebie why not she had asked wholly discouraged pulling now into the driveway of her house diane waved to tom standing scrubbed and ruddy beside his harrison county sheriffs department cruiser after the two threatening polaroids and the second murder he had taken to marching a regular line around the backyard at various times throughout the day he was also armed with his wifes opera glasses which he explained she bought for when they went to plymouth playhouse dinner theater with these hed often scan the forest for hostile eyes he looked silly a beefy redcheeked young man holding the delicate plastic motherofpearl glasses but diane was grateful for the effort there had been no more threats and the sense of violation had almost vanished coffee tom he declined goshthanks and turned back to the woods jamie walked outside slipping a tshirt on over his thin muscular body he was the epitome of grace and she enjoyed watching him climb on his bike and balance while he pulled on his fingerless riding gloves wherere you off to practice whens the match saturday hows your arm its like fine no problem garage looks nice thanks i did the windows they were totally gross you did the windows she asked in mock astonishment very funny and i found the old frisbee well play tonight you and me yeah okay we oughta get a glowinthedark one gotta go he pushed the bike forward without using his hands and coasted down the driveway as he closed the velcro fasteners on his gloves she watched him lean forward and his muscular legs start to pedal hes going to be a heartbreaker inside the house sarah was playing with a stuffed animal after diane had delivered the news that the school was over for the year the girl glowed with christmasmorning happiness this bothered diane who saw in the girls face the look of a spoiled child who finally got her way the sunshine man he came back did he now diane asked absently he saved me from mrs beiderbug sarah ive told you about that mrs beidersora she sprang up and ran into the kitchen diane hung up her jacket whos the sunshine man again which ones he mommy she was exasperated hes the wizard who lives in the woods i saw him again today i thought hed gone away but he came back he cast a spell on mrs beider she grinned with coy nastiness beidersorc and i dont have to go back to school just for the term not forever although the girls insistence that magical characters were real frequently irritated diane at the moment she wished that she herself had a sunshine man to watch over her shoulder or at least to cast a spell and cough up some big bucks for special ed tuition as she looked through the mail she asked your father call naw diane went into the kitchen and took four large pork chops from the refrigerator she chopped mushrooms and sauteed them with oregano and bread crumbs then let the filling cool while she cut pockets in the pork you sure your father didnt call maybe jamie took a message mom like theres the board do you see any messages you can answer me decently diane snapped well he didnt call diane carefully cut a slit in the last pork chop im not going back to school ever again sarah announced sarah i told you its just for the girl walked upstairs singing cheerfully to herself never ever again the sunshine man the sunshine man children sometimes the young woman said i believe it was leon gilchrist cynthia abrams was a thin sophomore smart and reasonable and unpretentious corde liked her she had long shimmering dark hair confident eyes earrings in the shape of african idols she was a class officer and the campus director of actup she was sitting forward elbows on the low desk in the student union holding a cigarette courteously away from him while she answered his questions corde glanced down and found the professors name on a card a note said that leon gilchrist had been in san francisco at the time of the first killing and had not returned as of three days ago he put a question mark next to the name and you think they had an affair i dont know for sure i heard several rumors that shed gone out with professors over the past couple of years one or two she was pretty serious about then i recently heard professor gilchrists name mentioned who did you hear this from about gilchrist i dont remember do you know if there was any bad feelings between them no i dont really know anything at all im just telling you what i heard corde glanced at his open briefcase and saw the picture of jennie gebben do you know of anyone who would have wanted to hurt jennie or her roommate no i sure dont but i want to say something else you seem like a reasonable man and i hope i can speak frankly to you go right ahead the gay community at auden is not popular in new lebanon this was hardly news to bill corde who had been on a panel to recommend to the state legislature that consensual homosexual activity be removed from the penal code as a sexual crime both because he thought it was nobodys business but the participants and because criminalizing it skewed statistics and confused investigations he had never heard such vicious words as those fired back and forth in the harrison county building public meeting room during the panel discussions she asked you know jennie was bisexual yes i do that fact hasnt come out in the press yet but if it does im concerned it will get mixed up with you know cult or satanic aspects of the murders i abhor the linking of homosexuality and violence i dont see why that connection would be made corde said it certainly wont come from my department somewhere in cordes mind was a soft tap as a thought rose to the surface was emily what was the proper terminology he felt on some eggshells here was she a lesbian i dont know i didnt know her very well you think jennie might have been targeted because she was bisexual a biasrelated crime we dont have those laws on the books here she lifted a coy eyebrow i graduate in two years i hope that will have changed by then im thinking more in terms of helping me with a motive i suppose theres always the possibility of antigay violence in areas that are less now she trod lightly enlightened than some corde considered this motive but he couldnt carry it very far he wanted all of his cards in front of him he wanted to read what other students and professors had told him he wanted more information about emily he said this has been very helpful anything else you can think of there is one thing id like to say whats that my roommate victoria and i were having this discussion last night yes she brought up the idea of surgically castrating rapists would you be interested in signing a petition to send to the state legislature corde said i better not in the sheriffs department were not supposed to be too you know political he couldnt recall the last time he felt so unwelcome detective i think its pretty clear that youre dealing with some kind of crazy person some psychopath he is not a student it is clearly not a professor everyone on this faculty has the highest credentials and the most impeccable background your rumormongering is despicable yesm corde said to dean catherine larraby i was asking about leon gilchrist you didnt really answer my question youre not suggesting that he had anything to do with the deaths of these two girls has he ever been in any trouble with students here or at another school the dean whispered im not even going to dignify that with an answer leon gilchrist is a brilliant scholar were lucky to have him on staff and ive heard from a number of sources that jennie had relations with at least one professor one person i interviewed thinks gilchrist might be him professors at auden are forbidden to date students doing so is grounds for dismissal who told you i told her id respect her confidence she looked for a way to pry this information out of him not finding one she said impossible its a vicious rumor leon isnt well liked no a tiny note went onto a stiff white card dont make anything out of that she snapped professors can be like children leon has an infantile streak in him which he has trouble controlling he makes enemies people as brilliant as he breed rumors you didnt answer my question is he a suspect no he was reading a paper at the berkeley poetry conference at the time of the killings she said did you know that before or afterward i beg your pardon she asked cautiously im curious if after jennie was killed you suspected something about professor gilchrist and checked on his whereabouts at that time the eyes went to steel cold i have nothing further to say to you detective if you could she was killed by a psycho the deans shrill voice tore through the room the same one who vandalized the grade school and churches the same one who murdered emily if youd taken this psychopath seriously instead of digging into banal college gossip emily would still be alive today we have to explore all angles dean ill guarantee you that leon did not have relations with jennie and he didnt have anything to do with her death or emilys now if youll excuse me im in the midst of emergency funding meetings which by the way are necessary largely because you people havent caught this madman when corde had left the office dean larraby snatched up the phone and snapped to her secretary is gilchrist back from the coast whens he expected whos his teaching assistant her foot tapped in anger while she waited who okun give him a call and tell him i want to see him tell him its urgent charlie mahoney was pretty tired of new lebanon the incident that had cemented this opinion was a bad meal at ewells diner particularly bad meat loaf gristle extraordinarily bad mashed potatoes paste and moderately bad bourbon oily this cuisine was followed by an early evening in the motel room where he was now lounging in front of a small tv that was not hooked up to cable the exact instant when boredom became loathing occurred during a channel commercial break four straight minutes of grating ads for products like hog feed and cultivators and used cars and kerosene who the fuck buys kerosene from a tv ad he lay on the sagging bed and looked up at the stucco ceiling stucco who invented stucco and why would anybody put it on a ceiling where you had to look at it all night long because there was nothing else to do how many college sluts had lain here on this bed with their legs in the air and stared at this ceiling thinking stucco who the fuck invented stucco jesus when is this son of bitch going to finish when mahoneys thoughts got tired of midwest decor they ambled over to richard gebben mahoney not a man with much heart to spare for anyone least of all an employer had sat with perplexed but genuine sympathy as he watched richard gebben absently drive the toy christmas truck back and forth on his desk back in st louis gebben preformed we fabricate the world jennies mother i dont know when shes going to come out of it she may never she doesnt cry anymore she doesnt do anything but sometimes she has these i dont know bursts of energy charlie shell be lying in bed then she leaps up and has to polish the silver the silver charlie for christsake we have a maid a jet had begun its takeoff run and the tenor roar filled the beige office the dc was well over illinois before gebben spoke again jennie he had said addressing mahoney not the spirit of his daughter he had proceeded to speak about reputation about the media about misunderstandings he had spoken about troubling discoveries then he paused and the truck stopped rolling and as he stared out the window at a tall gray mcdonnell douglas hangar richard gebben spoke about his daughter the whore to mahoney a man who had seen evidence of just about every sexual act humankind could think of the fact that jennie slept with women as well as men was unremarkable what was a little boggling at least in the age of aids was the sheer volume of both men and women shed had between her legs charlie i dont care what you have to do this fellow corde is going to be taking her life apart hes already been looking for diaries and letters i cant let that happen charlie you know what happens in investigations like this they look at every little detail of somebodys life they make up stories about people the newspapers just love that crap you know charlie it happens all the time you saw it happen no mahoney had never seen it happen what he saw happen was ismalah r dissed devon jefferies who went home to his crib on south halsted picked up his mac then came acalling to spray ismalah r with forty or fifty rounds and the asshole just died where he stood and nobody made up a single fucking thing about him at all that was what mahoney had seen and what he saw now was a pathetic richard gebben with his pitted face and moist eyes trying to save what little remained of his daughter well that was how gebben had explained mahoneys mission to new lebanon and ten thousand dollars had bought mahoneys unwavering acceptance of it along with a generous number of encouraging nods and mutterings of sympathy thrown in but mahoney knew there was more gebben had taken many business trips to places that had a light market share of the gebben preformed steel sheeting business if any at all unnecessary trips to acapulco aspen puerto vallarta palm beach and he was always accompanied by a sultry blond secretary or young marketing assistant or steno typist this was the role model he had been for his daughter it was a lesson she had learned and learned well and maybe it had killed her and who knew maybe gebben himself had even come to visit jennie late at night mommy fast asleep as a cop mahoney had seen a good deal of emotional pain he remembered walking up three flights of shitstinking stairs in a tenement knocking on the door to deliver some news to a young woman she listened nodding vigorously as she held her daughter who had little plastic toys tied into her hair where pigtails sprouted from her scalp tiny trains soda bottles dogs dolls the woman saying i unnerstand i unnerstand and mahoney thinking understand you poor bitch theres nothing complicated here your old man just got blown away in a drug deal but mahoney knew of course that it was complicated so complicated she would never unnerstand it as complicated as gebbens reasons for wanting his daughters secrets to stay hidden forever reasons that charlie mahoney lying on a lumpy bed in front of a flickering ralston purina commercial would never completely figure out not that he needed to he had his ten thousand dollars and he had a specific job which arrived at that moment in the form of steve ribbon who knocked and called hey charlie im a little late sorry you in there charlie right with you mahoney let him wait for a full minute then stretched and stood and opened the door ribbon grinned shyly like a police cadet on graduation day the sheriff who had ten years on mahoney looked like a youngster and mahoney thought damn if these small towns didnt preserve you real well steve he said ebulliently how you doing they shook hands ribbon walked in saying i like that the way you kept your hand in your jacket when you opened the door habit you looked pretty smooth cabrini projects you were telling me the other night war zone brung a present you want a drink sure ribbon poured john begg scotch into squooshy plastic hotel cups they tapped them together and sipped ribbon was in uniform and when mahoney glanced at the top of the sheriffs head ribbon took off his smokey hat and dropped it down on the dresser youre not getting tired of our little town are you tired mahoney grunted its heaven on earth he slipped off his jacket he hung it up and poured more scotch ribbons eyes slipped to the large dark gray automatic pistol riding high on mahoneys right hip steve i happened to have a talk with deputy ebbans jim slocum and some of the other boys on the case today i sounded them out about how the investigations going mahoneys eyes tunneled into ribbons which danced a little looked briefly back then danced away again this was fun it was the way mahoney used to look at perps and he missed doing it therere a couple of things ive got to talk to you about ribbon responded exactly the same way the perps had fiercely studying the scenery behind mahoney as if memorizing the wall or window or front door but first off good news i just talked to mr gebben did you now and you know that reward i was talking about reward ribbon frowned then he nodded right yeah i recall you mentioning that well hes authorized me to release some of it now we havent caught anybody yet charlie ribbon snorted a laugh well ive told him youre doing a good job and he wants to show his support thats real kind of him charlie hes a generous man but im afraid weve got to talk about something kind of an unpleasant situation unpleasant ribbon licked the rim of his cup and mahoney let him fret for a delectable minute before he said again i dont want to be imposing myself youre the boss here steve i value your opinion youre surely more of an expert than any of us ribbon seemed at sea and took refuge in the scotch he drank long and busied himself with pouring another glass i hate to say anything naw go ahead charlie well its about this bill corde corde pulled into the town hall driveway and saw three deputies standing in front of a new nissan pathfinder x it was a beauty corde admired it he saw nothing wrong with buying foreign as long as the quality was better than american he had a little problem paying foreign having testdriven a pathfinder himself he knew he was looking at over twenty thousand dollars worth of transport corde turned his attention away from the truck and back to the lardy figure of dodd humphries he was helping out of the squad car and through the parking lot as he passed the truck corde said to the men whos the proud father steve bought her corde laughed in genuine surprise steve ribbon surely did walked right into the dealership and drove out this morning hell you say he was gonna drive that dodge till it dropped corde looked at the shimmering chrome and metallicflecked burgundy paint and he said to lance miller hes gone and set a bad precedent now everybodys gonna want their trucks with all cylinders running they entered the sheriffs department wing half the complement was out inspecting the sheriffs new wheels jim slocum was looking at a handful of letters corde assumed they were more of the worthless confessions and tip letters that accompany any publicized investigation dodd you cant keep doing this corde said to his prisoner doing what the man asked drowsily the mans toyota pickup had sheared a leg off the purina feed billboard on and dropped a painted sixtyfoot hereford on her blackandwhite rump miller took him into the lockup in the back of the office when he returned corde looked up from the arrest report two point four hes more than legally drunk i do believe hes legally dead miller said well hes legally barfing and hes got bits of windshield falling out of his skivvies its all over the floor corde said give him some paper towels and make him clean it up nobody should be drinking like that on a weekday morning hell lose his license this time miller said hardly matters corde answered that was his last truck steve ribbon appeared in the doorway and looked at corde talk to you for a minute bill corde followed him into his office and the sheriff shut the door ribbon sat down and expanded his cheeks like a blowfishs body and started to bounce a ticonderoga number two off the drum of his skin corde decided it might be a long conversation and sat down in the chair opposite the sheriffs desk bill the pencil stopped being a drumstick and became a flash gordon rocket crashlanding on the desk damn this bureaucracy bill corde waited county and state and everybody okay whats up steve i got a call from ellison uhhuh bill this is a damn difficult thing to say to you corde laughed without humor then spit it out fast ribbon said the countys taking over the gebben and rossiter cases it took several seconds for the fire to burn across cordes cheek the county tts going to be heading her up well steve legally i suppose the county can take over any murder investigation it wants to but the point is its never bill the point is its never happened before all right im a little angry thats what youre hearing i dont think weve done anything to make ellison feel this way it was the situation at the dorm what situation ribbon surveyed the rocket pencils crash site they think you burned her letters and her diary bill corde said nothing theyre thinking it was curious you flew to st louis so fast after the killing when you didnt find anything there you went to her dorm room and took them and burned it all up dont look that way bill they think you were trying to cover up something between you and her therell be an inquest next month and youre off the case till its over wynton kresges greatgreatgreatgrandfather whose name was charles monroe had been a slave one of two on a small farm near fort henry tennessee the story goes that when the emancipation proclamation took effect on new years day in monroe went to his master and said i am sorry to tell you this mr walker but there is a new law that says you cant own slaves anymore including us walker said they did that in nashville monroe answered no sir they did that in the capital that is to say washington bc blazes walker said and added that hed have to look into it because both he and his wife were illiterate they had to ask someone to tell them more about this law their charming innocence was demonstrated by their choice of abigail the walkers second slave to confirm the news she did so by reading from an outspoken abolitionist penny sheet which printed the text of the proclamation while avoiding an inconvenient discussion of lincolns jurisdiction to free slaves located in the confederacy damnation hes right walker said then he wished monroe luck and said by any chance you be interested in staying on for pay and monroe said hed be happy to and they negotiated a wage and room and board and monroe kept on working on the walker farm until he married abigail the walkers gave them their wedding and monroe named his first son walker family history and probably as embellished and halftrue as any but what wynton kresge thought was most interesting was how his children responded to the story his eldest son darryl eighteen was horrified that he had been descended from slaves and never wanted the fact mentioned kresge felt bad the boy was so ashamed and grumbled that since he was black and had grown up in the united states and not on the ivory coast how come that was such a shock kresges eldest daughter sephana sixteen on the other hand often talked about monroes plight which was how she referred to it plight she hated monroe for going back to work for walker she hated him for not putting a minié ball in his masters head and torching the farm sephana had posters of spike lee and wesley snipes on her wall she was beautiful kresge had put all serious talks with his daughter on hold for a few years kresges fifth child named after the ancestor in question was eight and he loved the story charles often wanted to act it out insisting that kresge take the role of mr walker while charles did an impersonation of someone probably not unlike his namesake kresge wondered what his youngest son nelson aged two would say about their ancestor when he learned the story these were the thoughts that kept intruding into kresges mind as he sat trying to read in the massive bunbuster swivel chair he felt all stifled and bouncy with nervous energy so he stood up and walked to the window in the far corner of his office he reached out and rested his hands on the windowsill and did half a dozen lazyboy pushups then twelve more and twelve more after that until he smelled sweat through his shirt the window overlooked not the quad but a strip of commercial new lebanon storefronts and flashing trailer signs and a chunk of the satellite dish on the tavern he was anxious and his muscles quivered from using them the wrong way in a soft office in a soft university a soft white university where you had to keep your temper and give reasons and all the suspects were good students and were trying hard and were just out for some fooling round he sat on the windowsill his huge shoulders slumped thinking of his ancestor perhaps because walker had ultimately gotten his freedom had put wynton kresge in mind of his essential problem he was not what he wanted to be which was a cop he would be a cop in des moines he would be a cop in cape girardeau missouri in sandwich illinois hed be a cop taking tolls on the interstate if they let him spend a good portion of the time cruising around in a soupedup fourbarrel dodge tagging speeders and hunting down child molesters and stopping duis what was ironic no what was bitterly mean was that every day kresge got résumés from cops all over the country from real cops they wanted to work for him dear sir as a law enforcement officer of ten years standing i am seeking a position in private security services and would like to be considered for any position you might have open knock me upside the head i mean this is too much kresge would have dropped down on his massive linebacker knees to kiss the police academy graduation ring of any one of those applicants and trade jobs in a minute gold shields gla supervisors opscoordinators portable patrolmen cs technicians they all wanted to sit in kresges cracked leather chair and swivel back and forth and spend the three hours between start of business and lunch deciding how to allocate guards for the homecoming game and what did wynton kresge want to do but walk a beat he wanted to drive an rmp remote mobile patrol a squad car to everybody else kresge had learned this he wanted to kick in doors of murder suspects he wanted to pin drug dealers up against jagged brick walls and scream at them wheres the stash was that what they called it hed learned a lot but there was much he had not learned he had a very real problem however wynton kresges first goal in life was to be a cop but his other goal was to make sure his salary exceeded his age he now made fiftythree thousand dollars a year being fortytwo he was proud of this accomplishment he was therefore in the loop hooked hung up wynton kresge received a salary not unattainable by senior detectives or police administrators in large cities but a complete rainbow for a rookie itd be back to school at no pay then a grunt pulling twenty twentyfive even with overtime kresge alone would be able to cope with a career change of that magnitude kresge married might be able to but not wynton kresge father of seven he loved cops but he also loved being a good father he thought about reeducating them he thought about having a family conference and telling them they were going to have to buckle down dad was about to take a fifty percent cut in salary and become a cop man he could taste the silence in the living room after dropping that news so he watched miami vice reruns and led his men in drills for dealing with students whod gone ed the cop word for emotionally disturbed and with demonstrators who might try to burn down the stadium none so far and he kept his thirteenshot mm automatic loaded and ready on his hip waiting for the chance to draw down on a crazed assaultriflewielding sniper none of them either picking him off from fifty yards on the knoll of the quad this was all wynton kresge had for police work this and thinking a lot about the murders of jennie gebben and emily rossiter which is what he had been doing most of this hot afternoon he now walked to his desk and balanced a book on his hand then flipped it lightly in the air as if he were tossing a coin to help him make a choice that was in fact exactly what he was doing and when he caught the book cover up kresge walked abruptly out of his office she died two weeks ago tonight it took me all of fourteen days to lose the case corde spent five minutes looking for change in front of the vending machines waiting for the jolts of anger that never came he dropped in thirtyfive cents and pushed coffee milk and sugar the steaming liquid poured in a loud stream into a fragile cardboard cup it sounded exactly like a man taking a leak tt ebbans walked up next to him digging in his pockets corde held out a handful of change ebbans picked out some and bought himself a reeses peanut butter cup im sorry bill corde sipped the coffee it tasted salty the machines spigot dispensed both coffee and chicken bouillon thiss real bushwah i dont know whats going on whatd ribbon say im off the case hes going to fight the inquest but i hardly believe him he didnt fight worth diddly to keep me from getting the boot the burnt letters yup did anybody see you take them they have a witness any fingerprints whats their probable cause corde said were at the witchhunt stage now tt the due process comes later after my names been drug through the dirt after they find out about st louis when itll be too late when ebbans spoke again after a pause the flinch in his voice was unmistakable hammerback ordered me to look into every escape and recent release from the hospital at gunderson ive heard this before corde shook his head ebbans continued yep and then talk to school counselors and psychiatrists in town here and see if they had any patients with you know dangerous tendencies they wont say anything its all privileged hammerback oughta know that there was some mention of it in a book that ribbon keeps loaning to people corde pointed in the general direction of blackfoot pond well emily was jennies roommate its pretty damn odd for a cult killer to pick her for the second victim wouldnt you say i just tell what i been told i know that tt ebbans took a long time staring at the copy of the register sitting in the lunchroom the front page had a headline terror continues with stapleton girl cult threat whats that he asked pointing to the story turned out to be the boyfriend she dumped but the paper had to you know put it in terms of the moon killer damn good god damn well the cases yours now tt i told you what i found most recent about jennie having that girlfriend and a fight with somebody who wasnt too happy about it and about them maybe getting killed because they were gay oh and dont forget gilchrist he could tell us some good stuff about jennie i dont know word is we gotta concentrate a hundred percent on the cult thing forget the university connection forget her personal life thosere orders corde closed his eyes for a moment rubbed them son of a gun thiss great first i lose the investigation then its forget the school then they dont want to hear that the victim mightve had a girlfriend i dont know whats going on tt the biggest problem in this case isnt the killer its us its the good guys seems that way corde poured the coffee out then said you know i was thinking youre in a tough spot hows that lets say its what you and me think that its not a psycho thatll mean a lot of wasted time and a lot of panic and news stories about the departments going in the wrong direction youre walking point on this whole case well thats true bill i hope you wont be offended if i tell you that if it turns out right youll be in the catbirds seat and more power to you but with ellison and ribbon right beside you especially come november i hear what youre saying but i just want to get that guy whoever he is thats all i care about im no good at this politics stuff its like peoplere using those girls deaths for themselves theyre twisting things around makes me sick ebbans finished his candy and rolled the wrapper into a tiny wad pitched it out he looked around and said in a low voice i know youre off the case and everything and youll be doing a bangup job keeping the roads free of gindrunk felons but since youre giving me all your notes and leads its only fair i give you something in return whats that i told you somebody put the kibosh on the school side of the case the order came from ribbon and hammerback but you know where they got the word sure yeah i know corde grimaced dean larraby nope ebbans said it was a friend of yours randy sayles corde considered this well well well thats nice to know but you didnt hear me say that ebbans touched his ear deaf as a mounted trout as he walked out of the vending room bill corde stepped right into the broad form of wynton kresge oh sorry corde said pleasantly and smiled before he remembered he was mad at the security chief kresge blinked and started to smile back before he recalled he too was mad he ignored corde and turned back to where hed been standing in jim slocums doorway holding a book open and pointing to a passage yessir chief slocum was saying to kresge weve pretty much got it under control but i appreciate your concern what im saying is you ought to read this kresge sounded like he was arguing with a belligerent waitress slocum said formally weve got ourselves a pretty demanding situation chief as you can well imagine corde left the office he got into his squad car and started the engine wynton kresge came out and walked towards his olds which was parked two empty spaces from cordes cruiser kresges was nicelooking new everybody seemed to have a new car but corde kresge flung the book into the front seat then opened the door he got in and started the engine the two men sat twenty feet apart in their cars staring straight ahead as their engines idled a very strained bill corde shut off the engine paused a moment then walked over to kresge talk to you kresge shut off his engine and got out he stood up taller than corde many pounds heavier corde said about last week what i want to say is im sorry at first i didnt think you were right and ill tell you it didnt have anything to do with you being who you are or anything like that but maybe i was the way you said and if i was i apologize there was a moment of fierce silence and corde couldnt think of anything to do but stick out his hand kresge looked down and seemed boxed into a corner he took the hand and shook it firmly then released it im badtempered sometimes i get kind of caught up in these cases they can be frustrating i understand that he nodded with a grimace toward the sheriffs department what were you doing there kresge fished the book out of the front seat finished this today im not saying im an expert but i think youre looking for the wrong guy corde looked at the spine psychotic functioning individuals volume three criminal behavior listen up kresge opened the book found an underlined paragraph and read in a study of psychopathic and sociopathic here used synonymously homicides in england scotland and northern ireland conducted from to we irvine harrington concluded that the number of homicides that are in fact astrologically or astronomically driven are exceedingly rare of the eightynine psychopathic murderers convicted of their crimes only one was in fact motivated to commit murder on the night of the full moon in extensive interviews and examinations of records in the mans hometown of manchester it was learned that he had been killing animals and human victims indiscriminately as often as five times a year for the past fifteen years always on the night of the full moon he had no sexual contact with his victims and indeed found such thoughts abhorrent on the other hand scotland yard reported that for the years through the present the only years for which such data are available as many as ten murders per year are committed on the nights of full moons under the guise of psychopathic episodes when the criminals true motives for the killing are revenge robbery rape and organizedcrime expediency you just read them that corde nodded toward the office tried they werent interested you mind if i borrow it make a copy of some of it its kind of a jawful and id like to read it slow itll be overdue day after tomorrow ill do it myself tonight after a moment corde asked if you dont think its a psycho who would you be looking for nobodys been much interested in my opinion tell me just for the hell of it kresge said at first i was pretty sure it was the girls lover a professor or a student you should see all of what goes on here on campus young people on their own doing whatever they want fair game for the professors men and women i ought to tell you so that was my original thought but that was before kresges hand rose in a straightarm salute then closed into a fist he looked at corde expectantly im sorry kresge said you know the knife so now i figure it was a kid maybe some punk uhhuh corde nodded absently then said what knife i come in peace kresges hand rose and closed again from a land that is here and yet not here uhhuh what are you talking about didnt you see the lost dimension corde said he hadnt the movie it was at the duplex a couple months ago i dont remember corde was thinking of some film with creatures that had red eyes oh wait was that the one with these snake things yeah the honons they were battling the naryans in the lost dimension but whats he lifted his hand and closed his fist its the naryan salute kresge snorted a baritone laugh dont you remember nup you mean you guys dont know about the knife back there in that bag the cult knife i saw it on the deputys desk kresge pointed that symbol on the knife its from the movie you really didnt know did you corde lifted his fingers to his eyes i dont believe it he turned toward the department hell i gotta tell em but he stopped abruptly staring at the ancient town hall he sucked on the inside of his cheek for a moment wynton you want to go for a ride i guess can we go in the squad car sure only i cant use the siren thats okay they arrived at the toy store just as it was closing together the two large men strode to the door kresge stood awkwardly with his hands on his hips while corde knocked after a moment the owner appeared can you open up owen important im closed bill its suppertime open her up we gotta talk to you business couldnt you call me official owen the heavyset mustachioed man in a plaid shirt and blue jeans opened the door the store was dim costumes and helmets and monster masks lining the wall made the place seem as eerie as a wax museum at night some toy at the far end of the store gave off red dots of light corde looked around and flicked on a light he squinted and walked to a rack he spotted just behind owen he stared at thirty stilettos just like the one found under jennie gebben what are these what do you think they are as if corde had asked who was george washington owen he said theyre naryan lost dimension survival knives whats that symbol owen sighed thats the insignia of the naryan empire he extended his hand the way kresge had done i come in peace from corde said yeah yeah i know the movie company makes em they license somebody in china or korea to make them they sell all kinds of things helmets xaser guns dimensional cloaks scarves all that stuff in the movie kresge said he doesnt remember the movie he doesnt owen asked like ninja turtles a few years ago tshirts toys tieins theyre called how many of these knives have you sold theyre a bestseller corde glanced at kresge and said i somehow figured they might be how many owen said thats i think my third merch rack why has to do with an investigation oh corde pulled out a pen and handed it and a stack of blank threebyfive cards to owen he asked could you give me the names of everybody youve sold one of those knives to youre kidding owen laughed then looked at kresge hes kidding kresge said no i dont think hes kidding owens smile faded practically every kid in new lebanon bought one itd take me an hour to remember half of them then you better get started aw bill its suppertime the sooner you write the sooner you eat owen bill corde parked the squad car in the lot next to the fivefoothigh logo of the fredericksberg register the name in the elaborate hundredyearold typeface as it appeared on the papers masthead he and wynton kresge got out of the car and walked into the advertising office the girl behind the counter snapped her gum once and hid it somewhere in her mouth hi gentlemen help you corde said last week i called about running an ad as part of an investigation down in new lebanon oh that girl that was killed i heard there was another one too did i talk to you no thatd be my boss juliette frink shes left for the day but i can take the order how long you want it run a week i think what size corde looked at samples of ads under a faded plexiglas sheet covering the counter what do you think wynton kresge said may as well go pretty big wouldnt you think corde pointed to one i guess that size she looked thats two columns by seventyfive agates she wrote it down what section of the paper would you like oh i hadnt thought front page we dont have ads on the front page well i dont know whats the bestread section comics first then sports corde said i dont think we can run an ad like this on the comic pages kresge said but sports you might lose women you know the clerk said i read the sports page how about the same page as the movie ads kresge said that sounds good corde said she wrote it up juliette said you get a publicservice discount thatll be four hundred eightyfour dollars and seventy cents then you want us to typeset it for you thatll be another twentyfive dollars you have cuts cuts corde blinked he was thinking of the thin slash the rope had made on jennifer gebbens throat the fishhook embedded in emily rossiter pictures i mean oh no just words he wrote out copy for the ad corde pulled out his wallet and handed her his visa card she took it and stepped away to approve the charge what is it kresge said you pay then get reimbursed corde snickered i guess you oughta know i was just relieved of duty kresge frowned severe creases into his wide face man they fired you suspended why they claim i took some letters out of jennies room did you kresge asked but so innocently that corde laughed no he said hardly seems fair he said you mean youre paying for this ad yourself yup he wasnt though it turned out the clerk embarrassed returned sorry officer they kind of said youre over the limit they wouldnt approve it she handed the card back to him corde felt the immediate need to explain but that would involve telling her a long story about two children one with primary reading retardation and a psychiatrist and a new frigidaire and roll after roll of owenscorning attic insulation and a boy coming up on college in a few years uh he looked for a solution in the back of the cluttered advertising department kresge said miss auden has an account here right the university yessir the student affairs office ads for plays and sports i was to the homecoming game last fall that third quarter ill remember that all my life yesm that was a game and a half kresge said can you put these on the school account you work for the school yes maam kresge said i do he pulled out his identification card ill authorize it thiss official school business she rummaged under the counter and pulled out a form just sign this requisition here fourth and twelve on the ohio state forty did ladowski punt no sir and it wasnt even a bomb but a handoff to flemming ran all the way zippityzip while im about it kresge said run that ad for two weeks and put a border around it like that one there you got it thats real good of you wynton corde said i do appreciate it people keep forgetting kresge said quietly they were my girls too corde spent the evening talking to the parents of boys whod bought naryan dimensional stilettos he was easygoing and jokey and careful to put them at ease no no we dont suspect todd sammie billie albert not hardly why hes in science club with jamie im just he would tell them getting information they nodded gravely and answered all his questions and smiled at his jokes but they were scared men and women alike they were scared the second killing had proved the cult theory the words that corde had spoken to chubby gail lynn holcomb had been proved utterly false they did have something to be scared of as far as the good citizens of new lebanon were concerned satan himself had arrived with two murders to his name and more on his mind corde went from house to house and listened to parents without exception account for every minute of each boys whereabouts on the night of april a feat possible corde knew as a father only if every man and woman he talked to had turned psychic he saw through much of the smoke of course but still found no leads long about midnight corde noticed a dusty drawer somewhere in his mind it seemed to contain sheriffs department regulations and he believed when he peered into it that he saw something about officers who continue to engage in police work when suspended being guilty of impersonating sheriffs deputies he peered further and saw the word misdemeanor though his mind was often very dark and the word might actually have been felony corde felt suddenly pummeled by fatigue he returned home a county deputy toms replacement for the evening sat in the driveway corde thanked him and sent him home and then went into the house his children were asleep in their rooms his wife too corde was grateful for that he wasnt looking forward to telling diane that hed been suspended the next morning he was up early he kissed diane dodged a chance to give her the hard news and slipped out for a secret meeting with tt ebbans they rendezvoused outside the sheriffs department on the hardpacked dirt the deputies sometimes used for impromptu basketball games they both felt like spies or undercover narcs padding around out of sight of the departments grimy windows corde told him about the knife and ebbans slapped his head doggone i saw that movie sod i tt and ill bet every deputy in there did too hell he said in a whisper ill bet ribbons even got the comic book i talked to maybe thirty people last night heres the list and my notes nothing real helpful ebbans took the sheet watch yourself bill corde tapped his holster i dont mean that you forget youre suspended this things too important to leave to ribbon you got what i asked you for ebbans handed corde a plastic bag containing the green computerized accounting ledger that theyd found in the burnt oil drum dont lose it bill im taking a chance as it is i think ive found me an expert who can help i also looked into the gilchrist angle forget about it he flew out to san francisco to read some paper on saturday before jennie was murdered and he was still out there when emily was killed i dont think hes back even yet you might want to talk to him though he might know some of jennies boyfriends or girlfriends maybe ill ask him on the sly ebbans added weve pulled up with a stitch on this mentalpatient stuff and the occult bookstore leads are going nowhere this whole cult thing is looking thin as october ice i think we oughta tell hammerback and ribbon hold up a while corde said gravely next thing you know youll be off the case too and jim slocumll be our new investigator in charge hey now said ebbans brightly thatd give us a chance to read miranda to werewolves and vampires mrs corde hello my name is ben breck diane held the phone warily from the mans cheerful voice she suspected a salesman yes im from the auden university lab school you were speaking to the admissions department about a tutor it turned out that he was a salesman of sorts but diane listened anyway breck was selling something pretty interesting im a visiting professor from the university of chicago i noticed your daughters application for admission to the special education department and how much are you going to cost doctor visiting professor from the big city a hundred an hour two our daughters seeing resa parker a psychiatrist in town she recommended we find a special ed tutor i know of dr parker breck then added ive done a lot of tutoring and i thought i might be able to help you dr breck i appreciate your call but money beg pardon youre worried about the fees at auden and i dont blame you one bit theyre outrageous i wouldnt pay them myself my my a doctor with a sense of humor how refreshing it is one of my considerations diane admitted well i think youll find me fairly reasonable i charge twenty dollars an hour breck named a figure that two weeks earlier would have paled diane now she felt as if shed pocketed found money thats all i do ask to use the results of your daughters progress in my research anonymously of course im scheduled to publish my findings in the american journal of psychology and im doing a book to help teachers recognize the problems of learning disabled children well i dont know i hope youll think about it mrs corde from the application it looks like your sarah has a lot of potential diane said youve worked with students like sarah before hundreds in the majority of cases weve cut the gap between reading and chronological age by fifty percent sometimes more what are these techniques feedback monitoring behavioral techniques nothing revolutionary no drugs or medical treatment sarah doesnt do well with medicine shes had some bad reactions to ritalin i dont do any of that well diane said ill discuss it with my husband i hope to hear from you i think sarah and i can help each other a great deal seven days till the halfmoon do you know where your is tt ebbans walked into the new lebanon sheriffs department glancing at the sign and asked who put that up jim slocum looked up from that days copy of the register and said i did could you please take it down sure didnt mean anything just thought itd be kind of a reminder for morale you know ebbans sat down at his desk on it were fifteen letters from people who claimed they knew who the killer was because they had dreamed about it eight of them or had psychic visions of his identity four or had been contacted in a seance by the victims two the remaining correspondence was from a man who explained that in a former life he had known jack the ripper whose spirit had materialized in a condominium development outside of higgins there were also twentynine phone messages about the case the first two calls ebbans returned were to disconnected phones and the third was a mans recorded voice describing how much he loved sucking cock ebbans hung up and gave the rest of the messages to slocum and told him to check them out cordes news about the knife had both elated and depressed him it had cheered him up because it was a solid lead and like any cop hed take a single piece of hard evidence any day over a dozen psychics or a weeks worth of the most clever speculation the news had also depressed ebbans because it meant the line of the investigation he had inherited was looking pretty abysmal cordes warning about ebbans walking point which hed discounted at first came back to him ribbon wasnt pleased with the register story that morning cult weapon in auden death is movie toy the sheriff had said coolly guess your boys shouldve checked that out to start my boys ebbans returned to a stack of discharge reports from a mental hospital in higgins ten minutes later the door swung open and a man in blue jeans and a work shirt stood uneasily in the doorway ebbans frowned trying to place him it took a minute the red hat man without the hat detective come on in the man said what it is i just thought youd like to know you asked me about those boys i seen the night that girl was killed the boys by the pond i was leaving the lake and just now one of them was back he had his tackle but he wasnt fishing he was just walking around looking at things would he be the moon killer ebbans stood up and said he out there now was when i left miller come on you and mere taking a ride so like whats the reason why is this guy your friend jano didnt have any answers philip was a freak he was fat and had bad skin not zits which everybody had even steve snelling who could have any girl he wanted it was more that philips skin was dirty behind his ear it was always gray and his clothes were hardly ever clean he smelled bad and forget about sports no way could he even play softball let along gymnastics jano remembered how his friend had strained to get up on the parallel bars and he had watched horrified as the wood rods sagged almost to breaking point under the weight why were they friends this afternoon jano was walking around blackfoot pond holding the gray chipped tackle box and the rod and reel tracing steps trying not to think about that terrible night of april he felt bad not depressed but fearful almost panicked he felt as if a screaming honon warrior in an invisible dimensional cloak was racing toward him from behind preparing to leap closer closer closer to tear him apart janos heart galloped in his chest heating his blood as it pumped and he felt terror spatter him like a spray of hot water like a spray of come he pictured the girl lying in the mud her white fingers curled her eyes mostly open her bare feet with their long toes no no no shes not an actress in a movie thirty feet high on the screen in the mall she is exactly what she is pretty heavy smelling of mint smelling of grass and spicy flowers she is still she does not breathe she is dead jano shuddered feeling the honon troops circling around him and found he was staring at the crushed muddy blue flowers at his feet he thought of philip drowning the other girl holding her down and what was he jano going to do now who could he talk to nobody the panic crested and he sucked in air frantically eventually he calmed why is he your friend well he and phathar did talk about sci fi a lot and movies and girls for a guy who never dated philip was an expert on sex a walking dictionary of terms that every fifteenyearold should know he told jano how gay guys shoved their fists up each others asses and how you could tell whether a girl was a virgin by the way she bent over to tie her shoes but jano decided that their most common bond was how much they hated their fathers phathar was scared of his and that made plenty of sense because the old man was a total hatter one halloween philips dad had come into the yard sneaking up behind trickortreaters carrying bloody cows intestines in his arms hed just stood staring at the totally freaked kids but janos father was worse he was like a honon warrior hiding in a dimensional cloak passing through the house as if jano didnt exist sneaking past looking at his son oddly then vanishing the dimensional warp swelling out out out finally bursting into the now the here all that purple energy of the naryan realm flooding onto the earth the movie had had a happy ending jano didnt think this life would he climbed to the top of the dam and then dropped onto his knees he leaned forward looking at his gray reflection in the still water he didnt like water that was so still it made him look like death his thin face he lowered his head to the water he wondered what it was like to breathe water instead of air look at that jano you ever touched a girl there you ever tasted a girl he stared at the water he could smell its oily sourness you ever fucked a girl jano by lowering his head another two inches he could taste the water he could lick it the same way that phathar gave him the opportunity to taste the girls cold mouth her tongue her cunt he could swallow the water he could swallow her hide in her forever a princess excuse me young man the voice was like a chill downpour on his back he leapt up i talk to you for a minute the deputy was tall and very thin janos mouth was dry as summer pavement he swung his tongue back and forth between his sticky teeth and didnt say anything whats your name i didnt do anything id just like to talk to you the deputy was smiling but janod seen that smile before and didnt believe it a lying smile the same smile his father kept on his face i understand you and a friend were fishing here at night about ten days ago jano couldnt speak he found his skin was contracting with terror and he imagined that his bowl of thick hair was vibrating visibly other footsteps sounded behind him he turned lance miller grinned and said to him hey how you doing jano didnt answer the other cop looked at miller and said you know him sure tt miller said thiss bill cordes son didnt you introduce yourself jamie with panic in his voice randy sayles said i have a lecture he said its nowr never a lecture professor the departmental secretary said im only reporting to you what he said shit professor theres no need to be vulgar he sat at his desk at nine oclock in the morning gripping the telephone receiver in his hand as if he were trying to squeeze out an answer to the dilemma sayless last lecture of the year was scheduled to begin in one hour it was set against the centennial celebrations throughout the us in the climax was a spellbinding account his students not his review of the ouster massacre for him to miss this particular class was obscene this fucko fundraising crap had totally disrupted his teaching and he was torrid with rage he said tell him to hold he dialed the dean her secretary said she was out shit yes no yes no sayles said into the receiver okay ill see him get darby to take over for me the students will be disappointed youre the one who told me it was now or never she said i was only get darby sayles banged the phone down and ran from his office hurrying to his car as he roared out of the professors parking lot he laid down two streaks of simmering rubber as if he were a sixteenyearold in a stolen vette he paced across the gold carpet staring down at the stain made by the cola sarah spilled the night emily was murdered oh bill it doesnt mean im fired i still draw pay what were these letters who knows we found ash we found scraps he looked up at his wife before diane did something she dreaded her eyes grew very wide astonishingly wide and dark as night this happened now bill corde waited a moment as if taking his temperature the sense of betrayal never arrived and he said finally i didnt take them no he couldnt tell how she meant the word was she agreeing or disputing him she asked they dont know about st louis do they i never told them he did not tell her that jennie gebben had known she nodded i should see about a job i told you im not fired i im just thinking out loud this is something well theres nothing wrong with that this is something we have to talk about she continued but they didnt talk about it not then at any rate because at that moment a squad car pulled into the driveway corde leaned against the glass he smelled ammonia after a long moment the front door of the car opened its tt hes got somebody with him in the back whats he doing transporting a prisoner ebbans climbed out of the squad car and unlocked the back door jamie slowly stepped out halbert strumm who lived in an unincorporated enclave of harrison county known as millfield creek had made his fortune in animal byproducts turning bone and organ into house plant supplements marked up a thousand times strumm would say with sincerity and drama that it brightened some stiff geldings last walk up the ramp to know he was going to be sprinkled lovingly on a tame philodendron overlooking park avenue in new york city it was comments like this that kept strumm held in contempt or ridicule by all the people who worked for him and most of the people who knew him although he had not attended auden university strumm and his wife bettye had embraced the school as their adoptive charity their generosity however was largely conditional and they invariably looked for an element of bargain in their giving off shot a check for a thousand dollars if they got subscription seats to the concert series five hundred a stadium box five thousand a trip to the sudan on a dig with archeology students made wildly uncomfortable by the couples rollicking presence now randy sayles pulling into the strumms driveway was not sure if the couple was going to like the deal he was about to propose strumm a huge man bald and broad with massive hands led sayles into his greenhouse and there they stood amid a thousand plants that seemed no healthier than those in sayless own backyard garden which did not gobble down the earthly remains of elderly animals there was an injustice in this that depressed sayles immensely hal we have a problem and we need your help money thats why youve come its why you always come youre right sayles leaned hard into the abuse im not going to deny it hal but you understand what auden does for this town were in danger of losing the school strumm frowned and nipped off a tendril of green from a viney plant that serious weve already drafted severance letters to the staff my word nip we need some money and we need your help youve always been generous in the past you know professor im in a generous mood today sayless heart beat with a resounding pressure he heard the hum of blood speeding through his temple i might just be inclined to help you out do i assume youre talking about some serious bucks i am thats true you know i went to a state school sayles said i didnt know but thats okay of course its fucking okay strumm barked we didnt have a good team we had a terrible team i always thought if i had it to do over again id go to a school that had a good team auden has a pretty good team its got a nice stadium sayles said it did that was true modeled on soldier field in chicago that a fact ive had a dream in my life strumm said a man gets older and he starts to think about his dreams more and more happens to all of us one of my dreams has been to make a lot of money well you certifiably crazy old cocksucker you sure have done that anothers to give some of it to a school like auden are you playing with me or is this for real and in exchange spit it out theyd build a football stadium in my honor you see i had my chance and i didnt seize it so the next best thing would be to have a stadium named after me well hal we have the stadium already named after barnes who was he one of our graduates in the s a philanthropist he set up an endowment thats still in effect so that means youre not inclined to change the name of the stadium its in the terms of the endowment theres nothing we can do about it strumm studied a sickly plant and sprinkled on its leaves something out of a package labeled strumms extra extra what sayles wondered the businessman said well enough said of that ive had another dream ive always wanted a reactor named after me a nuclear reactor at champaignurbana i think it is theyve got a research reactor named after somebody i thought that would be almost as good as a stadium hal we dont need a reactor we dont have a science department to speak of were mostly liberal arts what was in the whiteandyellow packages old horses old pigs strumm shit id write you boys a check for two hundred thousand dollars if you built a reactor and named it after me sayles said quietly hal we need three and a half million nip that much hum i couldnt come close to that been a bad year for the company economys down people get rid of plants first thing to go im not recessionproof like everybody says audens going to close even if i had a stadium and a reactor both i couldnt come up with much more than a quarter million we can name a chair after you a building weve got a couple buildings you could have your pick threehundreds the top maybe for a vet school i could go up to threefifty but thatd be the end of it we dont want a vet school hal well there you have it nip sayles drove at seventy miles an hour all the way back to the campus his car came to rest partially over the curb of the parking lot he ran through the corridors of the arts and sciences building and stopped in front of the door to his lecture hall composing himself and listening to glenn darbys voice explain about sayless absence he caught his breath then pushed the doors open and strode confidently down the long aisle to the podium he was halfway there when the class realized he had returned and broke into applause which grew ever louder rolling and rolling then was joined by whistles and shouts by the time he was on the podium clipping on his lavaliere mike the applause had became a standing ovation and it was five minutes before he was able to quiet the students then barely holding back tears randy sayles began to speak resonantly and impassioned delivering what might very well be his last lecture at auden or for that matter his last lecture at any university corde was no longer pacing he sat on the couch slouched down and grim and diane was sitting in a straightbacked chair nearby she held her hands in her lap jamie corde sat between his mother and father he looked shrunken son this is pretty serious i dont need to tell you that i didnt do anything tt said you told him you were at the pond by yourself the night the gebben girl was killed i was i was just fishing by myself is all diane said honey please her eyes were on a studded milkglass candy dish and it was impossible to tell if she was speaking to father or son jamie we want to believe you its just that tt talked to a couple of people say they saw two boys and you fit the description of one of them so you dont believe me you think im lying this was a matteroffact announcement he wouldnt hold cordes eyes which was okay with corde because he would sure have trouble looking back into his boys son we need to know what happened i dont remember where you were that night i jamie leaned forward how would you know where i was any night diane said sternly dont talk to your he continued where was i last night two nights ago how the hell would you have any idea his mother rebuked young man but there was no edge to her words the boy was quiet for a moment then he said i went fishing i was there by myself a felony investigator corde had a dozen tricks he could try to drag the real story out of the boy bluffs and traps and intimidations hed learned them from his journals and seminars and bulletins hed practiced them in his continuing education courses hed tried them out on car thieves and burglars he couldnt bring himself to use them now he was crying out for the truth but he wanted it only one way were you fishing by the dam not so close to the dam up a ways in somebodys yard ive told you youre not to trespass there jamie didnt answer corde asked did you see the girl or anyone else that you hadnt recognized before no i just fished then i came home why didnt you tell me any of this before you knew i was on the case because i was there alone and i didnt see anything what was there to say jamie please the boy looked away im going to my room jamie corde scooted forward on the couch and touched his sons knee the boy remained unresponsive corde asked the question hed been putting off the other night wednesday you werent home either were you diane said bill what are you asking jamie kept his eyes on his father he wants to know my whereabouts the night the second girl was killed thats what hes asking corde said wait a minute son you cant treat this so light tt and steve are going to want to talk to you jamie walked casually out of the living room cordes face went bright red with fury and he stood then he sat slowly on the couch again diane said you know he didnt have anything to do with it i know he was there corde looked at her miserably and i know hes lying to me thats all i know dear sarah she read the note again but had trouble because of the voices from the other room something was going on with jamie her brother scared her some at times she idolized him when for instance he would include her in what he was doing like repeating jokes to make sure she got the punch line or taking her along when he went shopping at the mall but other times hed look at her like she wasnt even in this world as if he was looking through her he would get all dark and secretish in jamies dresser sarah had found magazines filled with pictures of women without any clothes on and a lot of copies of fantagore movie scenes of monsters and people being stabbed or cut up she guessed her father had found the magazines and that was why they were fighting she tried to ignore them now and turned back to her immediate problem which was what should she give to the sunshine man she wanted him to have something special something personal from her but when she tried to think of a present her mind went blank maybe she could the sounds from the next room grew louder jamie was mad and her parents spoke in grim voices it was the way they had talked when grandpa got sick in the middle of the night and went to the hospital and then didnt come home ever again then the voices finally stopped and she heard jamie go into his room and close the door and she heard music start up the soundtrack from that science fiction movie hed seen three or four times what would the sunshine man like when her parents went to parties her mother always took a cake or something like that but sarah didnt know how to bake she looked around the room surveying her toys videotapes a dozen stuffed animals ah that seemed like a good choice because he had made redford t bedford fly out to the circle of stones two weeks ago it was pretty clear that he liked animals and they liked him she picked one a small cinnamon bear that her mother had named chutney she put a pink scarf around chutneys neck and then carried him to the window and together they looked out over the backyard she took the note from her pocket this time she read it out loud so that the bear could hear what the sunshine man had written to her dear sarah meet me tomorrow at our magic stones be there at three oclock dont tell anyone ill make sure you never have to go to school ever again dean larraby said i suspect you have two minds about it brian okun said well of course what can i say hes my boss ive learned more about literature from him than from anyone i respect him immensely the dean continued he was in san francisco when the murders were committed so the rumor that he was involved in the girls deaths well theres no foundation to that you mean leon was a suspect the police you know how it is fools but im not concerned about the deaths the question is whether professor gilchrist was dating either jennie gebben or emily rossiter do you know if he was intimate with either of them is that what you asked me here about youre the one hes closest to okun shook his head but if hes not a suspect the deans square matronly face turned to okun this was her pose of sincerity but she spoke with menace i think the most despicable misuse of power is for a professor to seduce his students i agree one hundred percent but i dont believe it for a minute about professor gilchrist in fact the only rumors i heard were about him and jennie nothing about emily so you did hear something he paused his eyes evasive with embarrassment but you cant believe campus gossip if he was sleeping with her ill have him dismissed at once of course the temptations there he lives alone you know hes a recluse okun shook his head no what am i saying no as far as i know he never dated her the voice lowered there was some talk you know that he was a well homosexual the south surfaced in both grimace and inflection thats nearly as bad she muttered as bayad okun deliberated for a moment i yes he shook his head i was going to suggest something but it doesnt really seem supportable please say it well okuns voice faded and his eyes landed on the deans diploma university of kentucky chabm school she said i hope you feel your first loyalty is to auden he sighed dean im as concerned about this as you are to be blunt ive invested a lot of time and effort in leon i have nothing but respect for him and i want to see him vindicated i want the opportunity to prove hes innocent let me check around his office see if i can find something about jennie maybe a note from her maybe an entry in his desk calendar if i cant well lets just accept that this was a tragic rumor if i do i promise ill show it to you and you can make your own decision thats very courageous of you its not courageous at all this schools been good to me i owe auden a great deal okun paused the only thing is yes well id be taking a big risk this would be well spying he extended his palms and laughed at the plebian word leon would fire me in a minute if he found out id looked through his personal things if he was sleeping with jennie wed dismiss him hed be no threat to you but if he wasnt sleeping with her you stupid bitch that he added delicately is the only time when it would be a risk of course the dean debated and okun watched her thoughts stroll to where his were impatiently waiting she said there would be a simple way of protecting you youve applied for a teaching position here havent you subject to the acceptance of my dissertation of course i could talk to the appointments committee i couldnt guarantee much of a salary im a scholar okun said money is irrelevant through the window came a buzz of an old lawn mower a breeze was blowing but he could detect no scent of cut grass okun looked at the worker moving like a drone he felt abject pity for the mans unimaginative life a mass of dull years utterly without the cocaine of intellect the dean asked coyly have we just agreed to something a quote of nietzsches came to mind okun rewrote it slightly and was pleased with the result man is the only animal that makes promises and fulfills threats after a sleepless night corde drove jamie to the sheriffs department redeyed and ragged with anger and exhaustion corde had sat silently in the car jamie however was talkative almost flighty as if the two of them were going fishing in fact he seemed happier than if they were going fishing it made cordes anger boil harder he remembered the way his sons eyes used to brighten when corde took him for an unauthorized ride in the squad car a delight jamie had had no desire to experience in the last few years corde glanced at him then back to the road somewhere deep in his son he eagerly believed was cordes own fundamental manner which is why he felt so often that words were unnecessary between them and now it hurt oh it hurt to see the boy wall this nature up as well as he did secure as a hogtied prisoner with this chatter corde didnt say a single word all the fivemile drive to the sheriffs department tt ebbans said hello bill hi jamie miller waved uneasily to both of them corde looked at the astrological chart on the wall prominently taped above slocums desk then nodded to both men through the doorway of ribbons office corde saw ribbon and charlie mahoney the family representative talking the sheriff glanced up saw jamie then walked over to the others mahoney hung in the doorway there was a long moments silence then corde said jamie tells me he was alone that evening ebbans was nodding he had on his face a smile that meant nothing well he began and fell silent no one spoke ribbon stared intensely at the boy corde studied the floor jamie ebbans finally continued we just want to ask you a few questions you dont mind do you no sir why dont we go into the back office the boy looked at his father and started after ebbans corde followed ribbon said bill just a minute he stopped ebbans and jamie disappeared through the door neither looked back best wait here bill id like to be with my boy he didnt say anything ribbon asked in a low voice he says he was alone didnt see the girl or anybody do you think hes lying corde looked into ribbons eyes no now if youll excuse me ribbon touched his arm we talked about it bill we think its better if youre not there hes a minor ive got a right to be present during cordes voice faded and ribbon verbalized cordes sudden thought hes not a suspect bill were just treating him like a witness i ribbon shook his head its better for the investigation and better for you not to be in there we want to avoid any you know appearances of impropriety corde turned toward the door thinking how easy it would be to lift ribbons hand off his arm and walk out of the office and into the room where jamie was what he did was to take off his hat and drop it on a nearby desk steve ribbon stepped away stood for a minute looking out the window then said weve got to go fishing one of these days corde said softly you bet steve you little shit charlie mahoney walked slowly around jamie mahoney was impressed the boy wasnt crying he decided hed have to try harder youre a fucking liar i know it your father knows it and you know it i was by myself jamie looked at the door deputy ebbans had left a few minutes ago to get cokes jamie was just now catching on that he wasnt coming back oh cut the crap what do you think this is like breaking curfew you think youre gonna get fucking grounded for this you think theyre going to take away your allowance im talking prison im talking about hard time up in warwick youre how old sixteen fifteen jamie said now the boys voice was quivering youre fifteen now but by the time you come to trial me his voice cracked youll be sixteen and theyll send you into the adult wing thats it kid youre fucked and he was starting to cry i didnt do it i swear i didnt mahoney sat and leaned forward you dont know jack shit you little prick jack shit weve gotta find somebody and cause we dont have anybody else as far as im concerned that somebody is you jamie wiped his face wheres my father he said he was leaving no he said he was going to be here with me he just said that to get you in here he told us youre lying jamie looked at the door his teeth touched and he breathed hotly he did not he said you lied to him and youd lie to us he didnt say that he wouldnt who the hell were you with you have a daisy chain going pulling each others dicks im not a homo youre not then you wouldnt mind a little pussy a pretty girl walking by herself a pretty little college girl were you the one that came all over her the tears were thick i didnt do anything how many times did you see the movie what movie mahoney leaned forward and screamed will you cut out this bullshit how many times did you see the lost dimension jamie looked down and picked at a ragged fingernail a couple i dont know mahoney said slowly you know your father gave us some of your shorts ones youd been wearing while you were beating off weve got samples of your come were going to match it against what we found in the girl my father jamie whispered we know there were two of you weve he gave you my underwear weve got enough now to convict you but we dont want to leave that other asshole wandering around the streets you give his name to us and youll walk i guarantee it jamie looked desperately at the door i was alone mahoney waited for a long long minute then kicked back his chair and stood i gotta crap people like you make me want to shit ill be back in three minutes think real hard kid mahoney left the room the door remained open about six inches and through the gap jamie could see the back door of town hall he gazed through the half window at the parking lot and the thick trees beyond outside it was a may school day the sun was brilliant and insects zipping through the light flashed like sparks outside kids were lining up to be picked for softball in pe class they were jogging playing soccer and tennis swatting golf balls outside was an entirely different dimension from that in which jamie corde now sat the sunlight grew in radiance no it had moved closer to him he was astonished to find himself on his feet no longer sitting in the hard chair now walking across the interrogation room now pushing into the dark corridor staring all the while at the back window in the hallway pausing the light began to approach him slowly at first then picking up speed rushing toward him as his heart thudded with a shockingly loud pounding beating ever faster the light filled his vision it illuminated his flushed skin it grew very close and jamie understands that no no the sound is not his heart at all but the drumming of his running shoes on chestnut floorboards his hands rise palms out fingers splayed the back door explodes outward and a million splinters of glass precede jamie corde into the golden light one man jumped at the sound the other did not mahoney looked at the shocked face of tt ebbans who ran into the corridor behind the sheriffs department and stared as the back door now lacking most of its glass swung slowly closed once more he stepped across the hall to the interrogation room and looked inside then glanced out the broken door and saw jamie sprinting away from the station house deputy you better ebbans turned his gaunt face to mahoney jamie wouldnt run like that whatd you say to him mahoney nodded toward the shattered door you better stay on him you know where hes going ebbans said evenly i should tell you sir i think youre a real son of a bitch deputy hes getting away what are you doing here corde asked mahoney walking through the squad room glanced at the coffee he sipped devils brew were you in there with my son i just looked in on him he and tt were talking corde stepped into the corridor and saw the empty room he returned as mahoney was dumping sugar into his cup where is he your kid i think tt said they were going to the lake and look around i dont know corde walked to the front door he shouldve told me mahoney noticed the evidence envelopes containing the polaroids and the messages they carried whats this ribbon answered tentatively as if asking for cordes approval somebody left them for bill he thinks they might be his daughter you show them to her ask her about it she didnt see them no my daughter has a learning disability shes going through a rough time right now this would upset her well mahoney said with an exasperated laugh thatd be a shame but i asked her if anybodyd taken her picture recently and she said no you say shes slow shes not slow corde said evenly she has an aboveaverage iq she has dyslexia and dyscalculia does she now maybe somebody talked her into posing and warned her not to tell anybody about it that happens all the time i know my daughter mahoney fingering the photos said your son does he have a polaroid camera corde turned to ribbon can i see you for a minute steve the men walked into the sheriffs office corde leading ribbon left the door open corde reached back and closed it he hardly ever lost his temper but the problem was he couldnt tell when it was going to happen ribbon said all right bill i understand cordes teeth pressed together fiercely no more with that guy i dont want him crossing my path hes let me finish it may be that jamie knows a little more than hes saying but you know him as well as any boy in town and he wouldnt take those pictures im not going to listen to this crap anymore but mahoney doesnt know jamie at all and you cant condemn him for asking the question hell yes i can this thing is way out of hand the towns scared out of its mind we got the paper counting down the days till another moon and were going to get ten more folk shot youll remember it was my thought not charlies about the moon was he interrogating jamie ribbon paused hes been helping out some bill look hes a famous homicide detective oh steve come on we need all the help we can get this isnt a frat hazing that got out of hand do you know where tt took my son i dont know if he did or where corde opened the door and walked into the squad room mahoney said hold up detective corde walked toward the door hey detective corde kept going the window was open letting in the scent of lilacs and whatever snatches of breeze might penetrate the staleness of the room the morning was quiet philips father was at the warehouse his mother was asleep she hadnt wakened her children in time for school philip lay in bed eating from a box of graham crackers crumbs dusted his chest and stomach hed wait until ten when his pe class was over then wake his mother and have her write him a tardiness excuse outside he heard footsteps he rolled over and looked out the window hey phil the voice was urgent philip looked into the stand of lilac bushes he saw jamie corde sweating and pale hey jano whats the matter i went by the school whatre you doing home before philip could answer he continued urgently come on out here i gotta talk to you philip rolled out of bed pulled on jeans and a sweatshirt then walked through the house his sister was asleep under a mound of pink satin comforter in his parents room philips mother also lay asleep her mouth was open and her lipstick had left wet red blotches on the pillow around her face like stains of fresh blood he continued outside onto the back porch hey man philip called walking barefoot down the stairs whats i was just at the police the boy stopped walking what did you tell them nothing jamie whined nothing shit the knife thats what it was he knew it he felt sweat break out on his forehead philip continued into the bushes and sat down jamie sat too what do they know they know i was there and they know i was there with somebody that night theyve got a sort of description of you shit like how did they find that out suspicion filled philips round face i didnt say anything my father jamie said he he couldnt bring himself to say anything else about it he pictured his father going through the dirty clothes finding his underwear putting it in an evidence bag he began to cry they said were going to prison what are we going to do oh man jamies hands were shaking but philip was calm in the dimension where he spent much of his time nothing was impossible nothing was what it seemed maple trees were sodium boosters of intergalactic vehicles sidewalks were crystal walkways a thousand feet above the plasma energy core of the planet stars werent stars at all but holes in the paltry threedimensional world through which the allpowerful allbrilliant guardians trillions and trillions of lightyears big looked down in philips world fat boys in dirty jeans were sinewy lithe heros who could pull on cloaks and disappear from their terrible crimes we have to vanish he said softly vanish like dimensionally he added in a whisper permanently jamie whispered it was just a movie man philip continued in his quiet voice were both nicked you want to go to prison then what come back and live at home with your father he smiled in a weary way this dimension sucks jano jamie was silent we took an oath philip said quietly we took an oath we shouldnt have done it to her an oath to the death philip looked up at the sky through a cluster of faint purple lilacs that dimensions real this one isnt we took an oath are you going back on it jamie grabbed a black branch dotted with buds and small blossoms he stripped the sinewy twigs away like peeling skin off bones and flung the branch away furiously with a low moan philip said remember dathar the way he leapt off the governance building they thought they had him but he got away he didnt get away he died the guardians brought him back but he died its the same thing philip whispered he got away jamie said nothing the sound of a siren howling like a dentists drill filled the front yard philips smile vanished as the squad car skidded to a stop he stared at his friend you told them no jamie scrambled to his feet footsteps sounded running the men spread out ebbans and slocum and miller and two other deputies you turned me in philip screamed as he began willing his huge body to run feet pointing outward stomach and tits bouncing with every step feeling the sting of his chafed legs and the deeper pain of a struggling heart whoa boy hold up there stop him slow him up slocum was chuckling hes doing okay for a big fellow somebody else laughed and said we need ourselves a lasso the men easily caught up with philip and pulled him to the ground they were laughing as if theyd grounded a suckling pig for a barbecue handcuffs appeared and were ratcheted on pudgy wrists one of the cops asked jamie a question but the boy missed the words all he could hear was the sound of philips voice filling the backyard as he shrieked you turned me in you turned me in you turned me in corde paused outside the house he saw a broken lawn mower termitechewed stacks of black firewood a v engine block sweating under a foggy plastic tarp rusty tools four bloated trash bags bald tires a garbage can filled with brackish water the lawn was riddled with crabgrass and bare spots of packed mud showing through the scabby white clapboard of the house were patches of milky green from an earlier paint job three brilliant bursts of color tempered the grim scene orangered geraniums in clay pots inside were tt ebbans jim slocum lance miller and the two county deputies charlie mahoney was not there on the couch sat philip and jamie creth halpern stood over his boy staring down at him his arms were crossed and he had an eerie smile on his face jane halpern sat in a chair off to the side of the room her eyes were red and her lips were glisteningly wet corde didnt know much about her only that shed been a thin pretty cheerleader in the new lebanon high school class behind his and she was now a thin pretty drunk the house smelled bad food and mold he also could smell animal and he vaguely remembered a dog nosing in weeds behind a shed in the backyard with the door wide open the brilliant outdoor light which looked unnatural in the dank room revealed a coat of grime and spheres of dustballs the windows were mostly shaded corde stepped on something hard he kicked away a small dried dog turd he crouched next to jamie you all right son the boy looked at him silently with an undiluted hate that made corde want to weep he motioned to ebbans and the two of them stepped outside what happened tt did you and mahoney spook jamie and follow him here to his credit in cordes mind ebbans held the detectives eyes and answered honestly im sorry bill thats what happened he just asked to see him for a few minutes by himself and steve told me to let him i didnt know what he had in mind i swear that corde said you dont think philip did it do you take a look at what we found ebbans led him to the squad car inside was a foothigh stack of porn magazines and violent comic books also sketchbooks and notebooks corde flipped through the crudely drawn pictures of spaceships and monsters montages of photos cut out of the school yearbook girls imprisoned in towers and dungeons chained to walls while snake creatures circled around them much of the material had the naryan insignia handprinted on it corde thought of the picture of sarah her skirt high over her thighs he had this incendiary thing hooked up we opened the drawer where hed hid all this stuff and it started to set fire to the file cabinet it blew a fuse before it did any damage lance went through the backyard in the barbecue he found some scraps of jockey shorts the kidd tried to burn ebbans touched a small plastic bag they were stained and it could be semen oh and we also found some pictures of a naked girl polaroids polaroids jennie cant tell its a girls breasts its not corde dodged ebbanss eyes not a younger girl is it ebbans said not a little girl no he continued and i found a pair of muddy boots im doing casts from the porch slocum offered it all fits the profile the smut collection the home situation everything corde ignored this and said to ebbans you didnt question him by himself did you hes got to have his parents present no i didnt question him at all but ill tell you his fathers not going to be much help to the kid hes the one sent us out to the barbecue told us he saw philip burning something there the night after the first killing corde stared at the pile in the back seat of the car in the center of cordes bulletin board was a sign that hed sent off for from national law enforcement monthly a couple of years ago the brittle yellow slip of glossy paper read physical evidence is the cornerstone of a case he was looking at physical evidence now physical evidence that could put two boys in prison for forty years and one of them was his son ribbon and ellison arrived in one of the countys fancy furies the slogan on the side said if you drink do us all a favor dont drive ebbans told them what theyd found inside halpern was leaning over his son who stared straight ahead what the hell was going through your mind the boys eyes were glazed he didnt speak his face wasnt particularly sad or frightened he seemed to be possessed philip played at the corde house once or twice a week but was this the boy whod taken the pictures of sarah who had put the threatening newspaper article on the rosebush and in dianes diaphragm case was this the boy who murdered jennie gebben and emily rossiter he looked at philips round soft face smudged with dirt or chocolate a face that did not appear so much guilty as bewildered corde said jamie come here slocums head turned say bill maybe its not such a good idea uh talking to him in private i mean corde squashed his temper and ignored the deputy he motioned to his son the boy stood and followed him onto the porch ribbon stepped forward corde stopped him with a look leave me alone with my boy the sheriff hesitated only a moment before stepping away jamie leaned against the porch bannister and turned to his father i dont have anything to say to you jamie why are you being this way i want to help you yeah right just tell me what happened i dont know what happened son its murder were talking about theyre looking for somebody to send to jail for this i know you are me you want me to make up something about phil i want you to tell the truth i want you to tell it to me right here and now bill ribbon came to the doorway you can be present at questioning but oh goddamnit corde exploded goddamnit you dont have probable cause to charge him call the da ask him ribbon said delicately we do for conspiracy and obstruction youll just make things worse for everybody jamie why cordes eyes begged his hand reached for his sons arm but stopped short of contact what did i do why wont you tell me eyes downcast the boy let ribbon lead him into the filthy house while his fathers desperate questions fell like shot quail silent and flimsy the tall grass waved in the wind and the sunlight flickered off the leaves of thin saplings sarah stepped into her circle of stones and sat down she crossed her legs carefully from her backpack she took the bear she was going to give to the sunshine man and set him next to her she looked at her madonna watch it said she closed her eyes and remembered that this meant twenty minutes to three she hated numbers sometimes you counted to a hundred before they started over other times you counted to sixty twenty minutes until the sunshine man arrived she remembered a drill at school her secondgrade teacher would move the hands on a clock and then point to different students and have them tell the time this exercise socked her with icy terror she remembered the teachers bony finger pointing at her and sarah what time is it now she screamed that she didnt know she couldnt tell dont ask dont ask dont ask she cried all the way home from school that night her daddy bought her the digital watch she now wore a sudden breeze whipped her hair around her face and she lay down using her backpack as a pillow sometimes she took afternoon naps here looking around her wondering where the sunshine man would come from sarah noticed just above the horizon a sliver of new moon she imagined that the sky was a huge ocean and that the moon was the fingernail on a giants hand as he swam just below the surface of the smooth water then she wondered how come you can see the moon in the daytime she closed her eyes and she thought of the giant as he swam lifting arms as big as mountains from the water kicking his milelong legs and speeding across the sky sarah was afraid of the water when the family went to the park downtown she would still play in the baby pool which made her ashamed but wasnt as bad as the terror of bouncing on the adult pool floor with the water inches from her nose and thinking she might get swept into the deep part she wished she could swim strong strokes like jamie maybe this was something else she could ask the sunshine man to do for her she looked at her watch she counted on her fingers two minutes no twelve minutes she closed her eyes and kneaded the grass bunched up at her hips and pretended she was swimming skimming across the pool like a speedboat back and forth saving the lives of children struggling in the deep end and racing past her brother once then again and again five minutes later she heard the approaching footsteps sarah cordes heart began pounding in joyous anticipation and as she climbed out of her imaginary pool she opened her eyes look at this place lord bill corde couldnt get over the size of wynton kresges office flush yeah well kresge seemed uncomfortable the room was probably a third as big as the entire new lebanon sheriffs department corde took pleasure walking over the thick green carpet and wondered why two busy oriental rugs had been laid over the pile thats the biggest desk ive ever seen yeah well corde sat down in one of the visitors chairs which was itself bigger and more comfy than his own sears armchair at home and his a recliner at that he tried to scoot it closer to the desk but it wouldnt move and he had to stand again and lug the chair up to the desk kresge explained was the office of some dean or another academic affairs something like that he retired and they needed someplace to put me i think they like having a black man on this corridor see when you come this way from the main stairwell you see me at my big desk looks good for the school think im a big shot little do they know so they caught the kid they caught him he was a friend of my sons well kresge would be wondering whether he should ask the question about how close a friend but he let it pass the evidence is pretty strong against him hes a spooky boy and his fathers worse corde realized he still had his hat on it banged into the high back of the chair and he took it off pitched it like a frisbee onto the seat of the other chair he opened his briefcase i need a favor sure kresge said eagerly corde leaned forward and set a plastic bag in front of kresge inside was the burnt scrap of computer paper whats this a bit of that paper we found behind no i mean this the security chief pointed at the white card attached to the bag by a red string that a chain of custody card its got your name on it its not important wynton the piece of thiss for trial right right so the prosecutor can trace the physical evidence back to the crime scene got it so that if theres a gap in the chain the defense attorney can get the evidence thrown out right because corde was here to ask a favor he indulged kresge who was examining the coc card closely finally corde continued the piece of paper inside id like to find out where it came from ive got this idea youre leaning on it its from the school what youre leaning on it on what kresge motioned him away corde sat back in the chair and kresge yanked a thick wad of computer printouts from beneath a stack of magazines corde had been using the pile as an armrest its a university accounting department printout they send them around every week to each department mine shows me security expenses real and budgeted allocation of overhead you know that sort of thing you know what department this was from kresge looked at it no idea any chance you could find out technically i dont have access to the accounting departments files corde asked coyly how bout untechnically ill see what i can do after a pause he asked but if they caught the boy whats the point corde slowly touched away a fleck of lint from his boot heel and stalled long enough that an attractive woman blustered into the office with an armful of letters for kresge to sign the security chief rose and with clumsy formality introduced two people with nothing in common except their lack of desire to meet corde however was grateful for the curious decorum it seemed to drive the question from kresges mind and after the signingfest when their conversation resumed he did not ask it again she could sense him nearby almost as though he was hovering right over her body like a wave of hot sunlight she swung her head about peering into the clearing into the forest the tall grass more footsteps leaves rustling twigs snapping so he doesnt fly he doesnt materialize he doesnt float he walks thats okay sarah looked for the glow of sun as he approached but she could see nothing except trees and branches leaves grass shadows the footsteps grew closer hesitant uncertain then she saw him a figure in the woods coming slowly toward her picking his way through the brush he seemed less like a wizard than well a big man tromping noisily through the forest thats okay too im over here here she stood up waving her arm he paused located her and slowly changed direction pushing aside branches she picked up the stuffed bear and ran toward him she shouted im here a sheet of bright green leaves lifted aside and the deputy stepped out brushing dust and leaves off his uniform tom she cried her heart sinking hey missie howd you get here without getting all messed up he picked a leaf out of his hair then swatted his forehead skeeter he examined his palm crestfallen sarah stared up at him youre not supposed to be out here you know you could get me in a whole mess of trouble youre supposed to stay close to the house anyway nough said your mom wants to see you now youve got an appointment at the doctors she says i cant come right now she scanned the forest hes leaving i can tell the deputy scared him off well i dont know tom said patiently your mother told me to fetch you not now please just a half hour she was close to tears thats a cute little fellow youve got there whats his name chutney how about if you and chutney come home now and afterward you come back here with me and ill keep an eye on you howd that be when she didnt answer the deputy said your momll be pretty unhappy with me if i dont bring you right now like she asked you dont want her to have words with me do you it was true if she didnt come now if she missed the appointment with dr parker her mother would be furious with the deputy sarah couldnt stand the thought of anyone being mad because of her people hated you when you made them mad they laughed at you she looked around her once more the sunshine man was gone now hed fled and was far away why you looking so sad little lady im not sad sarah walked through the grass come this way its easier she led him out of the tall grass into the strip of land beside the cow pasture and turned toward the house certain that she and the sunshine man would never meet special to the register a freshman at new lebanon high school has been charged in the moon killer slayings of two auden university coeds law enforcement authorities announced today the fifteenyearold youth whose identity has been withheld because of his age was apprehended by town and county deputies at his parents home yesterday afternoon he clearly fits the profile that we were working from said new lebanon sheriff steve ribbon he had a collection of deviate photographs and drawings of girls from the high school it looked like he had a whole series of assaults planned sheriff ribbon added that authorities are looking at the possibility that the youth was involved in the slaying last year of another auden coed susan biagotti at the time he said it appeared that the girl was killed during a robbery but the way were looking at it now it might have been the first in this series of killings some residents greeted the news of the arrest with cautious relief of course were glad hes been caught said a new lebanon housewife who refused to give her name but it seems like theres still a lot of questions was he doing this alone is it safe for my children to go back to school others were less restrained in their reaction we can breathe again said one main street shopkeeper who also insisted on anonymity my business came to a standstill the last couple of weeks i hope he gets the chair under state law a fifteenyearold can be tried as an adult for murder but no one under eighteen can be sentenced to death if the jury convicts the youth of firstdegree murder his sentence could range from thirtyfive years to life and he would have to serve at least twentyfive years before he would be eligible for parole diane had found a psychiatrist cartoon in a magazine and cut it out for dr parker it showed a little fish sitting in a chair holding a notebook next to him was a huge shark lying down on a couch and the little fish was saying to the shark oh no its perfectly normal to want to eat your psychiatrist diane kept studying the cartoon and not getting it but the expression on the face of the shark was so funny she broke out in laughter which wasnt as loud as the laughter that escaped from dr parkers mouth when she looked at the clipping maybe the woman did have a sense of humor after all dr parker pinned the cartoon up on her bulletin board diane felt ecstatic as if shed been given a gold star at school sarah was in the waiting room dr parker had asked to see diane first today by herself this troubled diane who wondered what kind of bad news the woman had to report but seeing the doctor laugh she sensed this was no crisis as dr parker rummaged through her desk diane told her about ben breck breck i think ive heard of him lets look him up she spun around in her chair and found a huge book she opened it and flipped through ah here we go hes forty one impressive summa cum from yale ditto an ma and phd in psychology phd in education from chicago hes taught at a number of ivy league schools currently tenured at chicago published extensively in the journals visiting at auden is he lucky you so i should take him up on it cheap tutoring from an expert id say there isnt much of a choice there ive already told him i would i think youll see some dramatic improvements in sarah the doctor looked at her watch this session will be very short mrs corde a few minutes with you a few with sarah im not going to charge you for the time my horoscope for this month mustve said you will meet two generous therapists dr parkers sense of humor had been spent on the cartoon she ignored the pleasantry and dug again with some irritation into the bottom of her desk drawer finally she extracted a small black box the doctor said youre going to see sarah carrying this around with her tell your husband and son to leave it alone dont touch it dont listen to it dont ask her about it unless she says something first diane asked the most innocuous question she could think of is it a tape recorder thats right whats it for im going to reconstruct sarahs selfesteem how she answered tersely sarahs going to write a book diane smiled a reflex then she decided that the joke was in poor taste and she frowned dr parker pushed the recorder a blank cassette and an instruction book toward diane who scooped them up and held them helplessly when the doctor said nothing more diane said youre not joking are you joking dr parker looked as if diane were the one making the tasteless comment mrs corde id think youd know by now i rarely joke diane corde believed that the perfection of childrens fingers was proof that god existed and she thought of this now watching her daughter hold the tape recorder examining it with some small suspicion and turning it over in her pale hands diane unfolded a tattered copy of the instruction manual and took the recorder back she set it on the living room coffee table in her left hand she held two aa batteries and a new cassette i think we should she examined the instruction sheet lemme sarah said diane read we have to lemme click click click there diane looked down sarah had the machine running and was pressing the play and record buttons simultaneously saying testing testing how did you do that did you read the instructions sarah rewound the tape and pressed another button dianes tinny voice repeated read the instructions mom come on like its easy she looked at the recorder then back up to her mother dr parker wants me to make up stories and put them in my book thats what she said i dont know what to write about maybe buxter fabricant i think dr parker would like to hear that story hes the dog that became president right i like buxter sarah scrunched her nose but i already wrote that story i could write a story about mrs drake duck no no no im going to write a story about mrs beiderbug sarah dont make fun of peoples names its going to be a good story sarah dropped the recorder in her barbie backpack jamie appeared in the doorway he was eating a sandwich and carrying a glass of milk from the way he was looking at sarah diane knew he wanted to talk about something out of the girls presence he turned and walked back into the kitchen she heard the refrigerator door opening and the shuffle as he pulled out a plastic gallon jug of milk diane stood up and walked into the kitchen she took a package of chicken from the freezer and set it on a pad of paper towels taking her time as she cut away the plastic wrapper jamie sat at the table and silently stared at his glass of milk which he then gulped down he stood filled the glass again and returned to his chair she thought it was odd that though sarah had problems with language speaking with jamie was often far more difficult she asked practice today yeah later then you have weight training not today there was nothing more she could do with the chicken and she decided to boil potatoes because that would give her an excuse to stay in the kitchen for as long as he wanted her to be there she began peeling the silence was thick as oil smoke finally she said we know you didnt have anything to do with it jamie the prosecutor hadnt presented the boy to the grand jury but he had warned the cordes sternly that he would have to testify at philips trial and that there was a chance new evidence might arise implicating him further jamie drank the milk like a man on a bender he stood and she prayed he was just going to the refrigerator not leaving the room he poured another glass and sat down again he asked did dad like look through my room or anything did he what when he didnt repeat the question she said your father wouldnt do that if there was something bothering him hed talk to you uhhuh her son sat with his head tilted studying the glass diane wanted to tell him how much she loved him how proud they were of him how the incident at the pond whatever had happened was one of those ambiguous glitches in the complicated history of families that dont touch the core of its love yet she was afraid to she believed that if she did the words would turn his heart as thick as his sculpted muscles and he would move further away from her jamie sarah appeared in the doorway hes here mommy dr breck diane looked toward the living room and saw a car parked in the driveway okay ill be there in a minute sarah left and diane said to her son your father loves you she stood and ran a hand through his hair feeling his neck muscles tense at this he said nothing a suspect had been arrested but tom the pinkcheeked deputy was still taking his job seriously nobody had relieved him of his command yet besides he was hugely aware that somebody had gotten past him at least once and that sarah had hightailed it into the woods right under his nose he wasnt letting ben breck put a foot on the front porch until he had the queens okay diane nodded its all right hes expected she turned to the man standing on the concrete walk dr breck call me ben please he walked past the deputy into the house breck was over six feet tall with dark unruly hair laced with gray fortyone she remembered dr parker had said he had boyish qualities his voice and face for instance and you could see exactly what he had looked like when he was twelve he seemed to be in good shape but he was pale and this gave him the deceptive appearance of weakness his eyes were dark he wore black jeans and a tweed sports coat over a dark blue shirt his hands were small and his fingers almost delicate he slouched diane accustomed to her husbands military posture was put off by this initially almost immediately though this aversion flipflopped and became pleasantly quirky he carried a battered briefcase diane motioned him to the couch he glanced out the window is there uhm something wrong oh the deputy no my husbands a detective hes involved in the case where those girls were killed the students thats right the sheriffs department sometimes has a deputy keeping an eye out on the houses of the investigators sarah bounded down the stairs and halted in the arched doorway to the living room clutching her pink backpack and gazing at breck diane noted that she had changed clothes and was now wearing her favorite tshirt bright blue and emblazoned with a seahorse the girl brushed a long tail of hair from her face and said nothing sarah this is dr breck youre my tutor thats right im pleased to meet you sarah breck said to dianes surprise the girl shook his hand jamie walked quickly through the living room wearing his biking shorts and a sweatshirt oh jamie he glanced at the three people in the room and didnt say a word he left by the front door she saw him leap on his bike and pedal quickly out of the driveway wrestling practice she explained to breck ah breck turned to sarah whatve you got there my backpack whats in it barbie and redford t redford thats one of her stuffed bears diane felt a need to translate thats a clever name sarah announced hes the worlds smartest bear and i have my tape recorder tape recorder ohoh are you recording what im saying like a spy no sarah smiled im writing stories stories brecks eyes went wide ive never known anybody who writes stories dr parker is having me write a book breck said i write books but mine are very boring students use them in class ill bet yours are more interesting than mine sarah why dont you sit over here next to me diane asked can i get you anything a salt shaker breck said pardon actually the whole carton would be better salt breck said please diane walked into the kitchen and breck turned to sarah how do you spell chair chair very good sarah beamed how about table she closed her eyes and thought for a minute she shook her head then she said tabel no le thats right how bout tablecloth the girl went quiet her mood changed fast as a balloon popping i dont know her face became sullen tablecloth breck said diane returning with the blue carton felt an electric rush across her face sympathetic fear shes getting upset shes going to be blocked and youre bucking for a tantrum boy breck opened his briefcase and pulled out a sheet of black paper diane handed him the salt breck took it and poured a large pile onto the paper then spread it out smoothly mother and daughter watched one with fascination one with caution breck said to sarah lets spell it together i dont know how she stared at the salt diane stood in the doorway until she saw what she believed was a glance from breck requesting privacy she retreated to the kitchen give me your hand breck said to the girl reluctantly sarah did he took her index finger and drew a t in the salt with it you feel it he asked you feel what a t is like sarah nodded breck smoothed the salt do it again she hesitated then started the letter it was a clumsy attempt looking more like a plus sign lets try an a i can do that one she said and smoothed the salt herself for a half hour they made salt letters a hundred tables a hundred cloths a hundred of those words put together making a third word even though sarah struggled fiercely to spell it correctly and did so the majority of times breck did not seem interested in her results less a tutor than a sculpting instructor breck urged her to feel the shape of the letters diane crouched like a peeping tom peered through a crack in the kitchen door and watched at the end of the session he gave sarah a tracing notebook which contained a story breck read to her sarah declared it was a pretty darn good story even though she guessed the ending halfway through breck gave her instructions on tracing the paragraphs he stood up and left sarah to her book and tape recorder and mangy stuffed bear hello breck called mrs corde in here he walked into the kitchen where diane had rapidly resumed peeling potatoes you are amazing she said then confessed i overheard these are very wellknown techniques rapport with the child multisensory stimulation work with her motor skills use her given talents to compensate for her deficits you seem like an artist i like what i do thats the optimal motivation for any endeavour optimal endeavour you want some coffee he said sure she poured two cups and chattered about her garden and a pta bake sale she was chairing diane corde didnt know what to make of her rambling apparently neither did breck who sat in the kitchen and sipped coffee while he looked close to uncomfortable he gazed out over the backyard when she paused he said i like these windows you can see the whole field there i have bay windows like these in my town house wheres that chicago south side only i dont see fields i see the lake i wonder if thats why they call them bay windows bay lake he said or perhaps its because theyre shaped like a bay diane said that was true and felt like a fool that her joke had missed its mark breck said sarahs a good candidate for improvement dr parker has her dictating stories to build up selfesteem i assume thats right she has an astonishing imagination shes always making up things it drives me nutty sometimes i dont know whats real and whats fantasy a plight many of us suffer from plight there was a moment of long silence breck was still gazing though no longer at the cow pasture now it was dianes eyes he was examining he asked do you work yep you just finished with one of my bosses i got two more jamie you saw him and a husband theyre all a handful ah your son the bicyclist does he have any learning problems nope good student good athlete thats not unusual birth order is often a significant factor in dyslexia and your husbands a policeman a detective he works like a maniac hes away from home so much diane found herself about to blurt and thats with a case hes been ordered off of but she said only we dont get many murders in new lebanon from what ive read its got the town in quite an uproar well all this talk of moon killers and cults and that nonsense is it nonsense well theyve caught that boy i shouldnt be telling you this but thats why jamie was a little moody the one theyve indicated was a friend of his really breck frowned in sympathy poor kid im of mixed mind i didnt want to say anything in front of sarah but the reason the deputys out there somebodys left some threats how terrible to get bill to stop the investigation and they think your sons friend did that philips a sorry soul with parents like his im not surprised he turned out bad hes been abused im sure and his mother drinks but threatening my daughter i dont cut him any slack he gets no sympathy from me but if theyve arrested him why the guard thats my bill between you and me and the fence post hes not sure the boys guilty he asked to have the deputy kept on the house for a few days longer i cant say that upsets me too much diane hesitated i guess i shouldnt i mean this is pretty much classified stuff im telling you breck acknowledged the discretion with a nod and diane turned the talk back to the pta after ten minutes breck looked at his watch and stood thanks for the coffee id like to stay longer he said with sincerity but i have a lecture to prepare diane took his hand and found she was studying parts of him his floppy hair his eyelids his lips reaching conclusions about each this allowed her to avoid conclusions about breck as a person or as a man she thought suddenly that this was the first time in years she was having a serious talk alone in her kitchen with a man not related by blood or marriage she asked next tuesday ill look forward to it breck added ive enjoyed talking with you i think we have some good rapport established is that important indeed breck took her hand again he continued to hold it pressing firmly as he said youd be surprised how important the tutors relationship with a parent is memo to files from dennis b brann esq date may re people v halpern a minor attached are the relevant portions of a transcript of my interview with

when he walked in she looked at wynton kresge and motioned him inside then hung up you wanted to see me he asked the dean stood up and walked across her office it was a lot plusher than kresges but he didnt care for it too many scrolly twists of wood and ceramic vases and immense nineteenthcentury portraits she closed the door and returned to her seat kresge was tired so he sat too wynton she began id like to talk to you about the incidents incidents the girls deaths right sure i mentioned that it was important for the school not to be too involved i cant tell you the fallout weve had because of the investigation that detective corde was doing several of our lenders told professor sayles pointblank that they would not refinance their loans to us because theyd heard about lesbian orgies in the dorms thank god theyve caught that young man im sure bill didnt say anything about orgies well this is just background wynton the dean said the reason i called you here is that im afraid ill have to let you go go ive gotten a report from the finance committee did you authorize the placement of some advertising in the register ads the ads that bill corde couldnt pay for thats right i did you have no authority to approve nonsecurity expenses id say it was pretty much a security expense it was to find the killer of two of our students wynton you made an unauthorized expense its the same as embezzlement thats slander dean said wynton kresge who owned more law books than hunting books its a serious breach of procedures the personnel department will be contacting you about the severance package which is extremely generous under the circumstances she didnt say anything more she hunkered down in her chair and waited for the onslaught kresge let her flash through a few eeoc nightmares for a long moment then said calmly thatd be effective today yes wynton and im sorry well dean i hope thiss all you have to be sorry about he said cryptically and left the office chunk lying on the bottom bunk looking up at the xaser coils above his face he heard the sound philip halpern blinked and felt a low punch in his stomach he recognized the noise instantly the door of the familys chevy station wagon slamming his palms began sweating his fingers twitched he stood up and looked through thick bars and thin glass to see what he knew hed see his mother coming to visit hed been expecting her no no no oh god hed found it the plastic hefty bag with the dead girls purse inside his father not forty feet away holding the bag philip had buried under the back porch the boy stared at his father talking with sheriff ribbon bleak expressions on both their faces ribbon pointed back toward the cell his father stared for a long moment as if he was trying to decide whether he should visit his son then they both turned and walked up the street away from the jail these two men looked like any good old boys in new lebanon sitting at a green formica booth in the drugstore their solid shoulders arching over heavy white coffee cups the kind of men who would stand up quick when they heard the fourbar intro of the starspangled banner the kind of men whod buy a napa carburetor at nine am on saturday and have it seated by tenthirty the kind that talked about the price of propane and what poppers the bass were hitting on right now these two men were talking about murder my boys got his share of problems creth halpern said hes got more weight than he ought its soft weight its girl weight i dont know where he gets it his mothers a drinker you know that i think maybe that mixed up his chrome zones steve ribbon nodded and kept stirring the coffee he had no taste for he listened this was a pain and in spades take them pictures halpern was whispering as if admitting things hed never in his life spoken out loud the pictures you boys found id sometimes find these girlie magazines not like playboy it was just plain smut pictures of people you know humping i dont know where he got them from i was ascared it was somebody older some man phils a little girlish like i say halpern smiled and looked at a heinz bottle as he sailed over the second great tragedy of his life but the pictures werent of queers ribbon asked what you getting at exactly creth hes not the kind of boy would hurt anybody i dont want him to go to prison you showed us the shorts that he tried to burn i was mad then i wanted to whup him i feel different now why you talking to me you hired dennis brann i dont do well by lawyers i didnt take to brann or him to me it doesnt look real good for philip creth hes not bad hes a disappointment is what he is you know whatd happen to him if he went to jail halpern glanced at ribbon who was silent but who knew exactly what would happen to philip in general population at the state prison in warwick and probably on his first day there halpern said i cant say i love the boy i gave up trying a time ago but i i dont know branns an allright shyster hell give it a good shot well look here what i found halpern lifted the torn filthy plastic bag onto the countertop crumbs of dirt and popcorn fell into a comma of spilled coffee on the formica and dissolved i found it in this place where phil played like a hiding place under the back porch ribbon opened up the bag inside was a purse stained with mud he shook it out on the table he looked up at halpern he whispered harshly thiss one of the girls hell whatre you giving it to me for itll convict him sure creth no no halpern shook his head theres something you gotta see they stood outside the onestory yellowbrick building in higgins both bent over a piece of computer printout paper well we gotta do something with it steve ribbon said damn this is a wrinkle charlie mahoney handed the printout back to ribbon then held up the clear plastic bag with a cog tag attached he read the handwritten letter that was inside ribbon waved the printout as if he were drying ink it says its a fiftyfifty chance i dont think we can ignore it i dont think so either who is he whatre his credentials a graphoanalyst works for the state its admissible charlie when brann gets his hand on it itll be back to square one and thats gonna be a son of a bitch for all of us for all of us mahoney repeated slowly he glanced at ribbon with a smile that meant if anything why you fat shitfaced rube ribbon continued the case goes public again theyll start talking about jennie and her girlfriend and the school i mean thisll fuck us both he glanced at the paper mahoney said ill bet his father wrote it to get the kid off nup not the father you dont know him he wouldnt help his boy that way but the kid himself mightve written it and hid it knowing wed find it any chance at all its real we gotta give it to brann thats the law mahoney stuck a solid finger at ribbon and say what you like you had the investigation for two weeks before the county and everybody knows it your dicks in the ringer justs far as all of ours he drew out the last words melodically ribbon avoided the mans relentless eyes this dont disprove the case against the boy for the gebben girls murder damnit ribbon you been harping on this cult serial killing shit since the case started if the boy didnt kill the second girl then wheres that theory of yours go ribbon said youve seen the kid all those magazines the pictures the porn all that cult crapola the knife he guilty or not mahoney shrugged probably what if we was to get a confession outa him ribbon said and to mahoneys relief touched away a web of spit that had formed in the corner of his mouth confession uhm could you do that ribbon asked youve gotten confessions before mahoney snorted it sounds like something youd be good at getting confessions yeah mahoney said both pleased by the stroking and feeling utter contempt at ribbon for resorting to it hes in the lockup right now mahoney looked at his watch ribbon said i think sooner rather than laterd be best dont you what about the other deputies i can arrange for you to be alone with him now completely alone he didnt have a fiftythousandjoule xaser gun he didnt even have his fathers ruger but philip halpern had one weapon he turned back to his cell and stripped the sheet off his bunk philip lifted it to his wet mouth and with his teeth tore four notches in the cheap cloth he ripped the sheet into strips and tied them together he pushed the table into the exact centre of the room and after a struggle climbed up on top of it he took hold of the metal overhead lamp shade a wispy avalanche of dust fell he breathed it in coughing and blinking he smelled the pungent odor of his sweat mixed with pinescented lysol philip wrapped the sheetrope around his neck and then looped it around the electric cord he stared up pennysaver soft light registered trademark sixty watts made in usa the nearness of the cheap bulb began to erode his vision the words faded the flecks of dust and the corpses of fried bugs on the metal shade grew indistinct the room became bright as heaven philip halpern lowered his arms they heard the boys loud moan lance miller cocked his head and said sounds like hes not feeling good maybe we ought to get him something shore the county deputy said how bout a icecold girl lance miller looked up from usa today already had hisself two of them he returned to an article about jay leno can you get a dose from a corpse the county deputy mused thats disgusting miller told him another moan loud and eerie should we check on him you see the pictures of his sisters boobs miller asked missed em he tried to burn them her boobs no the pictures miller said what were they like closeups you know polaroids no her boobs the deputy said not real big the picture was dark he didnt use a flash they heard the moan again and looked at each other hes beating off in there the deputy said what if hes really sick i dunno how bout you look now ill look later if hes puking im not cleaning it up well draw straws lance miller walked into the lockup area closed the door and continued down the corridor to philips cell he saw the boy the sheetrope the table oh shit oh shit he fumbled with his key and swung open the door to the cell and leapt up on the table reaching for the boys shoulders which is when philip started to fall behind him trailed the strip of sheet which he hadnt tied to the lamp or to anything at all it streamed behind him like a tail of dimensional cloak firing his secret weapon at miller not fiftythousand joules not a xaser not a honon whip but his two hundred plus pounds of weight the deputy struggling to get his balance slipped onto the concrete floor and landed on his back philip continued downward and landed directly on him there was a huge snap lance miller groaned once then passed out philip grabbed millers keys and his smith wesson and walked out of the cell he unlatched the back door of the lockup then slipped into town hall and out the back door once outside he sprinted away from the town building then out of downtown his lungs sucking air as the pain in his chest grew a momentary thought occurred to him he felt grateful ebullient even that he had been in jail and had missed the anguish of the longdistance run in pe class now he put his head down and ran faster than he ever had in school faster than hed ever run in his life philip ran he ran he ran wait what is this bill corde stood in the doorway to the lockup and watched one deputy on his knees leaning over the other one wait it was lance miller kissing him wait no what is this it was cpr lance miller whitefaced and blotched in sweat thrashed on the floor arms sweeping like he was waving down a rescue copter legs kicking whispering in between the county deputys smacks gedoff gedoff gedoff the deputy would pinch his nose then breathe air into his lungs corde said i dont think he needs that sall right ive done this before the rescuing deputy said as he put both hands on millers chest and pressed down hard the crack of the breaking rib was audible to corde miller muttered gedoff me and fainted didnt look like he was having a heart attack corde said look what i done said the rescuer standing up and looking heartsick corde knelt and checked millers pulse i dont think hes hurt too bad why dont you call the ambulance yeah i could do that the kid escaped he stood up and ran past corde to the phone what what should i call nine one one what do you mean he escaped clutching the phone the deputy blurted ran outa here five minutes ago hello we need a ambulance at the sheriffs office theres a injured deputy i was giving him cpr and he didnt take to it corde ran through the lockup out the back door then to the town hall exit door which swung wide into the sunlit parking lot outhouse fulla shit there was no sign of the fleeing boy he trotted back into the office just as the fire siren began its throaty wail corde had the dispatcher call ebbans in then he picked up the phone and dialed ribbons home hey ettie can you get him down here soons you can we got an escape yeah where fishing hells bells jim slocum ran through the open doorway passing the county deputy who kept an intense vigil for the ambulance whats up bill i just heard an ambulance call the halpern boys gone gone whatdya escaped is what i mean beat up lance bad no shit slocum grinned hell of a scrapper for a fat boy wheres steve saturday afternoon where dya think in his new goddamn truck he got a phone in it naw slocum said he was gonna put the old cb in but he didnt get around to it corde said get out a description but tell them go easy when apprehending i can say but it dont mean theyll do slocum walked off to the dispatchers office the medics streamed through the door with a low gurney and explored lance millers body carefully they gave him an injection then got him outside and into the ambulance he was awake again and cussing colorfully as they closed the door twenty minutes later ebbans arrived and mahoney five minutes after him great we got a killer out mahoney said after hed heard the news oh i guess i missed the trial corde said loud mahoney lifted his eyes to the ceiling slocum said happily we got ourselves some proof now i mean whys he escaping if he didnt do it corde looked at him as if hed asked where babies come from ebbans said we better call the state and tell them we got one loose you might want to mention the ribcracking deputy said hes got a gun outright silence every head in the room turned to him the deputy blushed then said forgot to say what with lance being down and all he got lances gun i thought hed gotten the speedloaders but theyd fallen under the bunk just the gun he got i was relieved to find the extra shells corde said nobodys supposed to go into the cells with a gun he didnt leave it in the box guess he forgot sweet mary corde whispered get on the horn he ordered slocum make it apb to county and state armed and emotionally disturbed tell them that hes scared but he doesnt want to hurt anybody mahoney asked you sound like youre in charge here detective i seem to recall youre under suspension the others looked at corde cautiously waiting for him to blow he however had not even heard the words he was in a different place altogether running through bushes and trees wheezing and hawking right next to philip halpern the boys fifteen so he doesnt have a drivers license hes probably trying to get out of the county on foot how would he do that slocum said i dont know i dont think weve ever had an escape situation here ebbans said what about a greyhound out of fredericksberg maybe corde said slowly how about the state park slocum said damn sure itll lead him right to the river and i bet he thinks hell snatch a canoe or boat and head south the door opened and harrison county sheriff hammerback ellison stepped into the office he was a solid heavy man but his face was pointed and delicate and he had very small feet and narrow ankles i just got the call the boy got away sure did ebbans stood up and picked up his hat and hes got a gun you and me ought to get over to the state park that okay with you bill ebbans asked his voice was strident he was challenging anybody to question the shift of authority back to corde bless you on this t t corde nodded and said to slocum jim why dont you take just on the chance that hes hitching ill take down to the river and see if i find him there slocum looked at ebbans who said do it jim then corde said to mahoney charlie maybe you ought to check out downtown he could be trying to outsmart us and hole up till night somewhere around here mahoney reluctantly said i dont think hes that smart but its not a bad idea they all hurried outside to the parking lot slocum got into his car and sped off ellison and ebbans vanished in a cloud of dust and tire smoke corde hung back he started the engine then drove slowly out of the parking lot he did not however make the right turn onto cress which would have taken him directly to route he turned left then slammed his foot onto the accelerator by the power of your wisdom by the strength of your might guide me o guardians to the lost dimension from darkness to light philip pauses to smell the deputys gun the scents are oil plastic and metal warmed to by the abundant flesh of his stomach it is a small gun but very heavy systems armed xaser torpedoes in launch tubes philip is in the woods that border his parents house he is surrounded by lean pines and the hot stems of wild sunflowers and long bowed grass within a frame of trees he can see the chevrolet he can see the tail of the duct tape that holds the station wagons grille which was shattered when his mother went off the road two years ago he can see the barbecue he can see the back porch with its lattice door open wide left that way by his father after digging up the purse philip can see the green of the sagging shack in the backyard under one eave of the shack is a huge skincreepy wasp nest that has weighed on his mind like a fat pimple for a week after he kills his father and after he kills jano the honon traitor he will fire the rest of the bullets into the wasp nest lock on target entering dimensional shift now no philip remembers he will not shoot all the bullets into the nest hell save one philip steps out of the woods and starts toward his house faith to the lost dimension from darkness to light doing that creth halpern said wont help much at all his wife looked at him curiously as if he hadnt spoken as if he were simply standing in front of her moving his mouth silently as if the words buzzed around her head like bees in an old cartoon they were both surprised at his comment it had been years since hed referred to her drinking his wife emptied the contents of the heavy glass into her throat and swallowed she poured another and replaced the plastic pitcher in a refrigerator that held kraft cheese slices a nearempty box of post toasties a package of grey ground beef a half quart of milk she leaned against the wall halpern gripped the screwdriver he was using to crack open a paintfrozen window he dug the blade into the seam and levered upward crushing the wood of the sill the window didnt budge damn his wife sipped the drink and looked out at a blooming lilac bush outside windows bordered with curtains on which were printed tiny brown tepees halpern for the life of him couldnt understand why she looked so good in the mornings a little puffyfaced at night eyes dead to all who bothered to look but that was the only real evidence last summer one of philips friends had hit on her a skinandbones high school kid halpern admitted she had a great body how could she pour down the beefeaters faster than any one of the guys down at the tap and still keep her face clean and her hair all permed up nice her nails done her legs shaved our son she said by way of announcement in jail he didnt do it hell be out tomorrow oh come on he did those things to her she didnt even sound drunk he wondered if hed just gotten used to it he tried to remember her voice when hed met her when hed first started hanging out in the new lebanon inn where she was waitressing he couldnt this saddened him greatly his wife said to a lumber yard calendar i cant call my mother how can i call her id be so ashamed he did some things to that girl yeah and he oughta be whipped and he will be but he didnt kill anybody ill swear to that what we should do is get some help oh sure how theres state help i guess talk to a i dont know somebody oh just like that sure if you made money maybe her voice clear as gin i put a roof over his head i put food in his mouth and yours too food and thats not all two digs in one day halpern was shaken if you made money i fucking make money you could make money too we could do a few things im stopping you from getting a job you dont remember you dont remember anything halpern said i cant talk to you when youre this way how come she asked curiously you dont fuck me anymore halperns temper blazed then died immediately to a simmer he considered openhanding her cheek but was paralyzed by a bottomless remorse he joined his wife in gazing out the window it occurred to him that most of their arguments happened just this way her drunk him thinking about other places and people both of them staring out the window wanting to smack her and not having the energy or the type of hate required oh go to hell his wife said as if giving directions halpern snatched up the screwdriver he squeezed it a dozen times feeling the resilience of the rubberized handle spattered in paint he stepped slowly to the kitchen sink leaned forward and dug the screwdriver furiously into the seam of the window cracking chunks out of the soft pine sill he heard a clatter of pans behind him he heard the sticky sound of the refrigerator door opening he heard the sound of pouring liquid he heard his wifes voice philip halpern turned the boy had entered through the back door and stood in the center of the kitchen when dyou get out his father asked he felt a horrid urge a salivating urge to step forward and bloody the boys nose to scream at him to scream what how could you do that to a poor girl how could you you stupid little prick to scream whatd i do to make you this way i loved you i really loved you im so sorry creth halpern stood completely still the screwdriver sliding from his hand he stood twenty feet away from his son whose upper lip glistened with snot and whose face was glossy with sweat his fat threedimensional chest heaving how did you his wife whispered oh my god creth halpern too saw the gun whatcha got there boy he asked philips head turned to his mother the glass fell from her grip hitting the floor and whipping a tail of liquor against the refrigerator her smooth hands tipped in unchipped red nails went to her mouth philip turned back to his father the boys mouth moved but no words came out it was the mouth of a fish eating water finally he swallowed then said in a weak voice the handy mans here listen up young man put that gun down the handy man his mother said philip dont do this she sobbed please dont do this i never did anything to you the boy said to his father son philip held the gun up and said handy man handyman handymanhandyman i only wanted to help you son i never did anything to you philip whispered son i know you didnt hurt those girls you were talking to the sheriff i saw you i was giving him that purse you hid the note the note was inside you know what im talking about it shows you didnt kill her in a voice more assured and more adult and more frightening than halpern had ever heard philip said im sorry dad but the handy mans here i wanted to help you his father said philip said hold out your hand bill corde stepped silently past a drowsy old mutt chained to the worn railing of the front porch he slipped through the door and made his way toward the back of the house along the pink carpet runner stained with dark patches he smelled dog piss and old food and bleach he could see philip in the kitchen holding the dark gray gun he could see halpern nearby he could see a womans white arm ending in long polished nails corde stopped in the dining room outside the kitchen doorway he left his revolver holstered then took off his hat and set it on a dusty sanyo tv he paused next to the dining room table which was covered with sticky soiled dishes and scraps of food crusts from last nights pizza in the center of the formica a large paisley spill of ketchup had coagulated darkly hi philip corde said softly creth halpern jumped at the sound his wifes shocked face appeared in the doorway philip looked at the detective uninterested then back to his father and said hold out your hand halpern said slowly to corde hes got himself a gun hold up your hand halpern raised his hands above his head no not up handy man is here hold out your hand you know how to do it phil corde said the boy looked at him for a minute then back to his father when corde moved a step closer to the living room philip raised the gun to the center of his fathers chest philip corde said speaking casually why dont you set the gun down would you please his parents looked helplessly at corde he saw despair in their faces and he saw that the boys father wore it the hardest please honey please son his mother was whimpering philip looked at her he smiled he said open the refrigerator please honey open it she screamed and tore open the door philip held the gun up and fired a ringing deafening shot into the bottom of the pitcher the stained beige rubbermaid exploded in a mist of gin his mother screamed again neither corde nor halpern moved philip turned back to corde corde said nobodys going to hurt you philip laughed triumphantly you think i dont know about that thats what they tried with dathar they tried to fool him they lied to him but he didnt believe them we want to help you phil jamie turned me in corde said sternly no he didnt i talked he did he didnt corde shouted furiously risking the boys reaction i talked to him about what happened some people at the sheriffs office tricked him he didnt know they followed him he was trying to save you he has a message for you corde held his hand in the naryan salute the gun in philips hand wobbled he said that he sure did philip nodded and smiled weakly then he turned to his father and spoke in a mournful voice you didnt come to see me they said i couldnt there was visiting hours i was coming tonight like at the hospital when we went to visit gram they said i could only come at four oclock philip looked at corde who said thats true philip its the sheriffs department rules the boys eyes swept the floor outside when he heard the gunshot and the scream charlie mahoney put aside the motorola walkietalkie on which hed just called tt ebbans and hammerback ellison he pulled his federally licensed automatic pistol out of his pocket and started up the porch stairs after following corde here he had waited on the front steps considering what to do next the gunshot ended the debate crouching taking a fast look through the rusted torn screen he pulled the door open and crawled onto the porch the lime green indooroutdoor carpet was filthy and mahoneys expensive gray plaid slacks ended up hoofmarked on the knees with dirt he watched them talking corde and the halperns until the two squad cars silently pulled up he crawled back to the door opened it and motioned the men forward ebbans and ellison went around back and slocum and a county deputy held up on the front steps where mahoney signaled them to stay mahoney crawled into the living room son please theres nothing to be gained by this philip your father and mother and i want to help you the boy was crying now hes always hitting me i dont do anything but he hits me i want you to be strong halpern said thats all i know you have it in you its going to be all right theyll see the note and youll be free tell him about the letter corde corde asked letter halpern said desperately the note tell him mahoney stood then walked along the corridor into the dining room holding his breath not only to keep silent but to keep the stink of the dog piss and rotting food out of his nostrils what note halpern corde asked didnt the sheriff tell you mahoney eased forward a board creaked corde spun around and saw him no the boys silverdollar eyes saw mahoney and he raised the gun mahoney did the same corde lifted his arms palms out his back to philip and stepped in between them his nerves bristled at the thought of a smith wesson muzzle ten feet behind him and a browning automatics the same distance in front mahoney what the hell are you doing here you fucking son of a bitch corde get out of the way you fucking get out of here youve got no business corde was shouting mahoney was dancing in the doorway jockeying for a target the boy stood frozen with fear the muzzle pointed at cordes spine philip corde shouted over his shoulder drop the gun youll be okay just get the fuck out of the way mahoney shouted philips hand drooped his father looked at him and said put it down son please the gun sank lower a shadow flashed across the kitchen floor mahoney shouted drop it and fired two shots into the ceiling ebbans and ellison leapt into the kitchen philip whirling toward them ellison screaming in panic hes shooting hes shooting take him out the mens hands vanished in ragged flares of muzzle bursts mahoney dropped to the carpet one slug hissed past cordes left ear as he collapsed on the floor philip spun around and around then he fell corde scrabbled toward him shouting no no no philips father stood frozen his right hand outstretched toward his son in the enormous silence that followed charlie mahoney stood up and steadied himself on a pink metal table he knocked off a flower pot which broke and scattered a wiry geranium along the carpet a flower as red and dazzling as the artery blood that sprang from philips neck and chest and soaked the filthy floor that may at one time have been white book harrison county shooting incident inquiry board summary of findings the matter before the board is the death of a minor philip arthur halpern the suspect who was shot and killed by county peace officers after an escape from new lebanon town jail where the suspect had been incarcerated following indictment on charges of murder manslaughter rape and sodomy on the afternoon of may the suspect was struck by shots fired by thomas t ebbans chief deputy and bradford ellison sheriff harrison county it was determined that deputy ebbans fired two shots hitting the suspect twice in the chest and sheriff ellison fired four times hitting the suspect once in the neck all bullets were recovered the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene the facts surrounding the shooting are not in dispute when shot the suspect was holding a loadedcaliber smith wesson pistol which he had taken from a new lebanon town deputy whom he had severely beaten when he escaped earlier in the day the suspect acted in a deranged manner and it apparently was his intention to shoot his father also present were the suspects mother new lebanon detective william corde and charles mahoney a licensed and bonded private investigator from missouri who was acting as consultant to the new lebanon sheriffs department as detective corde was attempting to talk the suspect into surrendering sheriff ellison and deputy ebbans approached from the rear entrance to the house mr mahoney stated that the suspect suddenly raised the gun and according to mr mahoney was about to discharge his weapon at detective corde and myself causing me to fear for our safety mr mahoney fired two shots at the suspect missing both times sheriff ellison and deputy ebbans heard these shots and assumed the suspect who had turned and was pointing his gun at them had begun firing they returned gunfire which resulted in the suspects death it is the conclusion of the board that the shooting of the suspect was justifiable and that both sheriff ellison and deputy ebbans acted within the boundaries of prudent law enforcement detective corde testified that the suspect had not been about to fire and we agree that mr mahoney was perhaps premature in firing the shots that precipitated the killing however that was a judgment he made during an extremely stressful confrontation and this board is prepared to accept that his behavior was justified under the circumstances testimony was given by the suspects father that prior to the incident he delivered to sheriff steven ribbon of the new lebanon sheriffs department a note purporting to be evidence casting doubt on the suspects guilt sheriff ribbon testified that he felt the note was of such importance that he personally took it to the state laboratory for forensic analysis and through a miscommunication none of the law enforcement officers at the scene of the shooting were made aware of the notes existence however the existence and authenticity of the note bear solely on the issue of the suspects innocence with respect to his prime indictments in one of the murders of which he was accused they are irrelevant with respect to the escape and the incidents of assault that led to the shooting therefore this board of inquiry concludes that l the death of philip arthur halpern was justifiable the death shall not be presented for inquest to the grand jury of the county of harrison no grounds exist to dismiss suspend fine or in any way reprimand sheriff bradford ellison or deputy thomas t ebbans on the basis of the events occurring in the house of creth a halpern on may here is bill corde he writes three parking violations after turning the thick handles of the meters to make sure that the perpetrators are in fact out of time and didnt just forget to crank in their coins this is not generosity on cordes part nobody argues with cops more vehemently than parking violators he stops trudy parsons gremlin to tell her that the blinker in her right turn signal is on the fritz and the left rear is low too he tanks up a plymouth and sits in a speed trap for half the day catching himself nothing but one salesman from chicago he gives the man a ticket not a warning because the driver is wearing a fish gray silk suit and a pinkie ring and has a dark tan and here it is just mid may howdy fells that wouldnt be a beer you got in there would it reason i ask is neither of you look like youre eighteen so if it is i sure hope youre going to tell me that you just found those cans in the street and are about to dump them out and take them to a p for the nickel is that right corde has requested a hearing on the charge of destroying jennie gebbens letters because he has been reinstated and the inquest has been canceled the district attorney tells him a hearing would be moot corde looks up the word moot then he debates for a time and files another notice seeking the hearing a day later he receives a call from the judges clerk telling him that the application was rejected and they will be sending him a notice to that effect by registered mail return receipt requested corde receives another official communication this one is from the missouri attorney generals office it thanks him for his letter and says that someone from the office will be checking on the propriety of private investigation and firearm licenses issued to one charles mahoney a resident of st louis the county sheriffs department officially closes both the gebben and the rossiter cases when corde asks to see this note or whatever it is that creth halpern gave to ribbon hammerback ellison himself calls up corde at home and reminds him that the cases have been disposed of he uses those words disposed of corde says he understands but could he still see the note ellison says sorry its been sent to the archive files corde goes to one of jamies wrestling matches and watches the boy lose bad the family was planning to eat out afterward but nobody is in the mood after the loss jamie says hes going out with some teammates and corde and diane and sarah drive home for french toast corde forms mixed feelings about dr parker who has just depleted exactly threefifths of the cordes savings account and has turned sarah into a storytelling fiend the girl has used up four tape cassettes with her book when corde asks her how long the book will be she tells him a million jillion pages and corde says thats pretty long how long will it take to read she answers forever one day corde finds her looking out over the backyard longfaced he asks her whats wrong thinking her studies are troubling her she says shes afraid that the sunshine man her wizard is gone for good she hasnt seen him for a long time corde would like to console her but he does not know what to say he tells her to get washed up its time for dinner and she sadly complies diane is glad that sarah is off the ritalin since shes just joined the drugfree america task force of the sesquicentennial celebration committee and will be personally responsible for the fourth of july just say no float one morning in their bedroom diane paints on makeyourmancrazy red nail polish and corde watches the color go on but what he thinks of is the smell which reminds him of the dope he brushed on the balsawood airplanes as a boy to stiffen the paper wings this in turn makes him think of philip halpern he doesnt tell his wife this thought but just says my you look nice oh yes diane is also his source of information about sarahs tutor ben breck corde still hasnt met him though hed like to sarah has improved remarkably since theyve been working together sarah talks about breck often but corde doesnt feel jealous of this displaced attention though he thinks of the months and months of agony he himself has been through as he worked with her and here this fellow turns her around in a couple of weeks what can you do corde goes fishing with jamie they get into their aluminum canoe and push off into the deep reservoir their permits are in order and corde has with him a knotted length of string to make sure that the bass they take are legal corde hopes a big needlenosed pike or musky has come south he would like to trophy it for jamies wall the boy continues to be morose and uncommunicative corde hashes it over with himself then finally asks bluntly if he wants to talk about philip and jamie says no he doesnt five minutes later though out of the blue the boy says he sort of thinks that philip thought jamied turned him in they beach the canoe and sit together on a slab of steelcolor rock corde explains that he told philip before he was shot that jamie didnt turn him in at all that jamie got tricked philip understood and believed that corde puts thirtynine years of sincerity into this speech jamies expression doesnt change and they silently return to fishing five minutes later jamie asks if corde will be at the final wrestling match in two weeks and corde says that nothing hell or high water or a sale at sears will keep him away the boys face comes close to a smile and with the nod he gives his father corde knows theyre back on track corde calls wynton kresge at his office and is shocked to hear the secretary say that hes no longer with the school does that mean hes quit corde asks or been fired she says it means hes no longer with the school he calls kresge at home but he isnt there or hes told his wife to say he isnt corde leaves a message here is bill corde driving out to dark blackfoot pond the dark dam the dark trees the graygreen mud getting out of the cruiser walking through the tangled brush theres nothing much to see thanks to the sightseers the fishermen two powerout rainstorms and one tornado that vaulted over new lebanon the other day spraying branches and a million justborn leaves all over the murder scene here is bill corde flipping a dull quarter over his fingers as he walks through the site of paired deaths over ground that for him fairly trembles beneath his feet the case is closed but here he walks here he bends to the ground and kicks at twigs and leaves and the flattened disks of beer cans here he pauses at times and squints into the deeper forest then moves on here is bill corde you know the one i mean the man was asking he was lean bald and wore a blue suit whose polyester fibers glistened like mica down the front of his white shirt a redandblack striped tie hung stiff as a paint stirrer the plant out on walt i want to explain let me explain professor randy sayles wasnt feeling well although he was tearfully relieved that the gebben investigation was over and the halpern boy was buried he had learned that the financial situation of the university was worse than dean larraby had at first let on she had called the day before to tell him an additional million was needed to the man in whose office he now sat sayles said patiently go ahead explain she was valued at nine we loaned seven and when we foreclosed the marketd turned and it was worth five thats a twohundredthousand bad loan and we ate up our reserve by february because of a dozen just like her no a dozen and a half the office did not much look like a bank presidents it was closer to a truvalue managers there was some blotchy modern litho up on the wall but sayles saw a sticker on the side of the frame and knew he wasnt looking at the real article you dont generally get much in the way of investment art at walgreens especially at a twoforone sale sayles pulled a packet of papers out of his briefcase i wouldnt be here hat in hand if it werent serious walt were looking at a shortfall of close to thirteen million this year thingsre tough all over sayles tried not to sound desperate he pictured himself up in front of his class assured smiling humorous everything hed learned in twenty years of teaching he brought to bear on this man weve got benefactor commitments of about seven were talking to the banker too was used to theatrics look out that window what do you see sayles counterattacked i see a city thatll suffer to its very heart if auden university closes nice try the banker smiled and shook his head im talking about that building not fifty yards up the street plainsmans s l the rtcs moved in and shes in conservatorship theyre going to sell it off were more solid but not a lot the loan committee no wayll it approve auden a penny the bankers voice remained a low calm monotone as he twisted his curly eyebrow with his thumb and ring finger he dressed in pastel plastic cloth he had yellow teeth and glistening seethrough hair and under the veneer desk he kept a casual beat with crinkly black monkey ward shoes sayles knew however that wall street had nothing on this guy auden closes sayles said itll be a tragedy itll be a tragedy but itll be more of a tragedy if i write a bad loan and the us attorney up in higgins indicts me oh come on walt its not like youre buying yourself a porsche theyre not going to arrest you for loaning money to a university the banker looked at sayles and seemed to be taking his pulse sayles thought im just like the farmers he disbursed loans to loans written on the strength of bad collateral and their desperation facing the loss of two hundred years worth of family land randy sayles associate dean of financial aid knew that you never saw a person as clearly as when you hand him a large check the professor said what if we gave you a piece of the new dorm it cost twentythree million cost aint worth and if we foreclosed itd be because the school went under and what goods a dorm without a school to go with it land aloned be worth three million not with an empty dorm sitting on it you got the parking lot right on the highway im sorry these two words lanced sayless heart he stood up and said with a despair that made both men extremely uncomfortable you were my last chance neither said a word for a moment sayles picked up his financials and put them into his battered briefcase he started out the door hold up professor sayles turned and saw in the mans face a debate the banker arrived at a disagreeable conclusion writing a name and number on a piece of paper he said im not doing this you didnt get this from me you dont know me sayles looked at the scrawl fred barrett next to the name was a phone number area code chicago who is he after a pause the banker said i dont know what youre talking about he found it completely by accident because brian okun had made up the rumor that jennie gebben and leon gilchrist were lovers he had not bothered to do what he had promised the dean look through the professors office for evidence he would have been content to tell her that he had made a futile search and let it go at that then when gilchrist turned in okuns scathing evaluation okun would claim that gilchrist was seeking retribution for his espionage a delightful symmetry to the whole matter the whole affair you might say this was a good plan but he thought of a much better one when placing a sheet of student grades on gilchrists desk he noticed an envelope addressed in flowery script to the professor the writer was a young woman student okun lifted the crinkly envelope and found to his huge amusement the paper was perfumed gilchrist finally back from san francisco was at the moment lecturing his class and the graduate assistant immediately sat down in the professors chair and opened the unsealed envelope the poem scanned very badly thought okun the critic when the memory of you swallows me the way i took your lovely cock into my mouth he decided he would have given it a d for form and a c minus for content your thinking is unoriginal your meter too unvaried and honey is a hopelessly trite metaphor for semen this didnt matter however because he believed the poem would have at least one ardent reader okun now sat in dean larrabys office watching her flick the poem with a tough wrinkled index finger you didnt she hesitated you didnt get it out of his mailbox it wasnt stamped or postmarked you stupid fool how could it have been mailed okun said mildly id never do anything illegal it was lying out on his desk whos the girl doris cutting student of his i dont know anything about her do you know if he took her to san francisco with him i just said i dont know her senile already okun frowned i wonder this is enough for me its hard for me to speak against him okun said hes taught me so much but to sleep with a student its a very vulnerable time for young people i used to respect him his mouth tightened into a little bundle of disappointment well fire him we have no choice its got to be done well wait till the semesters over his last lectures when two days ill tell him afterward after the students have gone well want to minimize publicity youll keep this quiet until then he nodded gravely whatever youd like dean okun stood and started for the door oh brian as he turned she said i just wanted to say im sorry i know this was difficult for you to put the school above your personal loyalty i wont forget it sometimes okun said as immanuel kant tells us sacrifices must be made for a higher good you said youd polish them ill polish them you said today ill polish them today amos trout said slouching in his lopsided green naugahyde easy chair he scooped up the remote control and turned the volume up his lean wattleskinned wife poured the swans down cake mix into a pyrex bowl and decided he wasnt going to get away with it she set down the egg and said when i was to church ada kemple looked right down at my feet there was nothing else for yards around had tove been my feet and if that woman didnt have a gleam in her eye when she surfaced i dont know what i liked to die of embarrassment i said id polish them here she handed him the navy blue pumps as if she were offering him dueling pistols trout took them then looked at the tv screen it wouldntve been so bad if chicago wasnt playing new york and it wasnt the bottom of the sixth and the score wasnt tied with mets goahead on third and only one out but she had spoken and so amos trout turned the sound up again and carried the shoes down to the basement dont seem so scuffed that the toothless bitch ada kemple has anything to snicker about through her smear of cheap pasty makeup a grounder to left snagged by the shortstop backhand what a catch therell be a play at home the runner click the tv went silent his wifes footsteps sounded above him on their way back to the kitchen ah it hurts sometimes it hurts trout grimaced then snatched a newspaper from the huge stack that had accumulated while theyd been on vacation in minnesota he spread it out on the mottled brown linoleum he stood slowly and got the paraphernalia the blue polish the brush the buffing cloth and set it all out in front of him he picked up each shoe and examined the amount of work he turned one upside down a broken toenail like a chip of fogged ice fell out he set the shoe down on the newspaper and as he applied polish he focused past the shoes to the paper itself trout read for a moment then stood up he tossed the shoes on top of the clothes dryer one left a long blue streak on the enameled metal he carried the newspaper into the kitchen where his wife sat crosslegged chatting on the phone the game was too loud she said to him i shut it off then returned to the phone he said hang up her neck skin quivered at the command she blinked at him im talking to my mother hang up she looked at the yellowed rotary dial for an explanation of this madness ill call you back mom he took the receiver from her and pressed the button down to clear the line what are you doing making a phone call arent you going to polish my shoes no he said im not and began to dial the oakwood mall how bill corde hated malls oh the stores were clean the prices reasonable sears guaranteed satisfaction and where in the whole of the world did you get that nowadays without more strings attached than you could count here you could buy hot egg rolls and tacos and mrs fields dense cookies and frozen yogurt you could slip your arm around your wife walk her into victorias secret and park her in front of a mannequin wearing red silk panties and bra and a black garter belt then kiss her neck while she squirmed and blushed and let you buy her well not that outfit but a nice sexy nightgown but malls for corde meant the fairway mall in st louis where two policemen had died because of him and that was why he never came here he glanced at toys r us in the window a cardboard cutout of dathariv stood over an army of warriors from the lost dimension corde looked at this for a moment then walked on until he found floors for all he wasnt more than ten feet inside before a sportscoated man all of twentyone pounced i know who you are the kid said youre a man with a naked floor im floors are just like you and me we want new threads sometimes so does your floor it gets tired of the same old outfit whats in your closet right now a doublebreasted suit slacks bermudas izod shirts ha a khaki uniform or two ha am i right think how jealous your floor is no you dont know what a difference new carpeting makes to your peace of mind to your marriage he was a pit bull with a feeble blond mustache do you want to talk about stress what colors your carpet now im not really interested bare floors whoa lets talk stress no carpet just amos trout youre not here to buy carpet no detective trout came out from the back room they shook hands hey sheriff the kid said your police station have carpeting trout waved him away when they were seated by trouts desk corde said eager haw no pain in the ass but he sells carpet hell be down at the nissan dealership in three years and probably selling boeings by the time hes twentyeight i cant keep boys like that long corde asked you said you saw the ad in the register the wife and i were to minnesota on vacation for a while after that murder happened just a coincidence but i saw it when i spread out the paper to shine her shoes you shine your wifes shoes officer they do love it dont they now tell me you were driving along route that night thatd be tuesday night april thats right i was driving home it was about ten tenthirty or so that tuesday was our acrylic pile sale and wed done so well id had to stay late to log in the receipts and mark down whichre checks whichre charges whichre cash you get the picture so i got me a slurpee and was driving past the pond when this man suddenly runs into the road in front of me what happened was that my left high beams out of whack and i dont think he could see me coming because there was this bush hanging out into the road that the county really oughta take care of you had a clear view sure did there he was in front of me leaping like a toad on july asphalt then he saw me and just froze and i swerved out of the way and that was that was there a car nearby yessir but i didnt see what kind was it light or dark the car lighter moren darker you recall the plates dont even know if it had plates or was a truck or sedan i just didnt notice i was so concerned with not running that man over what was left of the slurpee went onto the floor and for the first time i was glad i got the maroon interior he was a man not a boy not a boy nope probably late thirties early forties could you describe him solid build but not fat short hair not real dark combed straight back he was wearing dark pants and a light jacket but the jacket was covered with dirt white pardon what was his race oh yeah he was white jewelry hats shoes no like i say i swerved past him real fast if you saw a picture of him would you remember it like in a lineup or something i could try anything else you remember no nothing unusual try to think back no nothing well except i figured he was handy i mean he knew about cars he was going to replace the ignition cable himself not everybody can do that thats why i almost stopped to help him ignition cable but it was late and the wife gets a bee in her bra i dont get home by eleven sale or no he was working on the car not exactly he was carrying that piece of wire over to it could you describe it you know ignition wire white thick looked to be wrapped in plastic like from napa could itve been rope like clothesline amos trout went silent for a moment could very wellve been diane walked into the living room and found ben breck cutting letters out of sandpaper sarah sat on the couch watching him i owe you a new pair of scissors he said beg pardon he said i only had coarse sandpaper it pretty much ruined the blade well now i wouldnt worry about it diane said what exactly are you doing storage breck said solemnly and handed an e to sarah touch it feel it sarah ran her hand over the letter e she said the letter joined storag on the table sarah spelled the word out loud touching each letter breck scooped them up and hid them behind his back and would hand her one at a time eyes closed the girl would touch it then tell him which letter it was diane watched engrossed in the drill after ten minutes he said thats it for today sarah you did very well but keep working on the b and the d and the q and the p you get those mixed up i will dr breck sarah assembled the sandpaper letters and put them into her barbie backpack in which she kept her tape recorder cassettes and exercises she was working on diane slipped her arm around her daughter breck said next thursday fine diane said ill be home all day then she added well be home i mean sarah ran outside ill be back later mom stay close to home breck and diane walked into the kitchen and diane poured two cups from a braun coffee maker without asking if he wanted any breck glanced at her red polished nails then his eyes slipped to her blouse two buttons open at the chest he seemed to enjoy the route his gaze followed she reserved judgment on this reaction she reserved judgment on her own as well breck spent a long moment studying a picture of corde in uniform it was taped to the refrigerator next to an eagle sarah had cut out of construction paper it must be exciting being married to a policeman more of an inconvenience id say we get calls at all hours and our friends are always wanting bill to do something about p z or fixing tickets or something ever been married ben she had checked his heart finger at their first meeting no never have been so lucky he sipped the coffee diane watched him closely that too strong theres hot tap water our boiler gets it to about one fortyfive its fine diane said the thing about bill is hes obsessive he you probably mean compulsive i do compulsive is when you do something repetitively obsessive is when you think about something repetitively oh well then hes both they laughed and she continued he just doesnt stop hes a workaholic not that i mind keeps him out of my hair and when hes home hes pretty much home if you know what i mean but once he gets his mind set hes like a terrier got hold of a rat last night i went to bed and he was still burning the midnight oil bill says a case is like building a brick wall there are always plenty of bricks if you take the trouble to look for them and he takes the trouble whoa thats true ive been an expert witness in court a few times testifying on the psychology of observation how witnesses can see things that arent there and miss things that are the senses are extraordinarily unreliable all i know is i dont get much involved in his cases its so you know grim its different when you watch it on television so why hasnt he been married ive done research into violence breck said two associates of mine have done work with sociopaths is that like a psychopath like you know tony curtis in psycho tony perkins i believe right right fortyone and never married theyve worked with some pretty odious characters odious and their theory is that commercial entertainment does a disservice when it minimizes violence that it tends to distort mental judgment and leads to situations where individuals act violently because they feel the impact in human terms will be inconsequential were seeing dianes palms moistened as she leaned forward trying to follow what he said many cases of blunted affect on the part of young people in response to films and uhm affect he saw that hed lost her and shook his head in apology affect it means emotion kids see people getting blown up and murdered on screen and it doesnt move them they dont feel anything or worse they laugh id rather jamie didnt watch those movies well look at his friend they got caught up in that lost dimension look what happened that boy who killed the girls breck asked he might have been influenced by the movie the corner of dianes mouth hardened well even with him getting killed and all bill still doesnt think the boy did it he doesnt breck asked with surprise but your bodyguard is gone wait till the story hits the news story theres a new witness she slung the words bitterly but the papers all said the boy did it the papers and just about everybody else in town they were all too happy to close the case but not my bill oh no hes still investigating he doesnt give up he went charging off this morning after some new lead he thinks he can prove the boy didnt do it diane noted the anger in her voice as she gazed outside at the spot where toms cruiser had been parked all these long weeks when youre young when youre sarahs age everythings clear all the endings are tidy you know who the bad guys are and if they get away at least theyre still the bad guys at our age who knows anything breck finished the coffee you have a lovely home here it seemed to diane that he said it wistfully but before she heard anything that confirmed that impression he added know what id like name it she said smiling coquettish as a barmaid lets go for a walk show me your property well sure she pulled a jacket on and they walked outside she showed him her herb garden then the muddy strip of potential lawn then the spots where the bulbs wouldve come up if the deer hadnt been at them breck muttered appreciative comments then strolled toward the back of the lot and its low postandrail fence lets check out the woods uhun diane said leading him around to the side we have to go the long way around that little fence we can jump it cant we breck asked uhm see those cows what about them how expensive are those sheecawgo shoes of yours she asked oh he said got it they both laughed as they walked around the pasture and into the strip of tall grass and knobby oak saplings that bordered the forest diane wasnt the least surprised when out of view of the house breck took her hand nor was she surprised that she let him werent the boy after all uhuh they got a new witness their eyes would make troubled circuits of the room following the greengray checkers of linoleum to their conclusion in the dark reaches of the county building cafeteria then theyd turn back to watch the halfmoons of ice slowly water their cokes necessitates something the man speaking was fat through a shortsleeved white shirt his belly worked on the elasticity of his sears waistband he had white hair crisp with dried vitalis combed back his name was jack treadle and in addition to other jobs he was supervisor of harrison county all aspects of his face had jowls eyes mouth chin he poked his little finger into his cheek to rub a tooth through skin suppose so said the other man just as jowly though not so fat he too wore shortsleeved white and on top of it a cameltan sports coat bull cooper was a real estate broker and the mayor of new lebanon these two were major players in the oval office of harrison county way it sizes up treadle said the boy cooper said defensively he had a gun well he mayve but i dont give two turds about the incident report we shouldnta arrested him we shouldnta let him get loose we shouldnta shot him down well hi ho the derryo somebodys gonna get fucked for this boy got shot bad cooper agreed got shot dead treadle snorted around them slowtalking smalltown lawyers and their clients ate liverwurst sandwiches and plates of macaroni and cheese while they waved away excited spring flies treadle was a man who did best with ignorant friends and small enemies he was in his element here and had nodded greetings to half the room during the course of this meal he said hammerback and ribbon were playing cute i mean shit they were playing bigtime sheriffs and they wanted press they wanted a big bust and they wanted to tie that other coed killing last year in with all this serial killer goat skinner fucking crap well they got press all right which are now wondering why we let a innocent kid get killed we got the sbi looking over our shoulder and we probably got some ethics panel up in higgins about to poke its finger up our ass we gotta give em somebody i mean shit and youre thinking somebody from new lebanon i know you are cooper hawked and cleared his mouth with a thick napkin naw naw dont matter to me if we pick a county man and i make the announcement then it looks good for me if hes town and you make the announcement its good for you you know like it hurts us to do it but were cleaning out our own no coverup i didnt think of that cooper relaxed then added what about that mahoney what about him corde copied me on this letter he sent the missouri ag he wants mahoneys nuts corde does whoa ribbons got a feather in his ass over that ill tell you whats the point cooper said mahoney shouldntve even been on the case hes a civilian well treadle guffawed i dont give a shit about mahoney whats dones done things like mahoney fall through the cracks and thats the way of the world whats the options who bites the big one theres ellison treadle offered casually stating the obvious then theres ribbon but if its somebody too high up itll look bad for us like you and me werent enough in charge cooper said we had a couple county deputies working on the case and bill corde was running the investigation for a while cordes a smart guy and he he treadle stammered as he groped for a thought found this new witness he found this witness treadle agreed and he he doesnt take any crap cooper offered no he doesnt take any crap but cooper said slowly theres the trouble what trouble didnt you hear he mayve accidentally on purpose lost some evidence there was word hed been fucking the gebben girl she was a regular little cyouknowwhat anyway some letters or shit got burnt up that mayve connected her with corde they dropped the investigation what investigation what im saying about corde about him eightysixing the evidence but he wasnt ever found innocent they just dropped it treadles eyes brightened think thats something we can use i suppose that depends cooper said on whether we want to use it or not bill corde was talking on the pay phone to diane it was after dusk and he was in front of dreggs variety perilously close to route every sixth or seventh car whipped by so fast he felt his uniform tugged by the slipstream as if the drivers were playing a fun game of copgrazing jamie corde asked whats the matter with him he got home late he didnt call or anything i want you to talk to him its the second night in a row well i will but im corde let the cyclone from a mack eighteenwheeler spin past then continued but im a little busy right at the moment this lead on the gebben case hes okay diane said testily of course hes okay i just said hes okay im out here on the highway corde said to explain his distraction then he added ill talk to him tonight i dont want you to talk to him i wanted what nothing corde ignored the brittleness and asked hows sarah she had a good session with ben and she said she did two more chapters of her book the insurance money didnt come again today i was thinking maybe you should call im out here in the middle of the highway diane continued its over two thousand mom had her ovaries out for three thousand five im so glad bens only twenty an hour thats a lifesaver right whos ben oh the tutor well corde said thats good i better go wait one more thing the team cant get a bus for the match in higgins jamie wants to know if we can drive him and davey i guess sure you wont forget its the last match of the season i wont forget another car was approaching this one didnt speed past it stopped corde looked up and saw steve ribbon and jack treadle looking at him ribbon was solemn oh brother it was jack treadles car a bottomoftheline mercedes though it had a big fancy car phone they pulled in front of cordes cruiser and parked the two men got out he realized diane was saying something to him he said gotta go be back around eight he hung up treadle stayed in the car ribbon walked toward corde they nodded greetings hows that lead of yours panning out bill he asked with no interest slow but were making progress ribbon said how about we walk over that way he pointed to a shady spot of newcut grass beside an enormous oak something familiar here havent we done this before corde walked along under the trees massive branches studying ribbons expression then focusing on treadles he fished a nickel out of his pocket and did the coin trick there were many things to think about but the one concern he settled on was purely practical how he was going to break the news to diane that hed been fired we could sell the car diane corde had been cleaning out the cupboards there were cans and boxes covering the counters and tabletop corde pulled off his shoes and sat at the kitchen table a porkandbeans can rolled toward him he caught it as it fell off the table he read the label for a moment then set it down again the car he asked diane said you got the axe aint the end of the world we can sell the second car dont need it anyway and thatll save us the insurance and upkeep he looked back at the bottle why you think i got fired you looking as mournful as you do presently got something to do with it bill corde said they offered me the job of sheriff after all these years of marriage there were still a few times when she couldnt tell when he was joking she put away two cans of pinto beans reached for a third then stopped corde said im serious im guessing thered be a little more to it they bailed steve ribbon out he blew the case bad but hes in tight with bull cooper and jack treadle so theyre moving him up to some plush job with the county im sheriff jim slocum takes over on felony investigations tt got fired with this new witness we know that philip was innocent they needed somebody to blame for the boys death tt took the hit but i thought there was an inquiry hes not been charged with anything hes just been fired thats too bad i always liked him hes a good man hes a damn good man corde said vehemently she sat on the kitchen chair that corde held out for her theyd refinished these chairs themselves a memory smell of the sulfury rock magic stripper came back to him she said and its tts the reason youre upset partly and id have to give up investigating so what youre worried about is sitting behind a desk yeah corde said then figuring he shouldnt be lying to her at least when it was so clear a lie no what it is is slocumd take over the gebben case well corde laughed honey ive worked with slocum for years god bless him but jim could catch a killer liming the body with the victims wallet in his hip pocket and the murder knife in his teeth and hed still screw up the case diane stared at the groceries for a long moment as if looking for something good about the deputy she said i guess im not inclined to let go of this one diane said you wont like my question but i suppose theyd be paying you more money some how much five hundred thousand ah there was enough reverence in her voice to send a bristle of pain all the way through corde diane stood up the third bean can joined its siblings on the shelf and then she started on the spices you havent eaten what should we have for dinner you interested in burritos i dont want this fellow to get away slocum taking the case doesnt mean hes going to get away jim wont be the only one working on it will he be therell be some rookie from the county probably the cases an embarrassment now they just want it to go away diane gave up on the packaged goods just let me ask you say this fellow hadnt left those pictures of sarrie for us would you still be this hot after him maybe not that hadnt happened youd take the job corde said i always wanted to be sheriff well he didnt do anything to sarrie and hes gone now hes scooted hasnt he maybe not necessarily diane paused for a moment youve wanted this for a long time everybody in town thinks more of you than steve ribbon you could get yourself elected as often as you want i cant tell you i dont want it bad and i better say it with steve gone they need a new sheriff itll be either me or slocum were senior diane said well honey i dont think you should pass it up you cant be working for jim i just cant see that at all corde smiled in frustration itd be hard to do that to new lebanon believe you me she ripped open a cello pack of beef chuck cubes they fell out glistening and soft on the cutting board she picked up a knife and began to slice the cubes smaller she wished she could talk to ben breck about this not ask his advice but just tell him what she felt without looking at her husband she said ive got to be honest with you bill she rarely used his name sometimes in connection with expensive presents hed just given her more often in connection with sentences like that one jamies coming up on college age in a few years and you know all about dr parkers bills five thousandd go a long way corde said they were silent for a long time diane broke the stillness okay ive said what i wanted to why dont you go talk to jamie hes got to call if hes going to be out past suppertime he just came back then went into his room without saying hello or anything and hes listening to some goshawful rock music thats got screams and howling on it well maybe that means hes feeling better he could celebrate feeling better by getting home when hes supposed to and listening to the bee gees or sinatra im not in the mood for giving him a talkingto tonight maybe tomorrow i will she wiped her hands full of dust and old flour corde was studying the ingredients of budweiser and didnt see her wrench her lips into a narrow grimace or tighten her hand into a fist he doesnt want to do anything at all for those two girls dead by the pond who wouldnt be dead if they hadnt been where they shouldntve campus sluts both of them no no he wants to save those cops he thinks he laid out on the concrete floor of fairway mall laid them out like the broken dolls they seemed to be on the front page of the postdispatch well its too late for them bill its too late diane said to her husband quit looking so glum you think about it tonight and whatever you decide were still going to have my special burritos for dinner then well watch that farrah fawcett movie and ill let you guess who the killer is now go water that new strip of lawn whatever the birdsve left and she turned back to the sink smiling brightly and scalded with anger at herself for this complete cowardice at eightthirty in the morning bill corde walked into the sheriffs department and hung up his blue jacket and his hat then he went into steve ribbons office where he saw assembled the whole of the department except for the two deputies on morning patrol they all nodded to him he paused in the doorway then sat down among them across the desk from jim slocum who was sitting in ribbons old highbacked chair resting on the desk prominently was that mornings register the headline read sheriffs dept reopens auden slay case a subhead youths death termed tragic accident well gentlemen slocum said welcome youve all heard the announcement about steves move up and were real happy about that situation ive asked you here to chew the fat a little and tell you about some of the changes im going to institute and i want to say if there are any questions i want you to interrupt me will you do that lance miller his volume hampered by the surgical tape around his ribs said sure we will good first off nothing im going to do is too you know radical but ive been thinking about the department and there are some things we can do different thatll be helpful he looked down at a sheet of paper well number one were going to change the radio codes were used to a lot of casual talk on the radio and i dont think we should be doing that you can get yourself into some real unprofessional situations that way from now on were going to be using the associated public safety communications officers codes thats like you see on tv tenfour tenthirteen all that there are thirtyfour of them and youll have to learn them all oh and i dont want you to say a b c you know i want adam boy charles and so on were not going to use the military ones i know some of you boys learned alpha bravo charlie delta were civilian and theres no reason for us to be ashamed of it two deputies nodded to show that they werent ashamed god bless you but bill corde shifted his weight and crossed his arms slocum said tenfour the deputies smiled politely another thing i dont want you to worry about calling me by my first name ive been jim to you for years and i dont want you all going grandiose on me and calling me sheriff or especially sir or anything promise me that yessir one of the deputies saluted sharply and they all laughed ive also been seeing about getting you boys walkietalkies mayor cooper thinks its a good idea but where the moneys going to come from is a whole nother thing so you may have to wait a while on those but i just want you to know theyre on our wish list now lets get down to brass tacks over the next ten minutes corde tried his best to pay attention as slocum described his plans for dividing new lebanon into precincts and the special drug task force he was going to establish one deputy frowned and said i dont think i ever arrested anybody for real drugs jim not moren a little pot or coke at auden he turned to another deputy anybody the other deputies said they rarely had aint been dont mean wont be slocum said and held up a time magazine cover about crack in small towns it was then that corde mentally left the room a half hour later the deputies departed carrying their photocopies of the new radio codes that theyd be quizzed on next week corde scooted his chair closer to the desk glad you stayed bill theres some things i wanted to talk to you about me too slocum said ive been doing some thinking and id like to tell you what ive decided this is a pretty odd situation you being senior to me and me getting the job so ive come up with something i think youre going to be pretty pleased with go ahead im going to create a new job here itll be called vice sheriff slocum paused and let corde taste the full flavor of the words when he didnt respond slocum said and guess whos going to be appointed it you bet slocum beamed sounds real nice dont you think what exactly does it mean oh dont think im doing you a favor no sir the fact is youre going to work for it ive been thinking about where your talents are bill and its pretty easy to see youre a better administrator than me im going to throw a lot of stuff at you scheduling overtime personnel problems payroll so what do you say to that mr vice sheriff corde got up and closed the door then returned to the chair he easily held slocums eye jim youre the sheriff now and i think youll probably run the department pretty good but im doing one thing and one thing only and thats tracking down jennie gebbens killer im finding him whether hes in new lebanon or fredericksberg or chicago or mexico city and im bringing him back for trial now tell me whats the budget for deputies what slocum was too surprised to frown the budget corde asked impatiently didnt steve show you the department budget yeah somewhere he inspected the desk for a moment looking for something he had no desire to find but bill the thing is i dont know i can have you assigned to just one case were down one man already what with lances broken ribs and all thiss a pretty big request ill have to think about it i believe thats it there that computer printout slocum pulled it out and opened it up what is it this column it says personnel corde said thats actual i need to know budgeted whats that here gimme corde scowled thats what i was afraid of weve hardly got enough left for raises not enough for a new man raises should i give the men raises corde was making notes on his index cards he said weve got about five thousand in travel and equipment left for the rest of the year well id like you to leave that alone im going to need a good portion of it if not everything equipment but i told you i was having trouble getting money for the walkietalkies and i was going to buy us all glocks they cost over four hundred each glocks jim we dont need fifteenround automatics slocum didnt speak for a minute then he said quietly im the sheriff bill i said id consider your request but i cant promise anything corde dropped the sheet on the desk okay jim theres no nice way to say what im about to he paused while he honestly tried to think of one the only thing ill add to take the sting out of it is that whether it was you or steve or jack treadle himself sitting where you are id say exactly the same thing which is you got yourself a plum job and you know it and i know it and im happy for you but you got appointed because i turned it down and the price for that is me getting the cebben case and all of the travel and equipment budget every penny of it after this is over id be glad to help you with all this administrative stuff and ill even learn your radio codes but until then what i just said is the way it is corde looked back at the shock on slocums face which froze slowly to a chill corde wondered if this talk might actually do some good toughening the mans flaccid way you dont have to be like that bill the buffoonery was gone and corde now saw in slocums eyes the toovivid knowledge that he had advanced by default and he saw too the mans depleted hope which could have very well been cordes own broken ambition had life moved just a little different this stung him for his own sake as well as slocums but he did not apologize he stood and walked to the door im counting on you to leave that money just where it is until i need it what wynton kresge owed to gmac to visa to union bank and trust the mortgage to union bank and trust the bill consolidation loan to consolidated edison to midwestern bell to duds n things for kids to corissa hanley duke the housekeeper to american express to mobil goddamn texans goddamn arabs to sears and that was just for the month of may he didnt have the heart to tally the numbers up for the year and he didnt dare calculate the broods budget for makeup burgers ninja outfits skateboards air pump nikes gloves basketballs piano lessons potato chips apple software spike lee and bart simpson tshirts run dmc tapes icet tapes janet jackson paula abdul the winnans tapes gummy bears white cheddar popcorn diet pepsi and whatever else got sucked into the black hole of childhood capitalism darla came to the door of his den and told him the plumber had just finished oh good kresge said how much he opened the checkbook and tore off a check he left it blank and handed it to her its a hundred twentyfour doll how much you cant take a bath in cold water she was gone he marked down check amount for sob mfing plumber why he wondered was it that the more you get the more you spend when he and darla had first been married theyd lived in a trailer park south of the business loop in columbia missouri hed been an assistant security director for the university making nineteen thousand dollars a year theyd had a savings account a real savings account that paid you interest not very much true but something you could look at the long line of entries and feel that you were getting somewhere in life now zip now debt this was too much thinking about the bills about hungry children about a wife about his lack of employment his palms began to sweat and his stomach was doing s he recalled the time he talked a failing student down from the auden chancellory building sixty feet above a slate walk kresge calm as could be no rope standing on a ledge fourteen inches wide like he was out looking for a couple buddies to shoot pool with talking the boy in by inches kresge had felt none of the terror that assaulted him now as he lined up the fat white envelopes of bills and pulled toward him his bluebacked plastic checkbook soon to be emasculated the telephone rang he answered it he listened then looked at his watch wynton kresge said well i dont know he listened some more well i guess he hung up wynton come on get the lead out of your cheeks you look like a walking tombstone corde spun the squad car around the corner and pressed the accelerator down the fourbarrel engine factorygoosed so it could catch vettes and irocs pushed both men back in the vinyl seat come on wynton cheer up cheer up cheer up what you got there kresge looked at the seat under cordes butt what youre sitting on a backrest of round wooden balls strung together it looked like a doormat good for the back corde said its like it massages you kresge looked away as if hed already forgotten hed asked the question you like to fish corde asked him i dont want to today you dont what after a moment kresge resumed the conversation want to go fishing were not going fishing corde said but do you like to i like to hunt i like to fish corde said huntings good too they drove past the pond where jennie gebben and emily rossiter had died corde didnt slow down and neither of them said a word as they sped on toward the fredericksberg highway after ten minutes kresge touched the barrel of the riot gun lockclamped muzzleup between them whats this loaded with doubleought i thought maybe it was rock salt or plastic bullets or something nope lead pellets you dont have to use steel i thought with the wetlands and everything you had to use steel corde said its not like we shoot that much buckshot at people round here yeah i guess not you ever used it drew a target a couple times never pulled the trigger im mighty pleased to say you got a pretty wife yep how many kids you got all told seven where we going fredericksberg oh how come because corde said oh twenty minutes later they pulled into a large parking lot and walked into the county building they passed the county sheriffs department corde noticed an empty office being painted it was tts old one there was no name on the plate next to the door he could picture a nameplate that said sa ribbon corde and kresge continued on to the office at the end of the hall painted in gold on rippled glass a sign read county clerk kresge stopped to study a wanted poster in the hall he said to corde you got business detective i can wait out here naw naw come on in corde walked through a swinging gate and into a dark woody old office presided over by a dusty oil painting of a judge who looked like hed spent the entire portrait session thinking up cruel and unusual punishments from a desk under the window a grizzled bald man wearing a wrinkled white shirt bow tie and suspenders waved them over rest your bones gentlemen the county clerk dug through the stacks of papers on his desk whatve we got here whatve we got here okay here we go he found a couple of sheets of paper dense with tiny type he set them in front of him youre a crazy son of a bitch corde to pass up that chance corde said i probably am they were good and pissed ill tell you nobody wanted it this way uhhuh in case you hadnt guessed i had whats he mean kresge asked corde the clerk added loudly as if he hoped to be overheard and nobody here is real happy we inherited you know who corde supposed he meant ribbon you cant pin that on me the county clerk grew solemn then spread the papers out in front of him he flipped through a threering binder he stopped at one page and began speaking rapidfire toward the book okay raise your right hand by the power vested in me corde was looking at the sour portrait above their heads kresge followed his eyes the clerk stopped reading and looked at kresge you gonna raise your hand or what me kresge said youre the one being deputized me the mans baritone rose nearly to a tenor raise your hand wynton corde said kresge did by the power vested in me by the county of harrison you wynton washington kresge are hereby appointed as special deputy pursuant to revised state code title section repeat after me i wynton washington kresge kresge cleared his throat looking with astonishment at corde what is this corde said do what the mans telling you i wynton washington kresge do swear to uphold the laws of this state and to tirelessly and faithfully serve and protect the citizens of the county of harrison and the municipalities located therein if you dont want to say so help me god the clerk concluded you can say upon my solemn oath kresge said so help me god corde shook his hand the clerk gave him three pieces of paper to sign you didnt tell me kresge whispered this to corde i need you wynton i figured if i just drove you here youd be less inclined to say no and go looking for a cushy office job someplace else look detective im grateful i really am but theres no way i can afford to do this corde smiled cryptically you cant afford not to talk to that pretty wife of yours youll find some way to work it out the clerk was impatient you two talk about this later will you he finished the paperwork and folded a couple of sheets like a subpoena he handed one to kresge go over to county central booking and get fingerprinted on the same form and have a picture id taken in personnel the same building billll tell you where it is have both these copies notarized lucy can do it if shes not at lunch and if she is go to fanners bank ask for sally anne bring me back one copy but i havent even thought about it youre a special deputy which sounds good but dont let it go to your head its the lowest rank weve got you have a pistol permit yes i do i did the smallarms course at higgins my score you have to buy your own weapon but you can get reimbursed up to two hundred automatics are okay but you can only use accepted loads the ones on here he handed kresge a badly photocopied sheet of paper dont get caught with anything heavier and if you file the trigger it cant be easier than a ninepound pull kresge nodded and corde noticed that hed stopped arguing the clerk continued your pay is twentyninefive annual prorated for however long youre with us youll be assigned to bill for whatever he needs you for ha ha big guess you folks finish up the gebben case and get this sicko under we can find a permanent place for you here at the county if you get certified by the state police academy now you get benefits as long as you work more than twentyfive hours a week but you gotta take a physical and for the family you gotta pay something you got a wife and kids seven corde added thats the kids hes only got one wife oh one more thing he tossed kresge a plasticwrapped green vinyl notebook about six by nine inches three hundred or so pages thick thats the state penal code and the deputys procedural guide read em learn em yessir kresge was lit up with modest pride do i salute its all in there the clerk tapped the guide jennie you wanted someone to teach you about love and all you found was someone to teach you how to die why did you go that night you said it was over do i believe you or not not knowing is almost as hard as life without you why kiddo why till we meet soon em it was where in emilys purse the night she drowned wynton kresge said they thought the halpern boy wrote that a fifteenyearold kid corde said uhn sitting in the new lebanons sheriffs department wearing a uniform as spotless and pressed as cordes kresge dropped emilys plasticencased note on cordes desk while corde read the report aloud graphoanalysis of subject document my professional opinion is that there is no more than a percent probability that the handwriting is that of subject emily rossiter significant similarities are fivedegree backslant and short ascenders and descenders and looped capital letters deviation from samples submitted are significant but may be attributable to inebriation drug use emotional disturbance or unsteadiness of writing surface why didnt philip say anything about it maybe he didnt see it maybe he saw it and it didnt mean anything to him corde looked at the letter for a long moment then said lets assume its really emilys okay okay does it tell us anything well it says two things first its a suicide note so it means suggests corde corrected suggests that emily killed herself she wasnt murdered okay whats the second thing that the halpern boy didnt kill jennie either i mean it implies that he didnt why because the someone emily mentions is probably well maybe the killer someone jennie had an affair with id guess she sure didnt have an affair with philip halpern because of where she says she thought it was over yeah like the affair was over corde said and look at go that night tuesday night she might be talking about he opened his attaché case the nowtattered picture of jennie gebben fresh off the volleyball court stared down at stacks of plump dogeared threebyfive cards he flipped through one pile and extracted a card that your computer bill computer ha here we go between about five and six on the night jennie was killed she and emily had a serious discussion of some kind maybe an argument and emily was moody that night she didnt join her friends for supper so maybe jennie was going to see her lover or former lover and emily was ticked off could be wait corde said he dug through another card the girl who told me that jennie was bisexual also said that shed had a fight with somebody the night before she was killed she said i love her i dont love you what if she agreed to meet that man or woman kresge added corde raised an eyebrow acknowledging the point possibly but trout the carpet guy said he saw a man what if she agreed to meet him one last time and he killed her thats sounding pretty good but what about the dna match it was philips semen found at the scene damn thats right kresge frowned dont agree with me too fast kresge considered for a minute and said maybe the lover killed her then the boy actually came along and raped her actually if she was dead first it wasnt rape it was violation of human remains misdemeanor oh kresge looked troubled ive got a hell of a lot to learn corde mused well why didnt emily come to us and tell us what she knew wouldnt she want the killer arrested maybe she didnt know his name if the girls were lovers then somebody jennied had an affair withd be a sore point between them emily maybe didnt want to hear about him good point wynton but she could still come in and tell us that somebody jennie had an affair with had killed her kresge had to agree with that then corde said of course look what happened emily killed herself she was pretty crazy with grief i suppose she wouldnt be thinking about police all she knew was her lover was dead kresge nodded thats good yeah ill buy that we got our work cut out for us he selected one stack of cards and tossed it to kresge what we know about jennie therere a lot of people who mightve had affairs with her well there cant be that many whore professors professors kresge tapped the plastic well shes talking about a professor isnt she corde stared for the answer in the note he looked up and shook his head why do you say that well kresge said it says teach i just assumed she was talking about one of her professors well emily couldve meant that like in a general sense could be kresge conceded but maybe we could save ourselves a lot of time by checking out the professors first corde picked up the cards and replaced them in his briefcase he said this time we get to use the siren wynton and the lights you think they care oh youll learn soon you think they want you but the way they want you is cold as mother moon jamie corde listened to the lyrics chugging out of his walkman headset he was lying on his back staring at the setting sun he wanted to be able to tell the time by looking at where the sun was but he didnt know how he wanted to be able to tell directions by the way certain trees grew but he couldnt remember what kind of trees he wanted to travel into a different dimension jamie zipped his jacket up tighter against the cool breeze and slipped down farther in the bowl of short grass to escape from the wind it was probably close to suppertime but he was not hungry he turned the volume up so just do yourself do yourself do yourself a favor and do yourself jamie was curious where the tape had come from hed returned home this afternoon after ditching wrestling practice and found it sitting on his windowsill geigers latest cassette the tiny cover picture showing five skinny german musicians in leather with long hair streaming behind them the lead guitarist wearing a noose around his tendony neck his parents would never have bought it for him this particular album was totally fresh itd been banned in florida atlanta and dallas and most of the record stores in harrison county refused to carry it maybe the last time philip was over hed left it one of the groups songs from a different lesscontroversial album had been used in the lost dimension and the two boys had listened to the soundtrack album frequently you think they care he held the tape player in both hands lifted it to his face pressed it against his cheek do yourself do yourself do yourself now he thought about school about science club which was meeting right at this moment theyd maybe look around and ask wheres jamie and nobodyd know and then somebody might say something about philip but there wouldnt be much talk about him because this was the endofyear party and you were supposed to be having fun drinking coke and jamming pretzels into your mouth and talking about the summer not about members of the club who were fat and weird and whod been shot dead by the police and also you werent supposed to talk about boys who cut school the evening of the party to sit next to a grave friends who when they werent around youd joke about being fags so fuck you fuck you fuck you just do yourself do yourself take a razor take a rope you dont have any hope except to do yourself jamie looked at the tombstone and realized he hadnt known philips middle name was arthur he wondered if that was some relatives name it seemed weird that his parents would give him a middle name at all because that was something normal parents did and philips parents were total hatters jamie sat back and looked at the freckled granite but this time he saw james william corde jamie imagined his own funeral and he saw his father standing next to the grave his father didnt seem particularly sad he was looking off into the distance thinking about sarah jamie pictured himself sitting alone in front of his own grave tracing the letters of his name he did not however trace his middle name they bypassed supersalesman and walked right into amos trouts office sorry to trouble you again sir corde said and introduced him to kresge trout said you in need of walltowall deputy kresge said not just now but hed discuss it with the wife corde said i wonder if you could go through this book and tell me if you recognize the man you saw in the road that night well like i was telling you i cant recall many details about him that old buick moves at a pretty good clip ive got an olds corners like nobodys business kresge said gm can put a car together there you go said trout if you could maybe narrow it down to a few men might resemble the fellow you saw itd make our job a whole lot easier corde handed him a copy of the auden university yearbook trout began to flip through it quickly take your time corde said cordes heart thudded each time trout tore off a small piece of paper and marked a page when he was finished he flipped open to the marked pages and pointed out three men he said i dont think id feel right testifying but it could be any one of these fellows corde took the book and glanced at the names of the men trout had marked he looked up at kresge who nodded slowly corde thanked trout and with kresge in tow left the store not bothering to jot down the names on his index cards kresge just back from his first official evidence photographing expedition had taken the better pictures at the crime scene below the dam in april jim slocum had forgotten to override the automatic focus of his mm camera and in the dark hed sometimes pointed the infrared rangefinder at a bush or hump of rocks many of the pictures were out of focus several of them were badly overexposed kresge had taken his time with the polaroid sitting in the den that was really cordes fourth bedroom surrounded by the debris of two double orders of the marquette grills steamfried chicken drinking coffee corde and twobag lipton kresge the men leaned close to the photos six eightbytens of the footprints by the dam were tacked up on a corkboard next to an ad for a lawn service that guaranteed to make your lawn thick as cats fur and we mean purrfect in the center of the board were kresges small polaroid squares i think its these two kresge said tapping one of slocums pictures and one of his own why corde asked the treads similar but look at the size the crime scene shoes fatter kresge said well that ground is wetter by the dam i mean i was reading a book on crime scene forensics you know what that word means corde had forgotten he thought for a moment wondering how he could bluff past it and couldnt think of a way he said what it means pertaining to criminal or legal proceedings i used to think it meant medicine you know but it doesnt hmmm corde said at least giving himself credit for not looking too impressed anyway i was reading this book and it said that prints in mud change shape depending on how close they are to the water source and whether the print would get drier or muddier with time that dams got a runoff nearby and its uphill of where she was found howd you know that i went there and looked so the print spread okay but how come in the crime scene photo the feet dont point out like in the one you took i think they do kresge said we just dont have him standing in one place look the heavier indentations on the right of his right foot and in this one its on the left of his left means the man walks like a penguin yessir corde said it sure does so i think theyre one and the same i do too wynton corde pondered this information i think were real close to probable cause but damn id love a motive what elseve we got he flipped through his cards then lifted out two and read them slowly he said you remember that scrap of computer paper i showed you the one i found behind jennies dorm mostly burned up i couldnt find out anything about it before i got laid off well in the morning id like to check on where it came from kresge winced bill the schools hardly going to let me do that i got fired remember wynton its not a question of letting you well get a search warrant youve got to start thinking like a cop kresge nodded flustered i havent been on the job too long you know thats not an excuse at ten the next morning the men walked up the steps of the darkbrick house and rang the bell wynton kresge noticed the way corde stood away from the front of the door as if somebody might shoot through the oak he doubted anybody was going to do that but he mimicked the detective a blond woman in her forties opened the door narrow shoulders in a white blouse widening to a dark plaid pleated skirt she listed to her right under the weight of a large briefcase she set it down corde looked expectantly at kresge who cleared his throat and said morning maam would your husband be home she examined them uneasily what would this be about corde said is he home please kresge decided he wouldnt have said that hed have answered her question she let them in in his study in the back of the house the men walked past her she smiled curious the motion spread the red lipstick slightly past the boundaries of her lips there she pointed to the room then left them cordes hand went to the butt of his pistol kresges did too they knocked on the door and walked in before there was an answer the man swiveled slowly in a shabby office chair bleeding upholstery stuffing kresge wondered if hed found the chair on the street in his poor graduate student days and kept it for sentiment kresges nostrils flared against the oldcarpet smell basement water in wool he had a strong urge to walk directly to the nearest window and fling it wide open the papers and books filling every available space added to the stifling closeness as did the jumble of oldtime photos stacked against the wall everything was covered with thin films of dust randy sayles put a pencil tick next to his place in the massive volume he was reading slipped a paperclip between the pages and closed the book a jay landed on a bush outside the window and picked at a small blond mulberry bill corde said professor sayles were here to arrest you for the murder of jennifer gebben sayles leaned back in the ancient chair sorrow was in his face but it seemed a manageable sorrow like that in the eyes of a distant relative at a funeral he listened to corde recite the miranda rights corde unceremoniously took his handcuffs out of the leather case on his belt sayles said a single word softly corde believed it was no the professors tongue caressed his lips one circuit two he lifted his hands and rested them on his knees they looked dirty because of the fine dark hairs coating his skin corde noticed that his feet pointed outward he said will you hold your wrists out please why do you think its me he asked this with unfeigned curiosity he did not offer his wrists a witness came forward and identified your picture in the yearbook he saw you by the dam that night your hands sayles nodded and said the man in the car he almost ran me over kresge said and your bootprint matches one found at the scene of the killing he looked at corde to see if it was all right to volunteer this kind of information my bootprint sayles looked involuntarily at a muddy corner of the study where presumably a pair of boots had recently lain you took prints of mine from the yard yessir kresge said shot pictures actually sayles fidgeted with his hands his face laced with the regret of a marathoner pulling up cramped a half mile shy of the finish will you come with me sayles stood up for what corde asked i didnt kill her sayles seemed stricken with apathy youll have your day in court sir i can prove it right now corde looked at the eyes and what he saw was a load of disappointment much more than desperation he motioned with his head toward the door five minutes but you wear the cuffs he put them on as they left the house kresge whispered so okay let me get this straight if they say they didnt do it we give them a chance to show us some new evidence i just want to know the rules wynton corde said patiently there are no rules the two men followed sayles outside they walked to the back of the house ten feet from the place where kresge had taken photos of sayless footprints corde recognized the ruddy box elder root from the polaroids corde glanced toward the front of the house he believed he smelled cigarette smoke corde saw sayless wife standing in the kitchen thirty feet away sayles walked to a patch of dugup earth like two wide tread marks about twenty feet long small green shoots were rising from precisely placed intervals along the strips dig here he touched a foot to the ground kresge picked up a rusty spade corde now felt contempt in the air sayless eyes were contracted like nipple skin in chill water the deputy began to dig a few feet down he uncovered a plastic bag kresge dropped the spade on the ground he pulled the bag out dusted it off carefully and handed it to corde inside was a length of clothesline thats the murder weapon sayles said corde said to him do you want to make a statement sayles said this is the proof yessir corde said do you wish to waive your right to have an attorney present during questioning he killed jennie with it i saw him itll have his fingerprints on it youre saying you didnt kill her kresge asked no i didnt kill her sayles said he sighed jennie and i had an affair last year yessir we figured as much corde said in the open window the blond woman rested her chin in her hand and listened to his words without visible emotion the cigarette dangled over the sill and from it rose a leisurely tentacle of smoke i was quite taken by her he said to corde you saw her how could anybody help but be captivated by her corde remembered the moon remembered the smell of mint on the dead girls mouth remembered the spice of her perfume he remembered the dull eyes he remembered two diamonds and he remembered mud he had no idea how captivating jennie gebben was sayles said she went to work for me in the financial aid office we just came from there the scrap of paper we found burned behind her dorm matches computer files in your records you broke into her dorm and stole her letters and papers you burned them sayles laughed shortly the disarmed sound of someone learning that his secrets are not secret at all he nodded you know the financial condition of the school what was it about educators that made them think their school was exactly the first thing on everyones mind sayles continued weve been in danger of closing since the mideighties dean larraby and i came up with an idea two years ago as dean of financial aid i started giving out loan money to students who were bad risks millions of dollars corde nodded you gave them the money and they paid it to the school then they dropped out and defaulted you kept the money who got uhm taken in in that deal it was mostly state and federal money sayles said its a very common practice at small colleges a professor sayles was giving them information not apologizing times are extremely bad for educational institutions auden is being audited in a week or so by the department of education theyll find the loan defaults ive tried desperately to get some interim financing to put into the loan accounts to cover the deficit but and jennie found out about the scam and you killed her kresge said no sir i did not corde thought something like a southern military officers drawl crept into the mans offended voice she knew what was going on but she didnt care and i didnt care if she knew i just arranged for the job for her so we could see each other privately she took some work home administrative things after she died i went to her dorm and burnt those files and her letters in case shed mentioned me in them thats why you urged steve ribbon to pull me off the case so this secret of yours didnt get uncovered i promised him and sheriff ellison theyd have university support in the elections come november kresges face blossomed into a large frown at this first glimpse of law enforcement politics hed been on the job less than twentyfour hours but i didnt kill her i swear it his voice lowered our relationship never went past sex we were lovers once or twice i thought about marrying her but she told me right up front she was in it for the sex and nothing else i was happy to accommodate it didnt last long jennie was bisexual you know she finally patched up her relationship with emily her roommate and she and i drifted apart emilys death was a suicide wasnt it yes im sure it was she called me the night she died i went to meet her she was terribly depressed about jennie incoherent she ran off i have no doubt she killed herself well professor who do you think is the killer about four months after jennie and i broke up she said shed started seeing someone else we were still close and she told me a few things about her lover it sounded like a very destructive relationship finally she broke it off but the lover was furious on the day she was killed after class jennie told me shed agreed to meet for one last time to say it was over to leave her alone i tried to talk her out of it but that was one thing you just couldnt do with jennie you couldnt protect her she wouldnt stand for it she wouldnt depend on anybody i worried about her all evening finally i drove out to the pond where shed told me they were going to meet i found jennie with a rope around her neck that rope she was dead she hadnt been raped corde asked no that mustve happened later the boy that got shot why kresge asked did you take the rope i was going to destroy it but then i thought for my own sake i should save it to prove that his fingerprints were on the murder weapon i wrapped it up in a scrap of plastic and buried it here kresge was exasperated destroy the rope you were trying to cover up the murder why dont you realize what would happen if word were to get out that a professor murdered one of his students it would destroy auden enrollment would plummet it would be the end of the school oh it was hard for me oh poor jennie but i had to think of the school first a professor corde asked who is it i assume you talked to him when you were interviewing people sayles said his name is leon gilchrist jim slocum lance miller and a county deputy met them at the university in an alleyway behind jesse hall corde said he claims its gilchrist one of jennies professors miller said he was in san francisco at the time of the killing i thought corde said to kresge i checked the flights gilchrist flew out on the weekend before the killing his secretary said he just got back a few days ago sayles said i swear it officer he was back the tuesday she was killed kresge said maybe if he was planning to kill her he used a different name on the flight corde nodded then handed sayles over to slocum take him to a cell book him for murder one manslaughter and felony obstruction corde and kresge left sayless protests behind and walked through the elaborate towering arch like the doorway in a medieval hall the sounds of their footsteps resounded off the high concrete walls they suddenly heard running water whats that kresge whispered as they got closer to the lecture hall they could tell the sound was of applause which rose in volume and was soon joined by whistles the noise filled the old stern gothic corridors an image came to cordes mind gladiatorial battles from an ancient movie doors opened and the halls filled with students in shorts jeans sweats tshirts corde walked into the lecture hall it did indeed resemble the colosseum steep rows of seats rising from a small semicircular platform empty except for a chipped lectern the ceiling of the auditorium was high hueless murky with years of grime the walls were dark oak the gooseneck lamp on the lectern still burned and in the dimness of the hall cast a pale shadow on the stage corde stopped a crewcut student excuse me this professor gilchrists class yessir do you know where he is the boy looked around saw someone and grinned he continued his scan of the auditorium nope guess hes gone was he away from town for a while yeah he was in san francisco until a few days ago i heard he came back to give his last lecture what was the applause about if you ever heard him youd know hes totally you know intense corde and kresge continued down the corridor until they found gilchrists office the professor was not there and the departmental secretary was gone kresge motioned toward her rolodex which was turned to the gs gilchrists home address card was gone the desk drawers were open and although corde found files on other professors there was none for gilchrist on the way out of the hall they passed the auditorium again the lectern light was dark the apartment wasnt university property it was three miles outside of town in a complex of twostory brick buildings with the doorways on the second floor opening onto a narrow balcony that ran the length of the building gilchrist lived in apartment d the complex was surrounded by thick foliage and mature trees corde noticed it was only one mile from his own house through the forest another brick of evidence for the district attorney it would have cost gilchrist merely a pleasant twenty minute walk to get to cordes house and leave the threatening pictures of sarah corde drove the cruiser past the entrance to the apartment complex then parked in a clump of hemlock out of sight of the building corde unlocked the shotgun and motioned to kresge to take it you hunt you told me yup kresge took the riot gun and corde got a moments pleasure watching the mans thick hands load and lock the gun as if hed been doing it since he was five they climbed out and started along the path kresge said i hear something in the woods over there corde looked squinting through the low light that shattered in the dense woods you see anything cant tell too much glare whatd you hear footsteps a dog maybe dont hear it anymore keep an eye on our backs corde said hes just a professor our backs corde repeated crouching the men walked side by side to the complexs directory corde found the supers apartment and rang the bell no response he motioned with his head toward the upper balcony together they went up the stairs corde whispered you never done this before so were going in the front door together okay with me kresge said sincerely the last of his words swallowed in a hugely dry throat lets go beneath them a horn blared corde and kresge spun around jim slocums cruiser with randy sayles handcuffed in the backseat pulled leisurely into the parking lot slocum honked again and waved hey bill he called thought you might need some backup jesus lord corde whispered harshly jim whatre you doing hes gonna see you slocum got out of the car and looked around he shouted what say corde jumped out of his crouch and ran for the front door of gilchrists apartment shouting to slocum watch the back behind the building watch the back corde and kresge stood on either side of the door kresge said if hes in there he knows hes got company i hate this corde said kresge said you ever do this before corde hesitated not exactly no he knocked on the door professor gilchrist sheriffs department open the door no response let me try kresge pounded on the split veneer of the door police professor i mean sheriffs department open the door nothing corde reached for the doorknob both men lifted their guns toward the sky corde turned the knob and shouldered it open they leapt inside jim slocum turned toward the backseat of the cruiser he said to sayles by way of explanation i figured they needed some backup and he drove around to the back of the apartment complex look sayles said im not real comfortable here minute slocum said and got out of the car he unholstered his service revolver and looked around the unkempt yellow lawn you cant leave me here im innocent quiet you cant keep me here please sir id appreciate it if youd just shut up get the goddamn rope fingerprinted are you listening to me are you listening to me jim slocum had been all the way from the auden campus and he was pretty tired of it he leaned forward shut your mouth got it you cant keep me here slocum wandered off to the apartment buildings detached workshed he went up on tiptoes looked through the window and noted that there was no one inside then he stepped behind it to take a leak breathing stale air corde and kresge moved farther into the apartment on the floor next to them was a wooden coat rack and umbrella stand carved with the bas relief of a hound treeing a bear corde glanced at the bears black glistening mahogany teeth and walked past it in the living room the scents were of mildew moist paper dust and a sour scent as if a pet had grown old and ill in the room the light dimmed by drawn curtains barely illuminated the space which seemed uninhabited the bookcases were filled but the jackets of the volumes all were matte paper imprinted with dull inks oldstyle typography the wooden chairs were coated with dust the upholstered ones werent indented a dust sphere leisurely followed corde into the living room the men danced past each other stepping into rooms and covering each other a choreography that kresge learned quickly corde could see he was unnerved and trying to look three directions at once they secured all the rooms except the kitchen they paused outside the closed french doors kresge had his index finger curled around the ribbed trigger of the scattergun corde lifted the sizable finger out and straightened it along the guard he then nodded toward the door and together they pushed inside empty kresge picked up a cup coated with a moldy layer of dry evaporated coffee he set it down stacked on the table were literary magazines books dense articles delmore schwartz the poetry of obsession special problems in translating the cantos the rebirth of the poet warrior the feeling first came to corde as he stood flipping through the blank notepad beside the yellow telephone which was decorated with a sticker in the shape of a daisy he paused as the crinkling chill began at the knob of his neck and swept down his spine his scrotum contracted one by one he lifted his fingers off his pistol and he felt the pads of his fingers cool from evaporation he looked around him at the still pale doorways out the window at a black gnarled willow trunk hes nearby i can feel it kresge dropped the journal back down on the table corde walked to the stove and touched the top it burnt his hand the tea kettle too was hot but then he tapped the metal again cautiously and found that the pilot light was heating the empty pot he left the kitchen and returned to the second bedroom which served as gilchrists study he searched the desk papers letters drafts of articles doodles there were no photos nothing gave a clue as to what leon gilchrist looked like or where he might be a chill again shuddered through cordes back corde had to share this hes nearby what i feel him hes around here someplace kresge pointed to a coating of dust on the wood floors and the linoleum only their footprints showed he hasnt been here for a long time corde said well get the crime scene boys to go through it take some paper samples and fingerprints lets get out of here slocum was walking out from behind the apartment building he met corde and kresge in the parking lot i heard something behind there i went to check but i didnt see anything if he had a car its gone we should call in a county apb corde said he walked toward his car dmv license and any tag numbers lets get back to the office and fax an id to the state and the fbi get a picture of him from the university yessiree lets move slocum said they found though that they had to make a detour which was to drive randy sayles to the emergency room at harrison county community hospital corde drove hitting speeds of close to a hundred on the straightaway of while kresge crouched in the back applying fierce pressure to the slashes in the mans carotid arteries because sayless hands were cuffed to the armrest in the backseat of the car gilchrist had been free to cut deep and with fearful precision at the hospital while kresge cleaned up as best he could corde sat in a blue plastic chair in the lounge he sat forward his chin in his hands the doctor walked out of the er and after surveying the three cops chose corde to whom he said simply im sorry corde nodded and stood up on the way out of the door he glanced at the sky and believed he saw for a moment a silver crescent of waxing moon before it was obliterated by an oncoming storm the way sarah thought of it was that her world suddenly turned joyous for one thing she woke up without the pitchforks in her stomach the way she always felt on school days and still felt sometimes when she awakened from a dream about class or about taking a test this morning sitting up in her bed she felt perfectly free floating and safe it was like she had all the good parts of running away from home but still had her family and her room and her magic circle in the forest behind the house the day too was perfection itself the sun was like the round face of a sky tiger and the wind blew through the new leaves so crisp and fast you could hear the voices of the trees calling to each other sarah strolled outside and played a game dr breck had taught her she looked at the lawn and she said out loud grass then came tree and cloud and she got the giggles when she pointed to mrs clemington next door and spelled troll she pointed to a cow ten feet away separated by the postandrail fence the animal gazed at her eagerly as if it was milking time she lay down in her circle of stones and took her tape recorder out of her backpack another good thing about today she was going to finish the last chapter of her book this one was her favorite story shed been working on it for days and hadnt told anyone about it it filled almost half a cassette and she hadnt even gotten to the climax of the story yet shed give the tape to dr parker and her secretary would type out the words and sarah would get the story back in a few days then she would copy it into the notebook and show it to dr breck she wanted desperately to impress him and had worked particularly hard on this story sarah rewound the tape to the start of the chapter to see what she had written so far she hit the play button chapter fifteen the sunshine man once upon a time deep in the forest there lived a wizard the deputies got a kick out of wynton kresge a man who owned more law enforcement books than they knew existed and who could outshoot any of them eitherhanded on the small arms range at higgins as far as they could remember thered never been a black deputy in new lebanon and it made the office seem like a set on a hollywood buddy movie they were sitting around this evening debating where gilchrist might have gone prosecutor dwayne lovell had gotten a bench warrant issued and faxed to boston and san francisco both cities having been gilchrists home at one time then corde added gilchrists name to the criminal warrants outstanding bulletin and database for state and major city law enforcement agencies what will they do kresge asked corde boston and san franciscoll prioritize it the others nothing but if they happen to pick him up for something else and find his name in the computer theyll give us a call its not for sure but we can sleep a little better knowing weve done it looking for a tick on a dog kresge muttered as he dialed boston pd after a brief conversation he learned that gilchrist had no criminal record in massachusetts earlier that day corde had granted kresges fervent request that he be allowed to interview dean larraby about gilchrist it was a long interview and she hadnt been much help though kresge clearly had enjoyed himself in searching gilchrists office and the other departments at auden the men had found that the professor had stolen most of the files containing personal information about himself the personnel department the credentials department the english and psych departments they had all been raided computer files erased cabinets emptied kresge and corde interviewed other professors none of them knew much about gilchrist or had snapshots that included him they could not recall any school functions he had attended brian okun corde learned in a second antagonistic interview said he knew the professor as well as anyone and could offer no clues as to where gilchrist might have gone hes resourceful okun said then added with eerie sincerity its troubling you dont know where he is the evil we cant see is so much worse than that which we can dont you think detective corde didnt know about that but one thing he did know gilchrist was jennie gebbens killer sayles had been correct gilchrists fingerprints were on the tiedown rope cut from the ford truck the rope also contained two of jennies partials from trying to fight off the strangulation and one of her hairs another strand of her hair was found on a shirt in gilchrists closet he also had several red marking pens whose ink matched those on the newspaper clipping he had left for corde the morning after jennies murder and on the back of the threatening polaroids gilchrists prints were also found on the back door window and armrest of jim slocums cruiser it wasnt necessary to dust for those prints they had been made with randy sayless blood but as corde knew and as wynton kresge was learning with great disillusionment finding a criminals identity is not the same as finding the criminal gilchrist had vanished corde got a deputy to call car rental agencies no one named gilchrist had rented a car the deputy announced and corde and kresge looked at each other both concluding simultaneously and silently that he wasnt going to be using his real name corde tapping the butt of his gun with a forefinger began to say when we got sayles to the er kresge finished the question did they find his wallet i dont know the deputy said corde continued find out and if not call back the car companies and ask if someone named sayles rented a car kresge didnt wait to find out about the wallet he got on the horn and called hertz a supervisor told him that a randolph sayles had rented a car the day before at lambert field in st louis hed rented it for two weeks and was paying a dropoff charge to leave the car in dallas kresge got the description and plate number of the car and told them it had been illegally rented have them notify us as soon as he returns it is that right i mean the right procedure corde realized kresge had looked up from the phone and was speaking to him corde who had never before had a carrenting felon said sounds good to me okay its a green hertz pontiac kresge announced and sang out the license number corde had him send that information out over the wire to the county and state they checked the midwest air commuter flights no one matching gilchrists description had flown from harrison county airport to lambert field in the past two days and there had been no private charter flights state dmv showed a car registered to gilchrist a gray toyota but no record of a state drivers license after two hours on the phone miller found out that gilchrist had a massachusetts license theyd fax a picture within three days thats the best they can do and i had to beat them up to get that kresge said so he drove his car to st louis dumped it rented another one and is going south maybe maybe hes trying to throw us off fax dallas in any case corde pondered you know maybe hes flying someplace and just rented the car to cover his tracks left it in the airport call the airlines everything that flies out of st louis lets hope he used sayless credit card again and check the airport longterm parking for his own car or the rental kresge said thats pretty good howd you know this stuff you pick it up as you go along corde said ive got a lot to learn kresge said hes gone over state lines corde said then added reluctantly we could get the fbi in if we wanted to hows that teddies arent interested in state crime unless theres interstate flight or youve got a kidnapping drugs or bank robbery why dont we want them in corde decided it was too early in kresges career for this kind of law enforcement education because he answered slocum strolled up bill one thing i was thinking yup im not so sure this is just a fleeing felon thing corde wondered what trashy paperbacks hed been reading slocum continued i was trying to psych him out i mean look what he did to sayles when corde kept staring blankly he added well it couldve been a revenge situation sayles was a witness corde said gilchrist had to kill him kresge said but bill we didnt need sayles to convict him did we we had enough other evidence and gilchrist wouldve known that corde considered and said that was true go ahead jim whats your thought his lifes over with hes never going to teach again never have a professional job the best he can do is make it to canada or mexico and the first time he runs a red light zippo his butts extradited i think hes around the bend and wants to get even hes just killed again my bet is he rented that car to send us off to texas but hes staying around here somewhere hes got some scores to settle kresge said maybe we should check out the hotels around the county maybe he used sayless name there too slocum said hotelsd be easy to trace i was thinking maybe cabins or a month lease somewhere nearby its getting near season so nobodyd pay much attention to someone taking a vacation rental corde said lets start making some calls it was just a half hour later that wynton kresge hung up the phone after a pleasant conversation with anita conciliano of lakeland real estate in bosworth he jotted some notes on a piece of the recycled newsprint the department used for memos he handed the sheet to corde the detective read it twice and looked up from the grayish paper he found he was looking at jim slocum who stood in his office doorway leaning on the frame the same place and the same way steve ribbon used to stand we got him hes in lewisboro corde grinned at slocum then he saluted thanks sheriff sevans tavern was sixty miles north of new lebanon in lewisboro county edged into a stand of pine and sloppy maples and just far enough back from route so you could anglepark a land cruiser without too much risk of losing the rear end today four men sat in one of the taverns front booths drinking iced tea and soda and coffee a greasy plate that had held onion rings sat in front of them lewisboro county sheriff stanley willars said how do you know hes there bill corde said wynton here tracked him down he called mustve been a thousand real estate companies gilchrist used sayless name and rented it for two months corde wanted more onion rings he hadnt eaten a meal in eighteen hours but he counted up that hed had twelve rings himself so far with ketchup and decided not to ask if they wanted another round wynton kresge said he doesnt have any family that weve been able to find and no other residences we think hes there and kresge looked at corde then added we want to hit him corde continued its your county stan so we need your okay never heard of a professor killing anybody before said assistant sheriff dudley franks who was lean and unsmiling and reminded corde of tt ebbans youd think theyd be above that or something willars said wryly sos hammerbacks providing all the firepower corde grinned okay wed like some backup too uck corde added fact of life stan willars said you boys want more rings corde said sure quickly willars ordered he was laughing as he looked out the window at cordes squad car look at that dodge it brand new corde said we got em this year you got that damn university down in harrison no wonder you got new wheels he turned to franks what year are we driving eightysevens kresge said thats pretty old that damn university willars said remember those old grand furies the police interceptors that was quite a car corde said had a fourforty in them i believe franks offered willars said what i wish is we had one of those emergency services trucks you should see the wrecks we get along franks said sedge billings near to cut his little finger off with his chain saw trying to get somebody out of a caprice that went upside down there arent but one jaws of life in the whole area sedge had to use his own black and decker the waitress brought the onion rings no willars corrected that wasnt a chevy was a taurus youre right frank said corde said i dont think ellisond have it in his heart or his budget to buy you boys one of those vans the one they got in harrison is secondhand i know we dont have the money in new lebanon there was silence as they dug into their rings willars said its just a shame you couldnt loan it to us from time to time like a week weve got it three weeks youve got it corde said i dont know the citizens of harrisond be too happy to see that theyre the ones paying true willars said pleasantly but i dont know the citizens of harrisonre real happy about what this gilchrist fellas done with cheer in his voice he added and the fact hes still at large franks said and the fact that its election time come november id guess corde said slowly hammerbackd be willing to work out a sharing arrangement but only if youre talking a limited period of time and ive gotta clear it with him willars said i think of the families of some kid rolls his car off that bend on you ever seen that happen its pretty bad kresge asked how come you dont put up guard rails willars looked mournful fact is were a poor county corde said i think we could work something out sheriff willars said thats good enough for me lets pick us up a couple ms and go catch ourselves a dangerous professor warning no trespassing bill corde and wynton kresge stepped out of a stand of trees and found themselves looking at the summer house leon gilchrist had rented in his latest victims name a dilapidated twostory frame home on whose south side paint was peeling like colonialred snake scales the whole place was settling bad and only the portion near the chimney had good posture the screen door on the porch was torn and every second window was cracked a typical vacation house in the lake district of lewisboro not a twoweek dream rental but a badly built clapboard that had been foreclosed on up next to them walked willars franks and a crewcut local deputy a young man bowlegged with muscles corde and kresge had their service pistols drawn and the lewisboro lawmen held battered dark gray military rifles muzzle up kresge looked at the machine guns and said well well peace whispered willars through superior firepower your show bill whatcha wanta do ill go in with wynton and somebody else id like somebody on the front door and the back just in case willars sent the stocky deputy out back and he took the front door he said to franks you be so kind as to accompany our cousins here look corde whispered a light was flashing in an upstairs window hes there the men crouched down kresge said no look its just the sunlight a reflection no i dont think so franks said with a taut voice i think its a light whatever it is corde said lets go in to his men willars said check your pieces load and lock semiauto fire the sharp clicks and snaps of machined metal falling into place filled the clearing then there was silence again they started forward a large grackle fluttered past them and a jay screamed once out of the brush they ran crouching to the front porch and walked up the stairs keeping low to the steps smelling old wet wood and decaying paint they stood on either side of the door backs to the house near kresges head was a sign beware of dog kresge tested the door it was locked franks whispered what about the dog there was one hed be barking by now corde said kresge said we knock or not corde thought of the polaroid of the girl possibly his daughter he said no kresge grunted his agreement like a veteran swat team cop and pulled open the screen door for franks to hold pit bulls dont bark franks said i saw that on current affair or something he flicked the trigger guard of his rifle with a nervous finger kresge stepped back but corde touched him by the arm and shook his head then stepped into his place ive got fifteen years experience on you just stay close behind but i got sixty pounds weight on you detective kresge said and lowered his shoulder and charged into the door it blew inward the jamb shattering under his momentum he slipped on the carpet and went down on his hip as corde then franks leapt into the living room after him a half dozen mangy pieces of sour overstuffed furniture and a hundred books stared silently back at them franks kept his m up swiveling from door to door nervously with his head cocked listening for malevolent growling the sunlight was fading fast and throughout the house the colors of rugs and paintings and wallpaper were vanishing the men walked like soldiers through this monotone corde listened for gilchrist and heard only old boards moaning beneath their feet the tapping and surges of tiny household motors and valves franks stayed downstairs while corde and kresge climbed up to where they had seen the light they paused at the landing then continued to the second floor corde was suddenly aware of the smells lemon furniture polish musty cloth aftershave or perfume they swung open the door to the master bedroom it was empty corde smelled the dry aftershave stronger here and he wondered if it was gilchrists it seemed similar to a cologne that he himself had worn something sarah had bought him for his birthday this thought deeply upset him the sun was low at the horizon shining into his face maybe that was the light hed seen its reflection in the window the sun dipped below the trees and the light grew murkier corde reached toward the bedside lamp to pull the switch damn the bulb was hot he told this to kresge the two men looked at each other put their backs together squinting through the gloom at the half dozen menacing nearhuman shapes they knew were a coat rack an armoire a shadow a thick pink drape yet at which each man drew an equivocal target with his pistol kresge reached for the light switch he laughed nervously walls hot too i think it was the sun it was falling on the lamp and the wall here corde didnt respond he opened his mouth wide and began to take slow breaths he listened no footsteps no motion no creaks walking around the edge of the room where the noise from sprung floorboards would be less corde looked in both closets they were empty he stepped into the hall and examined the other bedrooms and their closets filled with musty coats and jackets faded floral blouses blankets stinking of camphor kresge said the attic hell going up through a trapdoor into an attic that was surely packed with furniture and boxes perfect cover for a gunman but they were spared that agony corde found the trapdoor in the ceiling of the hall it was padlocked from the bottom he exhaled in relief on the ground floor again they moved through the dining room and living room corde thought hells bells the basement just like the attic only ifs not going to be padlocked at all and thats where gilchrist is going to be has to be no question how about the basement isnt one franks said thanks lord may be time to reconsider this church business yessir kresge said im pretty surely tense in here he said it as if he were surprised and corde and franks laughed in the kitchen corde saw colorful labels that said heinz and goya and campbells dented aluminum pans bottles and chipped canisters refrigerator magnets of barnyard animals which had turned dark with years of cooking grime corde said to kresge lets keep at it he held his pistol with cramping pressure his finger caressing the ribbed trigger inside the guard where he had told kresge it should not be i saw something i want to check franks said theres a room in the back i listened at it and didnt hear anything but its locked from the inside he poked a stained yellow drape with the slotted muzzle of his soldier gun just a second well go with you corde called from the living room he was looking at a pile of ash in the fireplace he crouched down and sifted through the gray dust kresge stood guard over him in the midst of a pyramid of ash corde found the scorched cover of a photo album his hands shook with the excitement of being close to a picture of gilchrist but there were none almost everything was burnt and the ash dissolved but one remained a polaroid had fallen through the log rack though it was badly blistered from the heat it hadnt burnt completely the square showed a street in a city a line of faded row houses with a few trees in front breaking through the maginot line of the tops of the residences was a shiny office building five or six stories high on the back was written leon come visit sometime love corde wrapped the photo in his handkerchief and put it in his pocket then stood the familiar pop of his knee resounding through the dark room the pop was loud but not loud enough to cover the crack of assistant sheriff franks breaking through the doorway of the locked room and the thunderclap of the shotgun blast that took off much of his shoulder corde spun fast dropping into a crouch kresge grabbed the convulsing deputy by his leg and dragged him toward the kitchen along a wall now covered by a constellation of slick blood okay okay okay corde shouted to no one and he rolled forward into the doorway prone position his elbow landed on a bit of sharp bone from the deputys shoulder corde ignored the pain as he fired five staccato shots at the figure inside three missed and slammed into the armchair to which was taped the doublebarrel remington wired to the doorknob two of cordes slugs though were aimed perfectly and found their target which wasnt however professor leon david gilchrist but a fourfoothigh ceramic owl which in the dim light resembled not a bird but a laughing man and which under the impact of the unjacketed rounds exploded into a thousand shards of brown and gold porcelain bill corde sat in the auden university library this was a musty victorian building latticed with oak dense as metal and wroughtiron railings that coiled through the balconies and stacks like ivy boughs the structure might have been imported brick by brick from sooty london and reassembled on this grassy quad within sight of thousands of acres of stalky fields growing a green pelt of corn shoots this was the library of a university that bill corde would not be admitted to and whose tuition he could not have afforded if he had been he had just gotten off the phone with sheriff willars in lewisboro and learned that dudley franks was in critical but stable condition whatever that meant willars had said im not a happy camper bill no sir and corde knew thered be some hefty reparation payments between the two counties gloom had settled on the new lebanon sheriffs department after the shooting the manhunt that seemed so like a game several days ago had now turned rooty and mean gilchrist was both far crazier and far more savage than any of them had guessed and though those two adjectives were rarely if ever found in the vocabulary of modern law enforcement corde now felt the full pressure of their meaning gilchrist leon david cleary new york ba summa cum laude ma northwestern university phd english literature harvard university phd psychology harvard university assistant professor and fellow department of english school of arts sciences harvard university tenured professor department of english school of arts sciences auden university lecturing professor department of special education school of education auden university visiting professor vanderbilt university university of naples la sorbonne université college of william mary there were two more full paragraphs corde finished his notes then closed the directory of liberal arts professors it contained no picture of gilchrist the main purpose of his visit here neither did the three books written by gilchrist in the librarys permanent collection they were books without author photos books without jackets smartperson books corde jotted a note on a threebyfive card to call the sheriff in cleary new york to see if there were any gilchrists still in the area he flipped quickly through the index to periodicals he was about to close the book when his eye caught the title of an article he walked to the periodicals desk and requested the journal the article had been published in the clerk vanished for a moment and returned with the bound volume of psyche the journal of psychology and literature corde sat at his place again read the first paragraph of the poet and the violent id by leon d gilchrist phd he returned to the counter and borrowed a dictionary he tried again the poet by which expansive term i am taking the liberty of referring to anyone who creates fictional modes with words is himself a creation of the society in which he lives indeed it is the obligation of the poet to deliquesce deliquesce corde marked his place in the journal with his elbow and thumbed through the dictionary the levitate licentious page fell out he stuffed it back between repudiate resident and residual response deliquesce v to melt by absorbing moisture or humidity contained in the air okay good obligation of the poet to deliquesce so that he might permeate all aspects of society permeate corde lifted the dictionary again for ten minutes he fought through the article his sweaty hands leaving splendid fingerprints on the torn jacket of the dictionary his stomach wound into a knot not by what he learned about gilchrist which was hardly anything but by the slippery obscurity of meaning for the first time corde truly understood his daughters predicament he paused saturated by frustration he breathed slowly several times and resumed does not the id of a pulp thriller writer encompass a lust to travel the countryside strangling women words what did these words say about where gilchrist was what state he would flee to what country how he would try to escape what kind of weapon he might use letters syllables words sentences what do they say about a beautiful young girl lying dead in a bed of hyacinths swabbed with cold mud what do they say about the man who closed his hands around her neck felt her breasts shaking under his elbows felt the slow bloody give of her throat felt the last shiver of her breath on his wrists as she lay down like a struggling lover and saw for one short moment the darkening glow of the halfmoon the metaphors of violence abound corde reached forward and ran a finger along metaphors of violence and seemed to feel heat coming off the ink metaphor n a figure of speech in which an object idea or symbol is described by analogy what analogy n correspondence between objects generally thought to be dissimilar is he talking correspondence n a similarity about corde leaned forward and pressed his eye sockets into his palms hearing tiny pops of pressure the motives of the poet are the motives of us all the mind of the poet is the collective mind but it is the poet whether his psyche be that of saint or murderer who perceived the world by the illumination of pure understanding while others see only in reflected light bill corde turned to the last page of the article oh lord he stopped as if hed been struck feeling the throbbing as the blood pumped furiously through his neck he reached forward and lifted the polaroid from the binding of the journal the snapshot had been taken recently perhaps when the family had cooked supper outside just two evenings ago he noticed the garbage can had not been righted after a storm last week sarah and jamie stood around the barbecue looking down at the glowing coals the picture had been taken from somewhere on the other side of the cow pasture in the forest almost the exact spot where corde believed he had seen someone that night hed kept his long vigil shotgunarmed and shivering written across the surface of the photo in smeared red ink were the words say goodbye detective diane corde feeling suddenly sheepish told ben breck that she and the children were going to wisconsin for several weeks what breck asked frowning diane lifted her hands to her eyes her burgundy nail polish was unchipped and her fingers often red and leathery from the housework were soft and fragrant with almondscented lotion its the damn case again she explained that thered been yet another threat by the killer bill thought it was best if we went to visit my sister he hesitated and then whispered two weeks she shrugged at least or until they catch this crazy man or find out hes left town brecks downcast boyish face and his tone were identical to those of her first husband when shed told him she had to spend a week with her mother whod fallen and broken her hip it had been the first time theyd be apart and the young mans face had revealed major heartbreak brecks eyes now mirrored the poor mans forlorn expression this troubled and thrilled her they heard a voice outside in the backyard sarah corde paced speaking into her tape recorder like a hollywood producer dictating memos tom the familiar deputy guard leaned against the fence rail his head swiveling slowly like a scouts in an oldtime western as he scanned the horizon for marauders breck and diane stood in the dining room and watched sarah silently they stood one foot away from each other diane felt him touch her hair the motion of his hand very gentle as if he were afraid he might hurt her she leaned her head against his shoulder then stepped away both disappointed and grateful to hear him begin to speak suddenly about sarah shes coming along remarkably well what a mind the stories she comes up with are incredible ive given dr parker four tapes already her secretarys transcribing the last of them he brushed his saltandpepper hair off his forehead in a boyish gesture shes fortunate breck said slowly his eyes playing over dianes face shes got a superior auditory processing system thats how im approaching her lessons and its working very well diane had recognized something about him if he had a choice between a tendollar word and a twentyfivecent word he picked the big one fortunate instead of lucky auditory processing not hearing onerous ensconce with anyone else this habit would put her off in breck she found it increased his charm no his charisma he continued to speak about sarah this was unusual and she sensed he was propelled by nervousness in most of these aftersession gettogethers usually in the kitchen occasionally in the woods they spoke not of phonemes or the visual aural digit span test or sarahs book but of more personal things the schools he had taught at his former girlfriends her first husband dianes life as the daughter of a riverboat worker vacations they hoped to take where they wanted to be in ten years and five and one yet the nature of these minutes they spent together was ambiguous though they talked intimately breck had not kissed her though they flirted he seemed bashful their contact was plentiful but often seemed accidental fingers brushing when passing coffee cups shoulders easing against each other when they stood side by side she once shamelessly seated her breasts against his arm as she leaned forward to look at an article on learning disabilities she thought he had returned the pressure but she couldnt be sure in any event he neither backed away nor prolonged the moment she didnt know whether to expect a proposition or not a proposition she would of course refuse she believed she would refuse she wanted him to kiss her she wanted him to leave she now touched his arm and he swayed close to her and diane sensed again the boundary between them that was continually being redefined they were like teenagers today she believed this barrier was clear and solid jamie was only thirty feet away in his room and although bill was at work it wasnt unheard of for him to drop by at this time of day stay for dinner then return to the office she and breck looked at each other for a long moment and she was vastly relieved when he looked at his watch and said must depart madame she was also pleased that he said this frowning with genuine disappointment he gathered his notebooks that was when diane kissed him like a sly college girl she glanced over her shoulder to make sure sarah was out of sight then pushed scholarly breck into the corner of the room and kissed him fast openmouthed then stepped away ohmygod ohmygod panic bubbled inside her terrified not that one of her children had seen not that word would get back to her husband no a more chilling fear what if he hadnt wanted to breck blinked once in surprise he put his hand on the back of her neck and pulled her quickly to him as he kissed her hard his forearm was leveraged against her breast and his hand made one slow sweep along the front of her blouse then wound around to the small of her back they embraced for a long moment then diane willed herself to break away they stood staring at each other two feet apart in surprise and embarrassed defiance he whispered can i see you before you go i have to i dont know the deputyll be watching us like a hawk i have to see you lets get away somewhere she thought i just dont see how look id like to tape sarah taking some tests if youre not going to be back for a couple weeks i should do it before you leave maybe you could come with us to the school we could have a picnic i dont know i want you he whispered diane stepped away rubbed her hands together she stared out the window at her daughter prancing about in the grass did i say something amiss breck asked oh my all theses highfalutin words all these snappy things he does for sarah all the places hes been and what is at the heart of it all him being a man and me being a woman do i want this or not i just cant tell for the life of me i cant tell but she said nothing she kissed him once more quickly then led him by the hand to the door they walked out to his car and she said to him itll be a couple weeks at the most in a whisper intended to convey grave significance she added i think its for the best anyway dont you no he said firmly i dont the big problem with the mytfine tap was the dirty plateglass windows they let in bleak northern cool light which turned the afternoon patrons all pasty and sick also sitting at a table you could look up under the bar and see the mosaic of twenty years worth of gum wads corde ordered an amstel so tired he wasnt even thinking it was a weekday and kresge said i just want to get this right its okay to drink light beer on duty corde changed the order to an iced tea they sat on stools upholstered in jukebox red vinyl squinting against the glare people used to tell sammie to fill up the window with plants they died or blinds they cost too much hed say its an ugly room who gives a damn anyway which it was and nobody did so they all stopped complaining corde asked what are we doing here waiting for her kresge said and pointed to the woman in her late fifties slender short with foamy gray hair she was walking through the door on the arm of an older man balding and also thin hey wynton the woman called hows darla tina earl come on over here for a second the couple walked over and kresge said to corde they eat here most every day she and darlare bridge buddies kresge introduced corde to earl and tina hess earl was a lanky retiree of about sixty his protruding ears and hook nose were bright with a may sunburn whats that uniform you got yourself wynton the school got you all duded up got a new job doing what im a deputy no kidding earl said like kojak hes still got himself some hair left corde said but not a lot we come for the tuna plates tina said you want to eat with us corde shook his head and turned the session over to kresge who said weve found ourselves a picture and we were thinking maybe you could tell us where it is tina he turned to corde tina worked for allied office supplies sales rep of the year fifteen years running my last year i lost to dk potts but only because he got himself the instant copy franchises up in higgins which are owned by the japanese and i wont comment on that kresge continued shes traveled all over the state knows every city bar none three years ago i put a hundred thirtyseven thousand miles on my ford you ever put that much mileage on a car before she rusted i should bet not no maam corde admitted she didnt tell you about the transmissions earl said earnestly kresge said weve got to find the building thats in the picture thats a sort of tall order tina said do i have to testify or anything no i was hoping i would you watch matlock fraid i dont corde said kresge set the photograph on the table whys it wrapped up earl asked poking the plastic bag evidence kresge said whys it burned was in a fireplace corde said you know where that is not much to go on tina squinted and studied it she held it toward her husband and he shrugged tina said no idea why you so interested itd help us in an investigation she handed it back sorry kresge taking the failure personally said it was a long shot corde kept the disappointment off his face thanks anyway were you part of that layoff at auden earl asked kresge layoff they let near to three hundred people go professors and staff kresge whistled three hundred no i left before that happened after that professor killed that girl earl said a lot of people took their kids out it was in the register didnt you read it tina said i wouldnt send my kids to any school that hired professors like that i cant blame them the couple wandered off to a booth as kresge and corde stood and dropped bills onto the bar tina called from across the room hey wynton got an idea why dont you ask somebody in the fitzberg c of c where that is who the chamber of commerce thats fitzberg corde asked pointing at kresges breast pocket where the burnt photo now resided sure didnt you know kresge laughed well no you said you didnt recognize it i thought you meant did i know what street it was of course its fitzberg what do you think that building is in the background firemans indemnity plaza where else you think they have a building like that earl said fitzbergs got a marshall field best store in the midwest dean catherine larraby walked in a slow circle around the perimeter of an oriental rug that had been acquired in by the then chancellor of the school whose first visitor to tread upon the new carpet happened to be william dean howells the august writer was lecturing at auden on the contemporary novel dean larraby mentioned this fact as she paced her eyes on the frayed carpet her visitor this morning wasnt as well known as howells at least not among literary circles though the dean treated him more reverentially than if he had been the ghost of the eminent literatus himself she was speaking of howells of dickens of the schools tradition of academic excellence of the number of harvard graduates on the auden faculty and vice versa when fred barrett a thickfaced slickhaired businessman from chicago stopped her cold by asking whats with these murders dean larraby heiress to great administrators and greater scholars overseer of this bastion of midwest letters smelled defeat she stopped pacing sighed and returned to her chair here he was another wealthy businessman able to loan enough money for her to conceal from the department of education auditors the bum loans she and randy sayles had made here he sat a godsend and yet she would now have to confess that yes a professor had killed a student and yes that students lesbian lover killed herself and that the professor had then murdered a colleague and that yes enrollment had fallen fourteen percent because of the whole damn mess he would then gather his london fog coat and place his jaunty hat on his head and walk away with his five million dollars and her job and the viability of auden university would depart with him the doe auditors were due in three days barrett had been her last chance she sighed and said im afraid we have had some tragedies on the campus this spring its unfortunate but you see why we need the money so desperately once we get this all behind us barrett asked this professor sayles is the one who called me i come all the way from cicero down here and i find hes dead he had an accent that she couldnt place im sorry if you wasted your time mr barrett he shook his head not a waste yet lets talk about lending some money hope glinted she considered tactics for a moment then said youre familiar with auden university not really its like a college the dean thought he might have been joking but she didnt dare risk a smile she looked around the room for a moment intuitively grasped that there was no irony in his question and readjusted her sales pitch i think it will be helpful to put the loan in context auden is one of the nations premiere institutions of higher learning im sure its a great place how much do you want dont mince words in chicago do you the dean sought refuge in the highrise of papers on her desk i know it sounds like a lot but i cant tell you how important it is to the school that we get this money barrett cocked an eyebrow which emphatically repeated his question dean larraby said softly five million he shook his head i know its a great deal she pleaded the nakedness of her voice shocked her and she spoke more slowly but the school is in desperate straits you have to understand that without its too little gotta be ten million minimum or we dont even talk to you dean larraby believed she misheard the man she ran through various permutations of his words you dont loan anything under ten million not worth our while but not worth our while this was a predicament she had not counted on you couldnt make an exception i could maybe talk my associates down to eight she wondered if she was being naive when she asked well if we were to do business with you would it be possible to borrow the eight and repay some of it early sure you can borrow it monday and repay it tuesday a lot of my clients do that they do dean larraby could find no logical reason for this practice and dropped it from her mind she regained her stride she lifted the schools financial statements from her desk and handed one to barrett he took it and flipped through the document as if it were printed in chinese he handed it back he shook his head that does me no good just tell me you want the money or no dont you want to know about the fiscal strength of the school our debt ratio our overhead dean larraby a liberal arts workhorse from the u of k was proud of this financial knowledge shed learned this useful knowledge no barrett said i want to know how much money you want it sounds like youre just asking me to name a figure barrett lifted both eyebrows this time she stalled well whats the interest rate prime plus two you should know theres a collateral problem were not interested in collateral were interested in you paying us back when youre supposed to well do that were trimming expenses and weve already fired three hundred and twelve employees weve hired a financial advisor and hes cutting barrett looked at his watch how much the dean inhaled nervously eight million done barrett smiled thats it youd write a check to us just like that barrett snorted a laugh not a check of course eight million dollars in cash she whispered he nodded isnt that risky its riskier with checks believe me i guess we could put it directly in the bank no barrett said cautiously that would be inappropriate the big word stumbling under his urban drawl when the dean looked at him quizzically he added what most of my clients do is keep it in their own safe and pay it out in small amounts if you have to bank it make sure its in different numbered accounts of less than ten thousand each thats a rather strange requirement yeah washington comes up with some funny rules the deans education was expanding exponentially your business is headquartered in chicago barrett said among other places and what line are you is it banking a number of lines dean larraby was nodding i dont suppose i should ask where this money comes from ask whatever you want where various business enterprises the dean was nodding this isnt illegal is it illegal barrett smiled like an insulted maitre d well lets look at the broad scenario im lending you money at a fair negotiated rate based on prime you pay it back principal and interest his eyes swept up to a portrait of a sideburned former dean that doesnt sound illegal to me i suppose not she said the dean looked out on the quadrangle then back to the william dean howells rug she wondered if she should ask directly if she had just committed her school to a major money laundering scheme but decided it might be insulting or incriminating and the risk of either was enough to put the kibosh on the question she looked out the windows and saw a lilac bush bending in a spring breeze this reminded her of whitmans poem about lincolns death and freeassociating she recalled that the last time she cried was in college on the wet afternoon of november she now felt her eyes fill with tears though this time they came from relief and perhaps joy she said i guess we have a deal barrett kept a noncommittal whataniceofficeyougot smile on his face he said you go up to ten million ill shave the points to one and threefourths the dean said mustnt be greedy now after all we have to pay it back yes maam youve got to do that wynton kresge said hes checking hes regular army put some salute in your voice when you talk to him corde picked up the receiver and listened to the hollowness of a phone on hold he was in his office and kresge was at a desk two feet away propelled by nervous energy both stood rather than sat after two minutes a crisp voice came on the line deputy kresge yes sir im here and i have on the line detective bill corde whos heading the investigation detective corde the voice said forcefully detective sergeant franklin neale up in fitzberg here you five by five sir five by five corde said well sir i understand we may have one of your perps down here thats what wynton tells me detective whatve you got well that polaroid you sent was a dead end we checked deeds and leases for a gilchrist negative that we knocked on doors of buildings shown in the pics and naturally got negatives there too but we did some brainstorming and stroked the folks at credit card companies as best we can tell theres a male perp cauc early forties no distinguishing using visa and amex in the names of gilchrist comma l and sayles comma rr its the same person using both cards thats what were reading sir neale said corde punched the air with a fist he winked at kresge you have a hideyhole for him kresge asked holiday inn eastwood near the river checked in as sayles he hasnt checked out no sir but we dont know whether hes in or not at the moment okay corde said weve got a warrant deputy kresge and ill be up there in about two hours youll keep surveillance on him ill fax you the warrant if he heads out before we get there pick him up will you yessir itll be our pleasure whatd his risk status be hows that corde asked he armed dangerous corde looked at kresge and said extremely dangerous the hardest part was lying to him it wasnt so difficult to tell him that his father couldnt be at the wrestling match after all and it wasnt so hard to see jamie take the news with heroic disappointment just a nod not even a burst of temper which she would have preferred because thats what she felt but making up her husbands words just stabbed her through your father said to tell you diane embellished that this killers on the loose and theyve got a real solid chance to catch him he tried to arrange it different but hes the ones got to go hes sending all his thoughts with you and diane said unable to look into her sons eyes he promised hell make it up to you what in truth happened was that corde had simply left for fitzberg and hadnt even bothered to call home or tell emma to do it for him what a long long wait it had been the time had crept past the hour when corde was due home cars passed but no new lebanon sheriffs department we serve and protect cruisers hurried up to the house the minutes dropping away as jamie and his teammate davey sat on the couch fidgeting joking at first as they talked about whupping higgins high schools butt then looking out the window anxiously then falling silent as sixthirty came and went diane had decided she was going to insist that corde break procedures and take the boys in the cruiser itself siren blazing and red light going like a beating heart at sixfifty diane had made the call it was much shorter than she let on emma the dispatcher told her bill and deputy kresge had hurried out the door and would be spending the night in fitzberg diane thanked her then listened to the dial tone as she continued her fake conversation at a higher volume oh bill what happened no really youve almost got him oh be careful honey well jamies going to be good and disappointed and here you were already a half hour late okay okay ill tell him then she delivered her improvised monologue and asked the deputy to step inside to babysit sarah let me get another deputy to go with you mrs corde your husband said theres my husband caused this mess she growled and we dont have time to wait diane and the two boys piled into the station wagon for a frantic ride to the higgins high school gym she ran every red light en route and was spoiling for a fight with any uniformed trooper foolish enough to pull her over bill you and meve gotta talk diane corde sat on hard bleachers sipping a watery coke she watched the crowds and thought of the smell the peculiar aroma of school gyms which a girlfriend had told her years ago came from boys jockstraps she wanted to tell this story to someone she wished ben breck were here sitting next to her after ten matches there was a staticky announcement the only words of which she discerned were jamie corde she set the coke beside her and fingerwhistled at a hundred decibels the visiting spectators cheered new lebanon diane watched her son striding out onto the mat brooding and engrossed and fluid in his step she whistled again bringing fingers to the ears of nearby fans she wailed for new lebanon and pummeled the bleachers with her feet the current fad to show support jamie was so focused so singleminded in his efforts he ran five miles every day pumped weights every other he trained and trained and he had recovered so well from the tragedy of philip he was even taking his fathers inexcusable neglect tonight in his stride diane felt a huge burst of pride for her son sending it telepathically out to him as he pulled on his head protector and shook his opponents hand jamie looked up into the bleachers she waved at him he acknowledged her in the only way that a competitor could respond to his mother here by looking at her once nodding solemnly then turning away she didnt mind she knew he was telling her that he had received her psychic message jamie strapped the blue cloth marker on his arm then reared his head back and breathed deeply the whistle blew and the boys exploded into frenzy jamies legs tensed then uncoiled as he leapt at his opponent a tall blond sophomore like a striking snake they gripped arms and necks heads together spinning spinning feet snagging the spongy blue mat inching like grappling crabs limbs confused with limbs dots of sweat flew faces crimson under foam protectors tendons rising thick from their necks furious scrabbling around the mat hands were claws gripping at knees and wrists diane shouted go go go come on jamie a brutal takedown jamie lifting the boy off the mat and driving him down onto his back his head bounced and the boy gazed upward momentarily stunned face glistening jamie pressed him hard into the mat furiously his opponents arms flailing several blows struck jamie on the back they were solid strikes but they rebounded without effect what was happening diane was frowning aware suddenly of the quiet of the crowd around her then people in the bleachers were on their feet shouting at the coaches and at the two boys the blond opponent tried to muscle himself away from jamie a centimeter at a time toward the outofbounds line twisting onto his side shouting hed given up and was bent on pure escape several people shot diane shocked glances as if she were responsible for her sons brutal attack she shouted jamie stop his opponents arm was turning bluegray under jamies relentless grip his legs kicked in despair the referees whistle blew shrilly jamie didnt let go he kept driving the boy into the ground and twisting his arm from which the red marker fluttered like a distress signal jamie she called honey the referee started forward the sportscoated coaches were on their feet shouting redfaced running toward the mat the referee dropped to his knees and slapped both hands on jamies shoulders jamie spun toward him and hit him hard in the chest off balance the referee rolled onto his back diane screamed her sons name jamie rose on one knee using all his leverage he bent his opponents forearm up up up thock diane heard the noise of the break all the way up in the bleachers she froze where she stood and raised her hand to her mouth watching her son standing smiling and triumphant over the unconscious figure of his vanquished enemy jamie turned on the coaches and they froze then the boy held his arm out straight and high then closed his fingers into a fist diane saw him glance toward her as he ran out the open double doors to the football field his arm still lifted in the macabre salute of victory detective frank neale was pretty much what corde expected crew cut blond beefy smooth ruddy skin too professional to put an if we outlaw guns then only outlaws will have guns sticker on his fitzberg police cruiser but dollars to doughnuts thered be one on his american x but god bless him he met corde and kresge after their frantic twohour drive with a thermos of the best coffee corde had ever tasted and four fat roast beef sandwiches they ate these as they raced through the bleak streets of urbandecaying fitzberg en route to what neale described as an mcp in the parking lot across from the holiday inn mcp kresge asked neale said mobile command post oh corde thought it wouldnt be much more than a police car with maybe two radios which is what an mcp in new lebanon would have been but no it was a big airconditioned ford van with room for six officers inside there was a large antenna dish on the roof kresge pointed out the bulletproof windows in the front jesus corde whispered maybe they got cannons too no artillery but a rack of lasersighted ms a gray box containing concussion grenades and rows of radios and computer screens and other imposing electronics kresge said all this for one perp standing as straight as the barrel of a goosegun neale said a lawbreakers a lawbreaker deputy and a killers my least favorite kind yeessir said kresge ill go along with you there corde hoped someday soon he could play the eyerolling game with kresge he said to neale wheres gilchrist now neale said tacsurv says hes in the room kresge asked tac tactical surveillance they say hes in the room but weve got a glitch hes taken in two innocents with him a couple prostitutes his profile isnt a lust killing but hes very unstable neale said weve got a sensiear on him hes paid the ladies already and now theyre getting down to fun and games if he goes rogue on us well do a kickin and nail him but if not its our policy to wait until were out of hostage situations is he the sort whod take a hostage hed do anything corde said emphatically to escape okay neale said subject to your goahead sir we wait the wind swirls into the low bowl of the cemetery and slips inside jamies onepiece wrestling uniform the boy shivers and stands up he carefully walks around the portion of the grave in which philips body lies and he leaves the cemetery walking slowly to the des plaines river here the waters course is narrow and as close to a rapids as a midwest farmland river ever gets upstream a quarter mile it forks and swirls around a small narrow island filled with brush and dense trees you cant wade the water but you can reach the island by a thick fallen birch which he and philip crossed hundreds of times to reach the dimensioncruiser that the island so clearly resembles jamie crosses the tree now looking down into the turbulence of the sudsy phosphatepolluted water and once across walks the familiar path past the cruisers control room the engine room the xaser torpedo tubes the escape vehicle jamie stops he sees on the other side of the island a night fisherman casting leisurely out into the water jamie is bitterly betrayed furious this is their private place his and philips no one else is allowed here in the days since philip died jamie has come here nearly every day to walk the cruisers decks he angrily resents this mans invading the island taking it over like a honon warrior the fisherman turns and looks at the boy in surprise then smiles and waves jamie ignores him and walks sullenly back through the island jamie stands under pines crowned with dusty illumination from the lights of higgins he pitches stones into the water in the gurgle of the torrent he imagines he hears the chugging rhythms of geiger the searing guitar riffs the screams from the sweating hatter of a lead singer he suddenly feels two mosquito stings on his arms after the insects drink for a moment he smashes them viciously leaving bloody black spots on his forearms he listens to the roar of the water do yourself you gotta do yourself you got to do yourself the sky long past blue is now the gray color of a xaser torpedo before it detonates the clouds separate for a moment and jamie sees the first star of the evening he feels a cloudburst of agony in his soul the pain gushing through him he is gripped with coarse panic and runs to the birch bridge he steps onto the tree do yourself you gotta do yourself now jamie walks halfway across then stops he lifts his arms like dathariv standing on top of the state governance building bridge a thousand feet above the solar crystals honon troops closing in from either side jamie corde stretches his arms high above his head two eyes closed balancing on twenty toes above a single abyss of racing water by the power of your wisdom by the strength of your might guide me o guardians to the lost dimension from darkness to light he drops like a meteorite into the dark rage of water he feels a scraping pain against his ear as the side of his head smacks the tree on his way down then a cold colder than hes ever felt envelops his body squeezing every last bit of breath from his lungs jamie corde looks up he sees water he sees blood and he sees in the tunnel of blackness above him a single star which he knows is the eye of a guardian agreeing to lift him away safely into a new dimension a second thermos of coffee appeared neale ran his fingers along his buzzcut hair and told them of the time one of his snipers picked off a perp at eight hundred yards god held his breath for that one neale said reverently on a panel like the dashboard of a a lonely red light began flashing and an electronic beep pulsed a sergeant picked up a receiver mcp one this is an unsecured landline go ahead he listened for a moment detective corde for you me he took the receiver corde here bill the hollowness of dianes whisper cried a hundred different messages to him he said honey what is it why are you bill corde could hear shed already cried volumes he heard noises behind her other voices he hated that sound they were hospital sounds he asked sarah jamie what happened hes in a coma he oh bill he tried to kill himself a fisherman found him but oh my lord he remembered and the thought was like a wallop in the stomach the wrestling match i missed it she didnt speak for a moment come home bill i want you here is he going to be okay they dont know he almost drowned he hit his head when he went in come home now when they hung up corde said wynton jamies hurt ive got to go oh no bill was it him he nodded toward the hotel no something else pretty serious ive got to go youre in charge here wynton kresge had the love for seven children in his voice when he said ill be thinking of you corde couldnt speak but just rested his hand on the deputys huge back in that brief gesture kresge felt a huge weight shift and remain on him even after corde stepped out the door kresge said well get him bill well get him i did this one bad didnt i corde said they sat in the intensive care unit of community hospital in a small waiting room separated from their son by a thick blond wood door the doctors were in with him now occasionally the large silver handle of a doorknob would flick and a nurse or doctor would exit silently this was the purest of punishments they held hands but there was minimal returning pressure from dianes corde figured he wasnt entitled to expect otherwise other than to tell him that jamie was in critical condition and still unconscious diane hadnt said more than five words since hed arrived after a perilous drive from fitzberg through the vast midwest night this was her worst anger a peacefuleyed camouflaged fury that seemed almost curiosity for the first time in his marriage corde wondered if hed lost his wife the case ran off with me he was thinking mostly of the impact on jamie but he remembered too that hed turned down the job of sheriff because of jennie gebbens death he supposed diane also was thinking of this i wish youd say something oh bill how can you figure it all out here we spent all our time with sarah we just assumed jamie didnt need us the way she did and it turns out he was the one that did and shes doing better without us this was mostly me corde said i knew about the match i was even looking forward to it then i heard about gilchrist and i got like a dog sniffing rabbit she stood up and walked down the hall to a pay phone whoever she was calling was not home she grimaced hung up retrieved her coin and sat down in silence their vigil continued corde took a quarter from his pocket and started rolling it over his fingers the coin fell and rang as it spun to a stop he picked it up and put it back into his pocket then the door opened and three doctors walked out both husband and wife locked onto their faces and began panning for clues but goddamn they were stoneeyed one the chief neurologist sat in a chair beside diane he began to speak corde heard the words brainstem minimal serious concussion no life support he talked for five minutes and told them all the things they could do for jamie they seemed to be good words or at least not bad words but when corde said when will our boy wake up the doctor said i dont have an answer for you but what do we do wait corde nodded diane was crying the doctor asked if theyd like sedatives they answered no simultaneously it wouldnt hurt to get some sleep the doctor answered i really dont think hell take a turn for the worse corde said why dont you run home honey get some rest im staying with my boy im staying too when the doctor left she curled up in an orange fiberglass chair and it seemed that she was instantly asleep corde rose and walked into the room to sit beside his son okay deputy home base is clear wynton kresge opened his eyes franklin neale stood above him shaking him awake what time is it sixthirty in the am the hookersre gone and home base is clear beg pardon kresge asked the magic thermos appeared again and coffee was poured kresge added three packets of sugar and sipped from the red plastic cup neale said you want to go in after him now or wait till he comes out kresge was asking bill corde silent questions and not a one of them got answered he looked at neale fresh as a recruit on parade he was cleanshaved what do you think neale shrugged well tactically its your classic situation if we go into his hideyhole theres a better chance of return fire if we get him on the street we could lose him or get some civvies casualtied in a firefight hearing this the military lingo made kresge feel better he decided he wasnt so much out of his element after all id like to go in and get him fair enough deputy weve got our swat team on standby you want them to do it wynton kresge said ill go in i want them as backup and the crewcut rosyskin detective was nodding solemn and eyerighteous one grunt to another thats the way id do it then he looked over kresges large frame and said okay lets suit you up in body armor i think weve got something that might fit as he applied the velcro straps to the type ii vest with the supershok plate over the heart wynton kresge thought suddenly of an aspect of being a policeman that he had never considered if the point of being a cop was ultimately to save lives then the flip side was true also he might have to take a life all the while sitting in his auden u office chair feeling the rub of the taurus automatic pistol on his belt he had never really considered using the gun oh thered been his theatrical little fantasies about winging terrorists but now kresge felt dread not at the real possibility that in five minutes hed be dodging slugs but at the opposite that he would have to send bullets hissing through the body of another man the thought terrified him deputy kresge realized the detective was speaking to him yes neale opened a diagram of the hotel look here whered you get that our swat team has layouts of all the hotels in town bus and train stations and most of the office buildings too this seemed like a good idea maybe hed suggest it to corde okay hes in here room theres no connecting door but theres this thing here what is it one of the other officers said they have a microwave and a little refrigerator there pipes stainless steel sink its probably enough to stop the hollowpoints but we cant use jacketed because of the street on the other side deputy kresge said i dont think we should give him any warning no gas or grenades take the door down and move in fast before he has a chance to set up a fire zone hed seen this in a mel gibson movie he added if thats in accordance with procedures neale said sounds good to me deputy lets get sergeant the young patrolman at the radio console said hes rabbitting left the room and is moving toward eastwood he listened into his headset for a moment then announced to neale and kresge tacsurv advising swat theyre three blocks away theyll proceed to deployment roger the detective said wheres he headed toward the river on foot got his suitcase with him hes moving fast kresge said wheres that from here a block well lets go get him neale pulled on a blue cap that said police on the crest tacsurv says hes vanished he turned before he got to the bridge into those old warehouses down by the riverfront hes gone north they guess the door of the van burst open and kresge squinted against the blinding light which way follow me neale began running across the street past a scabby field overgrown with weeds and strewn with rusted hunks of metal kresge could see block after block of one and twostory warehouses most of them dilapidated some burnt out a perfect hiding place for someone on the run a perfect vantage place for a sniper an econoline van screeched to a stop nearby five swat officers jumped out kresge heard load and lock green team deploy south blue north hug the river go go go neale pulled up in front of the first building deputy kresge looked at him and saw he was motioning to kresges pistol still in its holster oh kresge unsnapped the thong and drew the gun he pumped a round into the chamber and slid his right index finger parallel to the barrel he felt a monumental spurt of energy surge through his chest neale pointed to himself then to the right kresge nodded and turned the opposite way toward the river a minute later kresge found himself in a long alleyway through which ran rusted narrowgauge rail lines it was filled with thousands of black doorways and windows and loading docks oh boy he sighed and jumped over a small stone abutment as he ran into the war zone the first five buildings were pure hell spinning ducking aiming his pistol at shadows and garbage bags and shutters then having gotten this far without being shot kresge grew bolder gilchrist didnt want to get trapped his whole points to escape hes not going to back himself into a closed warehouse though it was in a warehouse that kresge found him the deputy stepped into a huge abandoned space pillars of jagged sun coming through the broken panes of skylight and there was the man he sought not fifty feet away hiding beside an old boiler he held no weapons just an old suitcase he looked benign and small next to the huge tank a slight man blond ashen and nervous it occurred to kresge that this was the first time anybody involved in the investigation had actually seen leon gilchrist it wasnt much of a sighting the light here was dusty and diffuse kresge shouted freeze the man did but only in shock and only for a moment then very slowly he turned his back to kresge and started to walk away as if he were reluctantly leaving a lover stop ill shoot step by step he kept going never looking back kresge aimed a clear target perfect better than on the small arms range at higgins his finger slipped into the guard and he started putting poundage on the trigger about halfway to its eleven pounds of pull he lowered the gun and muttered shit then took off at a full gallop ahead of him the silhouette became a shadow and then vanished one of the patrolmen temporarily assigned to felap the fitzberg felony apprehension squad was tony laporda a great round chunk of a man who wore his service revolver high on his belt and his illegal automatic in a soft holster under his pungent armpit he was a smallcity cop a breed halfway between the calm slopeshouldered civil servant urban police of say new york and the staunch cowboys of atlanta or san antonio laporda wore a leather jacket with a fur collar and dark slacks and a hat with a patentleather brim and checkered band around the crown he was typical of the five patrolmen working north side gla whod been told to volunteer for a couple hours at time and a half to collar some professor from new lebanon whod stuck the big one to a student of his for this assignment laporda was given a special frequency for his motorola and a flak jacket but not an m nobody but swat had rifles this leon gilchrist not being a terrorist or anything but a fucking professor laporda was not very excited about the project especially when it turned out that the perp was on the move laporda hated running even more than he hated the riverfront he trotted lethargically toward one large warehouse where he figured he might sit the whole thing out he pulled up with a stitch in his side thinking jesus christ this fucking aerobic fucking jane fonda crap is what they pay fucking swat for he leaned against a warehouse wall listening to the staticky voices of what a buddy had dubbed the felony apprehension response team nobody was faster than cops with this sort of acronym laporda called in too saying that hed had no sign of the perp but was on his way to the riverfront for further investigation then he dug into his jacket pocket for his camels he shook one out and put his lips around it he was startled when a polite voice next to him said need a match when laporda turned he didnt see who was speaking all he saw was a rusty pipe four inches wide and about four feet long as it whistled square into his face the ponk echoed off the walls nearby laporda collapsed in a large pile and began to bleed heavily he did not lose consciousness at first and was aware of hands rifling his shirt the hands were persistent but delicate the man they belonged to didnt seem very strong professors hands he thought then he passed out wynton kresge caught him lifting the fallen patrolmans service revolver out of its holster kresge wondered if gilchrist had killed the officer hold it right there he turned and their eyes met the two were alone there were no footsteps no crackles of walkietalkies the rest of the teams had passed them by dont move kresge said he aimed at the darting dark eyes then remembered the deputys procedural guide rule the chest not the head is the preferred target in an arrest situation kresge said drop the gun the sunlight bounced off a high window and illuminated the men in pale light drop it lets talk about this kresge nodded at the mans gun now it was a doubleaction revolver all gilchrist had to do was aim and pull the trigger no safety no slides rule identify suspects weapon immediately im not going to tell you again do you want some money how much do you want a thousand no problem he nodded toward the cop that was an accident he fell i was trying to help him you want two thousand he gestured casually toward his suitcase which moved the muzzle of the revolver closer to kresge he remembered the silhouette targets on the higgins range he said ill count to three hey why dont you just count to ten and give me a chance to go away what could be easier than that two thousand dollars cash ive got it right there in my suitcase if you dont drop the gun immediately kresge said i am going to shoot you oh i dont think so officer he moved he said something detective corde the nurse said i dont know what it was exactly he explained telephone for you sir corde said to her he moved he said something the nurse who knew all about sleepdeprivation hallucinating glanced down at jamies immobile form thats wonderful he sat up she had also read jamies chart and she knew that he was as likely to fly loopdeloops through the room as he was to sit up and utter one syllable thats wonderful dont you want to tell the doctor she said its a policeman in fitzberg on the line he said its urgent okay corde turned his red eyes to the phone he walked groggily toward it no sir its out here we dont put calls through to the icu oh standing at the nurses station corde accepted the phone and said hello he heard wynton kresge ask hows your son hes asleep now wynton but he sat up and said something to me i heard him i dont know what he said but i heard him thats good bill gilchrist is dead uhhuh you got him he was trying to get away he had sayless credit cards in his wallet some other peoples too hed stolen them or bought them he was going to cover his tracks real well what happened bill i wanted to talk to you about it about what i did he had a gun he was waving it around i shot him four times thats good wynton i couldnt stop myself i kept pulling the trigger he just fell over and died i shot him four times you did fine but the thing is bill i wasnt sure i mean not really sure he was going to use his gun i just couldnt tell did they give it to the fitzberg da theyre not going to indict you are they no but its not the law part im talking about i killed him and he might not have been going to shoot me wynton he killed jennie and he killed sayles he was going to draw down on you but i just dont know he was corde was looking back into the hospital room all he could see was a mound under the gray sheet that was his jamie we never really know wynton i didnt want to bother you bill but i had to say it kind of get it off my chest you get back you and mell go hunting we can talk about it then corde closed his eyes and leaned wearily against the wall i hope jamie gets better real soon he talked to me corde said did i tell you that he sat up and said something to me i wish i could remember what corde missed the nurse glancing at him with a sad straight line of a mouth kresge said tell him im thinking of him i will wynton corde hung up the telephone and walked back into jamies room bill corde a tall man now hunched over with short trimmed hair now mussed a man in whose heart one grave burden had been eased while another had been accepted he sat down on a low chair beside his sons bed corde didnt know what a fashion plate was but he decided if dr parker was one it was no way an insult he wished new lebanon could get a few more of them sitting at the spotless desk the good doctor was wearing a hot pink dress cut low enough so corde could have seen a number of freckles on her chest if he was inclined to look which he was and he did her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and she was wearing a thick gold bracelet which corde figured he himself mightve bought her what with all the fees she had matching earrings and he imagined that those too were courtesy of him im pleased to meet you at last officer on the other hand the way she dabbed her eyes over him he believed she was examining him distrustfully he wondered if diane had blown some whistles well i sure have heard good things about you doctor sarahs a whole new girl since shes been seeing you the dr parker of reputation emerged she nodded aside the compliment and asked abruptly sarahs here isnt she shes in the waiting room why didnt your wife come she at the hospital thats right jamies been in and out of consciousness they think hes going to be all right he might have some memory problems they say maybe some other things a neurologist is going to give him some tests dr weinstein at community supposed to be the best in the county thats what we heard dr parker gazed at corde passively and said nothing you know what happened was cordes voice suddenly stopped working dr parker continued he tried to kill himself mrs corde told me i dont know what itll be like when he gets home i dont know what happened exactly or why but if youd be available id be happy to see both of you she said sincerely but didnt seem to be looking forward to it both of us corde nodded id appreciate that the doctor opened her drawer and lifted out a thick handful of papers corde had a bad moment thinking they were more bills she slid them across the desk he glanced at the first one dense with singlespaced writing and topped by sarahs byline without looking up he said she wrote these theyre her most recent tapes my secretarys typed them up she speaks very well youll notice there are only a few places where the words are garbles and remarkably few places where she goes back to correct herself or misspeaks corde clipped through the stack there must be a hundred pages here close to it he had thought all along that the whole idea was silly if sarah was going to do all this work why not make her copy a history book or science book something practical something that she could use in school what possible benefit did these stories have but he kept this to himself he knew hed play along with the doctor she was the expert besides bill corde was nothing if not a sport is it really a book more a collection of short stories with recurrent characters like the winnie the pooh stories or song of the south you know brer fox and brer rabbit are they any good mr corde for a nineyearold with her history and her problems they are remarkable what should i do with them you nothing dr breck is using these stories in sarahs exercises her learning will be exponentially increased if she works with words that she herself has created exponentially sure its probably a lot of fun too some blunder here dr parker was frowning its mostly a great deal of work sure ill bet it is corde riffled the pages again and let the breeze scented with typewriter oil and expensive bond paper blow into his face he rose and started toward the waiting room where sarah was waiting she did this all by herself hell i get sweaty hands every time i have to write out an incident explanation on an mv form maybe your daughter can teach you a few things mr corde dr parker said and allowed herself an indulgent smile bill corde doesnt know what to think he sits on a folding chair in his den and flips back and forth through sarahs book hes read about shapechanging wizards about dragons and princesses and talking cars flying loaves of bread dancing blackbirds and bobcats that sing opera under full moons why bobcats because thats what they are sarah explains why opera because she answers with such exasperation that corde who asked the question solely because he couldnt think of anything else to say feels ashamed and therefore doesnt ask why the full moon which hed intended to this is what dr breck and i are doing she explains touching the typed sheets first then a blank piece of paper in front of her we move all these words over here like theyre on a magic train a train ah they sit in the den corde with his shoes off stretched back on the couch feeling like a dog in front of a fire sarah is at the wobbly desk corde had been by the hospital at seven that morning he is utterly exhausted though much of that fatigue is held at bay by his daughters enthusiasm for copying her book her leg vibrates with excitement at her task its a mystery to corde all these stories of magic otters and flying eagles and trolls and shining wizards cordes library contains mostly hunting and fishing nonfiction the animals he reads about are wolves and grizzles and damn clever trout who elude the most wellplaced tufts of fly they do not wear aviator hats and wetsuits and they do not hold parties in tree trunks or sing any kind of music in the moonlight he decides that his daughter would be the kind of film director whose movies he would not go to see but he can compliment her on her work which he does and watch with fascination as she leans forward writing with the awkward elegance of a doe on ice corde notices her techniques with her index finger she writes letters and words on her palm she traces the letters in a dust of salt on the tabletop she tears sheets of paper containing a single word into portions of the word and stares at them corde himself forgets what the fragments of words are called syllabus no then he remembers syllables although her spelling still needs much work her selfconfidence is bursting he has never seen her enjoy herself this way he looks at the first page of the slim stack of sheets sarah has printed my book by sarah rebecca corde fourth grade dedicated to dr breck my tutor corde stares at this for a few minutes wondering if jealousy will surface it does not when she finishes corde rises to leave he watches her for a moment then leans forward and hugs her suddenly and hard this surprises and pleases her and she hugs back enthusiastically corde does not tell his daughter that the complex gratitude he is filled with is only in part for her an officer in the fitzberg police departments demographics and vital statistics division made the discovery the demvit man had been crosschecking prints of the bodies of recent dcdss found at crime scenes against known felons warrants open and was at the tail end of his shift so it took him longer than it normally would have to find the glitch he marked his conclusion down on an bid form and was about to drop it in the interoffice mail to the detective division when he noticed that the body was due for shipping out later that day oh boy reluctantly he called mister master sergeant super detective franklin neale detective this is tech officer golding in demvit yes golding whats on the agenda neale said hup two three four theres an eid on that deceased confirmed dead you sent to the morgue two days ago an erroneous id neale growled tell me about it officer we had a tentative id from personal effects and from some outoftown deputy yes thats right the dcds was the perp in a foureleven two counts fellow was a real bad operator tell me dickhead do you polish your medals every night yessir golding said well the prints the coroner sent down match a felon theres a bench warrant out on eddie scavello two counts armed one burglary and ten receiving stolen rap sheet full of hot plastic youre sure were talking ninetyeight percent there was silence neale said okay do me a favor fax the bid to harrison county and new lebanon sheriffs departments they have a fax machine in new lebanon officer neale said consolidated law enforcement agency guidelines require one in every town it was a joke over five thousand population oh thats right im glad you reminded me whose attention wynton kresge at county william corde in new lebanon thats deputy kresge and detective corde write that down and dont get them mixed up no sir i wouldnt and attach a cover note mark it urgent and tell them it looks like their boy gilchrist is still a loose cannon my compliments on a job well done tech officer a pleasure to be of help detective brian okun celebrated the announcement that auden university would stay open for another year in what he thought was an appropriate manner he fucked a student on leon gilchrists desk he had another cause for celebration as well he would subject to formal acceptance of his phd thesis this summer be joining the faculty of the department of english college of arts and sciences auden university okun was now alone the blond student ironically one who had sat next to jennie gebben in his seminar session was gone and he sat naked to the waist in gilchrists chair spinning in slow circles the blinds were down and since the ac was off the school being officially closed for two weeks until summer school began the office was hot as an ozark swamp in august okun looked at spots of moisture on the desktop and wondered whether they were semen or sweat okun had been shocked at the news that gilchrist was a killer for a horrible moment he had wondered if the rumor he had started had gotten out of hand but in reading the register he had understood that gilchrist and jennie had had an affair but killing her and professor sayles astonishing okun had suspected that gilchrist was violent and probably was capable of murder but he had never thought that he would kill and now the son of bitch was himself dead shot down by police okun searched his repertoire for a suitable maxim that might summarize the man he could think of nothing slipping on his tshirt okun stretched out again gazing at the old prints at the hundreds of books that he supposed would go into gilchrists estate an old volume of freud that might be valuable more recent books on psychoses and literature okun had no claim to them even as gilchrists academic successor but he figured he could pilfer the choicest ones before the dean raided the office musing on these additions to his library feeling warm and spent smelling a may breeze and the redolence of sex okun closed his eyes he was awakened sometime later by a slight stinging on his neck at first he thought a bee or mosquito had gotten him but as he reached up to the sting he found himself so weak that he could barely lift his hand above his chest he looked down and saw that his shirt was soaked with blood he cried out and forced his hands to his neck he touched the loose flap of skin where his carotid artery had been severed okun tried to stand and fell immediately to the floor he grabbed at the telephone cord and pulled it off the desk onto the floor beside him ohgodhelp the weakness of his voice terrified him he pressed the receiver slipped from his bloody hand he managed to retrieve it he pressed he stared at the blurring number pad of the phone he tried to touch the final digit but found his arm would not respond he heard a hum and a click then a threepart ascending musical tone followed by a womans electronicallygenerated voice speaking to him saying the last words he would ever hear your call cannot be completed as dialed please hang up and try your call again diane corde slipped her arms around ben breck and hugged him hard this seemed a wholly natural thing to do standing up in her garden as she watched him pull up in the driveway then walking quickly to him wrapping her arms around him feeling his around her wholly natural this frightened her terribly she said i left a message for you at the library ive been over at arts and sciences hows jamie thats what i called about hes much better i just got back from the hospital diane realized with a shock that they were still embracing she stepped back quickly oh god the neighbors at least he didnt kiss me she looked around and stepped into the cover of the juniper bushes breck followed and why didnt he kiss me diane haltingly explained jamies diagnosis by rote not even hearing the words shed repeated a dozen times that day as they talked breck slipped his hands into his pockets this added to his boyishness and made him infuriatingly appealing he wore dark jeans and a thick burgundy sweater with a braided collar he said you told me on the phone that wisconsins out surely is seems they got that fellow got him up in fitzberg relief seemed to flood into his face im glad you wont be going agree with you there doriss never outgrown the big sister complex and its hardly fair since she only outranks me by thirteen months i have more selfish reasons for being glad youre not going he spoke seductively diane swallowed say ben i think you and i ought to have a talk somewhere alone he smiled private a thought seemed to slip spontaneously into his mind how about my place no she whined playfully im serious the smile faded are you saying you dont want to see me no diane said quickly im just saying we have to talk before things get you know get too complicated fair enough diane tamped on mounds of moist earth at the base of some newly planted zinnias and asked if he wanted something to drink she had a recurring image of her pouring coffee or wine into him in the afternoons trying to delay his leaving all these beverages struck her as funny she wondered if he ever felt waterlogged on the drive home no i just better collect sarah ive got the video camera reserved for twothirty honey diane shouted dr brecks here kay came the answering shout diane asked these tests youre giving sarah what are they theyre the same as dr parker gave her i want to correlate shortterm results to sessions of study per week the first draft of my article for the new england journal of child psychology is due tomorrow and i wanted to include her revised results on the bender gestalt and grays oral the data are also important for me theyll give me an idea of where we should go next data are some boys never quit being the showoffs you think theyll upset her diane asked cautiously he shook his head ill be videotaping her but its a hidden camera shell never know shes being filmed shell do fine sarahs face appeared through the front screen door dr breck hello sarah bring your book with you if we get a chance well do some more work ive got it here she slapped her backpack all of it everything the new pages from dr parker too good lets get a move on she ran to the car he hesitated his face clouded diane noticed it something wrong his eyes were distant he didnt seem to hear her and she repeated the question touching his arm gently he blinked and said i was thinking about jamie no no hes going to be fine he is brecks smile returned but diane saw a glint of something in his eyes regret or pining she believed she considered this perhaps what she saw was a childless man approaching middle age which was one of the saddest things she could imagine she wanted to wrap her arms around him she muscled up restraint and laughed that boys going to be just fine hes a tough one i must stop by and visit him sometime ill bring him a present maybe something about that movie he liked come on dr breck diane said to them both dont be late and stepped back into the tilled dirt of her garden when he noticed tom the young deputy who had guarded his house walking toward him corde was crouched down jamming stacks of papers from the gebben case into file cabinets in the small storeroom off the sheriffs department he paused a file halfway sunk into a clogged drawer he froze as he watched the grave face of the approaching deputy jamie he knew without a doubt that the hospital had just called and that his son had died when corde had last seen him the boy was frighteningly disoriented his eyes wouldnt stay on his fathers face and he blacked out twice propelled by fear corde rose fast his knee a resounding gunshot what is it he demanded the desperation in his voice stopped the deputy short tom told him theres a problem on your case bill case corde was confused he wasnt working on any cases at the moment the only case he could have meant was the gebben case but it was closed corde knew this because he had written that word in careful block printing in the status box on form fi which was this very moment sitting in sheriff jim slocums in basket corde was wrong tom said we just got a fax an erroneous identification notice from fitzberg the man wynton kresge shot wasnt gilchrist it was some guy with a rap sheet full of gl arrests mostly credit card dealing prints confirmed it oh no corde closed his eyes as he leaned against the doorjamb did you tell wynton yessir and emma says a call just came in a grad student was found in gilchrists old office a few minutes ago murdered looks like okun was that the name matter of fact thats it cordes grimset mouth didnt come close to the despair he felt and fear too gilchrist had returned to new lebanon and corde knew why okay tom get over to my house now and keep an eye on diane and sarah i think gilchrist is after them and get somebody over to the hospital to stay with jamie will do as he hurried back to the squad room emma shouted from the dispatcher office detective corde its wynton kresge on the phone for you hes over at the university corde sent tom on his way then trotted to his office and snatched up the phone wynton whatve we got killed just like sayles bill kresge sounded despondent cut throat razor witness says a car stopped outside the building man matching gilchrists description got out and went inside for three four minutes then left got into the car and drove off latemodel green sedan no tag no make about forty minutes ago any idea where he headed just toward the campus exit they didnt see after that there was a lengthy pause both men lost in their own vital thoughts kresge finally said looks like i got the wrong man huh bill cordes squad car moves at seventy lights whipping around siren grating the driving is fast but in this big taut american cruiser oddly placid he is on the outskirts of town passing small stores and buildings he sees a vets office dog cat hospital the numeral substituting for an ampersand stolen long ago along white structure tribution centr burnt out letters never replaced he blazed through the towns last stoplight then the land opens up there is no traffic and corde is free to have a discussion with himself this makes him extremely agitated think goddamn it think leon gilchrist who sees by the light of pure brilliance the prince of auden university come on think of something clever think of something unlikely think of something he would think of think his hands sweat and he feels ill i cant think the newspaper clipping the scrawled threat it could happen to them corde zooms past andy dexters harvester listing half off the highway as it bobs along at ten miles per hour the cruisers slipstream rattles the blades as it passes i cant think the way he does hes too smart for me corde sees the polaroid of sarah and jamie looking safe and silly as actors in a commercial he sees gilchrists handwriting say goodbye detective corde crests the road by sutlers farm and is blinded by a sheet of stunning sun the streaked bugdotted windshield goes opaque he is out of the glare immediately dropping rollercoaster over the hill and sees before him a threemile straightaway of cambered gray asphalt his foot aims for the accelerator then waffles and goes suddenly to the brake his skid is as precariously controlled as the ones he practiced for weeks on the state police course the dodge comes to rest dead center in the road at the head of twin black stripes the cloud of burnt rubber and dust catches up with the cruiser encloses it then passes away intact on an impossibly gentle breeze cordes car sat askew in front of his own house half on the lawn engine still running next to toms cruiser which was parked civilly in the center of the driveway inside diane looked up at her husbands wide green eyes as he burst through the door he took her hands and placed her on the couch youre scaring me bill as if speaking to a stranger is it jamie whats happened corde sat next to her his breath was rapid he didnt let go of her hands she squirmed what she said then louder what is it i think he squeezed her cold fingers i think ben breck is leon gilchrist oh god no dianes voice crumbled no its not true gilchrist is a special education lecturer at auden isnt that the department where the tutors work she nodded her eyes sweeping the floor at her feet he couldve read sarahs file and known all about her problem no bill she protested no what does he look like no no no he wouldnt do that to me he wouldnt do it her voice vanished in hysterical sobbing diane corde said harshly youve got to help me on this think oh bill no he gripped her shoulders describe him she did as best she could her words punctuated with sobs when she finished she cried oh god it cant be i know it cant dianes description was vague but it did depict someone who could resemble gilchrist wheres he staying i dont know near hear somewhere he never told me he never told you corde shouted how did you call him usually he called me when i called i left messages at the library i never saw his office every word grew weaker as the evidence mounted what kind of car does he drive i dont know quit crossexamining me corde gripped his wife by her shoulders think you mustve seen it is it green i dont know just a car american i think a fourdoor of some kind i dont remember the color i think it was dark no oh and i just saw it when he picked her up her hands flew to her face oh bill sarah corde shouted sarahs with him now he grabbed the phone and dialed auden he heard a click you have reached auden university the school will be closed until summer session registration on june if you would like to leave a message press the number of the extension for the department you wish to reach and at the tone leave your message if you he slammed the phone down he paused a moment then picked up the receiver again intending to dial directory assistance in his frazzled state of mind he dialed by mistake he shuddered at the error and pressed the receiver cradle down then released it the line wouldnt disconnect he held it again for three seconds still no dial tone then five seconds god strike them dead finally he heard the tone four one one operator this is the new lebanon sheriffs department we have a police emergency i need the number and address of a man named breck in new lebanon breck first name how many brecks do you have ben benjamin the wait was a huge black pit he heard the clattering of keys he heard pages riffling he heard a onesided conversation another operator saying ill bring em home but you have to cook em i wont have time sir yes corde asked how would you be spelling that spell it how do you think breck theres no listing of ben benjamin or b breck in new lebanon or fredericksberg would he he jammed the button on the phone down again shaking his head he made another call dr parkers receptionist said she was with a patient and corde said please tell her this is an emergency the psychiatrist came on the phone and said coolly yes mr corde he said do you personally know dr breck why whats the problem do you know him she paused a moment in irritation but must have sensed the urgency she said no but ive spoken to him several times about sarahs course of treatment but it might not have been breck you talked to you mean you think he was an impostor oh i dont think so he seemed to know a great deal about your daughter come to think of it he knew a great deal about your whole family detective whats your daddy doing today dr breck asked i dont know hes at work i guess do you love your daddy oh yeah sure does your mommy love your daddy sure i guess dr breck drove quickly the scenery raced past as if sarah were riding cloudtipper the eagle a barn was a red dot in the distance then a red ball then a huge red whale then it vanished behind them like a wish dr breck slowed and pulled into the driveway of the college he turned toward a part of the school that was deserted more trees than buildings sarah was able to read at least one sign auden university she couldnt understand the word university but she had memorized it because this was where dr breck worked and that made it important to her i like these buildings sarah announced they looked to her like castles only without gates and drawbridges and the lakes around them some even had updown teeth on the tops like in robin hood the old robin hood the good one where the sheriffs soldiers stood and shot crossbow darts at the star renamed by her arrow flynn sarahs book contained two stories about castles dr breck had remained silent as they drove he seemed lost in thought and she didnt want to trouble him but she tried to read the sign in the front of the building they were passing she couldnt and she asked him about the words it says graduate school of education he answered read the other sign there she frowned arts oh oh oh and school of i can read those and sciences thats good he said school of arts and sciences i got back my last story from dr parker sarah said can we read it today if youd like its my favorite its about a wizard i saw over by blackfoot pond he lives in the woods behind my house he watches the house a lot it took me forever to write it i wanted to get it just right its got cloudtipper the eagle in it and with sudden curiosity dr breck asked this wizards in your story uhhuh its called the sunshine man thats his name and you saw him by blackfoot pond when one morning last month i guess hes been behind the house too what does he look like i never saw him up close sarah brushed a strand of hair off her face you know dr breck i wanted to ask the sunshine man to make me smart only i was scared to but i think he knew i think he sent you to me you think so dr breck pulled the car onto an empty parking lot beside a deserted building he braked to a stop she reached for the door handle but before she could pull the lever up dr brecks hand touched her arm no sarah wait just a minute she did as she was told corde ran to the front door he said to tom deputy his voice shook and he took a deep breath to calm himself before starting again i think that man whos been coming here for the past month breck i think hes gilchrist what im not going into it now he turned to diane he and sarah left when through her tears she said a half hour ago where are they where could they go where has he taken my daughter they were going to the school which school auden to take some tests oh bill she sobbed and gripped the pillow hysterically he said he was going to tape her he had a camera corde said to the deputy do an apb state and federal call in a kidnappinginprogress code and an approachwithcaution check auden first but if he killed okun this morning this brought a moan from diane i doubt hes anywhere near the campus now right sir and you tell them that its my daughter hes got yessir if he hostages her im doing the negotiating got it tell that to slocum and ellison and if they have any trouble with that theyre to call me and i want somebody to keep an eye on wynton kresges house watch his wife and all the kids where is she where is my daughter the deputy asked you gonna stay here sir or you want a couple men on the house oh bill diane whispered please god all units in the vicinity from outside over the pa system of both squad cars as if in stereo came the radio broadcast all units in the vicinity tenthirtythree in progress school of education building auden university assault man with a knife or razor in latemodel sedan no plates corde and diane looked at each other further to that tenthirtythree ambulance is en route and we have unconfirmed report that a juvenile is involved make that a female juvenile about ten years of age repeat tenthirtythree in progress it looked like an auto accident the drivers door open the figure lying bloody and still beside the car one foot up on the drivers seat revolving red lights men and women in uniform diane screamed and flung open the door before corde had brought his cruiser to a stop in the school parking lot she sprinted over the cracked asphalt to where the ambulance crew a cluster of whitecoated attendants was huddled working feverishly with her hands over her mouth diane looked down then closed her eyes muttering indistinct words over and over corde trotted to the car and looked down at the bloody mass at his feet he took a deep breath and peered over the head of an attendant it was not sarah lying on his back ben breck opened his eyes he squinted and spit blood he whispered halting yet astonished words leon gilchrist following us he held up his arm to examine deep slashes in the palm of his hand with serene curiosity i dont feel any pain he looked back at diane we were in the car he just appeared just like that had a razor wheres sarah diane cried corde said to a county deputy do you know who this man is diane shouted at her husband its ben breck shes right detective the deputy offered corde a bloody wallet he opened it inside there was an illinois drivers license with brecks picture a university of chicago faculty picture id and an auden id which identified him as a visiting professor visiting professor so a temporary address and no directory assistance listing corde crouched wheres sarah she ran i think hes got her breck gasped i dont know what happened he was the words dissolved into bloody coughing wed stopped and he came up behind the car he was just there cutting me slashing grabbing for sarah did he hurt her diane asked choking on tears i dont i couldnt see an attendant finished applying a tourniquet and started bandaging a deep cut corde asked breck where did they go did you see there there breck reached up a bloody hand at first corde thought he was pointing out a direction but no he saw in the front seat of the car two typed pages corde said those sheets breck nodded take them read im getting very dizzy my mouth is dry he closed his eyes corde picked up the sheets he started to read his attention flagged and he looked down diane took brecks face in both of her slick red hands and shouted to him youre going to be all right youre going to be fine do you hear me do you hear me she looked up at her husband corde put his hand on her shoulder she picked it up and flung it off then lowered her head to brecks chest and began to cry it wasnt until the ambulance left a minute later kicking up dust and siren howling that corde walked abruptly back to his car and sat in the drivers seat finally he began to read they stepped over a tangle of brush between two beech trees that pretty much marked the start of cordes backyard and entered the forest at the exact spot he had seen or imagined the moonlit face staring at the house a month before they walked on a carpet of springdried leaves and low raspy grass yellow and deerchewed beside him dressed in a beige uniform and tan windbreaker wynton kresge was carrying a remington pump shotgun the gun had a stiff sling but he did not carry it slung he held it twohanded like a soldier index finger pointed forward outside of the trigger guard the men walked quickly corde consulting two sheets of darkstained typewriter paper as if they were instructions on a scavenger hunt the sky was milky the sun a white disk low in the sky was trying to burn off the overcast but the density of gray meant that it was going to lose the forest the cow pasture the yellowgreen carpet in front of him were an opaque watercolor a coal black grackle flew immediately toward him then turned abruptly away startling both men at an old burntdown barn that he had forbidden jamie and sarah from playing in they turned right beams of the silo rose like charred bones they walked on over an old railroad bridge then followed the gravelly roadbed to the des plaines they walked along the bank through more woods until they found the house corde folded the sheets of paper and put them in his pocket the house was another dilapidated colonial two stories narrow and sagging this one was set in a grim scruffy clearing past which you could see storage tanks along the river a tug towed a rusty barge upstream its harsh chugging engine irksome in the heavy air in the front yard was parked a green car a hertz sticker in the windshield corde read the plate its the one gilchrist rented corde crouched and kresge knelt beside him under cover of a fallen branch corde looked at the ground he said you stay outside no matter what you hear if he comes out alone stop him hes the only one who knows where sarah is i want him alive kresge said id feel better calling in some backup thats what the manual says in cases like this corde kept studying the house lord it seemed ominous towery and pale mean he said im going to get my daughter one way or another i may need some time with gilchrist by myself kresge looked long at corde considering these words he turned back to the house howd you know this was his place corde shushed him together they closed in on the colonial kresge crouched behind the hertz car and rested the shotgun on the hood he pointed at the front and back doors nodding meaning that he could cover them both corde nodded back and crouching ran to the front of the house he paused beside the rotting gray porch he caught his breath then eased slowly up to the door he smashed the door in with a vicious kick of his boot and stepped into the rancidsmelling house the room was milky as if illuminated through smoke or mist light already diffused by the clouds ambled off the silver maple leaves outside and fell ashen in the room the carpet walls plywood furniture paintings seemed bleached by this weak radiance a terrible moment passed corde believed the house was empty and gilchrist had escaped from them again then his eyes grew accustomed to the weak light and he saw at the end of the room a pale shape a sphere that moved it was mottled with indefinite features like the surface of the moon corde saw that it was a mans head and that he was staring back at corde the man slowly rose and stood behind a cluttered desk about sixtwo graying brown hair trim gangling arms and long thin hands he wore a conservative light green tweed sports jacket and tan slacks his face gave no clue that he was surprised by the intrusion he examined corde with brown eyes that were the only dark aspects of his person he looks like me was the thought that passed involuntarily through cordes mind gilchrist he said evenly where is my daughter leon gilchrist walked through a thick beam of dusty light and stopped ten feet from corde he folded his arms a mirthful half smile was on his face well i am surprised detective corde i want to know where she is cordes voice trembled i want to know now of course you do sarah corde shouted looking at a stairway that led to the second floor i was just thinking of you gilchrist said mildly youd be surprised how often youre in my thoughts about as often as i am in yours id guess corde stepped forward raising his revolver to gilchrists chest the professor glanced down at it then slipped his hands into his pockets and studied corde as if the detective were a bug padding his last circle on the cyanide disk in a kill jar then he asked hows your son detective an uncertain flicker was in cordes eyes as they scanned the face of leon gilchrist still enjoy bicycling does he despite the dangers what are you talking about and he went for a swim i heard the music these young people listen to hes trying to get my goat calm stay calm suicide by drowning that was uniquely his the song i believe mentions razors and ropes an alliteration suitable for adolescent lyrics what did you have to do with that cordes grip on the gun tightened and he was beset by a frightening sense that he was losing control of himself in his ears he heard a humming of immense pressure he swung the muzzle toward the professors face which tightened microscopically but remained otherwise passive the barrel stopped short of striking skin i could kill you gilchrist said slowly i dont imagine you know the writing of paul verlaine the french symbolist poet no of course not i find his poems stunning but i also believe he suffered from the same problem as you do stoic on the outside raging within he tried to murder his close friend rimbaud in a fit of passion he ended up a worthless drunk but if not for his psychoses the world wouldnt have his astonishing work the element of compensation is miraculous compensation which your little sarah displays so well cordes breathing was fierce he felt himself hyperventilating he grabbed gilchrists collar and pressed the gun muzzle against his ear ah gilchrist said in a silky voice remember her remember sarah our conversation mustnt become so obfuscated by passion that we forget that only i know where she is obfuscated can you deduce what that means detective can you corde shoved gilchrist away and stepped back he wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve he felt that he was the cornered animal and that it was gilchrist who was playing him detective you continually misunderstand whom youre dealing with im not a thug barricaded in a convenience shop your concept of intelligence is that it gets you to the bottom row of a category in jeopardy im different in kind from people like jennie gebben and you and your son and your sarah and your beautiful diane ive been studying you and your family since the morning after jennie died i saw your daughter at the pond after id left my first note to you her beautiful hair the sun was so pretty on her tight white blouse last years fashions had to put off the spring shopping spree at sears did we you know ive been corresponding with sarah ever since then why the shock detective you would have figured it out eventually see thats the problem that concerned me youre not intelligent but youre dogged unlike the rest of your colleagues who are neither intelligent nor persistent undoubtedly we could put you on the couch and wrench up some reason for this chronic tenacity you fell asleep at the wheel once or twice when it mattered didnt you when was it not too formative id guess your teenage years maybe later whatever happened youll be paying it off for a long time i was sure youd plod along until you stumbled across me sarah was the perfect distraction at first i convinced her to run away when that didnt work i decided id infiltrate throw you off the track the town wanted a moon killer so i skinned a goat and gave them one lunatic and i did some painting around town with a bit of the leftover blood mezza luna oh ill bet my frescoes had your boss salivating but not you detective you kept plodding ever the pedestrian getting closer and closer i needed a more direct attack i tried threatening you off the case he pointed to a polaroid camera im quite some photog dont you think oh an aside i detected that your wifes contraceptive had not been much used of late are we in the middle of the sixteenyear itch have you noticed any change in her recently her pathetically polished fingernails her sudden interest in eye shadow did you know she and breck have been for several walks in the forest the professor smiled and lifted his hands like a tv preacher did you know that while that buffoon of a deputy was supposed to be guarding the old homestead i was browsing through your bedroom i opened your dresser and rearranged dianes panties i smelled her pillow i washed my hands with her cheap lair du las soap oh i sat on sarahs bed i caressed your sons pajamas it was all so fascinating to me i lecture excuse me i used to lecture about psychology every day ive written articles for the most prestigious journals in the field journals he cocked an eyebrow with amusement that perhaps youve tried to read but i dont do clinical practice toying with your family has amused me greatly entwining them in this whole matter i drew you away from the nest i sent you to lewisboro i sold a handful of credit cards to this polyester thug in a bar in fitzberg so youd hightail it over there then i circled back i followed that fool breck gilchrist sneered the name and i killed him deader than dreisers prose i did all that detective right under your nose and i escaped but corde said here i am the smile on the professors face did not diminish but i have your daughter i want to know where she is corde shouted in anguish stating the obvious gilchrist snorted diminishes you as a late colleague of mine used to say sarah cry for me baby shout scream you son of a bitch the menace in cordes voice rose to the distant smudged ceiling it seemed to break the shafts of weak light that fell onto the bloodred carpet corde pressed his revolver forward and the hammer actually started back gilchrists eyes registered an instant of monumental fear then became calm and conciliatory he lifted a palm shes all right i swear it where is she gilchrists eyes swept over him the smile had faded he was now composed and his face was a mask of concern i cant tell you that im sorry if youve hurt her corde stepped forward his hand kneading the gun shes fine gilchrist said in a soothing voice think detective why would i hurt her i kidnapped her because i needed some insurance i couldnt stop you any other way he spread his hands out in front of him look you found out where i was i had to protect myself i swear ill kill you if you dont tell me what youve done with her he stifled a spiny urge to fire a bullet into gilchrists leg or elbow the professors voice was suavely reassuring i havent done anything with her shes safe he nodded at his suitcase as long as i get out of here shell be fine if you hurt me or arrest me youll never see her again its as simple as that corde stepped forward and held the gun close to gilchrists face where is she he cried gilchrist stepped back those are my terms theres no negotiation my freedom for your daughter take it or leave it you bastard you damn bastard corde growled thats perhaps true in one context or another but its irrelevant at this moment the muzzle of the pistol lowered cordes breathing calmed at least sarah was alive at least he had a chance of getting her back home safe he had a poignant image of the girl sitting in bed wearing her pajamas and talking to a stuffed bear tears saturated his eyes ill tell you what ill do gilchrist offered lets up the ante in exchange for my head start ill tell you where your daughter is and ill give you an explanation ill tell you exactly how i killed jennie and why corde squinted slightly and somewhere in his mind the policeman stepped side by side with the father gilchrist took the uneasy caution in cordes eyes as an affirmative answer he sat down in an armchair launching motes of dust into the sallow light i loved jennifer gebben very much the first time ive ever felt that way about a woman ridiculous when you think about it she was a simple girl she wasnt particularly pretty she vacillated between intense and moody but when she was with you in bed she was completely with you do you understand what im saying she was the center of the universe wed play our games wed take our hickory sticks wed get out the straps a lot of women just tolerate it for their man the remote father problem of course but jennie loved it she lived for it gilchrist please let me finish this spring she dropped me cold she went back to that fucking roommate of hers sorry its over with well that wasnt good enough for me no sir i wasnt going to be discarded the way she tossed aside sayles or okun sorry its over with oh no i wouldnt tolerate it not even from a borderline personality i called her up from san francisco she was too pusillanimous to break up excuse me detective she was too cowardly to do it in person i was in a consuming rage for a full twentyfour hours i calmed then i flew back you bought a ticket under a different name so you intended to kill her gilchrist paused for a moment and seemed neither surprised nor alarmed that this was public knowledge theres another part can you figure it out corde was nodding you killed susan biagotti and jennie found out about it the professor was however overtly disappointed that corde had made the deduction still he continued unemotionally lying in bed with jennie gilchrist smiled at some memory or lying in the bathtub with her or on the kitchen floor id tell her things you did that with her she was disarming well susan and i had played some very serious games i mentioned that one time to jennie stupid of me but i did it why did you kill susan accidental we got carried away and i strangled her corde winced uncomprehending he whispered she was somebody you mustve cared about yet you hurt her so badly you killed her why was the sex that good not for her it wasnt obviously he gave corde a fast chill smile then added i used the hammer to cover up some of the marks and i made it look like a robbery but you didnt tell jennie youd killed her of course not gilchrist grimaced at the foolishness of the question but she could link us together when i called her from san francisco on sunday when she told me she was breaking up with me we argued she said she was going back to emily and if i didnt leave her alone shed tell the administration about the students id slept with well our virgin dean has this thing her professors can fuck students minds all they want but their bodies are offlimits if jennie blew the whistle larraby would find out about susan and me and id have problems i flew back to new lebanon and asked jennie if i could see her i told her i wanted us to end on a positive note i said i had a book for her in memory of our relationship she agreed we went for a walk we ended up at the pond and you killed her and i killed her yes gilchrist seemed to be considering if there was anything else to say about jennie gebben and concluded there was not he added and i killed sayles and okun because he brought his hands together in a concluding way they were my enemies that deputy in lewisboro got himself shot too im very pleased about that that it wasnt you i mean i was actually feeling somewhat bad thinking that you would be the first one through the door he nodded his head slightly corde said ill give you a onehour start is there anybody outside the house just one deputy so this is an unofficial visit is it gilchrist glanced at corde with a certain level of respect well all right drop your car keys there we walked we didnt drive humor me corde tossed the keys into the middle of the floor gilchrist pocketed them shes all right of course shes all right ive tied her hands and feet thats all and gagged her people suffocate under gags an fbi bulletin had just reported on this corde had noted the fact in boxy script on a threebyfive index card gilchrist picked up his suitcase he said the basement he walked to the doorway and opened it he stood at the top of the stairs and flicked a light switch on corde shouted sarah its daddy there was no response gilchrist said impatiently the gag i told you corde took out his handcuffs and stepped toward gilchrist put one on your right wrist and the other on that radiator pipe there no we have a deal corde said i give you my word you get an hour but i get my daughter first or ill kill you where you stand gilchrist studied cordes eyes i think you might detective all right follow me ill have to show you its hard to find no you stay here the professor shrugged and said youll have to turn left at the foot of the stairs then go down a corridor then corde handed him the cuffs up a few stairs you dont have to worry shes fine just fine gilchrist was speaking like a pediatrician whod nursed a child out of a fever corde smelled the mans scent sour old cloth sweat he realized suddenly how close they stood gilchrist reaching for the cuffs calmly closed his long fingers around cordes wrist the nails dug into flesh and he threw himself backward down the stairs dragging corde with him the detective grabbed futilely for the handrail the gun fired the bullet sailing into a wall together they tumbled down the sharpedged pine stairs snaps and thuds corde felt his left wrist pop the gun flew from his hand there was a huge reverberation as his head smacked hard into the rickety handrail and he heard another snap of joint that must have come from gilchrists arm or leg they cartwheeled down and down the wood steps then crashed into the concrete floor and lay still curled like lovers on a cold winter morning in the small dim basement around them were rusted tools a sprinkling of coal a half dozen cans of paint and not another living soul wynton kresge rested across the trunk of the green pontiac in prone firing position it was the pose of the dressed deer he tied onto his olds hood when he drove home from hunting the checkered grip from the remington had imprinted its design into the pads of his fingers he smelled gun oil and gasoline and he thought corde had been inside too damn long then he heard the gunshot a short crack from inside the house the groundfloor windows flexing for an instant under the muzzle burst front or back front or back pick one damn it kresge stood up hesitated then ran over the barren lawn and through the open front door bill he shouted and in response the poker caught him in the corner of the eye and laid open six inches of cheek he fell backward hard the shotgun went off a chunk of clapboard exploded from the impact of the heavy shot hot blood streamed into his eye and mouth and he had a distorted image of gilchrist limping forward to pick up the fallen shotgun the professors right hand was swollen and dark and he too was bloodied about the face bill kresge called sputtering through blood gilchrist lifted up the shotgun and pointed it at kresges face the deputy rolled over and tried to scramble away he heard gilchrists grunt as he pulled the trigger and realized that there was a spent round in the chamber kresge prayed that he didnt know enough about guns to pump a new shell in he heard the double snap of the slide going back and forth and the tap of the old shell falling on the porch no kresge moaned groping for his automatic it had fallen from his holster and he could not find it he crawled another few inches and pressed against the wroughtiron railing he felt the heavy cold touch of the shotgun barrel on his back then the explosion and another and another gilchrist reeling over clutching his chest and stomach where cordes bullets had exited the shotgun fell on kresge who grabbed it in his blindness and pointed the muzzle toward the forest gilchrist dropped to his knees then fell forward wynton kresge was surrounded by numb silence which was broken a moment later by a voice intruding on and finally destroying the deputys relief the sound of bill corde crying sarah what have i done to you what have i done he walked unsteadily the tufts of grass and wiry roots reaching out and snagging his feet his voice was hoarse as he cried sarah sarah skittish birds flew up from their ground nests as he stumbled past sometimes he heard his own desperate echoes which fed him momentary false hopes he had sprained his wrist in the fall down the stairs but had refused any treatment and hurried outside to search for his daughter or for what he was now beginning to believe with despair his daughters body she had been nowhere in the house or the garage prodded by the horror of loss his mind in chaos bill corde was combing the five tricky acres around the house tangled woods pine needle dunes a couple deep wells and plenty of dirt soft enough for a shallow grave wynton kresge stitched and in agony strode through the same fields as much as corde he dreaded finding a small overturn of earth bringing such news about a child to her father was unthinkable to him still he searched frantically other deputies joined in even lance miller wheezing against the grip of the elastic tape around his ribs jim slocum and two offduty new lebanon deputies entitled to be home with beer wives and the tube also combed the scruffy landscape corde staggered through grass and whips of thin branches he scrambled and shuddered his way through headhigh brush he fell over a cruelly hidden arc of barbed wire and bloodied his good palm to save his jaw every reclining blotch of pink seen through the weeds was a well of agony every distant yip of a dog or owls hollow call once corde cried hard as he leapt through tall grass to what turned out to be a beige iga bag filled with empties sarah sarah he called in a whisper and continued across a stand of trees into another field which was a dozen acres of freshplowed dirt by seven the sun is low and narrow shadows of trees stretch out for yard and yards bill corde sits on a hillock of chunky earth covered with dandelions and catnip and stalks of milkweed his voice is gone his strength too he reaches out and affectionately strokes a yellow leaf in a wholly mad way he thinks he should be searching the fields but he knows it is useless he can do nothing nothing but sit and mourn his daughter and another loss too for sarahs death will in an obscure brutal way also poison the life he shares with diane and that with jamie the three of them will now be wedged forever apart while he searched hope had been his only instrument and now it too is gone he sits for ten minutes in this paralysis then watches as a police cruiser rocks over the uneven ground toward him lance miller cautiously piloting it stops on an incline the door opens diane gets out then sarah behind her corde stands uneasily and steps forward he hugs the girl hard embracing then wholly encompassing her honey honey honey he cries his intensity begins to confuse her and he forces himself to grow nonchalant then a giddiness which is not faked set in he laughs hard and squeezes her hand diane explains that sarah came running up the road to their house twenty minutes before she whispers to corde shes shaken up bad she saw gilchrist attack ben and she ran and hid at the school then she came home on foot corde cocks an anxious eyebrow and diane reads the signal she mouths shes fine he didnt touch her diane then nods toward the ambulance parked at the entrance to gilchrists driveway they gave her a pill that will keep her relaxed didnt they honey i feel sleepy mommy although there are a thousand questions he wants to ask corde knows not to pursue this conversation with his daughter now he says almost suppertime how about we go home and fire up the barbecue okay daddy you hurt your hand its nothing they start toward the dodge in this holiday atmosphere but the weight of the events is suddenly too much for sarah she is staring at gilchrists house as if gazing at a friend who has betrayed her although it is at some distance corde slowly steps between her and the house on the slim chance that she might see blood he hurt dr breck daddy the sunshine man hurt dr breck i thought he was my friend its all right honey youre going to be all right i feel sleepy i lost my backpack well get it later honey i left it in dr brecks car it has my tape recorder in it dr breck made me run when the sunshine man her tiny voice fades dianes fingertips rise slowly to her lips but she is determined not to reveal any more horror in front of the girl she forces a smile onto her face corde asks diane hows breck she hesitates corde knows shes considering if she should admit the existence of this knowledge i called the hospital she whispers hell live hundreds of stitches sarah looks groggily away i dont like it here im afraid hes going to come back to his house who diane asks the sunshine man corde crouches down hes gone away honey hell never come back ive sent him away diane looks at the house she says he lives there your wizard sarah says i saw him behind the cow pasture a couple times i wanted him to cast a spell to make me smart so one day i followed him here but i was ascared to ask so i left and she wrote a story about it corde pulls the two stained pages from his breast pocket and reads the words he near to memorized earlier in the day and the girl climbed onto the back of cloudtipper the eagle and hugged his feather neck they sailed away from the yellow house they followed the sunshine man home they flew into the yard then past the cow field and past the old well and the burneddown silo that looked like whale ribs and over the railroad bridge and along the path to the river finally they came to a clearing in the woods cloudtipper landed gentle and there was the sunshine mans cottage you came here by yourself sarah dianes eyelids lower at the insolence of tragedy averted by the smallest slip of fate i just wanted him to make me smart mommy diane casually slips her arm around her daughter and they walk toward the squad car corde hobbles along behind mother and daughter separate for a moment the girl running ahead corde catches up with his wife who is now silent the same wary expression on her face that shed worn at jamies bedside corde knows why but doesnt want to consider it now the pain in his arm is making up for lost time and hes half faint by the time he slides into the backseat of the dodge next to diane sarah has claimed the front diane brushes her daughters hair with her fingers when corde sits closer to his wife she shies away from him her motion is subtle but is clear miller starts the car and drives slowly over the rough ground the dodge sashaying like a canoe in a powerboats wake corde lowers his forehead to his thumb as if administering lent ashes and lets his palm take the whole weight of his head this is what he thinks i amjust doing my job the only way i know how what more is a man supposed to do though corde suspects that a man must do more and probably a lot more he knows that when your daughter gets well your son gets sick and when the car is paid off the mortgage goes up and when you decide you love your wife shes gone to another man theres no end to the burdens life lays on you oh there is so much to do and more after that and more and more and more but it seems to him that this isnt so much the problem as is finding somebody or something that can show you exactly what has to be done this is the lesson this is what bill corde doubts hell ever get right everybody buckle up now lance miller announces and turns the cruiser onto the highway corde got the new fi written up but it was a chore he was extra careful because he knew it was going to be the basis for jim slocums comments to the press and hammerback ellisons as well and he wanted it to be as clear as possible he tried dictating into sarahs tape recorder but he kept getting tonguetied and had to go back to ruled paper and a bic mediumpoint the register lost its exclusive the killings had been laid at the feet of a college professor whod taught at harvard and had written book reviews for the new york times the associated press and some bigcity newspaper reporters came to town along with a herd of earnest young tv reporters one from cnn to the towns delight with their hair spray and crisp outfits and fancy electronics one journalist referred to gilchrist as the new lebanon cult killer but sheriff jim slocum said that this didnt appear to be so much a cult situation as a romanceoriented homicide and some followup homicides to cover it up corde had been granted dispensation from learning the radio codes and was now in charge of what slocum was calling the felony desk something hed thought up after watching america s most wanted one night things were slow though the only felon at the moment being dell tucker a new lebanon farmer whod turned an ar fullautomatic and had been heard testing it on gophers corde figured that was mostly a federal offense so why bother besides corde had gopher problems himself wynton kresge had drawn a tough rotation from hammerback ellison being new hed been assigned to a month of speedtrap duty out in the unincorporated portions of harrison county corde told him they couldnt all be glamour assignments shardly fair kresge had muttered sitting on cordes desk in the new lebanon sheriffs department he was now looking over the felony investigation report gilchrist flew back here the day before jennie was killed he was speaking to himself picturing it he bought a new ticket under a different name we shouldve checked passengers ids and forms of payment the information was there kresge said seems like you cant think of everything corde thought for a moment true you cant but you have to flew back all the way from san francisco kresge mused corde continued and he just stayed in new lebanon he rented that house in the woods the place we found him in he rented it for a month laying low when he called people he just told them he was calling from san francisco and they believed him howd you find that out i didnt find it out i figured it out from what he told me the best source of information on a murder is the perpetrator remember that well i will i think he was going to stay there for a little while then reappear like hed come back from the conference but that first morning he mustve seen sarah in the woods he decided to use her to get to me her and jamie too how his threats against sarah mightve stopped me or if any thingd happened to the kids i wouldve been in no shape to keep going remember everybody else was looking for the moon killer tt ebbans and me and you too were looking for somebody like gilchrist he knew that i was the one he had to stop hardly ribbon or werewolf slocum kresge whispered when you were at the house where you shot him he said he had sarah whyd he say that corde grimaced to do just what he did get the advantage on me i didnt play it too smart it never occurred to me that shed gotten away i walked in and asked first off where she was that gave him something on me and he used it pretty damn well considering he was making it up as he went along he was playing with me he got me pretty riled then calmed me down telling me that sarah was safe and telling me why he killed jennie put me off my guard whos this breck fellow kresge looked at the report now theres a question for you i just had me a talk with him he was sarahs tutor thats all he was breck read part of sarahs book about this wizard watching our house he asked her about it and found out she hadnt made that part up he figured it was the man leaving the threats and that meant he was the killer why didnt he tell us before he just read the damn thing five minutes before gilchrist gutted him and two days after i read the same story a wrongtime wrongplace fellow breck was kresge offered you could say although there was a lot more to breck than this corde now understood but that had nothing to do with gilchrist or the investigation and it was going to take a lot of thinking and a lot more talking before corde figured out what to do about the ben breck situation if there was anything he could do and the person he had to talk to about it well she wasnt much in the mood for conversation whos this breck fellow gilchrist kresge said almost reverently he was one step ahead of us the whole time he always was and one step behind us too howd you know he was in that house bill ive lived in new lebanon ten years and never even knew there were houses down there by the river its tough to explain how the process of deduction works wynton you mean its something youre born with no you can learn the more you practice the better you are remember that well i will corde stepped out into the backyard of his house and set down his pabst blue ribbon he inspected the strip of muddy dirt by the dryer exhaust he shooed off a couple of grackles and bent down low to the ground then went lower on all fours it seemed to him the green fuzz hadnt grown a millimeter in the last weeks he decided it was crazy to try to grow grass here in this sunless rocky gully between two houses populated by hardrunning teenage boys who loved shortcuts he ought to put in gravel and be done with it nevertheless corde arranged the sprinkler carefully and turned on the water he sat down in a plaid lawn chair the aluminum legs screeching on the slab of concrete hed laid two years ago and spent two years meaning to enclose he looked at his watch tonight the family was going to visit jamie in the hospital they were going to smuggle in a vcr and corde was going to hook it up to the tv in the hospital room they were all going to watch a movie diane had rented some cop comedy but that excursion was planned for after dinner now he wanted to relax for a few minutes he opened the beer and drank half of it then replaced the can on the concrete while he watched the intermittent rainbow the sprinkler made as it waved a fan of water high enough to catch the last of the sun he glanced behind him and saw diane behind the twin thermopanes occupied with dinner corde felt a stack of threebyfive cards gig him in the thigh and he took them out of his pocket most of them would be filed away in the tall green cabinets he had testily commandeered for his own use down at the sheriffs department one card though filled with his careful block lettering he intended to pin up on his bulletin board he thought he would put it in the space next to his favorite quote about physical evidence being the cornerstone of a case this card read it is the poet who perceives the world by the illumination of pure understanding while others see only in reflected light ld gilchrist he slipped the card into his pocket then picked up his beer took several sips and cradled the sweating can on his stomach listening to the sounds of dusk cicadas cricket creaks an owl waking to his hunger a dinnertime summons to the neighbor children diane banged on the window and shouted ten minutes bill corde said okay he waited half that time then stood and stretched he walked to the edge of the concrete deck and leaning outward began to wave the white cards high in the air shouting whoa whoa at a half dozen shiny grackles which fled from his muddy patch of frail lawn and vanished into the moonless sky about the author former attorney and folksinger jeffery deaver is the bestselling author of a dozen suspense novels and
