michael palmer the society prologue marcia rising tilted back in her chair just enough so that neither her chief financial officer leonard smith seated to her right nor executive vp dan elder to her left could see what she was writing on her legal pad she was expected to take some notes at these meetings anyhow after all she was the boss smiling inwardly she added an ornate dollar sign in front of the at the far end of the broad mahogany table vice president joe levinson droned on levinson was the costcontainment officer for eastern quality health and as such was responsible more than anyone except marcia herself for the managedcare companys strong financial picture but as a speaker he was as animated and vibrant as drying paint we took last quarters slumping numbers as a strident warninga shot across our financial bow if you willthat we had to renew incentives among our employees and physicians in the area of cost containment the inhouse contest we ran was most successful in this regard almost immediately there was a twentyone percent increase in claims rejected outright and a thirteen percent increase in those surgical claims that were bundled for payment together with at least one other claim there were some complaints from doctors but nothing bills physicianrelations people couldnt handle four million thirteen thousand eight hundred sixtyfour marcia wrote the numbers out longhand then she added touches of calligraphy to the figure which was her salary for the preceding twelve months factor in her eight million in unexercised stock options and she was well into the upper echelons of female executives in the country the numbers had a delightful rhythm to them she mused perhaps a conga she imagined a kick line of her nineteen hundred employees snaking its way through the building four million thirteen kick marcia was more than pleased with the way her officers had responded to the recent dip in corporate profits her philosophy of one set of premiums and coverages for companies with younger healthier employees and another for those who might have a more risky older crew was infallible if they dont get sick they cant cost us she had preached over and over again to her minions let some other company cover those who are running out of time or wont take care of themselves every dollar spent researching the demographic makeup of a company blacks get more hypertension diabetes and kidney failure asians are ridiculous hypochondriacs hispanics have too much alcoholism drug addiction and mental illness thirtysomethings are okay fortysomethings are not would return hundreds in the form of payouts that eastern quality health wouldnt have to make eight hundred sixtyfour kick and so as i see it our company has weathered a passing financial squall levinson was saying but there are major storm clouds on the horizon for the entire industry still our ship will remain seaworthy so long as we never lose sight of the fact that our business is all about healththat is the health of eastern quality to laughter at his rare humor and a smattering of applause levinson bowed slightly and took his seat the meeting was to all intents over marcia stood and encouraged her officers to maintain their vigilance to bring problems and ideas to her attention sooner rather than later and never to lose sight of the goals of eastern quality healthnot to be the biggest hmo but rather to be the most efficient then she crossed to the door of her suite and shook the hand of each of them as they left finally she settled in behind her desk and gazed out at the reflecting basin and double fountain that graced eqhs fifteenacre campus on route eighteen miles north and west of boston the setting sun had already dipped below the tree line yielding to a still cloudless evening arranged neatly in labeled wire bins on her desk was two or three hours of work she expected to complete before going home seldom was she not the last eqh employee out of the building marcia brushed a minuscule crumb from her armani jacket and started with a review of reports from the team of attorneys handling one of several suits pending against the companythis one centered on confusion over whether or not a particular policyholder had the coverage for a bone marrow transplant eqhs position was of course that she did not although as of the womans death six months ago the question had become moot still her annoying husbands unwillingness to accept the truth was prolonging a resolution marcia dictated a carefully worded letter demanding that the lawyers stand firm at a settlement of with no admission of culpability it was to be that or nothing outside her thirdfloor window night settled in as she reached for the next set of reports finally at nine she gathered her things in the moschino briefcase her husband had given her straightened her desk then her skirt and headed out to the elevator floor two of the garage the socalled officers parking lot was accessed only via the elevator and only with the aid of a pass card marcia pulled her overcoat tightly about her and stepped out into the raw march night she knew what vehicle each of her uppermanagement officers drove and took pains to encourage them to choose automobiles reflecting their personal success and through that the success of eqh besides her mercedes sl silver arrow convertible there were still two cars in the lotutilization management director sarah bretts infiniti and chief of physician relations bill donohos lexus marcia made a mental note to reward them both for their diligence she was nearing her car when she felt more than heard the presence of someone else in the lot she whirled at the sound of footsteps a man fedora brim pulled down to the bridge of his nose hands in his trenchcoat pockets had left the shadows and was approaching her how in the hell had he gotten out here she wondered angrily this was absolutely the last screwup for joe odonnell if you couldnt trust your security chief who in the hell could you trust first thing in the morning odonnell was history and none of his whining about five children was going to save him this time marcias pulse shot up at the sight of the man then slowed as she took in the situation with the quick analytical thinking that had become her trademark there was a security camera sweeping the lot from just above the doors to the elevator foyer so maybe one of the two guards on duty would spot the stranger managed care was at times a controversial and emotional business her executive officers were encouraged to have a legally registered handgun hers was locked in the glove compartment of the silver arrow but if this was trouble there was no way she could reach the car in time she peered through the gloom trying to get a fix on the mans eyes dammit odonnell less than ten feet away the intruder stopped by now marcia was certain that this was no one associated with eqh who are you she demanded how did you get out here mrs rising i have something for you a woman marcia felt her pulse surge once more who are you she said again her voice breaking the womanslender with a narrow face and eyes still shielded by her hatwithdrew her left hand and passed over an envelope her calmness and the coldness in her voice tied a knot of fear in marcias chest she stared down at the envelope which she now held go ahead the woman urged open it marcia fumbled the envelope open and withdrew two cards each three inches square on one carefully printed with some sort of marker was the unadorned block letter r on the other was a t what is this whats this all about she stumbled backward toward the mercedes the letters and envelope still reflexively clutched in her hand before her the woman calmly withdrew a pistol from her coat pocket its muzzle covered by what looked like a rubber nipple my god no marcia cried dont do this i have money lots of money ill give you whatever you want this wont hurt as much as it should the woman said firing from four feet away into the center of marcias chest the ceo was reeling backward when a second shot fired almost from the hip caught her squarely in the throat the woman slid the silenced pistol back into her trenchcoat pocket and turned toward the door sleep tight she whispered chapter drained wiped fried burnt oh thats a good one okay whose turn is it dr camerons hell no lass not me i just did tuckered out then its dr grants turn from his position across the operating table from his partner will grant surveyed the three nurses and finally the anesthesiologist you sure he asked its you all right the scrub nurse said i cant think of any more well you damn well better laddie cameron said his highlands brogue as dense as it had

shibickie and end up buyin the beers for this motley crew before he could reply will yawned widely enough to displace his paper surgical mask off his nose seems like i should have picked some word other than exhausted he said as the laughter died down he turned his head to allow the circulating nurse to reposition his mask but it was the only one i could think of no surprise there cameron said we should allow dr will grant as a legal answer to this one because laddie you define the term i couldnt believe it when i heard you were covering again tonight four days of alimony what every extra call night i take from you guys translates into four days of alimony paidmore if i get a case which you almost always do well were getting ready to close sir will my trusty assistant do you have any reasons why we shouldnt go ahead and sew up this lucky bugger stomachs r us will said you did a really nice job getting that tumor out gordo you forgot to add as always as always how about prostrate

clip in will flexed his neck muscles which after a threeandahalfhour case felt as if someone had injected them with krazy glue it was only a slight exaggeration to say that the last time he hadnt been some form of exhausted was eighteen years ago when at twentythree he started medical school med school internship surgical residency vascular fellowshiphe often wondered if he had known really known about the call schedules and the interminable hours in the or and the early morning emergencies and the office practice and the continuingeducation responsibilities and the staff meetings and the mushrooming malpractice premiums and the ambulance chasers and the diminishing financial returns brought about by managed care and ultimately the divorce and supplementary nights on duty to make ends meet would he do it all again the same way the answer as always was yesexcept of course for the managedcare part last clip coming down laddie cameron announced lowering the final surgical clip dramatically toward the incision petered out will blurted at the last possible second silence held sway as those in or polled one another well give it to you willboy cameron said finally as long as you assure us your answer isnt merely a description of your sex life fredrickston surgical associates was a fourperson group headquartered in the medical arts building a block away from fredrickston general hospital a fully designated trauma center thirty miles southwest of boston the four surgeons rotated call with three others although in any given sevenday stretch will would take on one or even two nights in addition to his own today tuesday he finished seeing patients in the office then trudged back to the hospital through the raw gray afternoon james katz and susan hollister met him for signout rounds outside the surgical intensivecare unit katz now in his late sixties was the patriarch of the practice if not the entire hospital he was as stiff in his manner and speech as he was in his posture and to the best of wills knowledge no one had ever mentioned him telling a joke still the man was universally beloved and respected for his dignity his skill in the operating room and his ability to teach residents and other physicians werent you just on call will he asked that was two nights ago and it was incredibly quiet steve schwaitzberg wants to chaperone some sort of overnight with one of his kids classes is he going to pay you back with a night katz pressed whether it was his liberal politics and interests his relaxed dress and manner with the patients or his inability to keep his marriage together will sensed he had for some time been katzs least favorite of the three younger associates still the two of them had always been on decent terms although there was invariably some tension when the subject of wills extra call nights came up he probably will pay me back will said knowingas doubtless did his senior partnerthat the truth was being stretched dont you see the twins on tuesdays susan asked as reserved and conservative as gordon cameron was flamboyant susan had preceded will into the practice by two years a competent surgeon she was quite slender and attractive in a bookish way but to the best of wills knowledge had never been married for several years she had been dating a businessmanat least according to her she was will had never met the man nor had gordo and from time to time cameron would speculate that susans businessman was in fact a businesswoman regardless susan had gone from being reserved and somewhat distant from will before his divorce to being a concerned friend worrying about his health his children and even his social life one of the rare times will had allowed himself to be fixed up was with a former wellesley college roommate of susans had he taken years of acting lessons he couldnt possibly have been less himself than he was that night im just not ready he reported to susan after the spiritless evening we didnt have anything in common she was a human being i do have the kids yes he said but tonights our regular night at the soup kitchen so ill just take call from there until i bring them home speaking of the open hearth he added determined to divert the subject from his taking too much call were always looking for volunteers to serve when i resign from the symphony board i just might take you up on your invitation katz replied sincerely me too susan added with more sparkle i didnt know you were on the symphony board will said im planning on being on it someday all right katz said lets get on with this will its a good thing you enjoy your work because you certainly do a heck of a lot of it jim katz had seven patients in the hospital susan and will three apiece and gordon cameron who had already gone home two including the case he and will had done earlier in the day the trio of surgeons that included steve schwaitzberg had another five schwaitzberg had signed his three out over the lunch hour and the other two would do so by phone twenty patients in alla load by modern standards insurance restrictions had seen to it that most of them had received their preop evaluations as outpatients and had been operated on before they had even seen their rooms or met the nurses who were going to be their caregivers the moment after their surgery was completed they were being primed for discharge actuarial tables compiled by the managedcare and insurance industries had demonstrated that such policies saved money without causing a significant rise in postop complications wills experience with his own and many other practices had shown that a good number of patients would gladly beg to differ with those statistics at susans urging they saw jim katzs group first he would never complain about his workload or diminishing physical capabilities but the three younger members of the group had each seen evidence that layers were peeling off his stamina and abilities in the or and they sought to protect him in any way they could all went well until the last of katzs patients a sixtythreeyearold diabetic man whose gallbladder katz had removed the morning before so mr garfield katz said checking the four small incisions he had made into the mans abdominal cavity and nodding approval of the way they looked is your wife on her way here to get you she just called from the parking garage i shouldnt worry garfield said good good and the nurses have given you my discharge instructions good will didnt like anything about what he was seeing and hearing stuart garfield was doing his very best to mask it and maybe he didnt even realize it was happening but he was experiencing some shortness of breath susan nodded minutely that she had noticed the same thing the managedcare companies decreed that a night in the hospital or even less was to be the standard of care for the laparoscopic removal of a gallbladder katz did not consider that the mans diabetes was reason to argue for more and it wouldnt have been except for the distension of the veins alongside the mans neck and the slight bluish cast to his lipsboth subtle signs of evolving trouble nonchalantly will sidled over to the bedside slipped his stethoscope into his ears and listened through the mans back to the base of his lungs rales the crackling sounds made by fluid filling the small air sacs were most definitely present stuart garfield was in early heart failurea potentially serious condition in any patient but even more so in a diabetic who with little warning perhaps by the time he and his wife had reached the highway could be in fullblown pulmonary edemaa terrifying lifethreatening emergency will motioned katz over to the doorway there was no easy way to present the findings and with a physician as forthright and honorable as katz it wasnt smart to try jim hes in some congestive heart failure will whispered neck veins distended rales at both bases a little blue around the gills katz sagged visibly crossed to the bedside to listen then returned to the doorway i knew i shouldnt have been rushing him out he said shaking his head in dismay listen dont be hard on yourself were making rounds together as a team this sort of thing is why we do it thanks to our friendly neighborhood insurance companies the pressures on all of us now all the time they tell you that the average surgeon gets his gallbladder patients out of the hospital on the first postop day or even the day of the procedure you know darn well that if you keep yours in an extra day or two youre going to be right down on the hmos list they dont ignore these things just the same katz said wearily thanks for saving my bacon he returned to his patient mr garfield im going to wait for your wife to get up here then we have to talk ive never seen him so glum susan said as they headed off to see the first of her patients as the sole woman in the group susan had proclaimed herself the mother hen dedicated to keeping gordos weight under control seeing that will got enough sleep and met someone special and insisting that jim katz cut back on his many obligations we more or less grew up with the problems of managed care will said jims had to adapt to them he gets sort of wistful when he talks about the time when you simply diagnosed a surgical problem in a patient cut it out and cared for the person until they were ready to go home ah yes the good old days before onesizefitsall medicine my mom is embroiled in a battle with her hmo right now shes got huge fibroids complete with pain and vaginal bleeding and her gyn wants to do a hysterectomy makes sense to me me too but the evaluators at her hmo say the procedure is unnecessary whats more they performed their magnificent evaluation of her over the phone no one from her hmo has ever laid eyes or hands on her but theyre the ones making the decision will hoisted himself up haughtily and adopted a dense british accent im not a doctor but i play one on the phone exactly so mom has pain every time she takes a step and her doctor says the fibroids would make it impossible for him to feel a malignancy if one were there goodness she still in idaho forever and you never had any desire to go back there to practice how can i know i exist if i cant see myself in store windows when i walk down the street susans dark eyes smiled besides what do i have in common with demi moore and all of those other bigname transplants from hollywood you should bring your moms case up at the society meeting thursday night um the truth is i hadnt decided if i was going to go will i appreciate your enthusiasm for the hippocrates society really i do but after almost a year of going every month i just havent gotten caught up in it im definitely upset with managedcare companies policies and regulations and all theyre doing to the way we practice but i just havent been able to get as as fired up as the rest of you even with my moms recent problems you know me im pretty reserved about most thingsnot shy like some people think but not that outspoken either and excuse me for saying so but you people are fanatics will laughed hey now i wouldnt go that far how about committed if that makes you more comfortable listen suze we need every body we can get at these meetings there were over a hundred docs there last time a hundred the papers are really starting to take notice will im on two committees in the hospital and a couple at church the people on the desk at my gym dont know who i am and im afraid my boyfriend may be headed there too i understand just do your best i may tell your moms story anyway you have my permission these companies have ripped the heart out of medicine susan they have to be stopped you just be careful not to rile them up too much you wouldnt be the first doctor theyve squashed id like to see them try will said chapter ashford was a bedroom community located almost midway between fredrickston and worcester beeper and cell phone at the ready will checked out with the er and surgical residents and headed west through modest lateafternoon traffic he knew that he was hardly the only divorced dad forced to drive to the house that had once been his to take his children out for dinner but that knowledge did nothing to assuage the weirdness he invariably felt in the situationespecially when the doorbell was answered as it was tonight by mark mueller once a friend and financial adviser to him and maxine and now for more than a year her livein hey hows it going mueller said knowing better than to attempt a handshake mueller though about wills height and build had a full scalp of curly hair which invariably made will reflect on the modest but relentless recession at the corners of his own max had explained that she and mueller were too much in love not to live together but that the cost of marriage in terms of lost alimony made nuptials a fiscal impossibility will stepped into his former foyer kids ready dannys just finishing up his homework jess is ready though will smiled to himself could any pair of twins ever be more different from each otheror more wonderful in those differences jess always ready danny last minute or beyond one meticulous one scattered one serious and intense one flaky and wildly imaginative one jess an athlete the other already credited with several communitytheater productions damn you max hey dad who loves you jess in jeans and a bulky sweater came racing around the corner and dove into his midsection who loves you baby everything okay fine tammy got sent home today for throwing spitballs cody block said he likes me i got an a on my morocco project are we going to the hearth or your place or a restaurant hearth great danny lets get the shoulderfirst assault from behind with more force than any tenyearold should be able to generate nearly knocked both will and jess over open hearth night right danny asked right on um max wants them home by nine mueller said uncomfortably wills eyes flashed his thin smile said many things nine it will be mark she at the gym office she should be back soon nine come on guys i keep telling you im not a guy all right come on girls daddy will two classmates and a saintly psychiatrist had started the open hearth kitchen during wills sophomore year in med school the idea was to survive two intense years of basic science studies by involving themselves in a project centering on real live humans almost immediately the other students and faculty joined in helping to make their efforts a success a dynamic visionary young director and a committed board saw to it that the merchants schools churches and residents of fredrickston and the surrounding towns understood the place and embraced it now after sixteen years there were times when volunteers had to be turned away although none of the thousands of diners who had patronized the kitchen ever were three hundred and ten was the record for dinners served on one night but with the economy continuing to nosedive that record seemed likely to fall before long no matter how hard it had been to take time off from work will seldom missed the monthly board meetings and almost never his serving obligationthe first and third tuesdays of every month the rugged threestory clapboard structure occupied a corner lot in the most rundown part of town maxine had tried insisting that the area was too dangerous to keep dragging the twins to but in this debate unlike most of the rest will had prevailed okay he said easing his fouryearold wagoneer into the small parking area you guys know the drill im doing dessert danny called as the two raced up to the kitchen door you did it last time as he often did will paused to survey the building and to reflect on the years since the projects inception in the beginning a nearby episcopal church had rented the first floor to them for next to nothing now the open hearth kitchen a taxexempt corporation owned the whole thing belief perseverance fearlessnessover the intervening years the open hearth had come to mean so many things to him now his involvement was limited to board of directors meetings and those two nights a month as a server his energywhat there was left of ithad instead been channeled into the hippocrates society and its quixotic mission of reclaiming medicine from the hmos and insurance companies belief perseverance fearlessness by the time will entered the kitchen the kids were each involved in animated discussions as they worked he smiled at the ease with which they had made themselves part of the gang and the genuineness with which they had been accepted in all this night there were sixteen volunteers and five staff no army had ever functioned with more efficiency and esprit hey will wassapnin same old same old beano how about you cant complain your kids are really something two minutes and theyre already up to their elbows in whatever needs doing benois beane fortysomething had been the hearths director for going on five years during which he had continued to expand the agencys programs instituting a meals on wheels service and an employment counselor he had also taken it on himself following an offhand remark by will to ensure that no one called will doc many knew he was a physician but there was no reason at all to advertise the fact the last thing he wanted was to dilute the dual pleasures of serving food to those who needed it and introducing his children to people who were lightyears from the treelined privilege of ashford beano the place is looking great yeah thank god for all those churches and synagogues i suppose that would be appropriate will said beane took a moment to find the humor then his ebony face crinkled in a broad grin good one he said i almost missed it forgive me for saying this will but you look as if youve been working too much hell no by my standards im exceedingly well rested see me tomorrow morning by then ill be looking as if im working too much what youre viewing now is totally fresh grant fresh grant beane echoed sounds like something we should have on the menu by fivethirty when the doors opened at least fifty were lined up to be served a number of them with young children in tow a goodly percentage of the patrons still had a roof over their heads but for them food and heat were getting more and more difficult to manage the twins had settled their conflict in house and were working side by side at the dessert section will an apron tied around his waist strolled among the tables with a soapywater spray and a towel chatting with the diners and cleaning up after they had left at one table where a particularly grizzled downandouter sat alone picking at his beef stew and rice will stopped howre you doin he asked the man with metallicblue eyes and a nose that had been broken probably more than once forced a weak smile cant complain he said names will john john cooper i havent seen you here before havent been well you picked a good night to start beef stew is about the best thing we do its very tasty listen john i dont go around advertising the fact but im a doctor i work at the hospital stop me if you think im out of line but im concerned about those lumps on the side of your neck cooper didnt bother reaching up to touch them what about em the lumps markedly swollen lymph glands were trouble wills quick differential diagnosis included several types of cancer as well as scrofulaa form of tuberculosis has any doctor checked them out cant afford no doctor you have mass health any kind of insurance cooper shook his head will you come see me and let me check those over maybe run a few tests it wont cost you a thing maybe i promise ill take good care of you thats nice of you seldom more than a couple of tables behind will could see enough from where he stood to know he would be hardpressed now to catch up with the influx listen john he said im going to send ben beane over to talk with you he runs this place hell help you fill out the forms to get some state insurance okay you mean welfare insurancethe sort everyone in this country deserves to have i dont like to put labels on things but what im talking about isnt welfare wait here ill get ben hell explain everything and hell also give you my address okay if you say so on the way over to find beane will paused briefly to wipe down two tables most of the patrons of the open hearth kitchen were respectful of the place and quick to do whatever they could to keep the tables ready for others but some werent beano i need your help with a new guy the one you were talking to he needs to come see me about some big lumps in his neck can you give him my address and have your people start him on the bumpy road to mass health coverage so we can get some tests done i would beane said but the dude just got up and left will raced to the front door a mean wind was sweeping through the blackness there were a few patrons shambling toward him but john cooper was gone impotent with the situation and peeved at himself for possibly frightening the man off will was still on the staircase peering down the street when his cell phone went off the display showed an er number damn will its lydia the surgical resident said rescue just called from an alley downtown theyre working on a guy a couple of kids found there beaten up pretty bad midforties robbery probably no id no bp to speak of hes frozen but they assure me hes still alive eta ten minutes there was no sense in trying to find out the location of the alley even though it might have been nearby in the field the paramedics and emts were better and faster than he could ever be ill be there he said sensing the familiar adrenaline rush and accelerated thinking that accompanied a possible surgical emergency have the ct scan people ready to do his head call someone in if theres no one there right now two lines in large bore cath his bladder get bloods off including a stat alcohol and drugs of abuse panel type and crossmatch for six units and have them be ready to do more as soon as the bloods are off give him a jolt of glucose dont bother waiting for the sugar result before you do that just in case alert anesthesia and the or that something may be brewing got it oh and lydia if hes as cold as the rescue people say he is please have the nurses get a warming blanket ready and heat up some ringers lactate solution of all the tuesdays he had taken call while volunteering at the hearth this was the first time he was faced with an emergency that demanded his immediate return to the hospital ready to race up to the or he went back inside looked over at the kids and as he was doing for the emergency at fgh sorted through a dozen different courses of action at the same time finally knowing there was no other way he swallowed his pride and frustration and called maxine lydia goldman spotted will and the twins approaching down the hallway and raced to meet them a thirdyear resident she had never handled emergencies calmly and will was pleased to have learned some weeks ago that she had been accepted into a plasticsurgery program in kansas this is real trouble dr grant his core temperature is fiftytwo hes been beaten to a pulp bp isnt readable im getting set to put in an arterial line deep breath will said now slow exhale kids this is lydia lydia dan and jessica the guys alive right yes but hold it for a second jess

dan said another time i promise ill see you both on saturday i love youse guys daad i know i know will kissed each of them on the forehead then followed lydia into the er the unconscious middleaged man had been stripped and placed on a large warming pad two nurses were adjusting his iv lines and monitoring equipment he had been beaten badly about the head face and chest with some fresh bruising on his abdomen as well order some neck films lydia just in case oh my im really sorry i didnt do that the woman a knowledgeableenough resident in spite of her lack of cool flushed at having made an oversight will paused to settle her down lydia we do this as a team so that together we might think of everything okay selfflagellation does nothing to improve our focus ookay ill be right back she raced off to get spine xrays ordered arterial line will called after her already examining the patient as he approached the bedside no extremity fractures pupils slightly dilated not reactive to light probable orbital fracture on the right chest appears intact moving air poorly with grunting respirations julie he called to one of the nurses please call anesthesia down here to put a tube in this man abdomen somewhat distended dull to percussion fluid blood will set his hands on either side of the mans abdominal wall and felt the muscles beneath them tighten even comatose there was some reaction from john doe light pressure had caused enough pain to break through his depressed consciousness its in here he said to no one in particular id bet the ranch on it listen everyone as soon as we have cervical spines and a ct scan of his head were going up to the or someone alert them lydia youll assist so go scrub as soon as you can tell them were going to explore this fellows abdomen do you want antibiotics she asked will glanced up at her and pumped his fist just enough for her to see way to go he said order whatever you think would be best julie two grams of mefoxin iv please lydia said in minutes the broadspectrum antibiotic was in and the anesthesiologist had placed a breathing tube down john does trachea next he inserted a third intravenous line via a blind stick into the internal jugular vein temps seventytwo a nurse announced bp is still in the twenties will glanced down at the mans abdomen which was more distended than even a short while ago lets get him over to xray right now he said were running out of time this was medicine the way it was meant to be will thought vigorously scrubbing his hands with a hexachloropheneimpregnated brush a patient in big trouble a surgeon and his team prepared to act no forms to fill out no panel to go through he wished things with maxine had worked out differently and that he didnt spend so much of what little free time he had alone he wished he had the kids more and the money and time for a memorable vacation with them he longed to spend more time in the gym but one thing he never wanted to change was the rush of this moment focusing years of training and experience into the awesome responsibilities of being a surgeon using his knee he shoved the lever to the right shutting off the water then hands up palms facing in he backed into the or accepted a towel from the nurse and dried his hands finally he slipped into a sterile gown allowed it to be tied and thrust his hands into a pair of size gloves time for battle john doe was stretched out on the table covered with drapes that exposed only his abdomen swabbed in russet antiseptic will could see and feel that the area had become even more distended just before he had entered the operating suite he had received the bloodalcohol reportnegative that result coupled with the negative head ct strongly suggested overwhelming infection or massive blood loss into the abdomen as the cause of the profound shock and coma ready ramon he asked the anesthesiologist who peered over the drape separating his work space from wills and nodded ready everyone lydia okay numberten blade please jennifer one by one will sliced through three of the four layers of john does abdomen suction ready he called out just as the fourth layer the thin peritoneal membrane parted beneath his blade under pressure volumes of foulsmelling brown liquid spewed out of the abdominal cavity a good deal of it overwhelming the suction and flowing down onto the floor will stepped back just in time to keep from irreparably soiling his trademark or footwearred converse chuck taylor hightop sneakers whew the circulating nurse exclaimed deodorizer why not and a pile of lap sponges jen and more suction the circulator placed two drops of deodorizer on every persons mask one by one will inspected each organlarge and small bowel kidneys pancreas liver spleen stomach and gallbladder even though the source of the problem was already quite apparent scar tissue from chronic inflammation caused by gallstones had shut off the blood supply to the large intestine causing a footlong section of it to become gangrenous and finally to split spilling feces into john does abdominal cavity septic shock was the result lydia he asked where to from here the residents eyes were red from the onslaught of the fetid spillage will suspected that at least a corner of her brain was imagining life as a plastic surgeonbowel contents versus botox no contest isolate the diseased intestine staple it off with a gia stapler she said then control bleeding irrigate the abdominal cavity clear with warm saline and then go after the gallbladder first the artery we need to tie off to get the gallbladder out cystic excellent go ahead and locate it you sure you want to go into plastics will could tell from her eyes that she was missing the glint in his dont bother answering that he said he guided her through the removal of the gallbladder and then did the colon removal and colostomy himself if by a miracle mr doe survived this ordeal the colostomy could be reversed some time in the future with heavy bacterial contamination it was best to leave the skin incision packed with dressings rather than to suture it closed the scar would be impressive but that too could be revised down the line at the moment it was life versus death with death holding most of the high cards finally it was done a procedure fraught with potentially fatal pitfalls had just been completed quickly and virtually without a hitch and every person working in or at that moment felt part of it great job will the anesthesiologist called out as he lowered the drape you can take out my gangrenous intestine anytime several nurses and lydia echoed the praise john doe still remained teetering on the edge of death and was facing a multitude of potentially lethal complications if he managed to survive the hours immediately postop but will felt exhilarated the hundreds of decisions he had dealt with instinctively or after deliberation were holding up he helped transfer the man to a recoveryroom bed and watched approvingly as the nurses reconnected the myriad of fluid and monitoring lines maxine the exhausting hours at work the alimony and support payments the periods of loneliness the truncated time with the twins the pressures from managed careas long as practicing medicine could deliver as it had tonight he would somehow find the strength to deal with the rest chapter at five in the morning serenity lane was dark and still posed in front of the vast picture window over the kitchen counter cyrill davenport carefully forksplit a thomas english muffin and set the toaster oven for precisely twopointfive davenport was nothing if not preciseobsessive he knew some at the company called him but he didnt care he was the president and chairman of the board of the unity comprehensive health hmo and they werent he could see little through the darkness beyond the window but had no trouble envisioning his yardnearly two rolling acres of grass gardens walkways majestic boulders and ten varieties of mature trees not bad for someone who had to wheedle a scholarship just to attend a small state school now the student center at that school bore his namehis and glorias it had been a mistake to include her name on the building he thought now he unwrapped a soft pat of customprepared butter sliced it precisely in two and spread each piece in concentric circles beginning at the center of the muffin halves if he had donated a detox to the school glorias name should definitely have been on itbut otherwise most resoundingly not the cyrill davenport student centerthats how it should have been he poured eight ounces of the chilled orange juice he had squeezed the previous evening into a waterford goblet and sipped it down as he finished the muffin no matter he acknowledged gloria gave great parties kept a magnificent house and handled the help impeccably so what if she was too sloshed most of the time to be much of a wife davenport pulled on his overcoat and set his dishes in the sink this day was to be a most significant one for unity comprehensive health depsonhayes one of the largest electronicsmanufacturing corporations in the northeast was on the verge of shifting its total coverage package to unity by midmorning the announcement would be made and the seven different hmos that had been covering the dh employeesincluding several who had been pressuring unity to join in their mergerwould be shit out of luck it had taken statistics and promisesa boatload of eachto convince the health people at dh that care would not suffer despite a striking reduction in the premiums they and their employees would have to pay now it would be up to davenports lieutenants to see to it that unitys hospitals and physicians made good on those promises davenport knew he was asking the impossible but this was one instance like horseshoes and hand grenades where close would be good enough there could be problems and complaints from the dh policyholders even serious onesjust not too many of them fortunately although he would never broadcast the fact both the state and federal governments had taken significant steps backward when it came to holding hmos responsible for medical catastrophes incurred by their insured clearly the powers that be understood that the hmos and other health insurers were merely trying to make the system work by keeping costs in line if the physicians and hospitals in the old feeforservice system hadnt lost sight of that goal feeforservice would still be the standard of care in the land davenport flicked off the kitchen and hall lights and slipped out the door into the garage as he was shutting the door behind him he swore he heard glorias prizewinning snoring emanating from the master suite upstairs and at the far end of the house the broad garage door was closed and glorias neat little white bmw roadster was in its customary spot but his cadillac seville was missing suddenly nonplussed and anxious davenport hit the button on the wall beside him as the automatic door glided upward he sighed with relief the silver caddy an absolute joy from the day six months ago when he decided to make the switch from his lincoln was parked a dozen or so yards down the drive right by the walk to the front door curious davenport distinctly remembered driving into the garage last night when he returned from work and also closing the electronic door behind him only gloria their garagedoor service company and their attorney knew the keypad password not even their groundskeeper julio had it davenport glanced at his rolex almost fivethirty he had a mountain of work to get done before the others arrived and this most significant of days got under way it had to have been gloria he decided as he stepped out onto the drive and shut the garage door behind him she obviously ran out of booze late last night and in a moment of clarity decided to take the heavier safer car to get restocked davenport grimaced at the image of her fumbling with the keypad in the caddy then finally giving up leaving the car where it was and entering the house up the front walk instead the notion of her driving sloshed which she was even before he went to sleep produced a knot in his throat gloria was capable of doing damage that not even their tenmilliondollar umbrella liability policy could cover he wondered how the neighbors would feel having some homeless crippled accident victim take over sycamore hill with images of another trip to rehab suddenly occupying his mind davenport slipped the key into the ignition and turned it the caddy purred to life he put the car in reverse checked over his right shoulder and gently depressed the accelerator the journey to unity comprehensive health lasted just four feet cyrill davenport heard the explosion a nanosecond before he and the cadillac were blown to bits all twentythree windows on the south side of serenity lane shattered in the secondfloor master suite gloria davenport her bloodalcohol level still three times legally intoxicated opened her eyes a slit and tried to make sense of the noise she had just heard and the chilly air she was feeling then she pulled the covers over her head and sank back to sleep chapter the jangling phone slammed into pattys dream like a wrecking ball shattering a scene in which she was flying arms outstretched over the houses and buildings of pittsfield her hometown in the dream a recurring one since childhood she would put her head down sprint ahead and leap only to fall heavily to the ground again and again she would repeat the maneuver until at last after numerous tumbles and bruises she would hover just a bit before the painful fall finally after increasing periods just above the ground pulling through the air like a frog through water she would suddenly gain altitude and fly it was a glorious experience when she made it to the clouds but thanks to the disrupted bizarre sleep patterns associated with her job the occasions when her soaring reached such an altitude were few and far between lo patty moriarity yes the led on her bedside clock read not that early but she had been riveted to the computer screen in her office until nearly two researching serial killers sorry to have woken you no no i was just getting up the woman chuckled i always say that too patty its kristine zurowski from the academy remember me of course patty instantly conjured up the image of a pleasant darkhaired woman who like herself was in her early thirties the similarities between the two of them hardly ended there kristine was also intelligent extremely intense and as committed as patty to making it to detective in the state police the two of them each finished close to the top of their class and within a shorter time than any of the other graduates patty had made detective not long after that she heard that kristine had too everything all right with you im absolutely exhausted all the time kristine said if thats what you mean by all right my husband has a photo of me pinned to the pillow so he can remember what i look like believe me if i had a husband hed have a photo pinned up too its like be careful what you wish for so whats up you know im attached to the norfolk barracks norfolk county was south of middlesex pattys unit i had heard that yes well im calling you from a crime scene in dover a man named cyrill davenport was in his cadillac when it blew up in the driveway of his mansion the bomb squad says someone wired his car he iswasthe ceo of unity comprehensive health patty sucked in a jet of air davenport would be the third managedcare executive in the area to be murdered in the last eight weeks the first ben morales was shotexecuted would be a more appropriate wordoutside his home in lexington one bullet midforehead fired by a of some sort no witnesses patty was the investigating officer initially assigned to head the investigation it was her third murder case but the first in which the killer wasnt immediately known the second managedcare executive marcia rising had been gunned down in the secured parking lot of her guarded hmo office building also in middlesex countythis time with a ninemillimeter once again there were no witnesses the similarities between the two deaths brought greatly increased interest and concern all the way up the state police chain of command from pattys immediate boss detective lieutenant jack court through the detective captain the major and finally to colonel cal carver and carvers righthand man lieutenant colonel tommy moriarity pattys father immediately following the rising murder with tommy moriaritys tacit blessing wayne brasco a longtime detective and close compadre of lieutenant court in the good ol boy club was assigned to take over for patty and oversee the investigation patty would continue to work with him but brasco in every sense of the term would be the man while patty was displeased with what she saw as an undeserved demotion she was even more pained by the selection of brasco for whom she had no respect as a cop and whom she had already warned more than once to stop calling her sweetcakes babe and the like the phone tucked between her chin and shoulder patty was already out of bed snatching clothes from her bureau and closet kristine its great of you to call me so quickly ill get in touch with wayne brasco my partner on this one and well be out there in just a little while i guess you know this case is number three i do but dont bother calling brasco why not because hes already here apparently someone from norfolk called him because hes been here almost from the beginning gladhanding the guys like this was some sort of frat party and ignoring every part of me except for my breasts a couple of minutes ago he jokingly let slip that you were also on the middlesex cases with himsomething about your being assigned to work with him as a favor to your father thats absurd you dont have to tell me i was with you at the academy thanks im really upset that brasco didnt call me the mans a cartoon i dont know how you put up with him hes like something from the fifties in a tribute to her flexibility and fitness patty had brushed out her hair cut short since a druggie seized a fistful of the longer version during an arrest pulled on underwear socks a pair of slacks and a dark blouse buttoned it up and tucked it in all without dislodging the phone tell me something she asked as she slid on her belt tightened it and finished things off with a navy blue sweater vest have you guys found an envelope yet not that i know of but mostly its been the lab people so far well get our shot in a little while ill be out as soon as i can great and kristine thanks again i just hope im nearby to see brascos face when you show up you may have to pull my fist out of it first now that would be my pleasure lost in thoughts of the managedcare murders and the disdain of wayne brasco patty was half a block past serenity lane before she realized she had missed the turn no surprise driving was an instant hypnotic for her and after just a few minutes on the road she was invariably lost in somethingclassical or country music or more often a case she swung her threeyearold camaro a rallyred z into a tight u then paused by the curb to compose herself and take in a few more seconds of beethovens sixth breathe in breathe out the exercise failed to lessen the stabbing pain caused by her nails digging into her palms there was nothing to be gained by making a scene here with brasco she cautioned herself some kind of response to his snub was most definitely called for but timing was everything she just had to watch for the right moment and seize it a young uniformed policeman stationed halfway down serenity lane checked pattys id told her she was driving a really neat car then motioned her past the crime scene cordoned off by yellow police tape and several sawhorses was dramatic two fire engines half a dozen cruisers vans from the bomb squad and forensics and an ambulance were still parked on the street beyond them a dozen or so peoplelocal cops detectives and crimescene investigatorswatched and waited as the laboratory people finished their work well off to pattys right kristine zurowski and another officer were ascending the front walk to a greekrevivalstyle mansion that patty found repugnantly ostentatious ahead of her was a more tasteful but no less vast colonial with all of the windows shattered the pungent smells of explosive and fuel still permeated the air welcome to the davenports patty flashed her shield at one more inquiring officer then ducked beneath the yellow tape the front yard was illuminated by hazy morning light plus a series of spots in addition to the burned and twisted metal of cyrill davenports car patty could make out significant segments of the man himself including an elbow and nearly intact head she stared skyward for half a minute before she was composed and ready to make her way across to detective lieutenant wayne brasco brasco a thick stubby unlit cigar clenched in his teeth was chatting with two other men still waiting for the green light to begin their work he was a bullnecked specimen with a slightly simian face a perpetual fiveoclock shadow and hairy tattooed forearms a fog of cologne and cigar invariably hung around him occasionally augmented by beer while there were those who out of earshot derided brascos intelligence patty knew better than to underestimate his street smarts or his shrewdness he wore a wedding ring and as far as she knew had a wife but that didnt stop him from boasting of the deals he had made with the chicks he had arrested a shadow of surprise crossed brascos face as she approached dispelled almost immediately by a broad grin hey if it isnt my gal friday guys meet the legendary patty moriarity tommys kid patty shook hands with the men from norfolk corbin and brown both of whom seemed at first glance to be more enlightened than her partner thanks for calling me wayne she said he shrugged matteroffactly and said i was going to bomb squad say anything yet nope but what can they say the dude was blown to smithereens and it wasnt an accident badabing badaboom case closed brasco laughed at his own attempt at flip humor patty was pleased when neither of the other two officers joined in well for those of us not as knowledgeable about explosives as you are she said acidly there may be one or two things we can learn had brasco ever bothered to spend time talking with her or even looking through her file he might have learned that through taking several courses patty was making herself something of an expert on ordnance and explosives well thats one of them coming over here right now brasco replied an irritated edge appearing in his voice you can ask yourself a babyfaced officer who could easily have passed for opie on the andy griffith show approached the quartet and was introduced to patty by corbin as chipper dawes well were all done dawes said thanks the norfolk detective replied youll get us a report as soon as possible no problem so what do you think patty asked semtex dawes looked at her with surprise and undisguised respect as a matter of fact yes he said were fairly certain of that probably wrapped around the drive shaft just behind the transmission so whats this semtex all about brown asked angling his rotund body purposefully or not so that brasco actually had to step to his left and forward to insert himself back in the ring of conversation the terrorists friend we call it dawes explained plastique similar to c it can be molded into almost any shape and worked into almost any space forty pounds or less flattened the american embassy in kenya patty sensed brascos discomfort and bore in the ira is supposed to have more than three tons of the stuff with a little knowledge its a cinch to make have you found the detonator no im going to stick around for a while longer to look but i have my doubts we will so patty continued now on a roll if the semtex was wrapped around the drive shaft the detonator was possibly some sort of centrifugal fuse that went off when it reached enough rpms youre exactly right sergeant dawes said two weights come together and form a contact that sends a small electrical impulse to the blasting cap and kaboom there are other ways the semtex could have been detonated but this is what we think at the moment lost in thought patty toed the ground and glanced down a charred lumpprobably a portion of a leg with bone protruding outlay on the lawn just a few feet away at that instant two lab people scurried over labeled it marked the location on a chart and dropped it into a large plastic evidence baggie chipper she asked do you think this could possibly have been the work of an amateursomeone whos just angry at managedcare executives because of something a managedcare company did that hurt them or maybe killed a loved one not really dawes replied whoever did this knew what they were doing it may not look it but blowing up a car in a driveway without substantially damaging the house twenty feet away is not easy this womans a keeper corbin said he was an imposingly tall and muscular black man with dark intelligent eyes and patty wondered what life would have been like had someone like him been assigned to her case youd best stick pretty close to her wayne shell make you look smart brasco merely shrugged his eyes were flint even in the dim light patty could see him flush she felt like a guerrilla making quick annoying strikes at the enemy next time maybe youll call me theres more evidence this guy was a pro brown added i interviewed davenports wife she didnt see or hear anything before the explosion but she also admits to having had a good deal to drink last nightand from the looks of her i would bet most nights before that however she insists that her husbands cadillac was in the garage and the electronic door was closed that means someone had to get the door open without disturbing anyone then get through the security system of the car and get it out onto the driveway then set the explosive so maybe whoever wanted revenge hired a pro dawes ventured excited to be one of the gang of detectives or maybe he was a pro to begin with patty tried testing the notion out on herself as much as the others you know some hmo doctor or managedcare company just happened to do something to upset the wrong persona professional killer she surveyed the scene again then thanked dawes and turned to the norfolk men pointedly ignoring brasco who looked something like the loser in a round of musical chairs lieutenant corbin she said we need to get inside the garage the three of us were already there briefly before you arrived as soon as the crimescene people are done well be opening the door we can wait if you insist but id rather not lieutenant as you know this is the third death in what is almost certainly the work of a serial killer yes im well aware of that well did wayne tell you about the letters the what one glance at brasco told patty she had struck another nerve if the killer had once again left alphabet letters about as he had in the first two cases brasco clearly wanted to be the one to discover them immediately he inserted himself between her and the norfolk detectives yes patty thanks for bringing it up he said confidently clearing the insincerity from his throat i was waiting to get clearance from lieutenant court to tell you two about the letters when patty arrived he hasnt called back yet but i assume jack wont have any problem with sharing the information with you thatd be nice of him corbin said with thinly disguised sarcasm weve kept this information internal in case we needed it brasco went on we understand well in each of the other cases the killer has left a calling cardtwo in fact each of the first two victims had an envelope alongside them the first one contained the letters e and r and the second one the letters r and t both envelopes and all the letters were clean obviously the killer couldnt put an envelope in the car he was about to blow up so i strongly suspect something is in the garage you wouldnt suspect your knees were bare if you had forgotten your pants patty thought savagely what about the garage the man behind the query tall and straight looking as distinguished as any diplomat wore the full uniform of a lieutenant colonel complete with a multitiered rainbow of decorations above his left breast at the sight of him brasco stiffened corbin extended his hand colonel he said roosevelt tommy moriarity replied good to see you again its been a while since that forensics conference in boston corbin introduced brown to the second in command of the state police force patty hesitated gauging the situation to determine the greeting the man would like from her finally she reached out and took his hand in both of hers hi colonel she said im glad to see you at sixthree moriarity was nearly a head taller than his daughter for the briefest moment it looked to patty as if he was going to bend down to embrace her or kiss her on the cheek then he simply smiled the creased weathered smile she loved so much and returned the greeting you know wayne brasco she asked of course your wife and family okay yes sir margo isnt it patty knew her father might have only met brascos wife once possibly years ago she wasnt the least surprised that he remembered herhe remembered everyone yes sir margo shes doing great so although the question was directed more or less to the group brasco was not about to pass up the opportunity to impress the colonel so its another managedcare executive he said the other two looked like professional hits so does this one probably semtex were guessing i just told corbin and brown here about the alphabet letters we found with the other two victims its my guess there must be letters in the garage patty stifled a groan roosevelt moriarity said do you think you could check with the crimescene people and get us permission to take a look in there no problem moments later the detective returned and indicated that so long as they were careful they could enter the garage through the kitchen of the house just leave the garage door alone until someone could determine how it might have been opened and closed by the killer without the electronic code and without anyone knowing stepping around and between grisly remnants of cyrill davenport they entered the house through the front door using a handkerchief patty gently opened the door from the rear hallway to the garage then she extracted a slim powerful flashlight from her purse located the light switch and flicked it on with a pen it took just three minutes of searching before tommy moriarity said well lieutenant it looks as if you are absolutely right he indicated a heavy metal rake tines propped up against the back wall impaled on the tine at each end of the row was a threeinch white square that looked as if it was cut from a file card meticulously artistically printed on one card was the block letter b and on the other an e careful to touch nothing the four of them peered at the finding as patty further illuminated it with her light e r r t b e she said softly heartbeat corbin offered possible patty replied maybe its parts of several words in a quote they searched the garage for another five minutes but found nothing unusual or out of place back outside on the driveway moriarity encouraged corbin and brasco to keep him informed and to contact him if there was anything he could help them with including passage around any bureaucratic roadblocks to their investigation then he motioned patty to a spot on the lawn where the two of them could talk unheard you okay he asked good enough you with friends patty often referred to herself as the son my father wishes he had had her wonderful older brother tom a wilderness guide and expert flyfisherman was often unemployed but always busy advocating for various environmental causes he was also openly gay and exceedingly happyexcept for those infrequent times he spent with their father soon pattys brother would say every time he ventured east from oregon soon the guys going to figure it all out what a force hell be then moriarity scuffed at the ground with the toe of his spitpolished shoe im doing all right i miss your mother thats for sure it had been two years since ruth moriarity lost a heroic battle with ovarian cancertwo years during which tommy seemed to have aged a dozen yeah patty said risking a squeeze of her colonels hand i miss her too moriarity seemed to sag for a moment then just as quickly pulled himself up ramrod straight so how are you doing on these cases he asked patty shook her head were working like hell on them but nothing so far my bet is its either a disillusioned disgruntled physician or the relative of someone who died because of managedcare negligence our hope is that sometime soon the killer will feel the need to get his message across to the public more stridently and move closer and closer to being out in the open then maybe we can get a hook into him you still upset about brasco taking your place in charge of this case nope im fine dad good im glad you understand why the change was made brascos been around a good while i imagine youll learn a lot from him ive learned a lot already i heard hes got a cryptographer and a psychologist on the case that he does patty narrowly avoided choking on the words even before the murder of marcia rising she was concerned that the letters found beside ben moraless body might be the start of something and had both the codebreaker and profiler at work in one of his first acts after taking over as head of the investigations brasco had sent out a memo to all the higherups summing up the departments efforts to date on the two managedcare killings in it he unabashedly took full credit for bringing both specialists on board if tommy moriarity picked up on the venom in his daughters voice he hid it well so he said youre still happy you became a cop tommys dream for his daughter centered around at least law school and at most the presidency he didnt speak to her for two months after learning she had taken the state police exam without consulting him hes the perfect father she often said to friends so long as you do what he wants im very happy being a cop she said now i hear good things about you from lieutenant court he cant stand me dad or any other woman detective for that matter he and his pal brasco are absolute neanderthals if a male version of me had handled this case exactly the same way i had believe me hed still be running it im pleased to hear that she said tommy shifted uncomfortably this wasnt going to be the moment he suddenly blurted out how proud he was of her and what she had become or how sorry he was for not insisting she be left in charge of the managedcare murders if anything patty suspected he was embarrassed at how much pressure had been brought to bear on him to not protest her demotion to brascos second fiddle at some level she thought he had to be proud that she had chosen to follow in his footsteps but then again maybe not so he said were still on for our dinner a week from friday without ever really discussing it they had gone from eating together twice a week following the death of ruth moriarity to every other my place same time patty said with forced cheer well good luck with this case call me if i can be of any help he gave her a wooden hug turned and headed off across the lawn stepping to his left to avoid what looked like a piece of cyrill davenport chapter the boston chapter of the hippocrates society had been meeting on the third thursday of each month since its inception fourteen years ago initially the three founders of the chapter met at the home of one or another of them soon driven by a steady increase in membership they moved to a conference room at harvard medical school now for nearly four years meetings had been held in the amphitheater of the massachusetts medical societya spectacular modern structure located in a waltham office park featuring a massive fourstory glass atrium at the main entrance which opened onto terraced gardens and a bamboo forest the avowed goal of the hippocrates society was to recapture the practice of medicine from the capricious and viselike grip of the managedcare industry begun originally in san francisco the society now had chapters in chicago philadelphia new york and houston as well as its most rapidly expanding member boston it was named for the fourthcentury bc greek physician who was now widely recognized as the father of medicine hippocrates held the thenheretical belief that illness had a physical and rational explanation and did not represent possession of the body by evil spirits he also preached the natural healing properties of rest a good diet fresh air and cleanliness and wrote the oath of medical ethics taken today at most medicalschool graduations will arrived at the medical society with fifteen minutes to spare before the seven pm start he had spent the last hour with john doe who had over the past fortyeight hours made the transition from nearhopeless physical disaster to medical miracle following his remarkable surgery there had been a rocky period during which his coma remained dense his temperature once reached degrees and his systolic blood pressure persisted below despite the most vigorous treatment to make matters worse the shock and hypothermia had caused his kidneys to shut down producing no urine output at all will brought in specialists from cardiology neurology and nephrologythe kidney experts he and his residents delicately monitored dozens of body chemicals working under the dangling sword of nonfunctioning kidneys which meant that toxins couldnt be cleared from john does body in addition without kidneys the blood level of administered medications was a challenge to control and could in fact have easily become a source of lethal complications hour after hour the mans life hung by the thinnest of threads suddenly twenty hours after will had stepped back from the operating table and stripped off his gloves signaling the end of the surgery a single magnificent drop of urine appeared in john does catheter then a minute later there was another kidney function was returning and from a treatment standpoint anything was now possible will the nurses the residents and the nephrologist toasted the event in the nurses lounge with coffee and stale doughnuts just three hours ago nearly two days after he was left for dead in an alley the man remarkably and progressively regained consciousness all at once john doe had a real namejack langleyand a life he was a salesman from des moines lowa and father of three and had been incapacitated by sudden severe abdominal pain he was down on one knee when he was attacked by three men fortunately it appeared that langley wasnt conscious for most of the ensuing beating now hardly out of the woods but certainly improving langley was filling the nurses in on the details of his life even as they were bringing him up to speed on his close brush with mortality will was pleased to find that most of the medical society amphitheaters stateoftheart conference seats were occupied as he stepped into the hall he was immediately surrounded by colleagues wanting some sort of update on the latest in the managedcare killings as head of publicity and public relations for the boston chapter for the past two years will had expected to be contacted by the press if not the police but so far nothing an eager ob named runyon clearly more interested in what he had to say than in any grisly headlines captured the conversation so get this one will twentythreeyearold woman develops severe abdominal cramping its the holiday weekend so she gets called by the hmo oncall doc who phones in a scrip for indigestion the office is closed for the weekend so no arrangements are made for followup she is worse by morning and calls again and gets another doc who calls in a different prescription insinuating that last nights doc doesnt know what in the hell hes doing tubal pregnancy will said anxious to speak with tom lemm the society president runyon looked crestfallen at having the tag line of his tale preempted exactly he said speaking to those nearby as will had headed off she bled out on the way to an eras in died can you believe it will spotted lemm a family practitioner in his fifties on the far side of the hall by the time he reached the man he had been regaled by a surgeon whose name he didnt know with the story of a woman whose hmo told her to wait awhile to have her thyroid biopsy repeated because the evidence of cancer from the first set of seven painful needle biopsies was inconclusive three months later her husband was transferred to another state and assigned coverage with a different hmo when the womans cancer suddenly began rapidly growing the new hmo refused to pay for treatment claiming it was a preexisting condition hey will lemm called out as he approached this may be our largest gathering yet he motioned to the crowd and will noticed as he followed the gesture that his partner susan hollister had just entered and was casting about for a seat thanks for showing up suze i owe you one ive got a couple of cases tom do you think theyre appropriate given this latest murder are they funny that depends on what on whether you mean funny ha ha or funny all of a sudden i cant see out of my right eye which are these a little of both well youre on the agenda theres more tension than usual from whats going on but i dont see any reason to withhold an anecdote or two tonight itll be right after we finish discussing the status of the classaction suit after your report well decide what were going to do about the big debate against boyd halliday next week what do you mean i spoke to him an hour ago he says it would send the wrong message to the public and the killer if he called off the debate the debate billed as a forum had been organized by the wellness project a respected independent consumer healthcare coalition and was scheduled for venerable faneuil hall in downtown boston halliday the powerful and dynamic ceo of excelsius health was to be matched up against jeremy purcell a worldrenowned surgeon harvard professor philosopher and former president of the hippocrates society thanks in large measure to wills efforts publicity for the forum which was titled managed care boon or boondoggle had been extensive and a sellout was anticipated of course the managedcare murders had only heightened interest in the event how does jeremy feel about it will asked im surprised you havent heard lemm said jeremys had a fairly large coronary he had emergency bypass surgery at white memorial and hes reasonably stable now but he wont be ready for next week we have to decide what were going to do hallidays a force will said in what he knew was something of an understatement he is that listen ive got to get this show on the road dont worry about your stories if people want to laugh theyll laugh i think one of the big reasons were getting more members at every meeting is you and your stories i dont make them up i just read them thats the point theyre real okay ill do my best will youre doing great things for this organization and dont think we dont appreciate it well garsh thanks mickey will said in his highly tuned goofy imitationthe only one in his repertoire lemm a lean sixfooter shambled up to the podium and silenced the crowd with a few taps on the microphone three nurses die in an accident and are spirited up to the pearly gates he began without any introductory remarks saint peter is there and asks each one who are you and why should you be allowed to walk through these gates i was a nurse in a private doctors office for fortyfive years the first responds i instructed patients on how to take their medicines i gave out lollipops to the childrensugarfree of course go right in saint pete says the second nurse walks up same question from saint pete i was a nurse in a hospice she says and for many years i soothed dying peoples fears of crossing over to the other side and made the transition a peaceful and enlightening one please go right in pete says again milk and cookies are on the right the third nurse comes forward again pete asks about her qualifications for admission i did case reviews for a managedcare company she says pete checks his massive golden book ah yes he says i have you right here he swings open the gate and as she starts in he adds but weve only got you scheduled for a threeday stay laughter from the assembled was enthusiastic even though will suspected that most had heard the joke before lemm was right these men and women needed to laugh their profession in many cases their dream was under constant attack and the ama the organization they had counted on to man the battlements had mounted a feeble defense the welloiled machine of the managedcare industry had cut through the various medical specialties like a thresher it probably wasnt totally fair to draw the analogy between the way managed care overwhelmed the practice of medicine one specialty at a time giving concessions to the ophthalmologists at the expense of the gps then suddenly regulating the ophthalmologists and the way hitler swept through europe a country at a time but will was hardly the first physician to see it that way there was a remarkable intensely moving holocaust memorial near quincy market in boston at the entrance was a quote from a lutheran pastor named martin niemoller in germany they came first for the communists and i didnt speak upbecause i wasnt a communist then they came for the jews and i didnt speak upbecause i wasnt a jew then they came for the trade unionists and i didnt speak upbecause i wasnt a trade unionist then they came for the catholics and i didnt speak upbecause i was a protestant then they came for meand by this time there was no one left to speak up lets begin this meeting as we do all our meetings with a reading of the rollphysicians who have notified us they are leaving patient care or retiring from medicine prematurely their specific reasons vary but the themes behind them do not these physicians can no longer handle the paperwork frustration and inconvenience to their patients if not actual danger of corporate medicine the reading of the roll consisting of as many as twenty names each month was as always painful along with most of the names was a short statement of the reasons this fiftyoneyearold family practitioner or that fortyeightyearold obstetrician decided to look elsewhere for the emotionally fulfilling economically rewarding life that they at one time felt was worth the years of sacrifice exhaustion and escalating financial outlay demanded by medical school and residency this month three of the nine names on the roll were well known to will one of them had been a clinical instructor of his in med school half of all physicians recently polled he was thinking glumly and angrily had said that given the chance they would not do it over after the reading of the roll lemm called on the societys legal committee which reviewed in detail the status of a classaction suit being brought against several of the largest hmos by the hippocrates society in conjunction with a number of state medical associations and some individual physicians the case which had been plodding forward for almost five years but was now gaining some momentum charged the hmos with extortion and with violating the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act other legal actions from around the country were also reviewed including a lawsuit in california accusing the health plans of interfering with physicians ability to make independent medical decisions the plans threatened physicians with economic loss the suit was charging in an effort to deter them from fulfilling their duty owed their patients and encourage them to place unreasonable and often unsafe restrictions on the level of medical services that might be delivered to their patients the legal teams presentation was interrupted a number of times by applause in the analogies to the nazi takeover of europe the lawyers and physicians of the legal team were the resistancesniping at the enemy disrupting them wherever possible when they had finished their presentation there was an almost palpable drop in energy throughout the hall so lemm announced perhaps sensing the same thing before we do new business lets hear from our illustrious publicity and public relations chairman will grant what do you have for us tonight will there was a smattering of applause as will took over the microphone he had been painfully shy as a child and as an adult had never been that comfortable speaking in public but over time he had managed to convince himself that looking or sounding like a fool wasnt that big a deal after two years reporting to the society each month held no great stressespecially when he had material such as he did tonight before i present a couple of cases he began i want to say that advance ticket sales for our forum with boyd halliday of excelsius health are brisk and we already may have sold out faneuil hall when im finished tom has some announcements to make regarding that event which is going to be held despite the recent managedcare murders as many of you know my writing is about as dynamic as a snail derby thankfully our committee has randy harrington who continues regularly to submit wonderful letters to the editor and oped pieces to both papers as well as some suburban publications this past month two of them have been published one in the globe i hope youve had the chance to read them if not they are on our web site randy could you take a bow harrington a slightly built pediatrician with a pediatricians penchant for colorful bow ties did as he was asked will grant is a much better writer than he would have any of us believe harrington said after the applause had quieted especially for a surgeon roughly translated will replied that means i know several words with more than one syllable and own at least five books that dont require crayons tom lemm laughed loudest of all so will went on as you know your crack publicity and public relations committee members are constantly casting about for stories we might submit to the papers or at least present to you all tonight i have two of them in which our friendly neighborhood hmos combine medicine and mathematics to give the best possible care to their constituents a newton psychiatrist writes i admitted a twelveyearold boy from orthopedics to our inpatient adolescent unit he had bilateral ankle fractures sustained after jumping off the peak of the roof of his familys garage it was no challenge to diagnose the boy with major depressive illness and to conclude that his leap was a bona fide suicide attempt i contacted the medical director of his hmo and requested a twoweek hospitalization to do intensive family work in an attempt to provide him with a safer home environment to initiate antidepressant medication and to monitor his pain meds since one fracture needed to be repaired with an open reduction i presented the case including the mentalstatus exam which was positive for a profoundly depressed mood constricted affect suicidal ideation substance abuse feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness and sleep and appetite disturbances now tell me again the hmo medical gatekeeper asked how high was the building he jumped off what has that got to do with anything this kid is hellbent on killing himself he needs at least fourteen days in the hospital ill ask you againhow high was the garage two stories i said what difference does it make if it really was two stories he said ill give you two days of initial authorization two days so if it was three stories id get three days two days is what i can give you you can call back after that and request approval for more but i cant guarantee youll get them if this were your son im sure your response would be different i said but then again hed probably be dead by now you janusfaced bastard the gatekeeper hung up on me eventually i got a total of six days for the kid in the lobby the day he was discharged i heard his father call him a little jerk the next day i submitted my resignation from the hospital and started looking for a nonclinical job thank you managed care the ending tragic though it was brought sustained applause the members exuberance was born purely of frustration every one of them had encountered similar logicdefying bureaucratic stonewalling of the way they wished to practice medicine you had to have made this up someone cried out will shook his head i dont have that kind of imagination he said these are real stories from real people okay one more mathandmedicine case this one a quickie from a surgeon in worcester patient comes to see her with bleeding horribly painful hemorrhoids the guys done everything his family doc asked him tosoaks suppositories stool softeners rubber donut finally sleepless in constant pain bleeding through a pad and unable to sit at work he comes in for surgery the surgeon dutifully calls for the hmos preapproval and is stunned to have the young voice on the phone ask how large the hemorrhoids are clearly the lad is parroting questions off a computer screen the surgeon writes what difference does it make how large or small they are she asks theyre killing him just say youll pay for this mans care and let me fix him up maam im afraid i cant do that the kid says i need to know the size of the hemorrhoids before i can approve payment for the surgery okay okay okay says the surgeonon the faculty at the medical school incidentallythe guys hemorrhoids are roughly the size of nebraska the lad making medical decisions for his hmo over the phone thinks for a few seconds fills in the blank on his screen then approves the procedure the laughter this time was heartfelt but also a bit edgy having medicine practiced over the telephone by hmo mds or even worse nonmds was a constant sore point for most of the hippocrates society members thats it until next month will said back to you tom lemm returned to the podium and silenced those who were still buzzing over wills cases one last piece of business he said as many of you know jeremy purcell who was to champion our cause at next weeks forum has had emergency bypass surgery hes reasonably stable at white memorial but has been absolutely forbidden to participate in the debate we cant back out of the deal so we need to select someone who can face up to boyd halliday jeremy has promised to make his notes and slides available and to spend time coaching whomever we choose as a last resort i will do this but you all know as well as i do that i am a ploddera behindthescene type of guy ill help and even sit beside our champion but we really need someone with more panache than i have someone with just the right balance of intellect passion and humor will focused approvingly on lemms words more than on the man himself suddenly realized that the societys president was staring directly over at him before he could react an internist from springfield had waved his hand and shouted out i nominate will grant second a dozen voices rang out third someone yelled fourth lemm waved the members to quiet down will he said earnestly i know you must be feeling like youve been set up well i am here to assure you that you have laughter calm down hush up please all of you im sorry will i apologize for making light of this and seriously it was jeremy who suggested you as his replacement just yesterday and the executive committee agreed i know theres not much time for preparation but we will help you in any way we can and if you want me ill be right up there on the stage beside you as your aidedecamp there was absolute silence throughout the auditorium will sighed he knew he desperately did not want to publicly debate the flamboyant president of excelsius health he also knew that he couldnt say no to the society ive been humiliated and utterly degraded before he said without leaving his seat i suppose that means im well prepared for an encounter with boyd halliday will will will will someone began chanting as if they were ringside at a prizefight one hundred and forty joined in will will will will there being no further business lemm shouted out over the din ill see you all at faneuil hall nice job all meeting adjourned of all the dumb things will thought as he drove out through the largely deserted parking lot you are no more equipped to match up with boyd halliday than you are to bat against pedro martinez he pulled off to the side of the road set his palm pilot on the wheel and called up tom lemms cell phone number lemm would just have to do it before he could dial his own cell began ringing dr grant a womans voice asked yes this is ellie newell i work in the comptrollers office at the hospital mr davidson is my boss i called him about this and he called mr brodsky apparently mr brodsky told him you would want to hear whats just happened seth brodsky was the longtime cfo of fredrickston general whats this about will asked its about your patient john doe in the icu hes not john doe anymore he just woke up and told us his name its langley jack langley from des moines iowa yes i know ellie said i just spoke to his wife you did will had called marybeth langley just a few hours before i also spoke with an officer at midwest industrial care the hmo that covers the langley family and dr grant correct me if im wrong but it seems mr langley is still facing a long hospitalization if there are no serious setbacks he is the man was essentially dead when he was brought in its a miracle hes alive at all i would guess ten more days maybe even two weeks his bill alreadycounting among other factors the cost of the er the or the surgical team the recovery room the icu and a number of consultantsis in excess of fortyfive thousand dollars im not surprised well midwest industrial has flatly refused to pay anything and will not pay for any subsequent care thats ridiculous what reason did they give ellie newell hesitated well she said the insurance company has a strict policy regarding all surgery no coverage unless the procedure is preapproved by them or approved within twentyfour hours but the man was in a coma i know how can they do this mr davidson told me that you of all doctors wouldnt even bother asking that questionthat youd already know the answer will felt himself deflate you know mr davidson is absolutely right he said hes absolutely right thanks for calling me will ended the call then called tom lemm tom its will hey i hope youre not upset with me for the way i railroaded you back there desperate situations call for desperate measures no problem will replied i was just calling to see if we could get together tomorrow weve got a lot to do before next week chapter marybeth langley was a petite energetic woman with a sweet face and manner for the week since wills call she had been spending nights in a small b ampb in downtown fredrickston and days at the bedside of her husband jack despite the persistent refusal of their hmo to pay for any of jacks surgery consultations or hospitalization she and her husband had decided to remain at fgh and under wills care until it was medically appropriate for him to return to lowa finally that time had arrived it was midafternoon on a chilly gray thursday the day of the faneuil hall managedcare forum will had repaired an electricians painful hernia in the morning then worked his way through a reduced office schedule he wanted to leave at least an hour for a final review of the mass of notes and articles he had accumulated regarding the shortcomings of managed careespecially jeremy purcells insights and strategies throughout college and medical school will never took an exam that he felt truly ready for but never had he felt as illprepared for anything as he did for this debate saying yes to tom lemm and the hippocrates society was certainly noble enough but it was evolving into one of the dumbest most impetuous things he had ever done he reminded himself for the hundredth time that he could only do what he could do and then turned his attention to discharging his prize patient the titanic struggle the two of them had endured together had forged a friendship that went well beyond the usual doctorpatient relationship so jack will said it looks like this is it looks like langley had proven to be a bright wellread mana laconic midwesterner with a subtle sense of humor who listened to countrywestern music almost around the clock and loved his job selling heavy machinery although his lifes dream had once been to become a veterinarian the pictures of and by langleys kids had been taken down and packed nurses discharge instructions had been checked over by will then given langley dressed in chinos and a loosefitting kansas city royals sweatshirt was seated in a wheelchair the required mode of transportation for discharge for nearly a minute nothing was spoken will distracted momentarily from the impending forum was trying to remember when he had ever felt so good about a case jack langley was alternating between projecting what it would be like to hold his kids again and wondering when he would be able to return to work marybeth deeply religious was processing her overwhelming gratitude for the droll softspoken surprisingly unassuming man who had saved her husbands life and thanking god that there were men and women in the world who could do what he had done for their family she knew very little of him except that he was divorced and had two children and that her husband in his understated midwestern way absolutely adored him silently she prayed that life was treating him well earlier in the day will had quite casually mentioned that he had arranged for himself and all of the consultants to rub their charges off the massive balance sheet she and jack were facing she took a wad of tissues from her purse and dabbed at the corners of her eyes so will said finally youll keep in touch of course and youll have your doctor call me straight off if there are any problems i dont expect therell be anynot any medical ones anyway will sensed a fullness building in his throat he had never had that much reserve about crying in public but this just wasnt a time he wanted to i heard some interesting news last night marybeth said as if sensing wills predicament i was talking to my cousin peggy she lives in a suburb of des moines she was telling her friend claire about what was happening to us with the hmo refusing to pay and all well it turns out claire used to work as a claims adjuster for that same hmo she says that she and the others who worked her job were instructed by the company to reject one out of every ten claims out of hand dont even bother to come up with a reason just reject it it seems the company had tried this approach to saving money and found that only thirty percent of the rejected claims were ever contested by the doctors they just didnt have the time or resources to battle over such things lord id like to say im surprised and stunned but im not in many instances the cost involved in disputing an hmo decision makes it not worth it ill make sure our hospital isnt one of the seventy percent in this case but i hope youre planning on fighting this too my cousin pams husband is a bigtime attorney in des moines marybeth said as well as being one of the most obnoxious people on the planet ive already spoken to him he says he specializes in making people wish they had never crossed paths with him thats quite a specialty well jack he said taking the mans hand in his youve been one hell of a patient i dont throw around the term hero very frequently but you are certainly one of mine and youre certainly one of ours marybeth said not waiting for a handshake she threw her arms around wills neck thank you doctor she whispered in his ear thank you for saving my husbands life dr jeremy purcell hadnt been nearly as much help as will had expected for one thing some pneumonia and a urinarytract infection from the catheter were keeping him down for another his notes while impressive in volume and scope were not that well organized or easy to read with tom lemms help they had put together a reasonable albeit dry presentation they even had a powerpoint production of sorts although it would never win any prizes for flair anxious to get in some final rehearsal will hurried back to the office where he had left the carton full of notes articles and slides in preparation for the trip into boston he was custer riding off to inspect the troops only this time he knew what little bighorn held in store fredrickston surgical associates occupied most of the second floor of the medical arts building the airy central waiting area was half full on a thursday they would be susans and gordos patients will felt relieved knowing that none of them was his he still had an hour or so to review before making the thirtyfivemile drive into boston were all excited about tonight dr grant the receptionist said are you coming mimi once we knew you were going to be part of it my husband and i tried getting tickets but there are none its a sellout you might be just as well off staying home together and watching professional wrestling the guy halliday who will be representing managed care has been preparing for months ive had a week oh dr grant youll do great i wish i had your confidence just tell them all what goes on around here with all the paperwork and delayed payments and grumpy patients i may do that excuse me dr grant a trim attractive asian woman approached him from one of the seats to his right her ebony hair cut in a pageboy was very appealing yes dr grant theres no reason you should remember me but theres no reason i would ever forget you im embarrassed i dont re please dont be my name is grace davis thats my husband mark over there will glanced over at an athleticlooking man in his early fortiesbusiness or perhaps law was his guess he also caught sight of the ornate grandfather clock that jim katz had lent the practice in fortyeight minutes he had to be on the road im sorry he said im still not able to my maiden name was peng grace peng for more than a year i was a regular at the oh my god grace i dont believe this excitedly will held her by the arms and studied her face it was most definitely grace peng but it wasnt the grace peng he knew was a woeful downandout alcoholic who was a regular patron of the open hearth a decade ago she was a woman of intelligence and potential whom he and everybody else around the hearth was drawn to and wanted to help but sooner or later her anger and virulent drinking drove them all away more than one of the volunteers and staffperhaps will includedpredicted a premature and possibly violent death for the woman gosh but you look wonderful how long has it been more than ten years since i saw you and also since i had my last drink inadvertently will glanced at the clock again forty minutes it sure looks as if you have a tale to tell he said im so sorry youre in a rush i didnt mean to hold you up no well i mean yes i have a speech to give tonight in boston im a little nervous about it the transformation in the woman was absolutely astounding she was always filthy and disheveledmore so even than most of the open hearth patrons to the best of wills memory grace had gone off to yet another treatment center and had never been heard from at the hearth again if as she said it had been more than ten years ago the twins were about to arrive and he was hustling about trying to hook up with a practice his involvement with the place he had helped found fell off for a couple of years i had no idea you were working here she said well who are you here to see dr hollister for i was referred to her by the clinic where i had my mammogram theyre suspicious of cancer im sorry to hear that well i certainly hope thats not the case im afraid it is my husband has my mammograms its not that big but even i can see it thirtyfive minutes dr hollister is one of my partners youll really like her now i dont want her to be my doctor why you said you havent even met her i want you dr grant if i had known you were here i would have insisted they refer me to you but im sorry i know youre in a hurry ill just cancel this appointment and reschedule with you we can talk then grace we make it a point in our practice not to switch patients im sure dr hollister will understand when i tell her that i wouldnt be alive if it werent for you thirty minutes will sighed inwardly why dont you and your husband come into my office he said there is so much about me and my upbringing and my life that i would never let you or anyone else at the soup kitchen know grace said as will held her mammograms up to the window as she predicted the cancer was quite easily discerniblea marblesize density in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast if the adjacent lymph nodes were cancer free the lumpectomy to remove it would be quite routine you and some of the others at the soup kitchen were incredibly kind and nonjudgmental she went on but you were the only one who really pushed through my anger and denial to talk with me even when i was filthy and acting abominably you kept trying then one night you told me that it was horribly difficult for you to see so many patients who wanted to live but had terminal illness then to have to come to the soup kitchen and see me systematically killing myself you gave me the name of a priest do you remember father charlie will said wistfully i remember now he was a patient of mine sober in aa for many years and he was dying of cancer you knew that when you sent me to him he talked to me for a long time then he arranged for me to go to a special treatment center he never would tell me how it got paid for i certainly didnt have any money i was there for nine months during which time i had almost no contact with the outside world while i was there i got a letter father charlie had written to me just before he passed away telling me how proud he was of me he was a wonderful man i went back to school in la eventually i got a masters degree in social work and married mark its no surprise that i specialize in addictions last year mark took a job as the head of the english department at maplewood academy and we moved back here now this will said gesturing to the mammogram now this grace echoed wistfully but without rancor and i cant talk you out of wanting to change from dr hollister to me absolutely not unless youre not on steadfast healths list of approved providers i am dr grant mark davis said take it from me when grace makes up her mind like this theres no sense even trying to argue with her okay okay you guys wait here ill see what i can do as he left his office will stepped around the carton of material he had planned to review well he thought its a good thing no one ever died of humiliation if will expected susan hollister to give up her patient without discussion he was mistaken the two of them had clashed occasionally over treatment philosophy or a surgical approach but even those conflicts were shortlived will why didnt you just tell this mrs davis that we simply dont do things like this in our practice susan asked you know as well as i do how many times when were covering for one another a patient decides she likes me better than you because im a woman or gordo better than me because the patients scottish or you better than gordo because youre not overweight if we arent firm about not doing this sort of thing there will be nothing but chaos and discord a confrontation with susan on this of all nights was the last thing will wanted or needed in no more than ten minutes he had to leave for boston i thought that because grace had never met you he tried and had a history with me we might make an exception susan was clearly exasperated i dont think so this woman was referred to me and i feel as if i should take care of her will checked his watch susan i cant believe im stuck in the middle like this listen why dont you come over and talk to her i only have a few minutes before i have to head into the city and id like to get this resolved the poor woman has breast cancer it seems the least we can do in this situation is to let her choose someone shes known for ten years to operate on her susan glared at him for a moment then visibly softened im sorry will she said youre absolutely right my nose was just out of joint this isnt the typical case i was talking about you two do have a history go tell your grace davis that its fine for you to take care of her ill even assist in doing the procedure if you need me will felt a flood of relief thanks suze in case you couldnt guess at this moment my mind is on other things than who does this breast biopsy i understand ill see you in boston and will relax about tonight im sure youll knock em dead chapter faneuil hall had been a gathering place for the artists and intelligentsia of boston for more than years over that time its grasshopper weathervane still perched atop the buildings cupola had become a symbol of the hub a city characterized by liberal thinking and more than colleges and universities samuel adams and other patriots once spoke beneath its roof rallying the colonists to strike for independence from the british none of the buildings history was lost on will as he parked in a nearby garage entered the firstfloor market area showed his id to the guard blocking the stairway and ascended to the secondfloor meeting hall through a metal detector there were still nearly fortyfive minutes to go before he and boyd halliday were scheduled to square off a sign at the foot of the stairs adjacent to the metal detector announced that for security reasons ticketed guests only would be admitted beginning thirty minutes before the forum two managedcare executives shot to death a third killed by a bomb speculation on the killers identity and motive was rampant with most guesses leaning toward a disgruntled hmo patient or patients relative there was some pressure from law enforcement to postpone the forum or to cancel it altogether but in the end it was felt that the second floor at faneuil hall was small enough for private security and the police to cover and that the public was sick of bending to terrorist threats of any kind the meeting hall was inspiringan elegant seventysixfoot square featuring a thirtyfoothigh ceiling and walls adorned with portraits of george washington samuel and john adams and daniel webster among others doric columns supported a threetiered balcony running along the sides and back of the hall four hundred wooden folding chairs had been set out in neat rows all would soon be filled at the front of the hall was a stage and on it a draped dais with five name placardsboyd halliday excelsius health marshall gold excelsius health roselyn morton wellness project thomas lemm md hippocrates society willard grant md hippocrates society willard could the forum possibly be off to a worse start will wondered first matters surrounding grace peng had eliminated his rehearsal time now willard will disliked the name as much today as he had the first time he was teased about it he disliked it as much as he hated beets he disliked it enough to have insisted that the shortened version be on all his diplomas and certifications and had not changed it legally only because he had never gotten around to it why not william he asked as his mother was cleaning him up from yet another losing fight too common was her stock answer then when will was eight willard the story of a social misfit who raised rats to be killers hit the movie houses three years of being called ratboy honed his temper and fighting skills and cemented his feelings willard so i think were ready yes will spun to the voice tom lemm appeared calm enough he was as usual conservatively dresseddark suit solid brown bow tie ready as were going to be i checked the powerpoint stuff it looks pretty darn good if i do say so powerpoint always looks good what we have is pretty dry tom facts not anecdotes thats what jeremy said would win the day for us i thought we agreed on that i suppose we did tell me something how did they know my name was willard no idea not from me thats for sure youve always been will to me why is there a problem no no problem whos marshall gold hallidays business manager and righthand mansort of a data nerd i think i just met him for the first time ive never even met halliday in person well thar she blows lemm said indicating a pair of men just to their left lets get the intros over with marshall gold late forties closecropped grayblack hair gold wirerimmed glasses met them first and shook wills hand firmly im pleased to meet you dr grant he said perhaps maintaining his grip for an extra instant you have the reputation as quite an excellent surgeon were happy to have you on our panel of provider physicians thanks is that your job the provider panel along with the other duties that go along with being mr hallidays personal assistant i understand you two havent met each other yet we should take care of that right now will had seen some photos of the excelsius health ceo but none of them conveyed the force of the man he was slightly taller than will perhaps sixone with dense pure white hair the weathered face of an outdoorsman and eyes so intensely gray that will wondered if he was wearing some sort of tinted contacts so dr grant he said impaling will with those eyes after years of sniping at us in the press you finally get the chance at an allout frontal assault will was immediately en garde i hadnt intended any sort of assault mr halliday just a dissemination of the facts as i know them yes of course facts that will be refreshing that did it halliday had only one chance to make a first impression and as far as will was concerned he had used his poorly they were enemies and would remain so until the man did something incredibly admirable i had been led to believe that this evening was going to be a civil discussion of the issues will said feeling the heat in his face that used to follow being called willard hallidays smile held no warmth dr grant you are publicity director of an organization that is trying to hurt my company if not put it out of business altogether i intend to be civil with you only as it suits my purposes well well well i see that weve all gotten acquainted with one another roselyn morton gushed as she approached the four combatants she was a lusty woman straight out of the society pages meticulously coifed and wearing a formfitting designer dress that aesthetically could have been a size larger or even two the four men introduced themselves and shook her hand although it was clear to will that she and halliday had some prior connection morton took several minutes to review the format of the evening which she said was to be a brisk issueoriented presentation and discussion surrounding managed care there was to be a fifteenminute opening from each side followed by ten minutes each spent addressing the points made by the other next there would be five questions for each team chosen by a wellness project committee from audience submissions with a strict twominute limit on the answers if i tell either of you that time is up i would like you to stop immediately she said mr gold and dr lemm may speak at any time but the minutes they take will be counted against your side lastly there will be five minutes for each team for summation the side that goes first at the beginning will go last here if all goes well well be done in an hour and twenty minutes questions who goes first will asked roselyn morton looked over at halliday oh im sorry dr grant halliday said i was asked about this a couple of weeks ago and said it was perfectly all right with me if your side went first did dr purcell know that i assume so well he didnt say anything to me about it gentlemen gentlemen morton pleaded supposing we simply flip a coin winner goes first dr grant heads will said certain only that if halliday wanted him to go first there must be some disadvantage for him to do so heads it is morton sang out from a spot beside the stage will and tom lemm watched the sellout crowd assemble there were uniformed security people patrolling the main floor and up in the balcony and will knew there were police scattered about in street clothes as well reporters and cameramen filled the back of the hall so will whats your take on boyd halliday lemm asked clearly not a man who enjoys coming in second do you i hope i dont disappoint you tom but my finishfirstatallcosts phase caused me nothing but trouble and pain most of the time now im more than satisfied with just competing and trying my best regardless of whether i win or not in fact except for in the or i think winning is often vastly overrated christ is that the governor this is big stuff will tell me again why im the one with the dueling pistol and youre the second because im dull and i cant stand to lose listen dont worry youll handle this guy fine jim katz and his wife julia entered with gordo and his wife kristin behind them came susan who was unaccompanied but looked less drab and bookish than usual in a tweed wool suit cameron was the first to spot will and pointed him out to the others who smiled and waved then he left the group to give will a bear hug no kilt will asked knowing your curiosity about what lies beneath i dinna want to distract you are you ready for battle braveheart gordo the truth is this all sounded better when i said id do it than it does right now i cant believe it the lad is cool as kelp in the operating room and here he is shaking in his boots i cant help it if im allergic to humiliation well you better be entertaining i told kristin this was our night out for the month hey easy does it i cant handle any more pressure well then make us proud ill try whats this willard thing a misprint roselyn mortons opening remarks were neutral enough although at one point she did aver that excesses in the former system of feeforservice health care gave birth to the need for major healthcare reform a conclusion that will felt was debatable wait will wanted to scream as he heard his introduction beginning wait im not ready yet im not ready yet and for gods sake please dont call me dr willard grant to polite applause will took the stack of notes he and lemm had prepared which included pages with the powerpoint slides printed on them and woodenly approached the podium clearly he appreciated now it would have been better to go second with no idea what approach halliday was planning to take he would have to stick to the script he and lemm had put together it has been well over twenty years he began since the onset of myriad attempts to reform the feeforservice delivery of medical care that many physicians grew up with the current incarnation an alphabet soup of various forms of managed health care has pitted physicians and patients alike against insurance companies physicians against other physicians and even physicians against patients there are lawsuits upon lawsuits skyrocketing physician dissatisfaction rampant early retirement and an unprecedented malpractice crisis many managedcare programs feature coverage called capitation in which primarycare physicians are paid a set amount to deliver care to a patient for a year any lab tests xrays and specialist consultations are paid for from that upfront money what remains at the end of a year is what the physician gets to use to pay the expenses of his practice and feed his family the initial amount paid is hardly large and primarycare physicians know they are in essence being paid to cut corners if a doctor goes over the budget in his evaluation and treatment the excess is his responsibility will glanced briefly at the audience for anyone nodding in sympathy and understanding with his points if there were such people out there he missed them a few already seemed asleep with the help of the powerpoint tables and charts will illustrated that there are more uninsured now than there were before healthcare reform beganmore than forty million he spoke of the more than patients refused care in hospital emergency rooms last year because they couldnt pay he showed graphs comparing the perpatient cost in the us versus countries with national health insurance such as canada and great britain careful to omit the three who had recently been murdered will listed the astronomical salaries and stock holdings of the top ten managedcare executives in new england he was just halfway through his initial presentation when roselyn morton announced that he had one minute left surprised and flustered will tried to sift through his notes to those facts he felt would have the most impact what he succeeded instead in doing was to shove most of the sheets over the edge of the podium where they floated to the floor like mutant leaves for the first time since he began his presentation there was a reaction from the audiencea collective gasp peppered with some sympathetic whispers and some notsosympathetic laughter for a frozen moment will stood there uncertain whether to go for his notes or to try and ad lib one or two final points instead with a mumbled thanks he scooped up the sheets and returned to his seat you did great lemm whispered did you like that little touch at the end inspired i think who hasnt dropped something in their life im sure theyre all thinking that very thing tom and not something like hes a surgeon boyd halliday smiling strutted up to the microphone his white hair glistening beneath the elegant chandelier rumor has it he began that the president is going to create a new cabinet post to oversee managed health care however congress has insisted that the secretary he appoints will only be allowed to hold office for three days will groaned two seconds and the man had already won over the audience with selfdeprecating humor a minute later halliday switched on a film possibly done by an oscar winner which made managed care seem responsible for everything that was good about america and american medicine where wills data was presented in powerpoint with a character occasionally moving aimlessly on the screen hallidays film together we can make a difference used disneylevel animation and a score that had some in the audience tapping their feet where will presented columns of statistics halliday showed smiling children and scrubbed midwesterners each relating a heartwarming account of how their managedcare company came to the rescue during their darkest hour what statistics he did present had to do with unchanged maternalchild health despite strict hmo limitations on their hospital stay together and patient satisfaction that exceeded surveys done when feeforservice was the way to go hallidays final minutes were spent looking at cost savings for various medical conditions since the managedcare revolution by the time he had finished will doubted there was a soul in the hall who wasnt a believer in the mans cause both will and lemm took notes for the rebuttal period but there was so much flash and so little substance in hallidays presentation that it was hard to find any point on which they could gain much purchase you want to do this part will wrote on the legal pad before them youre doing fine lemm wrote back just relax a little bit and you will succeed if will succeeded at anything over the minutes that followed it was at not embarrassing himself any further rather than attempt to refute the glossybutvacuous picture painted by halliday he completed his factual presentation and added some of the data they had not included on the powerpoint program he felt a bit more animated but the audience still seemed lost to his point of view before taking over the microphone halliday held a prolonged whispered conversation with marshall gold for a moment will thought gold might take over as a gesture of fairness to their thoroughly beaten opponent but it was halliday who again stepped to the mike this time the ceo of excelsius health took him on point by point in a structured mechanical defense of the positions of managed care round two was much less of a defeat for will and the society than round one had been but it was a defeat nonetheless it had to have been bookish marshall gold who had so quickly and effectively organized hallidays rebuttal phase and will found himself grudgingly admiring the man the questions submitted by the audience and chosen by the wellness project panel were all softballs which both will and halliday handled without a hitch though also without doing any significant damage to the other will rated round three as a tie but weighted it significantly below the first two in terms of impact time had just about run out hallidays summation was a nifty professionally done powerpoint show that made the one will had presented look at best unimaginative efficiency and costcutting are not the least bit incompatible with compassionate health care while hmos may at times not have an extensive choice of physicians patients can rest assured that those we do select have been carefully screened not only for ability but for a history of psychiatric drug or alcohol problems statistics have shown that our restrictions on length of hospitalizations have not compromised surgical outcome in the least statistics also show no change in morbidity or mortality even though we are paying surgeons less than they earned per case under feeforservice smug son of a bitch lemm wrote on the yellow pad he has reason to be was wills reply well here are the notes for your concluding statement will lemm whispered handing over a stack of fivebyseven cards some of which jeremy purcell had prepared i think thisll be pretty good halliday concluded his remarks and returned to his seat accompanied by generous appreciative applause will remained in his seat for several seconds after his name was called out the night was nearly over and in truth from what he could tell he hadnt accomplished a damn thing it wasnt as if he had mortally wounded himself or the hippocrates society and its goals but he certainly hadnt helped to promote them either he carried the file cards to the podium then took a few more seconds to scan the crowd it was he realized the first time he had made any real contact with them yes of course facts halliday had said that will be refreshing dr grant i intend to be civil with you only as it suits my purposes suddenly with barely a hint from inside himself that he was going to do it will took the stack of note cards and set them aside then he lifted the microphone from its stand and carried it to the side of the podium mr halliday has spoken a great deal tonight about statistics he began with no clear idea where he was headed i took biostatistics in medical school i was hardly a legend in the course but i did pass one thing i learned was that welldesigned truly meaningful unflawed clinical studies are about as rare as as a day without dozens and dozens of conflicts between physicians of every specialty and the insurance companies charged with deciding what they can and cannot do for their patients and how much they will be paid for doing it put another way if you happen to be the person being shipped from one er to another because your hmo doesnt perceive your illness to be lifethreatening statistics that say youll make it through your crisis without dying dont mean a hell of a lot in addition to biostatistics i also took a course entitled the art and practice of medicine that one i did do quite well in basically what we learned about in the art and practice of medicine was peoplenot the kind of actors we saw in that movie scrubbed and healthy and happy but people who are sick or injured or confusedreal people often at the very crossroads of their lives people like roy a tenyearold boy hospitalized by his pediatrician for profound malnutrition fiftyfour pounds he weighed it took an extensive delicate evaluation but finally the diagnosis of anorexia was madean unusual though not unheard of occurrence in a boy of this age tube feedings and intensive family therapy helped the pediatrician and psychiatrist and nurses to save his life imagine if this was your child and he had died imagine the devastation to the survivors but doctors doing what they had studied and trained to do kept that nightmare from happening the point well through a clerical mistake roys discharge diagnosis was listed as anorexia not malnutrition same boy same illness same miraculous outcome different word alas whereas the familys hmo would have paid for the lifesaving hospitalization if the diagnosis was written as malnutrition the bureaucrats who decide such things adamantly and forever refused to pay for anorexiaa diagnosis they considered psychiatric and therefore not covered by the familys plan recently karen a registered nurse in a hospital not far from here with fifteen years of unblemished service committed a fatal medication error an investigation concluded that she was exhausted and harried because corporate costcutting had left her floor woefully short of registered nurses and she had been picking up extra shifts and performing extra duties on those shifts do you think she or the family of the dead patient want to hear about statistics and dollars saved by substituting lpns and aides for rns there was no movement at all among the hundreds in the audience no sound will cleared his throat then took a sip of water seated in the center of the fourth row gordon cameron made eye contact and almost imperceptibly nodded will plunged ahead feeling like a halfback who had broken through the line and was now running free in the open field last week a fiftythreeyearold loving caring internist by the name of mark white was chastised and threatened by a nonmd managedcare official for ordering excessive diagnostic tests on his patients that call was the final straw for this physician who had never been sued who did volunteer work at a free clinic who was a past chief of medicine at his hospital and whose filledtooverflowing practice was as totally devoted to him as he was to it he spoke briefly to his staff and to the patients in his waiting room then he put on his coat and left quit just like that goodbye dr white a survey by the western journal of medicine recently reported that the average primarycare physician spends forty minutes a day dealing with managedcare hassles mostly around referral and prescription issues since there are around one hundred thirtyseven thousand primarycare docs with managedcare contracts that translates into more than twentyone million hours of patientphysician interaction lost to those hassles using the average three visits per patient per year and an overly generous twenty minutes per visit more than twentyone million patients could have had access to a primarycare physician during the time those docs are now spending on managedcare issues will paused to let the notion sink in he still had no clear idea how he was going to wrap things up but he sensed that desperation had led him to the path he should have been traveling all eveningthat medicine must be at its core always and ever about each individual patient he caught movement out of the corner of his eye and initially thought that either roselyn morton was coming over to give him the hook or boyd halliday was about to turn the forum into a freeforall instead tom lemm approached and handed him a typed sheet i think this might be just what you need he whispered will scanned the paragraph and immediately understood so where does this leave us he asked the crowd feeforservice has been deemed too expensive and managed care is too well managed under the one system lots of doctors were felt to be making too much money under the other managedcare executives are pocketing tens if not hundreds of millions while searching daily for ways to further cut services and payments as well as ways to weed out from their coverage those who are most in need of proper health carethe old the infirm and the poor in europe and canada nationalized health care has been at least as successful as the system we have in place if nothing else all of the citizens of those countries have access to care whether it is their system or a hybrid of theirs with our own changes are needed and needed desperately i want to close with this note that we received at the hippocrates society and that my trusted cohort dr tom lemm just produced for me its from a man who works in an autobody shop north of bostonone of those regular guys i was talking about i seriously doubt well ever be seeing vic kozlowski in any promotional videos he doesnt suffer from a dramatic lifethreatening illness but believe me vic has something to say to all of us gathered here tonight so here he is in his own words for emphasis more than any physical need will cleared his throat again and took another sip of water i dont think its really appropriate for my doctor to do vic writes but every time i visit him he tells me about how the hmos are dictating every move he makes and ruining his practice then he tells me he shouldnt even be saying such things because he might get in trouble it makes me so sad he is a wonderful doctor but hes scared to speak up against the hmos its bad for me too i cant get an antibiotic that i need because its not on the hmoapproved formulary but the ones that are in there either dont work or make me so sick they dont stay in my body so if i do whats best for me and get the medication that works the payment is more than fifty dollars well i dont have to tell you that to a family of four with one income that is a hard chunk we already pay skyhigh rates and they keep rising while our copays keep rising as well the bottom line is i feel i might as well be uninsured the doctor doesnt make me feel confident and the circle is neverending the patient is the butt of the whole thing i truly believe that america is helpless i am so nervous every time i get sick this probably seems totally trivial to you but believe me most of the patients in this country feel the same way i do thanks for reading this will walked back around the podium and replaced the microphone and on behalf of myself dr lemm and the hippocrates society thank you all for caring enough to attend tonight the huskiness in his voice was as surprising as it was unintentional several silent seconds passed then the applause began building like the sound of a river churning downstream toward a falls then with gordo leading the way slamming his huge hands together most of the crowd rose cheering out loud thoroughly drained will nodded sheepishly and returned to his seat still the clamor continued roselyn morton took the microphone and thanked the audience and participants but it was doubtful anyone heard through the noise the forum was over will sat for a time until he felt reasonably confident his legs would hold him then descended the steps to the main floor where he was mobbed gordo jim and their wives hugged him susan squeezed him tightly and whispered something about his making the whole profession proud several members of the society pumped his hand and said no one had ever done so much for their cause so quickly as the crowd began to disperse wills attention was drawn to a woman standing off to the side wearing tightfitting jeans cinched with a heavybuckled belt a tan silk blouse and a black vest her face was fascinatingvibrant and intelligentwith scattered freckles across the bridge of her nose and wide emerald eyes that seemed possessed of their own light for a time she just stood there eyeing him curiously until the last of the wellwishers had departed then her gaze still fixed on him she approached and handed him a business card please give me a call she said punctuating the request with the tiniest wink before he could speak a word she turned and was gone her jeans highlighted an athletic totally appealing behind she moved with confidence and perhaps even a bit of swagger will watched until she had disappeared down the stairs the vacuum she created in front of him was immediately filled by a few lingering fans each anxious to tell him how his spontaneity and emotional sincerity had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat when at last he was alone the womans face still dominating his thoughts he took a look at her card patricia moriarity detective sergeant massachusetts state police chapter patty woke from a troubled sleep at ten after three her dream this timewhat she remembered of itfeatured multiple burned and bloodied body parts interspersed with varying images of dr willard grant the two homicides she had handled before the managedcare murders were exercises in police and crimescene procedure not in detective work in the first the victim had taken out a restraining order against her violent boyfriend and half an hour after she had returned from court he kicked in her door and stabbed her twentyfive times the second a lovers quarrel between two gay men had ended in a single impetuous gunshot to the heart the shooting death of ben morales ceo of premier care was the first murder she had been assigned where the suspect wasnt readymade now that one case had grown to three and no one doubted that a serial killer was at work on paper she was still part of the team from middlesex working the case but thanks to wayne brasco she was justifiably feeling more and more like an outsider meetings were being held that did not include her and were called nothing more than impromptu discussions when she found out consultants were being called in without her knowing about them the profiler she had originally lined upa young talented womanhad been replaced by a more experienced though in her mind far less capable man tired of having her ideas demeaned and brushed off patty had decided on her own and on her own time to attend the faneuil hall debate it just seemed to her like a charged setting where something might possibly happen and something had only not at all what she had expected wrapped in the darkness of her room she sat on the edge of her bed and wondered about grant and why he was occupying so much of her thoughts there was no question he appealed to her his looks were hardly classic hollywood but she had never been attracted to square jaws and dimpled chins his face was narrow and angular almost gaunt but there was a gentle vulnerability to it that brought her images of the man curled up on a couch glasses perched on the tip of his nose reading by a winter fire it was his eyes though that affected her the mostwide and dark brown enveloped by shadows of strain and fatigue yet still bright and intelligent this was not a simple man she decided after just a few minutes of watching him at the podium this was a man who felt things deeply who had honest humility and who also she suspected had a past that included some significant pain patty shuffled to the couch in her living room and sipped some decaf cinnamon tea before attempting to read herself back to sleepfirst with an agatha christie she had read at least once before then with some emily dickinson poetry by fourthirty her angry thoughts of wayne brasco and her pleasant ones of willard grant were scrambled with the frustration surrounding three violent deaths and nearly eight weeks of fruitless investigation sleep at least for this night was over she tied a terrycloth robe tightly about her waist padded into the guest bedroom which doubled as her athome study and switched on her desk lamp the base of which was a remarkable northwest eskimo carving of a polar bear the lamp had been a gift from her brother tommy in honor of her graduation from the police academy willard grant she knew precious little of the man it would be fun to learn more she rotated some residual stiffness from her shoulders then switched on her pc called up her favorite search engine and typed in the name surprisingly a seventyfivepage list of web sites that contained the name popped up encompassing separate items intrigued patty began to scroll down the pages after just a few minutes she was ready to give up there were a few sites involving a reverend willard grant in historical documents dating back before the revolutionary war but all of the rest it seemed pertained to a rockjazz fusion band that took its name from the intersection where their first recording studio was located grinning at the image of herself poring through countless web listings at four in the morning searching for a man to whom she had spoken all of five words patty highlighted page which for no particular reason she considered her lucky number the page was filled with more band sites most of them in german enough she thought he wasnt wearing a ring but that doesnt mean he isnt married go for a run do some pushups email some friends but stop this teenage patty stared at an item near the bottom of the page it was from the ashford sentinelthe police log from may four years ago domestic disturbance martin road dr willard grant taken into custody for arguing with responding officers no charges filed there was no more information taken into custody no charges filed what was that all about she muttered the best scenario she could concoct was that grants wife or else a neighbor or perhaps even one of their children had called the cops because of a noisy argument when the officers arrived grant refused to calm down or perhaps to leave the house for the night in order to defuse the situation he was eventually removed by the officers by force and then calmed down quickly enough so that no charges were filed maybe the responding officers even knew him maybe he did some medical work for them or their families cops and docsespecially surgeons and er docstended to share the bond of full moons and earlymorning crazies just as quickly as that pattys romantic fantasies were gone replaced by thoughts that were much more serious and sinisterthoughts of a father of two with a bullet in his forehead and a company ceo shot through the throat and finally a meticulous suburbanite blown to bits in his driveway the issues willard grant had discussed at faneuil hall didnt exactly qualify as a motive but there could certainly be more going on add an angermanagement problem to the mans passionate dislike for hmos and something well might be brewing in twenty minutes patty had showered and dressed and was speeding through the early morning toward salem along largely deserted streets the middlesex state police detectives unit was one floor below the district attorneys office located in a small shopping mall near the center of town patty used her security code to enter left the overhead lights off and switched on the desk lamp in her cubicle her desktop while somewhat cluttered was still neater than any of the mens except for lieutenant court who was at times fastidious to a fault she had a single poster on the wall sent by her brother which looked amazingly like a mullioned window looking out on the cascade mountains she had added a rod and set of paisley curtains tied back to complete the illusion sensing she was on to something patty settled in front of her computer and logged in in moments she would be linked over space and time to the criminal justice information system an almost inconceivable amount of data on criminals as well as on everyday citizens with no police record at all she was about to become something of an expert on one dr willard grant her first stop was the registry of motor vehicles discovery number one was that willard grant used the name will on his drivers license which patty sensed might already be a violation of state law he had two citations in five years both for speeding both paid his current address was in wolf hollow a modestly upscale condominium development in frederickston backtracking patty found a maxine grant still living at the martin road address in ashford since the domesticdisturbance incident four years ago will grant was either separated or divorced a quick check of fredrickston records showed a divorce two years ago two children daniel and jessica both the same age an adoption perhaps but more likely twins patty wondered where the children were the night their parents argued and will grant was hauled off by the ashford police seated in the pleasing quiet of the office patty logged on to a second site the wmswarrant management system it took only a short while to learn that grant had no outstanding arrest warrants against him patty sensed that in spite of herself she felt strangely relieved at the news still there was the aftermath of the disturbance in ashford with several choices available to her patty next logged on to the board of probation site the bop recorded every court action in the state and was in the process of merging with the data banks of all other state boards of probation as well cori the criminal offenders records information segment of the bop was her first stop willard grant ashford address lit up immediately in the form of a threemonth restraining order taken out by maxine grant the day after the incident reported in the ashford newspaper patty opened a spiralbound pad and noted the information she had intervened in enough domesticviolence cases to find them totally abhorrent and that was even before her grisly first homicide case what little warmth she still held for grant vanished replaced by heightened interest in him as a suspect in a string of murders that until now had no suspects a few minutes later that interest expanded like a party balloon she had searched through the interstate identification index iii and the ncicthe national crime information centerwithout adding anything to what she already knew and was about to call it quits when she decided to visit one last sitethe criminal history system board the chsb located in chelsea just north of boston was manned twentyfourseven and contained a vast data bank overlapping some of the others but also including information on lawbreakers who either hadnt yet made it onto other sites or had been overlooked for one reason or another willard grant was fortyone teaming up with the night officer on duty a youngsounding man who introduced himself as matthew macdonald patty searched through the chsb for will or willard grant beginning with the year he turned seventeen when she reached twentyone will grant again lit up it was an arrest at the university of massachusetts in amherst for leading a sitin at the office of the dean public service and two years probation there was no mention of the cause for which the sitin was held but the zealous action against a perceived social injustice fit well with the man who twenty years later was active in the hippocrates society and vehemently opposed managed care theres more macdonald said from his desk twenty miles south and east of where patty was seated in addition to being booked for illegally blocking the egress and entrance of a public building grant was charged with shoving a security guard it doesnt look as if that charge led to a court appearance but i cant be sure there are still holes in some of these reports pattys spiral pad was filling up just three years later there was moreanother arrest this time for assaulting a fellow med student at some sort of book burning book burning patty asked thats what it says here macdonald replied the other students name was streeterowen streeter apparently no official charges were filed patty was recording the information when macdonald said wait this is interesting what will grant was picked up as a suspect in the bombing of a lab at the medical school same year arrested i dont think so but the amherst police were impressed enough to put him in the data bank i wonder why for a few seconds macdonald was silent i think i know he said slowly go on there was someone in the lab at the time of the explosiona janitor it says here he was killed murder patty wrote the word across the center of a blank page in her notebook then added drops of blood coming off the legs of the m and rs she noted the date and for the time being ended her conversation with macdonald but not before extracting his promise to keep searching the intervening years for more on grant and to call her if anything additional turned up her shift was about to begin and even before this latest turn of events she was behind in her paperwork still strongly sensing that this was no dead end she was unwilling to put matters on hold using the net she jotted down the names and urls of the newspapers in amherst as well as the nearby towns and cities including northampton and springfield before she could make her way into those newspapers back issues the door to the office opened it took just a few seconds to recognize the voices of two men as jack court and wayne brasco i dont care if she did embarrass you in front of the norfolk guys wayne theres no way i can take her any further off the case unless she fucks up the overhead fluorescents flickered on pattys cubicle was farthest from the doorjust a few paces from courts office brascos was just inside the door i could work better with sonnenblick or even tomasetti he said you dont have to work with her wayne just put up with her throw her a crumb here and there show her how real detectives handle a murder investigation the moment she steps out of line shes off the case patty heard brasco grunt as he settled in front of his desk then courts footsteps as he headed down the row of detectives cubicles toward her he stopped when he realized she was at her desk the nonplussed expression on his hawklike face clearly stating that he was calculating how much if anything she had heard morning patty he said lieutenant patty slid her arm over the notebook to cover up the macabre rendering of the word murder there was an unpleasant pause before pattys co favored her with one of his most engaging yet insincere smiles well be meeting in the conference room at eight he said carry on the moment she heard the exchange between the two men patty conducted and resolved the internal dialogue surrounding whether or not to share her information and suspicions regarding will grant she returned courts nod and remained motionless until she heard the door to his office close then she slipped the spiral notebook off her desk and into her shoulder bag chapter impassioned plea helps doc lambaste managed care four hundred of the citys best and brightest including governor john a fromson sat in stunned silence at faneuil hall last night as fredrickston surgeon willard grant emotionally and effectively chastised managedcare companies for placing profits before patients and before physicians the article was the headliner in section b of the globethe city section there were two copies of the paper on wills desk when he arrived at the office along with two copies of the article itself neatly cut out by the associates dauntless receptionist mimi there was also a copy of the herald which contained an article saying essentially the same thing albeit in many fewer words will had begun his day as usual by making rounds at the hospital where nearly everyone seemed already to have heard about the forum and his unofficial victory over boyd halliday several peopletwo nurses a lab tech and a ward secretarybuttonholed him to share their own angry managedcare stories two others felt the need to tell him how pleased they were with the care their hmos were providing for their families even his patients seemed to have heard some version of the debate will persistently denied doing anything special but in truth he was puffed over the turnabout he had been able to effect in the encounter with halliday he was not however at all pleased that the willard cat had been let out of the bag even his office staff was surprised and amused that he was not a william it didnt help that the classic horror flick that had initially caused his dubbing as ratboy had not too long ago been remade and to generally favorable reviews as well as he flipped through a dozen excited emails mostly from hippocrates society colleagues will wondered if he had ever even bothered telling the twins his true given name most likely he acknowledged even if he hadnt maxine had found a way in addition to the article mimi had dutifully left a copy of the days appointment schedule on his desk patient visits sandwiched about the removal of a large fatty tumor from a womans back were light this was exactly the mellow stressfree day he would have prescribed for himself after an evening that hadnt ended until nearly two in the morning he was scanning the list of patients when he remembered the card detective sergeant patricia moriarity had given him along with the request that he call her he had little doubt she wanted to speak to him about the managedcare murders others in the hippocrates society had already been questioned he took the card from his wallet and studied it absently as he thought about the woman in all likelihood there had been a shoulder holster and pistol under her vest except for the one time a friend had dragged him to a firing range he had never even held a real handgun patricia moriarity lived by one he gave a moments thought to calling her then wedged the card alongside his desk blotter protruding out as a reminder this just wasnt the time he wanted to be grilled about serial killings and his views on managed care dr grant its mimi could you come out here please will did as the intercom requested and found grace penggrace davis he rememberedseated alone in an otherwise empty waiting room he was struck as he had been yesterday with the remarkable transformation in the woman who had essentially been a bag lady not that many years before do you have a moment to speak with me she asked quite obviously agitated and distressed sure come in to my office she settled into one of the two walnutstained danish modern chairs that jim katzs interiordecorator wife had chosen for each of the offices my insurance company is steadfast health she said ive done some business with them will hadnt actually had all that much contact with the company but he had operated on a number of patients whom they covered from what he recalled steadfast health was smaller than most of the hmos and for the most part more civil well they are refusing to allow you to do my surgery when did they say that he asked wondering if somehow last nights forum and the resulting publicity could have already had some undesirable fallout yesterday just in case there was some clause or other like the one they have requiring preapproval for everything i called them shortly after we got home from here to inform them about the change we wanted from dr hollister to you the woman who answered the phone checked around and then called me back to say they have a contract with excelsius health that includes the requirement that the referral surgeon is the only one allowed to operate on steadfast health patients will was stunned was this yet another managedcare game what do you mean contract he asked whats excelsius health got to do with this from what i was told when my primarycare doctor scheduled my mammogram steadfast health is too small to have cancer centers the way excelsius health does so their patients are xrayed at the excelsius mammography clinics and if they need it theyre treated at the excelsius cancer centers then i guess steadfast health reimburses them somehow well this is just crazy will said im on the provider panels for both steadfast health and excelsius even though he chose not to add excelsius had tried several times in the past to have him removed from their provider list for various technicalities including failure to get a form in on time no matter what grace said my husband and i have decided that we want you to do my biopsy even if we have to pay for it ourselves we have some money saved and stop right there this is absolute nonsense you arent going to have to pay for this yourselves the oversize manila folder with graces mammograms in it was still propped against his desk from the previous evening it was ironic and somewhat amusing that he had completely missed the excelsius health label in the upper left corner briefly he scanned the films once more the cancer was as he rememberednot huge but in truth indisputable biopsying the lesion would be technically simple as would be its removal provided there were no local lymph nodes with cancer in them if the cancer had spread to the nodesa part of the system draining foreign matter from the bodya meeting with the oncologist would be worth having to decide whether removing the lump or the upper outer quadrant of the breast would be statistically the best way to go charles newcomber was the radiologist who had read the mammogram dictated his reading and subsequently referred his patient to susan emphasizing his title to the excelsius cancer center operator will had no problem getting patched through to the man who had a rather highpitched voice and a fairly pronounced british accent dr newcomber will said after introducing himself im here with a mrs grace davis who had a set of mammograms that you correctly read as showing probable cancer well im certainly relieved at being deemed correct about such a thing oops im sorry doctor i hope you know thats not what i meant i really do apologize will expected the man to say something that would help ease his discomfiture but there was only silence from the radiologist i um the problem im calling about is that you referred mrs davis to dr susan hollister who is one of my partners yes well it turns out that mrs davis and i have a history together that goes back more than ten years how sweet newcomber said will sensed his neck redden but held his tongue in check newcomber was part of the excelsius health family it was quite possible he was aware of the forum and its aftermath perhaps he had even been there dr newcomber mrs davis is here with me right now she would like me to perform her surgery i have spoken with dr hollister and she has no problem with the change im afraid that isnt possible what dr grand first of all this cancer center has an approved list of consultants from which we select a surgeon based on our patients hometown and any sexual preference dr hollister is on that list you sir are not secondly i have made it a point to personally get to know any surgeon to whom i make a referral i dont know you at all if mrs davis has a problem with that i suggest she make an appointment to come in and share her concerns with me will could barely speak dr newcomber he managed who is your supervisor i am the supervisor sir came the acid reply well youre not the boss will shot and my names grant not grand he slammed the receiver down a call to information gave him the number of the headquarters of excelsius health he and boyd halliday had mixed it up yesterday and will was more than ready for another go theres no way theyre going to get away with this he muttered as much to himself as to grace excelsius health the leader in costeffective comprehensive health care how may i direct your call this is dr grant mr hallidays office please one moment boyd hallidays office may i help you this is dr will grant may i speak with mr halliday please dr willard grant from last evening thats right um just a moment please for nearly two minutes will sat with the phone pressed to his ear listening to a spanish flamenco guitar piece and looking across at grace her transformation while certainly remarkable was not the only one of its kind he had encountered over his years as a physician and as a volunteer at the open hearth he had known a number of alcoholics and drug addicts who had failed at rehab again and again only to suddenly get it and become straight and sober forces for good in their own lives and the lives of many others his own dentist had survived a horrible stretch of drinking during which he was hospitalized more than two dozen times in a tenyear period now twenty years into recovery the man was something of a saint practicing his craft with wonderful skill while helping countless men and women in and out of his profession to face their demons and prevail dr grant yes marshall gold here mr halliday is at an allday conference is there anything i can do to help you the time spent on hold had done nothing to help will calm down barely pausing to breathe he recounted the situation with grace davis and his disturbing conversation with charles newcomber i am on the provider panel for both steadfast health and excelsius he railed and so there is absolutely no reason to prevent me from caring for this woman dr grant i promise you if boyd halliday doesnt intercede in this case and set matters straight hed better be watching the news and reading the papers because i wont hesitate to bring grace davis to them and dr grant gold repeated calmly what were sorry for the confusion we have no problem honoring mrs daviss request to switch to you for her surgeon you dont no sir but newcomber the arrangement we have with steadfast health has from time to time generated some confusion im sorry that you of all physicians on the day after the faneuil hall forum of all days have been caught up in it hopefully in the very near future steadfast health and excelsius will be merging and such misunderstandings will be eliminated altogether the freight train of wills anger screeched to an immediate halt you can speak for halliday on this matter as i said you are not the first physician to be caught up in this sort of situation so long as you are a provider on our panel which i most certainly know you are you have been screened in depth by our credentialing committee and have been deemed to be a quality physician i well thank you mr gold thank you very much mrs davis will be very pleased to hear that is there anything else no no i guess not dr grant i assure you we are not the soulless moneygrubbing monsters you have worked so hard to portray us as maybe youre not will replied distantly he set the receiver down softly so i guess youre my surgeon grace said i guess i am i dont know why im sitting here feeling like a jerk when i didnt even do anything but stick up for our rights the company made the offensive call then the company took it away its as simple as that its as simple as that except that you have passion for your profession and your patients and dont want to have that stolen away from you she stood and set copies of the mornings globe and herald on his desk ill make an appointment for you to examine me and speak to me and my husband about whats in store for us and also to schedule the biopsy with any luck youll get to help save my life a second time im not sure i subscribe to this one but an ancient chinese belief is that if you save someones life you are responsible for that person and what she does with the rest of her life having presumably cheated the fates out of an intended victim if thats really true i would wager you have quite a number of souls on your plate before he could respond she reached across the desk briefly took his hand in hers and was gone leaving the faintest scent of something springlike swirling in the air will checked the mornings schedule once again he still had ten precious minutes to review lab reports and dictations and to sign the stack of payment requisitions for those companies who refused to allow a rubber stamp proxy or any signature other than his in black ink two minutes into the ten his private direct linethe line reserved for family close friends and other physiciansbegan ringing dr grant the voice was tinnymechanical and roboticthe sort of distorted disembodied computergenerated voice that telemarketers were using more and more to announce that you had just been chosen to receive three free days and two free nights at one of orlandos newest resorts or to ask you to call for the absolute lowest mortgage rates possible even if you have been refused credit in the past only this call had come in on a number that none but the most dogged resourceful telemarketing firm could ever have obtained will resisted the impulse simply to hang up who is this he asked is this dr grant the totally creepy voice asked again it is now who is this what do you want you did well last night dr grant very well use your regular voice or im hanging up will managed though with less force than he had intended all in good time we are very proud of you doctor very proud these companies have got to be made to pay for all those they have killed will sank back in his chair stunned at the notion that this might be the one who had recently murdered three people however within just a second or two his surgeons mentality kicked in and was demanding action he snatched up a pen and wrote the callers words down as closely as he could remember are you responsible for the killings he asked searching his thoughts for any other action he should be taking aside from staying focused and prolonging the conversation as long as possible he could think of nothing along the margin of the paper he wrote man woman halting speech on purpose we not i we not i several times this is war the voice said in war people die these corporations earn millions off the blood of the innocent you implied as much last night now you are one of us you are our brother in this wara fellow soldier if you need us we will be there for you if we need you we expect your cooperation top drawer of your deskback left corner we are counting on you to deliver the message that we are engaged in a holy war to avenge the innocent there was a click and an instant later a dial tone will continued writing furiously until he was certain that most of the chilling diatribe was on paper finally he scanned the transcript his handwriting was deplorable under the best of circumstances and would have been the butt of office jokes had not gordo camerons been even worse carefully he reprinted those words that were particularly illegible then his palms unpleasantly damp he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and peered down at the contents in the back left on top of the usual melange of letters articles notepads photographs prescription pads paper clips writing implements and scattered surgical instruments was a plain white businesssize envelope with the flap tucked in not sealed inside were two pieces of white index cards each three inches square a c was printed on one with some kind of marker an n was printed on the other aware that he had done the wrong thing by touching the envelope at all will carefully replaced the letters and set the envelope back where it was in his desk then with an unpleasant gnawing in his gut he slid patricia moriaritys business card to the center of his blotter and called chapter six minutes after will ended his conversation with patricia moriarity two uniformed state policemen sirens blaring arrived at the fredrickston medical arts building and began the process of sealing it off there were at least a dozen different practices of varying specialties in the building in addition to a pharmacy an optician and a bagel store will knew that for at least the rest of the morning there would be massive inconvenience for all of them susan was doing a case in the hospital and jim katz had the day off but gordo had arrived in his office while will was speaking with grace davis now he was stuck there and not at all pleased about it arms folded his bulk threatening to overwhelm his desk chair he stroked his beard and gaped over at will in disbelief willy now tell me again he said just what are ye doin consorting with a murderer hey youve got it backward gordo its him or her or them or iti couldnt even tell for chrissakesthats consorting with me because of the things i said at the forum last night the bastard has decided that im a kindred spirit of hisa brother in the war against managed care is how he put it in fact i had this feeling while i was listening to him that he might have actually been there last night that gives me the williesor maybe out of deference to you i should say the creeps how could they have gotten into this building and then into your office i was hoping you might be able to come up with a theory to explain that well given the crack security company that watches over this place my guess is an entire terrorist cell could be operating here every night without being noticed you might be right think we ought to try and get in touch with jim i cant imagine something like this happening and him not wanting to know about it in case you hadnt noticed hes a wee bit of a control freak ill have mimi try and find him at that instant the receptionist called in over the intercom dr cameron would you tell dr grant that detective moriarity is out here looking for him consider it done lass do us a favor and see if ye can locate dr katz her expression businesslike patricia moriarity shook wills hand then motioned him over to the corner of the waiting room farthest from the receptionist she was wearing a black hiplength leather jacket over dark slacks and a light blue sweater will couldnt help but notice that the only ring she wore was on the third finger of her right hand dr grant the crimescene people will be here any moment to go over your office is there a place we can speak in private we have two empty physicians offices either one would be fine you choose will led her to susans consultation room which was on the side of the suite directly opposite gordos the size and setup of the room were nearly identical to wills but the modern art on the wall and extra touches susan had added to the basic decorcurtains with a repeating parisian street scene and a small reading table by the bookshelfmade it quite distinctively hers moriarity pulled one of the patients chairs away from the desk and motioned will to the other then she flipped open a notepad and slid a governmentissue pen from the wire dr grant she began with no pleasantries or even a mention that they had met just twelve hours before what on earth were you thinking when you pulled that envelope out of your desk and opened it before calling me will took a few seconds to stabilize himself i i think i was so bewildered and frightened by the call that i wasnt really thinking straight and there was nothing about the callers voice that you recognized it was totally mechanical in fact whoever it was might have been typing the words into a computer that then read them over the phone that technology is available even when she was writing patty kept her eyes on grant despite what she had learned of the manhis temper his history of violence his suspected though apparently never documented association with an explosion that had killed a manhe had a vulnerability and sensitivity about him that seemed real she reminded herself that if sociopaths had a major it was gentleness and genuinenessjust ask those who knew charming ted bundy or john wayne gacy who dressed as a clown to entertain hospitalized children as far as she was concerned until proven otherwise this man was a suspect in three violent murders will forced himself to remain calm as moriarity grilled him about his whereabouts at the time each of the three managedcare executives was killed he expected the questionseven without a phone call like the one he had just received others in the hippocrates society had been interviewedbut not the icy disbelieving tone in which they were delivered even with the help of his calendar the firmest alibi he could come up with was that on the nights of two of the murdersmorales and risinghe was on call in the hospital of course he was forced to admit with his pager he could just as easily have been outside the hospital as in if there was an emergency requiring his immediate presence there might have been a problem but in most situations he could have bought some time by giving instructions to the nurses and the resident on duty the morning of cyrill davenports execution he was at home trying as usual when he wasnt on call to catch up on lost sleep after writing down his responses moriarity again took him step by step through the minutes preceding during and following the eerie call she was clinical if not cold and even the most innocent attempt on his part to inject anything light or personal was immediately stonewalled it did not take long before the fact that she had the sort of scrubbed earthy good looks that most appealed to him was lost in the chill of her interrogation and in the realization that she did not believe his only connection to the murderer was through the phone call dr grant tell me again why you think there is more than one killer she asked will consulted his notes and read off each time the words we or us were spoken by the caller you have no idea how the killer could have gotten your private inside line none at all its not like its the combination to fort knox though people do have the number and you have no idea how the killer or someone associated with the killer could have gotten into your office the maintenance people in this building probably make eightfifty an hour it wouldnt take much to get one of them to put the envelope in my desk hell with what i earn it wouldnt take much to bribe me into doing it theres nothing funny about this dr grant and theres nothing funny about you insinuating that i might have murdered three people he snapped back did you no why would i call you about a phone call that never happened and put that envelope in my desk crazy is its own definition doctor sooner or later most serial killers need attention and many of them also need to prove that they are smarter than we are thats when games like claiming you received a call from the killer begin im not crazy and i didnt kill anyone should i have a lawyer here if you want one at that moment wayne brasco appeared at the doorway looking like he just rode into dodge he was wearing jeans with a wide handtooled belt cinched with a massive silver horseshoe buckle a suede jacket and alligator cowboy boots he glared first at patty then at will why didnt you call me about this he snapped gesturing to the office in general jesus patty felt herself flush at being rebuked in front of someone let alone a suspect you were out of the office when i got the call from dr grant here about the alphabet letters i felt we needed to get right down here so i called the crimelab people and i told tomasetti to get a hold of you didnt he patty flashed on the notes in her shoulder bag dealing with will grants past originally she had decided to keep the information to herself until she could investigate the charges in more detail and see if there was anything else on the man between the explosion in the lab at medical school and the restraining order taken out against him by his wife now with the phone call and the envelope whether real or concocted by grant himself things had changed the longer she held information back from brasco the worse it was going to be for her this grant brasco growled pointedly ignoring her question about tomasetti patty groaned inaudibly and introduced the two men lieutenant brasco is in charge of the investigation of the managedcare murders she explained disgusted with herself for trying to mollify the jerk at all brasco made no attempt to shake hands so whats this all about he asked will i um ive been interviewing him patty said evenly so now ill interview him thats what officers in charge are supposed to do will looked over at patty embarrassed for her he wasnt the most socially aware being on the planet but he certainly knew a boor when he saw one i need to speak with you first wayne so speak in private they left will in susan hollisters office and found a spot in the waiting room out of earshot from the crimescene people and the two uniformed officers who were keeping the office staff from getting in anyones way patty considered beginning on the offensive by demanding that brasco apologize for his behavior in front of will grant and also by reminding him of his failure to call her from cyrill davenports place instead she propped herself against the wall extracted her notes and ran through them she could tell from brascos hardly subtle expression that she should have brought up her research at their team meeting with lieutenant court brasco was a pigheaded brute but he was hardly stupid stick a fork in patty folks it looks like shes done she was thinking so brasco said when she had finished let me get this straight you uncovered this guy with a recurrent history of violence connection to a murder committed by some sort of socialaction group and current active membership in another socialaction group that just happens to hate hmos and you didnt feel this information was relevant enough to share with the rest of us i um wanted to dig into things a little deeper beforewell yes yes thats exactly what happened brasco raised his hands in a suit yourself gesture ill take over interrogating this suspect from here he said mind if i listen in i think youve done enough for one day why dont you interview the staff we can discuss this whole business with jack later on youre in charge patty said youre damn right i am brasco replied errtbecn deflated by this latest round with wayne brasco patty mulled over the two new letters as she gathered her things and prepared to leave the offices of fredrickston surgical associates they had to be part of a multipleword messagea saying a place a company name she was the last of the investigating crew remaining but she was reluctant to go sensing that her involvement in the managedcare murders might soon be over you can only do what you can do sister she reminded herself you can only do what you can do the world was full of wayne brascos and jack courts if she was going to make it she would have to learn how to deal with them well the hell with them she thought heading for the door if they want me off this case theyre going to have to pry me off sergeant will grant stood just a few feet behind her yes do you have a couple of minutes in addition to the stack of reports she had to write covering the past few hours there was a session scheduled at the office with lieutenant court and the other principals in the managedcare case im in a bit of a rush perhaps its very important something you didnt tell detective brasco something i chose not to tell him the vulnerability in his eyes made her uneasy she reminded herself again about the ingratiating charm of sociopaths i suppose i can listen you know were wary of people who try and drive a wedge between members of an investigating team we call it splitting forgive me for saying it will replied but it didnt seem to me as if lieutenant brasco was treating you as a teammate is your office empty will settled in behind his desk patty took the chair directly across from him that was a very frightening session i had with your teammate will began i would bet that hes not a legend on the force for his subtlety he has other strengths he thinks i killed those people did you i fix people i play with my twins every chance i get and i work at a soup kitchen that i helped start and when people are broken or hurting i fix them thats reassuring to hear patty said realizing that at some level it was lieutenant brasco came in armed with a number of items from my past i dont like the man at all but i have to admit he did an amazing amount of homework in a very short time and he didnt do enough did you tell him he was so aggressive that i was afraid to say a word to him about myself without having a lawyer and i cant even afford to get the squeaky brakes on my car looked at let alone hire a lawyer you may have to i sure hope not thats why i wanted to speak to you you should have spoken to lieutenant brasco do you know about the information he had about me yes i i know about it the restraining order my wife took out on me yes will withdrew a file from the bottom drawer of his desk i admit i have a bit of a temper he said but maxine my ex makes me look like a puppy shes capable of going off like a volcano the night our neighbor called the police she had gone absolutely berserk for almost no reason she threw a pot and a vase through the window but wouldnt admit to doing it in fact when the police came she insisted that i did it at the officers insistence she requested the restraining order neither the police nor the court wanted to hear my side of the story he passed the file over the day after maxine filed the restraining order she had it rescinded our marriage counselor insisted on it because maxine told her the truth in case i ever needed it which i havent two of our closest friends wrote notarized letters stating that they had been present at times when max went off at me almost as violently as she did that night fortunately she has never blown up like that against the kids in fact they say shes done much better at controlling her temper since her lover moved in with her patty scanned the documents which were impressive she knew that in the case of restraining orders the police and courts invariably sided with the wife until matters could be sorted out generally speaking the policy was as it should be but there were still times when husbands were penalized unjustly there were other issues as well she said sensing some thawing of her feelings toward the man as well as some guilt that it was she who had failed to dig deeper before passing over the information about him to brasco an arrest in college for assaulting a police officer we were protesting the firing of a black faculty member will said wearily the man i shoved was campus police he wouldnt stop prodding us with his nightstick he pushed me i pushed back he got his feet tangled up and fell there were like a hundred witnesses eventually when the truth came out he was put on probation he produced another file from his desk this one considerably thicker than the other labeled medical license renewals i put this stuff together because when we apply for a medical license or renewal the form asks about arrests in addition to documentation of the incident outside the deans office there was extensive material dealing with a fight in medical school that resulted in wills arrest and subsequent exoneration the guy was psychotic will explained he was also tougher than i was and he beat the snot out of me six months later he got expelled for cheating and repeated acts of violence you seem to bring out the worst in people i guess you might say that but thankfully there are those who would disagree with you one more thing patty said the lab will rolled his eyes in frustration brasco almost took my head off over that but it was like the moment he saw my name and the word murder together in some computer search he stopped looking patty used the tip of her tongue to moisten her lips which had become unpleasantly dry go on she said i was a social activist all the way through school heck i would be more of one now too if i had the chance in med school we formed an organization for protest mostly against the pharmaceutical industry for giving medical equipment to impoverished students with their company logo on it we named our group after a comic bookthe justice leaguebut we never really did much because we were just too busy trying to survive med school shortly after the lab explosion some unnamed source told a reporter that it was us but it wasnt no he said it wasnt the newspaper chose to shoot first and ask questions later just like your lieutenant brasco it wasnt brasco it was me did they ever find out who did it a phd who had been booted out of the lab because of doctoring some research results and costing them a big grant it was in the papers i dont have the article but ill bet it wouldnt be hard to find ill bet it wouldnt patty said glumly pardon nothing she said i mumble sometimes so do i get to keep all this to show lieutenant brasco ill make copies and send them to you i have your card make the copies and just hang on to them patty said if as you say the killer really has adopted you to be his public voice well be seeing each other again very soon id like that very much will said for the first time there was a glint of mischief in his eyes for the first time patty didnt avert hers chapter if you didnt do anything then you dont have anything to worry about will wondered how many times he had heard that maxim from his parents or how many times he had used it on his own kids if you didnt do anything you dont have anything to worry about well he hadnt done anything other than pick up the receiver so why was he feeling so worried the answer to that question was of course that three wealthy powerful corporate executives had been murdered and the police were under intense pressure to arrest someone motive opportunity method delightful lieutenant brasco had latched on to him like a mastiff on a bone hitting over and over on the fact that will scored high on two of the three suspect requirements and as for the third the mastiff was quick to point out anyone could pull a trigger and almost anyone could go online for a few hours and learn how to blow someone up why dont you just save us all some time and hassle and tell us you did it so we can reassure the public and get you some muchneeded help why would i go out of my way to plant those alphabet cards in my desk dont make me answer that dr grant at the end of the morning after will had shared his documentation with patty moriarity it seemed to him as if she might be a small port in the gathering storm but even if she did believe he was being used by the killer it was doubtful she had much clout brasco didnt seem to care much about how she felt one way or the other to no ones surprise will was on call again both for the group and as backup for the er the evening was pleasantly hectic a code at eleven had the emergency physician backed up so will waded in suturing both the winner and loser of a tavern brawl evaluating a woman with belly pain and even stabilizing a child with a febrile seizure until the pediatrician arrived the busy pace helped keep his mind from drifting too much to the chilly electronic voice and the notion of what it must take to coldbloodedly kill a person let alone three patty had told him the significance of the two letters in the envelope and had disclosed the other six after extracting the promise that he would share the information with no one at various breaks in the evening he tried playing around with the eight letters but nothing leapt out at him that made any sense at two oclock suddenly drained he made his way up to the surgical oncall room and dropped facefirst onto the bed when the jangling phone shattered a bizarre xrated dream featuring a scantily clad greeneyed brunette with a shoulder holster he had been deeply asleep for three uninterrupted hours remarkable the switchboard operator apologetically reminded him that he had asked for a fivefifteen wakeup call just before he tarnished his reputation by calling her insane he remembered his eightoclock case if it was possible to call anyone with cancer of the pancreas lucky kurt goshtigian qualified in general by the time pancreatic cancer caused any symptoms it was too late for anything except condolences and maybe some palliative chemotherapy but goshtigians tumor had been diagnosed by accident on a ct scan done after a beam swung loose on the construction site where he was working and struck him in the lower chest there was nothing more than a deep bruise from the impact of the beam but an incidental finding still wellcontained in the portion of the pancreas referred to as the head was a cancer now a week later will was about to cure that cancer through the surgical approach known as a whipple procedure he showered dressed in a fresh set of scrubs and paid his customary earlymorning visit to the er lounge for coffee oj and a doughnut with the soondeparting nightshift crew he was surprised to find gordo there powdered sugar still flecked in his beard like christmas snow he was regaling the nurses with one of his trademark jokesthe one dealing with lan macgregor seated at his usual spot at the bar deeply and morosely in his cups and of course speaking in the heaviest of brogues see that pier out there macgregor says i built that pier so do they call me macgregorthepierbuilder noooo and that shed over there i built that too do they call me macgregortheshedbuilder noooo and and that stone wall out there i set every single one of them stones in place myself so am i known as macgregorthestonesetter noooo but fuck one lousy goat will joined in the laughter even though he had heard the joke enough to qualify as an expert on it camerons delivery was hilarious enough to make it fresh every time gordo what are you doing here at this ungodly hour kristins snoring woke me up she swears it was me waking us both up in addition to the neighbors and a bunch of them in the cemetery down the street but i know better since the powers that be are about to put me on probation for not getting my discharge summaries dictated and since im going to be spending twenty or thirty hours assisting you with that whipple i thought i would come on in and get caught up kristins like a hundred and fifteen pounds will told the crew somehow i cant imagine her snoring any louder than a sparrow if she ever even snores at all my moneys on the scotsman here did you guys save me my jelly stick we practically had to pry it out of dr camerons hands with a crowbar a nurse said but there it is hey gordo you know jelly sticks my lucky doughnut i cant start a big case like this whipple without having had one mea culpa cameron said but excuse me for pointing out that its the poor slob youre operating on that needs the luck good point will knew he wasnt kidding himself about the jelly stick for as long as he could remember he had been a creature of lucky maneuvers and talismans of lucky shirts and rituals although his superstitions didnt run so deep as to paralyze him or even alter his life very much he did cling to certain routines and clothing when playing poker with his friends in their monthly game or when preparing to do a case in the or after fifteen minutes of small talk and another scottish joke cameron headed off to the dictation carrels in the record room and will made his way to the medical library the whipple he was about to perform on kurt goshtigian was among the most complicated of surgical procedures developed in the thirties the technique was necessitated because the pancreas is anatomically not clearly separated from the gi structures surrounding itthe gallbladder the duodenum segment of the small intestine the bile duct and often the stomach as well after the cancerous head of the pancreas and parts of the other organs were removed the remaining portions would be sutured back to the small intestine to restore continuity and function gordos sarcastic reference to wills painstaking timeconsuming technique in the or notwithstanding if things went well the operation would take four to six hours and the result would be a cure will had performed or first assisted on fifteen or so whipples over the yearscertainly enough to feel confident about the procedure still the technique and anatomy were complex and variable enough to warrant reviewing them before stepping into the arena it was crucial before beginning the whipple to examine the area thoroughly using a laparoscope in order to be as convinced as possible that there was no cancer outside the head of the pancreas evidence that the disease had spread to local organs or the inner wall of the abdomen would mean that it was essentially incurable and would strongly if not absolutely mitigate against a procedure as extensive as this one after forty minutes of review and actually performing the operation in his mind will felt energized and ready he called the twins to wish them a good day and to review the plans for the rest of their weekend together then he made rounds on his three hospitalized patients and finally headed up to the or suite in the east wing of the second floor thanks to a huge gift from a grateful familys trust the surgeons dressing room like the ors was stateoftheartplushly carpeted with three private showers and a steam room following a routine from which he seldom if ever varied will left his wallet and watch on the shelf of his locker laced up his red converse chuck taylors left foot first pulled disposable shoe covers over them right foot first tied on a hair cover then a mask and finally slipped on the glasses and magnifying loupes he only used in the or next for five minutes he sat eyes closed breathing deeply and slowly making no real attempt at clearing extraneous thoughts from his mind but willing himself to relax and thanking god for the opportunity and skill to be a surgeon by the time he was ready to enter the scrub room he was experiencing a most pleasant calmness and euphoria they were sensations he had come to expect although this one was even more intense than what he was accustomed to kurt goshtigian was just being wheeled up to the or when will entered the scrub room gordo already scrubbed and gowned was on the other side of the glass or door along with a surgical resident who would do the prep and drape on goshtigians abdomen will hurried past the scrub sinks and out of the narrow room and caught up with his patients stretcher actually bumping into it just as it reached the or goshtigian was a solid weathered fiftyfouryearold with tattoos on his muscular forearms and over his deltoids his coarse black hair was graying and his silver stubble suggested he hadnt shaved for a couple of days will pulled his mask down and apologized to the man for bashing into him im pretty sure ive never done that before he said wondering if maybe he shouldnt have broken his routine by rushing out of the scrub room goshtigian drymouthed and groggy from the preop meds smiled up weakly and patted will on the arm youre just excited about getting to muck around with my innards he said were going to get that cancer out of you kurt and youre going to be as good as goo you mean new pardon you said goo when you mean new will had no idea what the man was talking about probably the preop meds he decided yes he said well if youre ready im going to go scrub in my partner dr cameron is there in waiting for you ill be in soon will replaced his mask and headed back into the scrub area the wonderfully pleasant sense of wellbeing and connection to his world had if anything grown more intense he was halfway through a fourminute scrub when he realized that he had broken his routine again this time by taking the hexachloropheneimpregnated brush to his right arm and hand before his left strange no big deal but strange just the same when he backed out through the scrubroom door and then into the or kurt goshtigians abdomen was already washed shaved prepped with an antiinfective and covered with sterile drapes carrie patel the best anesthesiologist on the staff was in the process of putting him to sleep with a nurses help will slipped into a gown had it tied behind him then drove his hands one at a time into latex gloves taking pains to do the left hand first as usual gordo was talking almost nonstop so lad are ye all boned up on the whipple the mans first name was allen you know allen whipple now theres a piece of trivia for you beneath his mask will smiled at his partner even though he realized he wasnt picking up everything gordo was rambling on about it was always good to work with him in the or for one thing he was skilled and quick as a surgeon and intuitive as an assistant and for another his demeanor kept the team loose and upbeat even through the most grueling cases the initial laparoscopic evaluation went smoothly and showed what will had prayed it wouldno evidence for spread of cancer into the organs adjacent to the pancreas throughout the procedure though will sensed a very mild fuzziness to his thinking and he also noticed that on and off especially with fine movements his hands shook ever so slightly low blood sugar he wondered he had eaten as usual so the possibility seemed remote a virus of some sort no symptoms to go along with the mild lightheadedness in fact on the whole he still felt upbeat and positive ready everyone well okay numberten blade please beth again please the scrub nurse asked will felt a spark of irritation i called for a ten a numberten blade there was more of an edge to his voice than he had intended the nurse in turn glaring at him from above her mask slapped the blade into his palm with more force than usual for her across the table from will cameron immediately reacted to the rocky start okay willy he said acutting we shall go the incision will made though quite large was precisely the length he had planned after bleeders were clamped and cauterized he sliced open the peritoneal membrane exposing the structures beneath so far so good except that will was beginning to sense things werent good at all he was feeling nauseated now and his lightheadedness was more constant for the first time he wondered if he was going to be able to continue with the operation using large clamps and retractors he and cameron pulled the margins of the incision wide apart the intestines arrayed just beneath where the peritoneum had been were moved aside with damp towels exposing the bloodtinged structures of the operative field glistening under the harsh saucer lights overhead wills mouth now felt desert dry he peered down at the organspancreas stomach liver gallbladderand at the arteries veins nerves and ducts servicing each one in his mind he had mapped out almost every second of this procedure now he couldnt remember where he was to start everything okay there willy cameron asked will glanced up at him from over his mask i all of a sudden im not feeling so good you need a basin need to step away huh will look over at me kara take those glasses off him let me see his eyes im okay just need moment to will felt the lightheadedness intensify and a profound dizziness set in as well his knees became rubbery and his vision began to darken he tried to speak but only guttural sounds emerged from beneath his mask clutching at the sterile drape he lurched to one side then pitched forward heavily landing facedown in the gaping incision chapter the inestimable blackness was pierced by soundgarbled voices captured by wills gradually increasing consciousness next came the ghastly sensation of chokinga tube the size of a redwood clogging his throat will tried to move his arms but met immediate resistance at the wrists from his earliest days as a med student in the hospital he had watched patients be intubated and put on a ventilatorsome comatose some semiconsciousand wondered what it could possibly have felt like he had even asked some of them after they were on the way to recovery and had concluded that the degree of helplessness pain and horror of the situation was a function purely of how much medication they had received from time to time especially with emphysema cases the relief of being able to get in enough air made the breathing tube tolerable but mostly the discomfort was quite frightening especially in the initial hours before there was any chance to learn to cope will knew he would never again have to ask a patient about the sensation he thrust his tongue against the hard rubber airway that had been slipped into his mouth next to the tube and then taped in place to keep him from biting down awareness was rapidly returning along with swirling memories of becoming sick terribly sick in the or he must have stopped breathing or come damn close the fact that the discomfort and panic seemed manageable suggested he was being medicated was this the first time he had been awake with no little effort he forced his eyelids apart even before his focus sharpened he knew that he was in the icu the fluorescent lights over him were midday bright across the cubicle two nurses were talking was it a stroke he wondered is that what had happened to him a cerebral hemorrhage of some sort methodically he tested his hands and arms then his feet and legs no problem moving anything the incision he had gotten horribly dizzy and toppled over into the incision he could envision the blood and the coils of intestine as he pitched downward toward them but there the images stopped how long had he been out what happened to his patient he opened his eyes wider as his consciousness grew so did the suffocating discomfort in his throat he also became aware of another unpleasant sensationthe desperate need to pee easy easy he told himself there was no way he could have been unconscious on a respirator in the icu and not have had a catheter inserted to drain his bladder easy the pressure and urgency was almost as dreadful as the tube he had never been a hospitalized patient before now he wondered if he had been sympathetic enough with those who were the nurses were two whom he knew well anne hajjar and donna lee he banged the back of his hand against the guardrail donna rushed over clearly pleased to see him awake sharp features and closecut blond hair she was a new wife in her late thirties and a hardened veteran of the icu wars like the other unit nurses she called all but the most unapproachable physicians by their first name will hi there its donna welcome to the land of the living will nodded that he understood are you in any pain he twisted his hand and pointed toward the tube ken millstein is taking care of you your blood gases are looking pretty good so maybe hell be able to pull that tube out after all the labs are back meanwhile we can keep you medicated will shook his head no no medication i can handle this just not too long okay but you sort of woke up a little while ago and started tearing at the tube thats why we medicated you and put those restraints on i understand go after the tube again like that and well have to beat you with a stick do you know what happened to you no apparently you had a seizure of some sort while you were doing a case you immediately lost consciousness and then a few minutes later you stopped breathing altogether you were rushed down to the er and they put the tube in there your ekg is normal so it doesnt look like a coronary and your chest xray doesnt show any sign of aspiration is there anything you need right now will wriggled the fingers on both hands and pointed back at the restraints anne anne hajjar willowy browneyed and eternally lighthearted materialized at the opposite side of the bed from donna and squeezed wills hand of all the nurses in the hospital she was his favorite hey big boy were glad youre coming around she said we were a little worried when they dragged you in here he wants the restraints off donna said i told him if he pulled that tube out it would not go well for him i suspect it would be the last thing that shape he ever pulled anne said undoing the velcro cuff and strap on her side as soon as the restraints were removed will brought his hands together and pretended to be writing on an imaginary pad donna left and quickly returned with a stack of progressnote paper on a clipboard and a bic pen at that moment internist ken millstein moved in next to anne he was a slight harvardtrained doc about wills age but half a foot shorter with a rapidly receding hairline and a penchant for baggy suits he and will and their wives had been friends from their earliest days at fredrickston general and the millsteins had been one of the very few couples who hadnt found it necessary to side with one or the other of them after the divorce eventful day millstein said i guess will wrote how long have i been here two hours give or take you had us worried for a while there how is my patient gordon is still in the or with him i think he called jim katz in to help finish the procedure apparently you got a ten from the russian judge for that dive you took very funny any idea what could have happened because i sure dont none i have never passed out before will you didnt just pass out you stopped breathing your blood pressure was heading south when steve edelstein in the er decided to go ahead and intubate you good man any medical history we should know about asthma as a child meds none feel okay now groggy no surprise there millstein checked wills pupils then examined his heart and lungs ill tell you what he said ive run so many labs that your hmo is probably going to put a bounty on my head as soon as i have most of them back ill get anesthesia in here and well pull that tube how about the catheter first the tube sorry you want the nurses to give you something just a little will wrote this time five of morphine donna repeat it as needed thanks just bear with us my friend millstein said were going to get to the bottom of this with the help of the intravenous morphine will drifted in and out of a comfortable haze at times he dreameda highspeed auto chase a greenfaced judge sentencing him to prison for something swimming in perfectly blue caribbean water alongside a woman who looked vaguely like patty moriarity at one point in the middle of a disturbing vignette in which his hands were about to be chopped off by someone he awoke to see gordo cameron looming over him greetings lad he said you sure gave me and the gang in the or one hell of a fright there im glad youre coming around howd you do with the case he should make it through the next few hours but thats all i can say at the moment jim came to the rescue and assisted we had to repair a couple of torn vessels then we went ahead and did the whipple he lost a fair amount of blood and dropped his pressure a couple of times did i tear the vessels your head hit the incision like a bloody meteor some vessels were bound to rupture but really it was manageable once we got the bleeding controlled we irrigated everything like crazy theres bound to be infection but thats what we have antibiotics and infectiousdisease specialists for plus you just dont look like someone with a lot of devil germs on his face what on earth do you think happened no idea well dont use up your energy writing we can talk after that tube comes out whos takin care of you millstein good man millstein a little scrawny by my standards but sharp well lad im going to head on over to the recovery room to check on our boy thanks gordo just dont ever do that again my poor knickers had to be permanently retired donna lee appeared and pulled cameron aside beyond wills field of vision i dont believe it will heard cameron say i dont will envisioned the nurse stopping cameron short with a finger to her lips he banged on the bed rail to get her attention whats up nothing donnas tone was icy dr millstein will be up to speak with you tube very uncomfortable could i have a little medication until he arrives hell be here before long just close your eyes and relax until he gets here and dont touch that tube the woman was gone before will could write anything further what could she have said that gordo didnt believe why was she refusing even a small amount of medication to help him deal with the tube why the sudden coldness he shifted his position in bed and tried as best he could to ignore the discomfort in his throat and bladder for a time he lay there trying to divert himself with thoughts of kurt goshtigian he had a decent enough patientphysician relationship with the man but their history was not a long one even if goshtigian fully recovered from his whipple procedure a lawyer could certainly make a good case for will having caused the need for additional surgery and powerful potentially lifethreatening antibiotics as well as prolonged time under anesthesia still no judge or jury could find him negligent when clearly some medical problem beyond his control or knowledge had caused the incident in the or will took pride in the fact that despite a highrisk specialty he had never yet been sued but he hardly took the fact for granted as a surgeon the specter of a malpractice action was always hovering not far away even without medication will began to drift off images of the or floated about for a time then gave way to a comforting darkness everything was going to be okay he told himself the diagnostic tests he would undergo over the days and weeks ahead would show no brain tumor no vascular anomaly within his skull no hemorrhage and no irregular cardiac rhythm the incident would be written off as a simple faint caused by a virus fatigue dehydration or factors never to be determined such a faint was known technically as vasovagal syncope the sort of physiologic reaction that commonly accompanied stresses such as horrible news or a grisly sight in such instances a sudden powerful discharge of electricity along the large vagus nerve caused rapid dilation of the veins in the abdomen and legs and marked pooling of blood in those vessels the resultant drop in blood pressure produced an instantaneous loss of consciousness fainting was the brains effort to protect its critical circulation by insisting that the body lie down vasovagal syncope will thought as sleep enfolded him yes thats it thats what theyre going to conclude will ken millstein stood by wills left hand standing beside millstein anne hajjar looked down at will with the stony impassivity of a sphinx on the right side of the bed was anesthesiologist ramon bustamante also looking grim will opened his eyes and managed a weak thumbsup to which neither the nurse nor the physicians reacted somethings wrong he thought somethings will dr bustamantes here to remove the tube after that well talk the philippine anesthesiologist moved forward and used a syringe to deflate the balloon cuff that held the tube in place below wills vocal cords the inflated cuff also prevented him from aspirating his stomach contents into his lungs mrs hajjar you have the backup tube ready bustamante asked right here you tested the balloon yes suction ready okay then doctor the anesthesiologist ordered unemotionally cough when i say so and now will coughed feebly and the redwood tree instantly vanished from his throat he sputtered and gagged as the nurse suctioned his mouth and throat with a hard plastic tube then eyes tearing he sagged back against the pillow sucking in drafts of sweet air bustamante listened to his chest assured himself that neither lung had collapsed then turned and left without a word anne hajjar slipped oxygen prongs into wills nostrils did a bloodpressure check nodded to millstein that it was satisfactory and quickly followed the anesthesiologist out of the cubicle for fifteen seconds millstein just stood there looking down at will feel able to talk he asked will cleared his throat as forcefully as he could manage sure he rasped nearly overcome now by apprehension okay ive gotten most of the lab work back including a comprehensive panel i requested for drugs of abuse that would be negative well you can say so will but it wasnt will felt his heart sink thats impossible you lit up for fentanyl will big time fentanylone of the most powerful of all narcotics it was used as a painkiller via a timerelease patch and in an iv to put patients to sleep in the or before they were intubated it was highly addictive and too often an instrument of death in those anesthesiologists who chose to experiment with it by sequentially pushing up the dose they injected into themselves i tell you thats impossible ive never taken any painkillers stronger than tylenol two different samples millstein said fentanyl confirmed in both of them by emergency gas chromatography and mass spectrophotometry large amounts were in your blood when you passed out will there is absolutely no doubt in anyones mind about that will found the bed control and raised himself upright this is absolutely insane i didnt take anything i dont see how that can be true millstein said evenly i can try and help you will but only if you tell the truth the chilliness of the nurses and the anesthesiologist was certainly explained fear and anger tightened the muscles at the base of wills skull a jet of bile rose in his throat youve known me for years ken youve got to believe me millstein shook his head slowly i dont know what to make of this will ive learned to repeat abnormal tests that dont fit and thats just what i did here but if i dont trust our lab when a test is repeated with the same results i might as well pack up and find another profession it wasnt my blood will said desperately again millstein shook his head will could see now the deep sadness in his eyes we ran a urine too straight from your catheter chainofcustody handling no breaks in the chain it was positive too strongly positive i might add and you know how rapidly fentanyl is cleared from the body will with all thats involved this is way beyond me ive reported everything to sid silverman and hes called the police theyll be here shortly if theyre not here already jesus will said silverman the president of the hospital was in bed with several managedcare companies and had been openly critical of the hippocrates society and will in particular im in no shape to deal with fucking silverman or the police let me out of here dammit ill sign out ama bring me the form he leaned forward then just as quickly fell back as a spear of pain thrust itself through one eye and out the back of his skull easy will no im out of here mindless of the iv lines and catheter will battled through the headache grabbed the side rails and pulled himself forward again scrambling toward the foot of the bed hands millstein cried out restraining him with surprising strength in seconds the room was full of uniformed bodies each trying to hold him down a hand clutching a filled syringe moved into wills sight helplessly he watched as the needle was slipped into a port of his iv and the syringe emptied moments later a gentle pleasant wave washed over him and he sank back into a dark welcoming sea chapter youve got to be kidding sergeant benois beane seated in a wellworn leather easy chair in his office stared across at patty shaking his head in utter disbelief its the truth his body was loaded with a very powerful narcoticone that doctors but not most other people would have easy access to from the moment they first shook hands patty liked the open hearth director there was an engaging openness to him and an appealing wisdom in his face that she guessed was born of hard times she had phoned him and driven over to the soup kitchen after a stop in the icu at fredrickston general shortly after she had been raked over the coals by wayne brasco and jack court for withholding the information about will grant from them a call from her father alerted her to the latest bizarre twist in the managedcare casethe drug overdose of their only suspect sitting in on the tense meeting with court and brasco had been sean digby a young eager detective who had come on board about six months after patty and been immediately accepted by the guys this was the first time digby had attended one of their skull sessions on this case and patty had no trouble figuring out why he was clearly being groomed to take her place should she falter any more and calling him in like this was a strident warning that she was skating on thin ice unwilling to make any moves without clearing them with both brasco and court she called the two men together and asked permission to go out and check on the situation at fredrickston general their response was predictable so what is this brasco exclaimed you called us in to tell us you want to go out and check on a guy in a coma whats next youll call a meeting if you want to blow your nose you know patty court added youve got to show more independence in this thing you dont have to check with us for everything you learn or dojust the important things no surprise she was damned if she involved the two of them and utterly damned if she didnt was it that she was a woman that she was her fathers daughter that she had a masters degree in criminal justice that she had an independent streak probably all of the above and none of the above and there was nothing she could do about it absolutely nothing except put one foot in front of the other and take the path that felt right quitting was not an option will was still sedated when patty arrived at the icu the nurses she spoke with seemed shocked about what had happened in the or and what had subsequently been discovered in his blood and urine but they were also disappointed and angry will grant certainly wasnt the first physician they had grown to love and respect who turned out to have a hidden problem with alcohol or drugs but he was the first one to have unveiled his shortcoming in such a spectacular way must have just gone for a little more of a thrill and overshot anne hajjar said with a matteroffactness that seemed blatantly forced patty did learn that absolutely none of the staff saw this one coming if will grant had any faults as a doc they were that he cared too much often hurt too deeply when things didnt go well and spent way too much time in the hospital otherwise as a physician and as a man he was the total package before this happened hajjar said we all thought dr grant was the catch of the year even though it seemed he never left the hospital long enough to date i expect hell have a good bit of free time now donna lee added i just hope he uses it to get some help more confused about will grant than ever patty had left the hospital and driven over to keep her appointment with benois beane whom she tracked down after discovering will had won an unsung hero award from the boston celtics for the work he did at the open hearth following her session with will in his office it was easy for her to believe he had no involvement in the managedcare slayings now however there could be no way around the fact that he had taken a potent narcotic and then attempted to perform surgery would the real will grant please stand up sergeant moriarity benois beane was saying we have twentyeight people who work here and a couple of hundred who volunteer regularly and probably know will grant id wager not one of them would believe he knowingly took drugs and went into the or let alone killed three people patty almost added but didnt i just dont get it then she said the drug was in his blood thats a given i dont care if it was in his body someone put it there tell me how i cant but i can sort of prove he doesnt take narcotics go on a few months ago maybe three one of our regulars sophie rennet died after a long battle with cancer will was her surgeon and did his best but the cancer had gone too far from the start it just so happened that one night when will was working here sophies family called to say that she had passed on will and i both went over to her place to pay our respects and for will to pronounce her dead so the mortuary could come and get her as we were leaving her son handed us a box containing her medications saying he hoped maybe someone else could use them inside were bottles and bottles and vials and vials of narcoticsall kinds of narcotics once we got back here will took a hammer to each of the vials and flushed the pills down the toilet i saw him do it but he could have just as easily told you he was taking the medicine back to his office exactly i have known a lot of addicts in my day a lot of addicts and not one of them would have thrown away such a stash i would think thats got to prove something patty thought of several rebuttals to beanes logic but she knew in her heart that none of them carried much clout are you sure hes awake it doesnt matter hes got to wake up sometime hospital president sid silvermans distinctive tenor worked its way into the darkness the other voice irritated and sardonic was donna lees the veteran nurse and silverman once an endocrinologist on the staff of fgh had known each other for years now they had something else in commona clear distaste for one will grant will tested his arms and legs and found that the wrist restraints were back in place shit i just came from the recovery room silverman was saying the guy looks bad real bad his blood pressure wont stay up theres talk about bringing him back into the or to open him up again and see if somethings bleeding thats terrible donna said youre damn right it is if he doesnt make it his family could end up owning this place i doubt theyd want it well go on in there we havent given him anything for a while so he should be pretty light will kept his eyes closed but sensed silverman approaching his bed he pictured the man glaring down at him his paunch stretching the vest of his trademark threepiece suit welcome to the icu sid he said keeping his eyes shut for a few more seconds then slowly opening them i dont suppose it matters to you but i didnt take any fentanyl it was in your blood and in your urine silverman said flatly do you have any explanation that i can give to the executive committee when they meet in an hour i didnt take anything listen can you crank me up halfway i dont like lying flat like this i feel like im on a slab getting ready to be sacrificed silverman hesitated then raised the head of the bed and while youre at it sid could you please tell the nurses to take these restraints off im not going to cause any trouble promise ill send the nurses in when im finished silverman said i asked if you had any explanation for how the fentanyl got into your body maybe someone put it in my breakfast everyone knows i have oj and a jelly stick on the days when i operate maybe someone injected it in there maybe youre also going to have to explain how two unopened vials of the stuff got into your locked locker in the surgeons lounge thats absurd the locker was opened and there was the fentanyl wrapped in a washcloth the same person who poisoned me put them there cant you see that and sid not that i have anything to hide but you had no right to open my locker without my permission i didnt open it will the police did they got a warrant very quickly your locker and your office and maybe your condo as well jesus sid cant you see that this is all a setup someones doing this to me someone who knows me pretty damn well or has made it their business to learn about me like the evil managedcare companies dont be snide i havent the strength or the inclination to deal with it right now okay then heres the situation im recommending to the executive committee that you be suspended from the staff immediately until this matter can be resolved i actually have the authority to do this myself but i want their support why dont you just ask me to take a weeks leave or something i promise i wont work until i get clearance from the executive committee besides dont suspensions have to be reported to the board of registration any change in privileges gets reported will you should use the time off to check yourself into a treatment center someplace get in touch with the physicianhealth people at the medical society and have them recommend a good one will sensed himself about to blow fists balled he forced his hands upward until the broad restraints cut into his wrists i didnt take anything he said through nearly clenched teeth i have never taken anything and im not going to any goddamn treatment center suit yourself silverman said his stubby fingers wrapped around the bed rail youre going to have a day after youre discharged from here to get your strength back then twentyfour hours to wrap up your dictations and any other business here after that until youre convicted or cleared of drug charges i dont want you near this hospital im sorry will i had hoped youd be more forthcoming he turned and strode to the doorway then turned back our pr people are together right now working on damage control but theres no way we can keep this from becoming a media circus as soon as the press gets word of what happened and believe me they will hear about it id suggest you notify maxine so she can prepare your children i would also give your malpractice carrier a call so they can keep on top of things silverman left and a few minutes later anne hajjar came in and removed wills restraints dr millstein will be up in a little while she said i want to sign out please wait and speak with him it wont matter he can discharge me or ill sign out ama i didnt take any drugs and i want out of here dr grant please just dont do anything crazy until ken gets here we have a security guard right outside i wont cause any trouble anne youve known me for years do you think im someone who would take drugs and then go into the operating room to do a complicated case i only know what i hear she said i hope it turns out you didnt but i admit it sounds like you did by the way your wife called from the lobby shes on her way up its exwife will wanted to say but didnt bother maxine stylishly dressed as always today in a floral print silk blouse navy blazer and gray slacks knocked on the doorway and nodded gravely to the nurse as they passed you all right she asked physically im fine howd you know i was here gordon called and told me then a few minutes after that karen millstein called i could win the nobel prize and news wouldnt travel any faster in case you dont know it you didnt win the nobel prize i didnt take any drugs either gordon said it was in your blood and urine i didnt take any drugs will wondered how many times he would say the phrase over the hours days and weeks ahead i thought youd been acting strange lately you came to tell me ive been acting strange i came to see if youre all right im not all right i didnt take any fentanyl and nobody believes that you passed out in the operating room and then stopped breathing and then had the drug in your blood and urine what are people supposed to think i didnt take any drugs sid silverman was just here im about to be suspended from the staff what else could they do he says the media is going to be all over this weve got to try our best to protect the kids maybe you should go away for a week until the firestorm blows past maybe we will listen will mark and i talked and decided that until this business is resolved im going to limit your visitation with the twinsno visits for the next week then once a week in the playroom or yard at our place three hours maximum supervised that is provided your psychiatrist says its safe i dont see a psychiatrist you will now thats ridiculous you cant do that can and will dont make me go to court for a restraining order besides if our situations were reversed you know youd do the same thing will sank back and stared at the ceiling this wasnt the time or place to battle maxine especially when he was totally outgunned he lived for his medical practice and time with his children now in a matter of just a few hours he had lost both who why how for the first time the questions took center stage in his mind was the managedcare killer somehow involved if so to what end he was supposed to be the ally of the movement why would they want to destroy him will are you listening to me i asked if you thought you might be sued for this how should i know he replied still staring overhead if im sued im sued thats why i have malpractice excuse me sir maxine said but if youre sued for this you dont have malpractice have you forgotten the clause in fact he had forgotten in an effort to stem the bleeding from malpractice premiums that were going through the roof fredrickston surgical associates had decided to switch their coverage to psfphysicians security funda small physicianowned company based in indiana among several clauses designed to keep premiums down was one omitting coverage for any incident involving the use of alcohol or other mindaltering drugs it was not surprising that maxine knew the details of his malpractice insurance better than he did she was a businesswoman and an avaricious one at that if he were wiped out by a claim which as of this moment seemed exceedingly possible her finances would take a significant hit im sorry he said but i just cant get worked up about that right now but its true yes i suspect its true damn you will dont you ever think of anyone but yourself wolf hollow condominiums was a wellmaintained middleclass development situated a few miles outside the city wills unit a twobedroom twoandahalfbath town house was in the block farthest from the clubhouse and outdoor pool thus bringing its cost down from absolutely prohibitive for him to merely unaffordable still the kids enjoyed the pool and the game room and had actually made some friends there it would be hard to one day have to tell them that the place had become the property of kurt goshtigian or his heirs it was nearly eight when will arrived home having signed out against medical advice ken millstein simply refused to authorize an early discharge for someone who had spent a large portion of the day on a vent due to a massive drug overdose and respiratory arrest if nothing else he insisted on a psych evaluation to determine whether or not will was a danger to himself or anyone else ultimately will relented and a colorless shrink named yvonne sands took more than an hour to determine that he was in fact mentally able to go home still millstein made him sign the ama papers as sid silverman had predicted the executive committee voted unanimously to suspend him from the hospital staff until his situation could be resolved it seemed like only a matter of time before the board of registration suspended him as well was there any way his disability insurance would pay anything without insisting he admit that he was an addict maybe he could claim a severe paralytic depression and simply crawl into bed for a year or two at the moment such a diagnosis would not be stretching the truth very far will pulled into his parking space grateful that no reporters or cameramen were lurking about but he knew it was just a matter of time before they descended on wolf hollow drive hungering for any ort of information about him and his life compared to the house in ashford the condo was quite modest even so will liked the hardwood floors and the view of the woods out back and bit by bit as the bookshelves filled and artframed prints or the twins masterpiecesbegan to fill the walls the place had become home there was no evidence inside that the police had been there yet feeling numb and detached from his life will brewed a pot of tea then sank onto the couch in the small den who why how after a few minutes the three burning questions were joined by a fourth what now he wanted to fight backneeded to fight backbut he knew things were only going to get worse a lawyer probably that was the place to begin he really didnt know any who handled this sort of thing thanks to the nodrug clause there was no chance his malpractice company would provide one and the incompetent weasel who had handled his divorce would probably succeed in getting him the gas chamber what sort of retainers did lawyers charge these days anyhow at a recent society meeting he had heard of one insisting on up front was that possible the divorce and ongoing settlement payments had hit his finances hard as had increasingly restrictive managedcare policies he had maybe ten thousand in the bank fifty or so in his retirement fund and perhaps thirty that he could wring out of the condo not much to show for seven years in surgical practice jim katz knew a lot of wellplaced people maybe he or one of the other two partners could recommend someone will sipped at his tea and stared across at the dark screen of the tv shit what in the hell had just happened to his life the doorbell had rung several times before he became aware of it let the circus begin he thought the guest bathroom overlooked the parking lot rather than answer the door he went upstairs carefully opened that bathroom window and peered down patty moriarity alone paced back and forth across the front stoop faced with the vast emptiness of his condo and in fact his world a visit even from her was welcome ill be right there he called down the fredrickston pd called and told us what happened she said when he opened the door i checked with the icu at the hospital and they told me you were about to sign yourself out so i decided to see if i could catch up with you here he motioned her into the living room she was wearing black jeans and the leather jacket he had now come to associate with her and aside from maybe a little lipstick wore no makeup there was no gun that he could see but he imagined a shoulder holster or a pistol strapped to her ankle its locked in the car she said before he could ask just wondered keeping her jacket on she settled in at one end of the burgundy sofa gordo had given him for his thennew place while he took the recliner the people at the open hearth had chipped in to buy for him so she said it sounds like youve had a time of it since we last spoke calling it the day from hell wouldnt do it justice i havent spoken to the da yet but the fpd guys tell me theres a chance youll be arrested soon for the drugs they found in your locker i suppose theres a chance the da could go for an attemptedmanslaughter charge if the guy makes it and maybe manslaughter if he doesnt thats great just great sergeant moriarity i didnt take any drugs someone did this to me the killer i have no idea why would he do something like that he said i was going to be his buddy from now onhis spokesman you dont take drugs of any kind i smoked dope from time to time in college and med school thats it now i dont even take tylenol any idea how the drug got into you if i hadnt passed out the way i did id blame someone in the lab putting it in my specimens im superstitious and i have a few rituals that a lot of people know about maybe someone put the drug in my juice at breakfast or the doughnut i like to eat what kind is that will felt color rush to his cheeks jelly stick im a glazedcruller person myself but those krispy kremes are starting to win me over dr grant the people in your hospital have a great deal of respect for you theyve told me youre one of the best same goes for the people at the open hearth i just came from speaking with benois beane youre like a god to some of them thats nice to hear so you believe me about the drugs at the moment i dont know what to believe you see everyone i talked to says youre a great surgeon and a terrific person but you work too hardlonger hours than anyone theyve ever known a couple of them dont know how you do it now all of a sudden a serial murderer is calling you on your private line you almost kill a man when you pass out in the operating room and youre found to be loaded with narcotics dont you think it seems possible even likely that you are coming apart from all the hours you spend working thats ridiculous maybe it is maybe it isnt what are you going to do now find a lawyer i guess i dont intend to hand over my life without a goddamn good fight the words were there but they were belied by the dazed vulnerable look in his eyes im glad to hear that she said you just dont expect this kind of stuff when you sign up maybe not but its all there in the fine print that nobody ever reads for a time patty gazed across the room at nothing in particular how much she wanted to believe himthat he didnt create the mysterious phone call as a means of setting up a public platform for his views on managed care that he didnt accidentally overdose on a powerful narcotic that he would never even consider killing anyone she wanted to believe him because at the moment she needed him her first major case and she was being shoved out the door unless she came up with something and quick she would be back to chasing down shoplifters fulltime what would tommy moriarity think if he knew she was contemplating joining forces with their chief suspect in a series of vicious murders what were all those women thinking the moment they opened the door to let in charming handsome vulnerable ted bundy how much denial was she in about her attraction to this man dr grant she suddenly heard herself saying i need your help at the moment i cant believe anyone needs my help for anything he said your career is on the line if you cant prove youre innocent of taking any drugs well mine is on the line unless i get a break in this managedcare case and soon the truth is its the first one of any consequence that ive gotten since i joined the force a lot of people including your friend brasco think that the only reason im still on the case is because my father is second in command of the state police how can i help will asked first i want permission to tap your phoneshere your cell even the one in your office if you think you need to for a while you wont have much privacy when the media gets ahold of what happened this morning i dont suspect ill have much privacy anyway besides if youve been investigating my life you must have learned that outside the hospital my kids and the soup kitchen i dont really have one its been months since my last date good ill give you my home number and my cell if the killer calls day or night i need you to contact me immediately if you have any ideas about who could be doing this or why i need you to call me if you can connect anyone to this drug business anyone at all thats important too ill even take any theories that might come to you i suppose i could do that one last thing i would really appreciate it if you didnt tell anyone we have this arrangement i wondered about that given that im still a suspect to brasco you are but ive pretty much decided to believe youat least for the moment as patty spoke the words the reality of what she was doing hit unprofessional amateurish and downright dangerous her father would say you dont go into a mans home without another officer nearby if not right in the room with youespecially when that man is a suspect in your murder investigation jesus girl what were you thinking i ive got to go she said standing abruptly here are forms for the wiretaps sign them in front of a notary and get them to me at the address on my card ill let myself out wait you dont have to go stay for just a little while maybe we could brainstorm somewhere in the midst of wills second sentence she closed the door behind her patty knew that in addition to her own vulnerability and feelings of isolation she had just blatantly gone against policy and procedure because of the admiration and attraction that were building inside her for will angry with herself and more than a little embarrassed she hurried to the camaro she was unlocking her door when a photographer stepped out from between two parked cars and snapped off three quick shots hey a female reporter called from somewhere behind the man how about an interview go screw yourself patty shouted back the stench of burning rubber filled the car as she screeched out of wolf hollow parking lot chapter nowhere to go nothing to do with the abruptness of a racing car hitting a wall every aspect of time had changed for will just six days ago hours had passed like minutes with surgical consults to visit notes to dictate patients to see cases to do in the or exercise to squeeze in and evenings and weekends with the kids to arrange for to say nothing of the mundane aspects of running his life and continuing his work at the open hearth he had wistfully prayed for just an extra couple of hours each day just an extra day or two each month now the days that had followed the unfathomable events at fredrickston hospital had seemed interminable it was ten in the morning when the phone rang for the first time that day after waking at six will had scrambled a trio of eggs and served them to himself with a toasted bagel and some oj he had rinsed what few dishes there were put them in the washer and failed on his third attempt to get into a michael crichton novel usually a sure thing for him finally he had taken a tube of caulk to the bathroom off the kitchen to tack down a small block of tiles that had been loose for at least a year it was a good bet that michelangelo didnt work more meticulously on the sistine chapel ceiling nowhere to go nothing to do over the past six days caller id and the bathroom window overlooking the parking lot and front stoop had become his staunchest allies initially the reporters had been merciless in their attempts to get at him only in the past two days had their calls and visits begun to die away now expecting yet another blocked on the display he checked the id on the phone in the kitchen august micelli will snatched up the receiver this is dr grant dr grant this is gladys from attorney micellis office speaking i know your appointment isnt for three more weeks and this is short notice but weve had a cancellation for noon today and mr micelli thought you might want to come in i can be there will said hearing a small jet of enthusiasm in his voice for the first time since that moment in the or however the woman added he asked me to tell you not to get your hopes up and to remind you that he really just takes the cases of people suing doctors not the doctors who are being sued i understand you know where the office is park street in boston right down the street from the state house well see you at noon the recommendation to try august micelli md lld had come from susan hollister who did not know the man well but did know that his intelligence was respected by physicians even though the nature of his law practice was reviled it was while will was turning his practice over to her that susan had suggested he might call the man who was widely advertised as the law doctor the patients susan inherited from will included grace peng davis on whom she had operated the following day and several others whose surgery needed doing after being turned down for legal support by his malpractice carrier as expected will had tried two attorneysone local and one in boston emotionally and intellectually he failed to connect with either and the retainers and fees each demanded would have virtually broken him even before the game of saving his professional personal and financial lives began visions of running out of money and lawyer at the same time had sent him trudging back to the sanctuary of his condo when he returned from the disappointing session with the second of the attorneys there was a letter from a third firm waiting in his mailbox however rather than offering him representation at an exorbitant fee this attorney was announcing that he and his firm had been retained by kurt goshtigian and his family to institute a malpractice claim against him after two extra trips to the or it appeared that the man was going to make it but his debility would be profound if not permanent will was dressing for the trip into boston when the front doorbell sounded he scurried over to the bathroomwindow observation post beneath him a husky black man in a business suit stood motionless by the front door not a reporter will guessed the man was simply too well dressed he discarded salesman as a possibility for the same reason and decided to open the window yes he called down the man squinted upward at him dr willard grant yes my names sam rogers im an investigator with the board of registration in medicine may i come in for just a moment please i have a letter i need to handdeliver to you will knew even before he opened the door what the officiallooking envelope contained still rogers explained it to him this is a summary suspension of your privilege to practice medicine in this state of massachusetts it has been issued because of the suspension recently ordered by fredrickston hospital it is effective immediately and may be appealed through channels established by the board do you have any questions without bothering to read the letter will tossed it onto a pile of junk mail and unopened bills on the coffee table somewhere in the mound of mail was another letterone he had read it was from tom lemm unofficially requesting that he remove himself from his very important and sensitive position with the hippocrates society until his pending matter with the hospital could be satisfactorily resolved are you here to investigate what was done to me will asked rogers no sir i may well be investigating your case sometime in the future but for the moment my assignment is to deliver this letter and explain its contents thanks will said with no emotion whatsoever as far as im concerned youve done your job and done it well in that case rogers said if you wouldnt mind signing off on that right here will would have been the first to admit that he had never been on anyones bestdrivers list his reflexes were sharp and that certainly helped but even under the best of circumstances his thoughts were constantly wandering as was all too often his car although he had never been involved in anything more destructive than a minor fender bender he sometimes wondered if there were accidents he would never know about for which he had been responsible this morning traffic was light and the drive into boston was less grueling and perilous than usual susan had told will little of augie micelli except that he had once been on some sort of board or communityservice organization with her and that he had been treated poorly by the board of registration in medicine and the medical community micellis response to both had been to get a law degree and subsequent notoriety as the law doctorhighly promoted in the press and on billboards as the place to go for justice against physicians responsible for bad outcomes it was susans hope that the similarities in the ways micelli and will had been treated might lead him to agree to get involved in wills case it was a long shot but in this mounting gale even the smallest landing field would be welcome as will turned off the mass pike and headed into the back bay he found himself thinking of patty moriarity since her visit to wolf hollow drive she had not been among the hordes who had tried to reach him by phone or through simply showing up on his doorstep he assumed the wiretap on his phone was in place and still functioning but he had no way of knowing if her position as an investigator on the case was surviving he gave passing thought to reaching out to her but nothing she had said or done during her odd visit had encouraged such familiarity and her abrupt departure had accomplished just the opposite he expected to reconnect with her if he ever received another call from the murderer but so far nothing maybe he simply wasnt good enough for the serial killer anymore he left the jeep in a lot off tremont that was more expensive than some surgical procedures and walked along the boston common to park although the street itself was elegant the law doctors office was not located on the thirdfloor alley side of a fourstory brownstone it consisted of a small eclectically furnished waiting room off of which was an entrance from the dimly lit hallway and one other door presumably to micellis inner sanctum the oriental carpet was threadbare in spots and the two framed prints on the walla farm scene perhaps by one of the dutch masters and a courtroom depiction that might have been offered as a premium for subscribing to a law magazinehad little to do with each other a bottleblond woman in her late forties peered up from behind her granny glasses as he entered and smiled kindly dr grant she asked in what he could immediately tell was a dense boston accent yes im gladys please fill out this registration form bring it in with you when you go mr micellis on the phone right now but it shouldnt be too long im in no hurry will replied in the understatement of the day the form clearly meant for someone who was hoping to sue a doctor contained only a few lines of demographic questions that will could answer he finished it in less than a minute and slipped it into his thin black leather briefcase which contained copies of the lab reports from the hospital that susan had obtained for him as well as of the letters of suspension from sid silverman and the chairman of the board of registration in medicine in addition there was the letter from the multipartnered law firm in worcester that told him he was being sued for malpractice that letter included paragraphs taken directly from some law boilerplate describing the legal basis for kurt goshtigians action against him please consider this letter together with the attached complaint incorporated herein to constitute a written demand for relief on behalf of your former patient kurt s goshtigian we intend to file a lawsuit following the expiration of fourteen days from the mailing of this demand it is our contention that through your negligence and use of mindaltering drugs at the time of mr goshtigians cancer surgery you have caused infection excess bleeding extended operatingroom time substitution of principal surgeons additional surgery and additional medication in addition your negligence has caused unnecessary pain and suffering for mr goshtigian and his family please provide your medical malpractice and personalliability carriers with the enclosed documents and have their attorneys send us notice of representation the amount of damages to be demanded will depend on mr goshtigians survival from your malpractice and his condition at the time of discharge and subsequent to that time but in no case will it be less than fifty million dollars fifteen minutes passed during which gladys answered four calls each it seemed from a potential new client just as will was beginning to get restless the door to micellis office opened and a thickwaisted broadshouldered man emerged who had probably been an athlete at one time although clearly not anymore he had dense grayblack hair and olive skin and was wearing a lightblue sport shirt open at the collar with no jacket he could have easily played one of don vitos bodyguards in the godfather except for his eyes which will did not appreciate until the two of them had shaken hands and he had settled down on the hardbacked chair beside micellis desk they were very dark with an intriguing forcefulness and intelligence but in those first moments together will saw something else as wellthe sadness and ennui of a man who didnt care about much drink micelli asked heading over to a sideboard with three crystal decanters labeled scotch whiskey and rum half a dozen glasses and a brass ice bucket its past noon no thanks dr micelli for chrissakes dont call me that augiell do fine mr micelli if you have a need to be formal but please no doctor he splashed two fingers from the scotch decanter into a waterford tumbler added an ice cube and took a gulp before heading over to his chair there was a law degree from suffolk on the wall behind his desk alongside a medical degree from harvard but no other certifications or for that matter pictures of any kind one wall was a floortoceiling bookshelf filled with carefully aligned sets of legal tomes that appeared as if they had never been read the window to wills left looked out on the side of a building the wall behind him included the door to the waiting room and a small fireplace neatly painted with three logs decoratively and probably permanently arranged the law doctor with all the advertising will had conjured up visions of a massive medicolegal mill with lawyers scurrying from exquisitely appointed offices into mahoganypaneled conference rooms and libraries you look a little dismayed micelli said not what you had expected no i i mean yes i mean not exactly all those ads and worth every penny too malpractice cases come in here by the barrel just listen to that phone ringing most of them are frivolous ridiculous or simply nasty and vindictive but a certain percent of them have some merit and once in a while the ol amputatedthewrongleg or pluckedoutthewrongkidney mother lode comes hobbling in but you see dr grant i dont actually do the cases in fact i dont do any cases at all so i dont need much help and i dont need much space he drained what remained in his glass and immediately restocked it i bring the cases in evaluate them from a medical standpoint and either ship them off to one of the firms that can actually do something with them or send them on their way to pursue their complaint if they want but not with me and you get a finders fee from the firms you refer to sometimes a really big one plus as many dinners at swanky restaurants as i care to accept they all want to be my friend isnt that fee splitting by any definition of the term i would say so yes and isnt that illegal in medicine its illegal you cant refer a patient to a specialist and then get a kickback from that specialist in law its considered good sound business will sighed and stared out the window as uncertain whether he wanted to continue this session as micelli probably was finally he shrugged and asked if the lawyer wanted to hear why he had come you go ahead with your story if you want to micelli replied but as gladys told you the only help i might be is to give you the names of some firms to call our motto here is if it takes work we dont want it he managed a thin smile but there was nothing cheerful in the way he said the words will may have been a surgeon but he could recognize depression when he saw it and probably alcoholism too thank you susan hollister i think im going to go he said suit yourself you know my partner susan hollister said you have had some trouble of your own plenty of it and she said because of that you might have some sympathy with whats happening to me i might that doesnt mean i can be of any help well will said exactly what is it that happened to you micelli eyed him for a moment then drained his tumbler it was as if the question was one nobody had ever asked i killed my son he said simply will stifled any kneejerk response go on he said you sure will nodded okay remember you asked for it i was an internist with all the right medical pedigrees very full of myself micelli said in a near monotone virtually devoid of the emotion inherent in the terrible account my then wife and son and i were in utah set to go on a camping trip into some pretty remote country ryan had a little fever and a stuffy nose his mother wanted to cancel the hike i told her he was nine and she was being overprotective i even checked him over so she would be reassured a little red throat was all so off we went will could see the shattering end of the story already and wanted to spare both of them any unnecessary anguish meningitis he said impressed micelli nodded two days out with no radio i raced back for help but by the time the helicopter reached them he was gone just like that im very sorry thats so sad so was what happened afterward a few months later i went into what they called a paranoid depression no history of prior mental illness scared the hell out of my wife my neighbors and a lot of people at my hospital i was about the only one around who thought i was normal rather than get me help or ask my wife to get me hospitalized my hospital panicked and suspended me after that i was hospitalized and properly diagnosed and treated the paranoia and crazy behavior went away almost immediately and has stayed away but by then the board of registration had suspended me as well until they could investigate why i had been kicked out of my hospital once again will could see what was coming and again stepped into the account then he said because you had your license suspended the managedcare companies dropped you from their provider panels exactly it was a cookiecutter response by the board and by them without so much as an investigation or a hearing so even though the board eventually reinstated my license most of the companies held to their decision once worth suspending always worth suspending there was no way i could practiceat least no way i could practice and get paid for it well no matter now i make ten times more doing this than i ever did being an internistand work a fraction of the hours too bad though because i actually liked doing it and i was pretty damn good at it too ill bet you were augie will said listen im sorry for all youve been through i really am but i hope you can take some pride in the way youve managed to deal with all thats happened without going down for the count i dont think i could have handled something happening to one of my kids that bravely even if i didnt believe i was responsible without a word micelli made his way to the sideboard and poured a third drink this one more substantial than the other two so he said taking a gulp then clumsily wiping his mouth on the back of his hand its your turn now assume i know everything about you that the newspapers and tv can tell me clearly augie micelli was now under the influence although not strikingly so will debated if there was any percentage in staying even if he decided to leave and renew his attempts to connect with a lawyer who fit his requirements of being talented empathetic and reasonably affordable he knew that the trip into boston had been worth it whether he and augie ever saw each other again or not he still owed susan thanks according to the story augie had shared the man was hardly as responsible for his sons tragic death as he seemed to want to believe still the boy was dead wills external world was crumbling that was all too true but dan and jess were healthy wonderful kids and even if he hit rock bottom and lost everything else he would still be their father and they his children even if the only purchase he had on the sheer wall up from this nightmare was them he would still have a firm hold from which he could start the climb his heart ached for augie and the terrible emptiness he had to deal with each day but it no longer ached for himself you know what he said finally if you know that much about me and my situation then you really are already in a position to know whether or not you can be of any help to me i can tell you right now that i cant this just isnt the sort of thing i do i can see that listen here are copies of some letters i brought for you to review ill leave them with you anyway just in case you can think of someone who might want to work with me one of the letters is from a law firm that is representing my former patient because of a clause in my groups malpractice policy i dont have any coverage for whats happened fortunately even though theyll get everything i have if im found at fault it wont be much all the information you need to reach me is on that sheet i filled out im sorry i cant be of any help to you micelli said im sorry about your son will replied for twenty minutes after the door closed augie micelli sat staring unseeing out the window feet on his desk rising once only to replenish the scotch and ice in his glass losing ryan would always be the worst thing that had ever happened to himfar beyond the subsequent financial losses and breakup of his marriage but this was the first time he could remember speaking with anyone about the pain of losing his practice unlike what he was doing now practicing medicine had never been about the money he opened his desk drawer and set a silverframed photo from it on his deskone of ryan smiling down from the limb of a massive ancient oak he drained his glass drinking like this had been really stupid he had made a deal with himself not to do it around clients anymore and now he had broken that agreement he swallowed what remained in his glass what in the hell difference does it make in fact what difference does anything make guilty or not will grant has gotten himself into this mess he can damn well get himself out if he needs to he can just go to law school or become a grocer or do landscaping or or micelli stood suddenly and hurled his tumbler into the fireplace the shattering glass had gladys in his office in seconds are you all right im fine fine sorry about the glass ill clean it up myself meanwhile could you please get me gil murray in the middlesex county das office tell him its about the will grant case chapter i miss you daddy i miss you too sport well see each other next week meanwhile just keep oiling that new glove and then with the ball in the pocket tie it up like i showed you with one of those heavy rubber bands we bought ookay danny its okay to cry if you want to but please know that im all right and everythings going to be fine its just going to take a little time the things that have been said and written about me arent true and before long everyone will know that okay okay seans mother wont let him come over here to play anymore im so sorry that must make you very sad only a little seans a jerk most of the time and he wasnt my best friend anyway just the same its got to be hard for you we know you didnt do anything wrong and thats all that matters to me now ill see you both next week and before too long everything will be back to normal got that got it youre a brick youre a wall youre iron youre steel your nose is running daad will said goodbye and set the receiver down slowly you bastards he muttered at once sickened and furious at the pain that the twins were experiencing you fucking bastards augie micellis story had been a heavy dose of perspective for him but the reality of his situation was still overwhelming and it seemed at the moment virtually hopeless whoever had set out to destroy him had done a masterful job he was a rag doll hung out to dry and swinging helplessly in the breeze even worse aside from a few friends like benois beane he was alone in the certainty of his innocence there was no grassroots crusade mounting no letterwriting campaign no passiton emails even his partners and a number of his friends seemed to have stepped back and taken a waitandsee position you can only do what you can do he reminded himself for the thousandth time you can only do what you can do he was sifting aimlessly through the mound of mail on the coffee table when the phone began ringing the caller id read simply error will hesitated then both curious and prepared to hang up he picked up the handset hello hello will grant the electronically distorted voice said your life has certainly been quite eventful since we last spoke will wondered if patty was on top of this she hadnt given him any instructions in terms of whether or not he needed to keep the killer on the line for any specific length of time like the cops in the movies always tried to do in fact she hadnt even told him whether the tap on his line was done at his phone at the line outside or at the phone company stay calm but sound upset he told himself calm but upset i dont want you to call me anymore he pleaded give yourself up and ill see to it you get the best therapist around youre sick you need help i need help goodness but those are strong words from a man who has done what the papers and tv say youve done facefirst into a patients incision that sort of publicity isnt good for our cause dr grant not good at all we have no place in this crusade for drug addicts im not one of you and im not a drug addict oh but you are these managedcare companies are your enemy just as they are ours i read where you are claiming to have been set up i was well if not one of the managedcare companies you exposed at faneuil hall then who was it halliday because if it was he could and should be moved up the list say to tonight stop it please youve got to stop this insanity funny thats precisely what we begged our mothers socalled caregivers youve got to stop her insanity we told them a mentalhealth patient this is all about a mentalhealth patient will flashed on the many instances he had encountered over the years of managedcare companies refusing detox or even counseling for alcoholics and cutting short hospitalizations for psychiatric cases even though there was concern that the patient was or might be suicidal of all the patients the industry had shortchanged since its rise to power those with mental illness headed the list did your mother kill herself he asked is that whats behind all this when you have proven yourself reliable dr grant we will increase your level of responsibility and knowledge in the meantime if you have any information as to who might have set you up or you need to contact us for any reason any reason at all simply place a personal ad in the herald containing the phrase in war there are casualties we will contact you meanwhile i suggest that you stay safely indoors tonight the pipers on the loose and he must be paid good day dr grant wait the tension had become almost unbearable around the state police in general and among the middlesex detectives in particular it had been over a week since the managedcare killer had been heard froma week that coincided with will grants bizarre drug overdose in the or spurred on by what he and jack court considered pattys reckless and potentially disastrous solo visit to the apartment of their only suspect brasco was keeping the pressure on her with a constant barrage of callous remarks and a string of timeconsuming tickytack assignments related to their case the latest of which was reinterviewing the security people in the fredrickston medical arts building meanwhile there had been no letup in the daytoday business of robberies assaults drug deals and various other demonstrations of mans inhumanity to his fellow man and to society the result from the co down to the rawest rookie was stress the afternoon was heavily overcast and more humid than any early spring day had the right to be it was ten after three when patty swung the camaro into her spot and made her way through the sparsely patronized mall to her office there was yet another meeting scheduled with court to review the lack of progress on their biggest most visible case in order to appease brasco patty had not only interviewed those security people on duty the night before and the day of the killers intrusion into wills office but she had tracked down all the personnel who had covered the company for the past month not surprisingly she had come away with nothing except the hassling she was about to get for being late to courts meeting she punched in her code on the security pad waved to veteran brian tomasetti who was building a pyramid of magnetic balls on the top of a dunkin donuts carton and hurried past brascos empty cubicle she paused at the door to her own space long enough to toss her jacket onto the back of her chair and was just about to race off when she saw the light flashing on her voice mail even before she keyed in her password she knew it was trouble three messages the first was prefaced by gil kinchley at the phone companythe man who had turned the court order she had obtained into a wiretap well sergeant moriarity he said i think this is what youve been waiting for barely breathing she sank into her chair the receiver pressed against her ear and listened to the eerie exchange between will and the killer its gil again the second message said our people say heif it even is a hewas probably using a call diverter more likely two its like call forwarding only it doesnt go through us the technology is readily available in any spy store the equipment is well made very effective and makes a call almost impossible to trace ring me if you need anything well keep on this the third message was from will patty its will i hope you got that call and let me know what you think and what im supposed to do i tried keeping him on the phone as long as i could wayne brasco appeared at the doorway startling her sergeant are you going to join the rest of us at the meeting youre already late for or are you going to exercise a womans prerogative to talk on the phone no matter what i think youd better bring lieutenant court in here she said ignoring the remark tell me again court said after he patty and three other detectives had listened to the message on speaker for the second time when did the call come in patty knew this was coming she also knew she deserved it two hours ago but you just picked the message up now i had meant to forward it to my cell phone but i was racing around so much i forgot ask that gorilla next to you why i was racing around so much so weve lost two hours we wouldnt have had this tap at all if i hadnt gone out and gotten it she wanted to scream theres still time she said to do what this time it was brasco hes going to kill tonight a brilliant deduction mrs holmes patty stood and glared at brasco back to my office everyone court snapped intercepting any escalation in the hostilities he waited until the others had gone past him then stepped in front of patty moriarity were having enough trouble without losing two hours like this he said i understand ill be more careful from now on and another thing yes whats going on with this guy grant that hes calling you patty i um i dont know she had never been much of a liar and it was clear from her cos expression that he wasnt buying her denial you just be careful he said be damn careful without waiting for a response court turned and headed back to his office patty snatched her briefcase from the floor and followed all right court said when the team had settled back in his office thoughts i still think grants dirty in this brasco said i think hes playing us like a violin his big screwup was overdosing on that drug now its damage control for himusing someone from that damn society of his to make it seem like he isnt involved in these killings patty i think the call strongly suggests grant is innocent but at the moment that doesnt matter what does matter is that the call also implies someone is going to get killed tonight so patty withdrew a manila file folder from her briefcase and opened it well believe it or not there are ninetyseven managedcare or healthinsurance companies of one kind or another headquartered in massachusetts alonehmos ppos mcosalphabet soup most of them are within thirty miles of boston there are another twelve in new hampshire and a few more in vermont and maine if we limit ourselves to this state and eliminate the three companies where someones already been killedand im not at all sure we should do thatwe have ninetyfour companies to contact and warn i have a list of them here with phone numbers and a contact person usually the membership or pr coordinator there was silence while the group waited for a reaction from court patty sensed that the last thing he wanted to do was to find any merit in her suggestion but she also knew contacting the ceos of the companies was the thing to do finally court inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly okay we have enough people here to make these calls over the next hour or two might as well include the companies that have already had someone murdered what do we tell themjust for all their executives to be careful dont go walking around alone patty said bring a guard along when they walk to their car keep their personal cars out in the open not in their garage where someone can work an explosive into place without being seen is it worth notifying the tv and radio stations i dont know the killer must suspect that will grants phone is tapped otherwise he wouldnt take the sort of precautions he has but if we go public we remove any doubt i hate to put the guy in harms way i say go with it brasco blustered grants a damn drug addict almost killed his patient the execs who have been murdered were all upstanding citizens they all were big into charitable causes so is will grant patty snapped he started the open hearth soup kitchen in fredrickston when he was a medical student and he still volunteers there that doesnt change anything and neither does your grandstanding here you just conveniently neglected to mention that list youre holding is one i told you to put together you know brasco ive just about had it with you you sexist enough jack court slammed his fist on his desk moriarity divide up those phone numbers im warning you you and wayne better find a way to work together on this thing or one of you is going to go and im warning you about something else too keep your personal life separate from your work forcing courts warning to the back of her mind patty made the twenty or so calls she had been assigned the effort to alert all of the managedcare ceos in the state seemed akin to trying to stop an elephant with a pop gun but at least they would have done what they could do the best they could hope for was that the killers dramatic proclamation about the piper being on the loose and needing to be paid was his way of keeping the police off balanceone of the im smarter than you are ego games that ultimately led to the capture or death of so many like him now there was nothing more to do but sit down and analyze the tape that had been made of the killers call not surprisingly brasco had again managed to maneuver her out of the loop by suggesting that he and court meet with the new profiler to pore over the recording patty was assigned to contact the cryptographer and even though there were no new alphabet clues to go over the letters they did have in light of the new information on the tape she had a different idea but it wasnt one she wanted to discuss with her co she wasnt surprised when she called will to find him at home and anxious for company he was openly relieved to hear that in her mind at least any lingering doubt about his not being connected to the killings was gone what she didnt share with him but grudgingly acknowledged to herself was that for days she had been looking for the opportunity to see him again it was almost seven by the time she pulled into a parking space marked guest not far from wills condo on the drive over she listened to yoyo mas contemplative score from crouching tiger hidden dragon spurred on by the horrible events of wills week she found herself trying to rank some of the worst things that had ever happened to her certainly her mothers illness and death headed the list and there were some tragedies over the years that had befallen her friends but most of the rest dating back to middle school it seemed centered about bad choices she had made in men including last years follies with jerry parkhurst a wildly attractive and successful mergersandacquisitions attorney who lived in a stunning waterfront apartment in charlestown parkhurst seemed like a potential keepera match for a lifetimeuntil after they had finally slept together following their fourth or fifth date when he almost casually mentioned that in addition to his penthouse bachelor pad he also had a sixteenroom mansion in newton where he lived unhappily with his wife and two children that was a bad one and would have been even more painful if she had actually fallen in love with him but with images of the vivid imprint of her hand on the side of his face and some tincture of time the sleaze had become a relatively distant memory in terms of pain it was certainly nothing compared to what will was going through now with jerry parkhurst strutting through her brain like harold hill in the music man patty rang wills bell be right down will called from the window above dressed in rumpled chinos a lightblue buttondown white socks and slightly worn nikes he looked every bit like a man who had lost his medical license was facing criminal drug and manslaughter charges and was being harassed by a serial killer you okay she asked will made no attempt to mask his discouragement i can handle everything thats happening to me he said but people arent being kind to my kids that i cant handle forgive me for saying it but i really want to kill some of them i dont think id do very well at dealing with that either patty accepted the offer of a diet coke set her tape recorder on the coffee table and motioned that it was okay for will to sit on the couch where they both could have access to the control buttons the distance between them was the same as when he was on the recliner but she knew there was something more to the sensation of having him sitting there in her head jerry parkhurst and jack court were engaged in some sort of heated discussion that she decided not to try to overhear lets start by listening to the whole conversation with no interruptions she suggested then well play it again and again if necessary until we both feel weve squeezed every ounce of juice from it it was the fifth time patty had listened to the eerie exchange while the gender of the caller was electronically obscured the cadence and choice of words made her almost certain it was a man do you think hes going to kill someone tonight will asked as she clicked off the tape and rewound it for another pass im hoping praying hes just jerking our chain she replied toying with us he doesnt seem like the toying type to me why do you say that i dont knowmaybe because this is a vendettaanger but with a point to be made and maybe a demand somewhere down the road this personthese people if you believe all those references to weis avenging the loss of someone they loved i see your point but what about the letters arent they some sort of game i dont know dramatic effect maybe maybe the killer expected the press would glom on to the letter thing right away and the publicity and speculation would go through the roof people the national enquirer larry kingthe works you think theyre going to spell the mothers name that would be my first guess if it didnt seem so obvious and didnt point directly at the killer well i hope youre wrong about him being totally serious will because if this guy kills again he gets two for one explain my co has made it clear that unless we produce a break and soon the team on this case is going to be revamped he neglected to say starting with moriarity but he didnt have to in that case lets listen to that tape again will said the guy keeps saying us lets see if we can convince ourselves once and for all that there are more than one of them then maybe we can get a pen and some paper and see if we can come up with any other hints i really appreciate your help with this patty said especially with all youre going through yourself i need to get my mind off my own stuff without either of them orchestrating things patty slid a few inches closer and will gently lowered his arm down around her waist she hesitated then set her head on his shoulder for a time neither of them moved do you think were just making our bad situations worse she asked will stroked her hair not from where im sitting he said chapter careful there jennifer handle that suction with care and never ever forget thats brain youre suckin on yes sir the med student said grimly to keep the nervous tremor in her hands at bay she braced them against the patients skull standing across the table in or of bostons prestigious white memorial hospital richard leaf noted the protective maneuver and smiled beneath his mask the kid a harvard senior was bright and witty and had a better than decent body now he could see that she was resourceful as well the potential for something interesting was very much there he could tell from the way she had been looking at him on morning rounds since she started her neurosurgical rotation he had tuesday free next week and his wife had a board meeting scheduled at some society foundation or other maybe something could be set up for then tonight though he had another fish to frya fish by the name of kristin oneill his mouth grew dry at the prospect be gentle there jen thats it thats it youre doing great were almost done it had been a tricky piece of surgery but the patients cancer a lowgrade malignant astrocytoma was gone in all likelihood it would be cured after a course of radiation and chemo the legend grows leaf was thinking the legend grows take over jeff leaf said to his resident let jennifer help as much with the closure as you feel comfortable with youve all done a terrific job thank you thank you all very much he stepped back from the table to allow the resident to take his place then dramatically stripped off his gown and gloves and strode out of the or reveling in the gazes he knew were fixed on him leaf was as talented a surgeon as he was flamboyant and as handsome as he was talented from his earliest days of awareness in grammar school he knew he was special through his years as class president and allstate athlete he had come to know that he was destined to do great things now at fortyfive wealthy by most peoples standards and world renowned for his skill as a neurosurgeon his remarkable life was becoming even more so hub health care the hmo he and three other physicians had started just six years ago was on the verge of making a public offering the moment the stock went public richard leaf would instantly go from wealthy to rich hub healths money people were estimating that for starters each of the founders would increase his net worth by thirty to forty millionand that was a lowball projection leaf showered then breathing deeply just to keep himself in check over what his life held in store he entered the busy main corridor of the hospital and headed for his office just two days ago in about this very spot he was leaving the or when he literally collided with the library cart being pushed by kristin oneill nothingnot the ugly salmoncolored volunteers jacket not her conservative skirt and loosefitting blouse not the barrettes with which she controlled her reddishblond hair not her wirerimmed glassescould negate her natural beauty as she presented herself there were some who might pass her by without even noticing how rarely fine her features were how sensual her movements or how incredibly full her breasts especially compared to her narrow waist but that group would certainly not include richard leaf she was in her twenties and wore no wedding ringno jewelry of any kind in fact not that adornment was needed on this woman by the time they had laughed over the incident and had spoken a bit she had accepted richards invitation to coffee his fantasies at that moment would have put a july fourth fireworks display to shame over coffee he learned that she was home in boston helping to care for her invalid mother while taking some time from a hollywood acting career that was about to break through the idea for her to do some volunteer work at the hospital had come from her mother who had been a salmoncoated information lady for years before her diabetes and kidney failure made it impossible to continue by the time he had handed a twenty to the waitress for their sixdollar bill and waved off receiving any change a rendezvous had been set at the scandinavian motor inn south of the city with kristins gaze threatening to set his white coat on fire leaf went through information to call the manager of the hotel and book a room it sounds like you do this often she said her expression suggesting she might be even more intrigued if that were true no way leaf lied unwilling to take any chances taking out peoples brain tumors is my style it just so happens that maury gross the manager is a former patient of mine a few years ago he had a tumor the size of a golf ball couldnt walk had trouble speaking now he runs and does the sunday times crossword in ink it must be really wonderful to be able to cure someone of cancer she sighed eyes closed leaf stretched out on the kingsize bed in room of the scandinavian motor inn and imagined what it would be like to see kristin oneill ease open the door and step inside the woman was perfect in every respectand an actress to boot it would be really something to have slept with her and then to have her become a big star she had the looks so it certainly seemed possible he checked the time and then took the painkillerandtranquilizer combination that experience had taught would keep him from coming too soon the room was candlelit in exactly the way it had been for the other trysts he had arranged there champagne was chilling in a silver ice bucket on the desk velvetyvoiced morgana king was singing a taste of honey on his cd player on the bureau sandalwood incense was smoldering alongside an envelope containing a couple of tabs of ecstasy just in case kristin wanted it at some point he surely didnt need anything even ecstasy of all the women he had ever slept with this one was possibly the hottest his marriage wasnt in any trouble and cindy was certainly decent enough in bed but she wasnt nearly enough john kennedy had been quoted as saying that he got a terrible headache unless he had a woman every other dayor maybe it was every third no matter kennedy was a remarkable powerful man and so was richard leaf and for kennedy even jackie wasnt enough leaf slipped his hand down his boxer briefs and gently massaged himself while he waited time passed during which he thought about the night ahead but also reflected on the incredibly rapid rise of hub health exclusion was the key he had told his partners when they were first starting outcareful screening of applicants and their lab work and rejection for any reason of those likely to cost hub significant sums in the short or long haul preexisting condition was their watchword the finance people had told him that hub stock absolutely couldnt miss and he was going to have a bundle of it at precisely the time they had agreed upon there was a light knock on the door leafs lingering fear that the young beauty might not show instantly evaporated come in its open he said trying for a cadence and tone of voice that was something of a cross between bill clinton and sting the door swung open a man slipped into the room and closed the door quickly behind him he was wearing a black motorcycle jacket and a baseball cap with the brim pulled low enough to obscure his eyes and he was carrying a small orange pillow leaf hardened against panic by years in the neurosurgical or and convinced that whatever the situation money could cure it glared at the intruder what the fuck is this wheres kristin kristin is back where i found her turning tricks for rich horny men like you so what is this some sort of shakedown how much do you want take whats in my wallet then get the fuck out of here what this is you selfcentered jerk is payback time wait do i know you the man merely shook his head you do now he said thats for sure and i dont think youll ever forget me calmly he withdrew a pistol from his waistband and jammed it into the pillow no please wait i can pay you anythinganything y the three rapid shots from eight feet were deadly accurate heart throat foreheadstraight up the line leaf saw the hole materialize in the pillow and felt the scalding heat of the shots as they entered his body but slumped back against the bloody pillow his head twisted grotesquely to one side he never saw the man extract a plain white business envelope and carefully set it beneath the palm of his right hand chapter excelsius health cancer center cancer the word while carved into the granite archway identically to the other three words and highlighted in gold like the others stood out as if the others did not exist in spite of herself grace peng davis paused on the sidewalk and stared up at the letters through a raw drizzle sticks and stones can break my bones but names can never hurt me well she thought viciously this one can it was graces first day of chemotherapy for the cancerous nodule that susan hollister had removed from her breast dr max dantonio the oncologist had assured her that there was really no rush to begin the treatments but both she and her husband wanted the tumor out and gone and any remaining vagabond cells blasted with poison as soon as was possible iv adriamycin and cytoxan every three weeks dr dantonio had told themtwo drugs that were toxic to every cell in the body but more so to those that were rapid multipliers especially cancer cells in between visits to the clinic she would be taking oral medication as well god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference grace had been exposed to the serenity prayer at her first aa meeting more than a decade ago but had never paid it more than lip service until with dr will grants help she finally connected with people who helped her get honest with herself about her alcoholism now although her life was in remarkable order it wasnt unusual for her to recite the prayer to herself every ten minutes when she needed to get through difficult situations god grant me the serenity mark davis took his wifes arm and guided her into the building youre doing great he whispered they both knew how fearful she was and always had been of doctors and hospitals and although the cancer center was a glittering modern outpatient clinic with comfortable furniture and dazzling artwork on the walls it was more of a hospital than she would ever care to see only mark would ever fully appreciate how anxious she had been about having her surgery done by a doctor she didnt even know it was such a blessing that day to have run into dr grant the way they did and later such a terrible blow to learn that his license had been suspended because of drugs but dr hollister had helped soften the blow by being kind and patient with both grace and mark and best of all she unabashedly supported dr grants claim that he was innocent the receptionist a prim young hispanic woman with carla on her name tag greeted her warmly then handed her a clipboard with some forms attached i already filled these out grace said when i came here to meet dr dantonio oh i remember who you are the woman said but these arent our registration forms they have to do with transferring your insurance from steadfast health to excelsius health transferring my insurance i guess you hadnt heard excelsius has taken over your insurance company we were told that the change has been in the works for a long time and that steadfast health had sent out a mailing we had heard there might be a change when we were initially sent here for graces mammogram mark said but we had no idea steadfast health had actually been taken over already and we certainly didnt get a mailing you didnt know anything about this grace did you grace huh oh no no i didnt know steadfast health had actually been taken over already we had heard there might be a change grace battling a sudden wave of anxiety was unaware that she had used her husbands exact words at three that morning she had been awakened by a similar episode of panic but after half an hour or so she was able to fall back to sleep god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change she tried to ignore the perspiration in her groin and soaking into her dress beneath her arms no big deal she told herself dr dantonio had given her medication to help her relax for her treatment phyllis her aa sponsor had assured her that taking the sedation was definitely the right thing to do if this was as bad as her anxiety was going to get she could handle it nobody told her getting chemotherapy was going to be pleasant well thats what weve been informed carla was saying cheerfully as of today steadfast health is part of excelsius we have lots of steadfast health clients here all of them are being given the choice of switching to excelsius or changing to another company if you choose to go to another company your chemotherapy will be turned over to whatever doctor your new hmo allows you to select thank you mark said they retreated to seats in the waiting area and filled in the form authorizing the transfer of their coverage to excelsius good thing we checked into this last week mark said i would have hated to have to change doctors hon are you all right you dont look good im fine fine just a little apprehensive you should tell the doctor he already told me to expect this first day to be frightening i still think mark please i know you mean well but i just want to get this over with besides they have a nurse practitioner in there or nearby while the drugs are going in theres absolutely nothing to worry about her husband generally not at all demonstrative about his feelings merely nodded that he understood and after an appropriate pause looked at his watch you go ahead to work grace said phyllis will be here later on to take me home and fix dinner im fine honey really dont worry here gimme a kiss for luck not one of those pecks on the lips i want the wet juicy kind youre so good at mmmmm now be gone the students need you ill call you when i get home grace watched as her husband hesitated at the doorway then left for his office of all the unmerited gifts made possible by her sobriety he was by far the greatest she returned the clipboard to the receptionist the worst thing about all this she was thinking was that she wasnt the least bit sick when this whole nightmare started logically she was grateful for the early detection of her cancer and the fact that the tumor was small and there was no evidence for spread but emotionally all she could think about was that she was feeling fine when she was called into the radiologists office for the bad news no symptoms whatsover how could anyone improve upon no symptoms i know youre feeling fine the radiologist dr newcomber had said but trust me and this xray here youre not grace scanned the waiting area who are all these people she wondered whatre their stories how had they reacted the first time they heard the word cancer applied to them grace davis the sound of her name startled her it was judi the nurse she had met during her orientation to chemotherapy they had sat together in a small windowless room while the woman outlined all of the effects and side effects of treatment it had not been a heartening conversation she had started with hair loss the most dreaded and expected side effect of the drugs there was no doubt she said that grace would lose her hair it would probably occur about two weeks after her first treatment most women got their hair cut very short before it happened but even so she should be aware that the short hairs would be annoying when they fell out getting in her mouth and nose it would have been okay if the nurse had stopped at hair loss but there was a litany of side effects to review nausea was of course a major topic grace would be given an arsenal of drugs to help alleviate that symptom judi had patiently reviewed each pill and its potential side effect ativan works quite well for anxiety but will make you drowsy vicodin is good to take if you have pain but it is addicting if you take it more often than prescribed and it may make you constipated it seemed like there was a potential side effect for every part of graces body her fingernails might become discolored and break easily urinating could burn and bowel movements would be painful finally grace just looked up from the myriad of papers judi had given her tell me there is at least one upside please tell me that my skin will never look lovelier or it will make my eyes shine brightly judi responded with a weak ironic smile no there was no upside at best grace could anticipate four months of malaise and an assortment of disrupting discomforts oh i forgot judi had added youll be extremely sunsensitive for a while after your therapy so much for the celebratory getaway with mark to aruba after all this was over maybe greenland finally after judi had pushed back in her chair her arms folded her expression indicating that the number of times she had done this might be getting to her grace had screwed up her courage to ask the big question how will you and dr dantonio know that this is working what replied judi as if grace had asked the single most stupid question in the world the chemotherapyhow will you know that it works that i am getting the expected result well there is no way of knowing we can certainly tell that it hasnt worked if you get a bone liver or brain metastasis but we will never know with absolute certainly if it has worked from a statistical standpoint we draw the line at five years but of course there are some patients who do get a recurrence after that great with memories of that first meeting with the nurse roiling in her brain grace followed her into the treatment area the place abounded with plaques and posters with pithy lifeaffirming sayings there were even stuffed dolls carrying placards that read things like live large love hard laugh often on every surface there were pamphlets and brochures for a myriad of services advertisements for cute hats you could buy online notices of support groups including one that showed how to do makeup and scarf tying so you could look your loveliest during this difficult period of your life there were also notifications of various financialaid plans for treatments for patients without insurancelowinterest loans for up to grace said a silent thank you to steadfast health or excelsius health or whoever they were today she couldnt imagine going through this hell and having to worry about how to pay for it she had seen the statements of benefits for the tests and surgery to date and they exceeded the value of their saab she was sure these next four months would approach the cost of their house in addition to the literature there were huge baskets of hard candies in every room you might want a couple of these judi said the taste of chemo can be pretty awful i thought it was intravenous oh it is but your bloodstream carries the medicine throughout your body including the nerves in your mouth and nose you can taste it from the inside they entered the expansive treatment room toward one end was a long cherrypaneled nurses station in front of it was a horseshoe of eight leatherette recliner chairs each had an iv pole and a side chair for a guest there was a bank of tvs above the nurses station so that patients could try to divert themselves during treatment grace gazed around the room all but two of the recliners were occupied in one lay a woman sound asleep under a blanket the iv tube twisting to accommodate her position her bandanna had slipped off her head revealing tufts of browngray hair scattered around an otherwise bald pate her pretty gold hoop earrings contrasted sharply with the grayish cast of her skin feeling nauseous even before the treatment began grace followed judi to her designated recliner how hale and hearty she must look in comparison to the other women here she still had her hair her skin one of her best attributes still had its unblemished glow by the next time i come ill look like them she thought she managed a sad smile at the sudden notion that the room looked like some kind of weird day spa in reversea place that took beautiful women and made them tired bald hags spa toxique she thought and then realized she had said the words out loud dont think of it that way judi said as if she had heard versions of the dark humor before think of the medicine as pacman hunting through your body munching all the evil cells judi donned her latex gloves and asked grace if she was ready first i am going to insert this needle into the port dr hollister implanted during surgery the port was right below graces right collarbone she could feel it just under her skin take a deep breath grace inhaled and clutched the arms of the recliner as judi passed the needle through her skin and into her upper chest surprisingly it didnt hurt as much as she had anticipated now were going to draw some blood through this tube to see what your cell counts are today is really a formality and a baseline because were pretty sure your red and white blood cells and platelets are all present in healthy numbers but as you go through your chemo your counts will drop considerably we cant start a treatment if the counts are too low in fact sometimes you may need medication to bring them up otherwise theres a danger of bleeding or infection or severe anemia great once the tests were done judi returned with the drugssome form of steroid and one to make her drowsy next was a large syringe filled with what looked like cherry koolaid but was in fact the cellular poison adriamycin in spite of herself grace watched the liquid pass into her chest from within her bloodstream grace could smell and taste the powerful medicationa sharp almost musty odor reminiscent of some sort of cheese a taste like like what just close your eyes and relax judi said to accept the things i cannot change with the help of the sedative and the serenity prayer she began dozing off cloaked in the conviction that soon this theateroftheabsurd production would end and she would find herself back in her life courage to change the things i can relax and the wisdom to know the difference relax relax the dream she drifted into was at first pleasant the lake two young girls playing together at the waters edge she and her sister charlotte their mother arms folded back to them standing on top of the water gazing off at nothing in particular their father shoulder against a tree eyes narrowed watching watching did he know already what he was going to do to his girls had he already started the dream became a strange drugaided montage of images in which grace was both a participant and an observer totally aware she was dreaming yet completely immersed in the scenes when the itching first began it was as if it were happening to the grace in the dream she wondered if somehow seeing her father like this watching her watching charlotte knowing what he had done to them was causing the uncomfortable sensation the itching increased and now was joined by a burning sensation her arms her belly her face along with the girl in her dream grace began to scratch over just minutes the itching grew more intense and the burning more disturbing the dream blurred then faded altogether grace opened her eyes and raised her arm her fingers were swollen and stiff crimson welts with irregular pale margins interlocked with one another like a jigsaw puzzle until they virtually covered all the skin on the arm her belly too was covered and her other arm hives she thought remembering something similar from when she was a teen similar but not nearly as bad hives the burning especially on her face was becoming quite frightening something else was becoming frightening tooshe was beginning to have trouble breathing a tight sensation in her chest that made it hard to draw air in hello help me please she called out her voice was harsh and cracked and not nearly as forceful as she expected it to be help me her lips felt badly swollenswollen and on fire the breathing problem was rapidly getting worse she needed to sit up to get air in needed to sit up needed to sit up now there were footsteps then voices oh my god grace can you hear me judis voice nod if you can hear me get a stretcher out here and get her to the examining room theres not much room in there just get the stretcher run that saline wide open grace youve got to lie back get oxygen on her a mask five liters or more tell carla to call nineoneone get an ambulance here also tell her to call dr dantonio tell him shes having an anaphylactic reaction we need the crash cart stat epinephrine zeropointfive draw it up ill give it also benadryl twentyfive iv make it fifty shes hardly moving any air get a bloodpressure cuff on her quick here help me lift her onto the stretcher jesus carla did you make those calls shes not moving any air i cant get a bp epi is in get her into the corridor by the examining room we need the crash cart jesus this has never happened here absolutely never grace can you hear me squeeze my hand if you can hear me no bp carla are they coming graces panic had exploded it was as if someone had pulled a broad piece of tape tightly across her nose and mouth no matter how hard she sucked air just wasnt getting in she struggled against the hands that held her struggled to sit up she clawed at the oxygen mask she pounded her fists on the bed finally exhausted she sank back still trying with all her strength to get in even a tiny bit of air im going to try and intubate her have you done it before in advanced life support class never in an emergency like this what else can i do grace felt her head being tilted back a metallic rod was being jammed into the back of her throat everythings swollen back there i cant make out any landmark dammit wheres the rescue squad help me please god grant me grant me grace knew she hadnt said the wordsknew she couldnt she felt herself stop struggling she felt herself stop trying to suck in air overhead the lights dimmed her panic lessened the words of the nurses became garbled and distant a veil of darkness settled over her accompanied by a growling lowpitched drone the droning sound grew softer softer finally there was silence chapter spurred by an unseasonably cold rainy spring near record numbers of meals were being served at the open hearth kitchen almost every night for will the place had always been an island in his often furiously paced life tonight he knew asking for any kind of significant diversion from the place was probably asking too much last night as he sat in his apartment with patty moriarity someone had walked into a motel room on the south shore and fired three lethal shots into one of the leading neurosurgeons in the countrya man who just happened to be one of the partners in an expanding highly successful hmo victim number four four out of out of how many even worse the killer had made the point of calling will essentially to announce that he was going to do it hey you you gonna just stand there staring into the flames or are you gonna stir that pasta benois beane his gentle face crinkled in a trademark grin stood hands on hips just a few feet away hey beano sorry in case you couldnt tell im a little distracted here look all stirred you do that very well well have to see about bringing in more surgeons on pasta night its hard going for you huh yeah you might say that beano whats been happening to my life is absolutely insane i want to fight but theres nothing to push against i want to lash out but theres nothing even to hit i dont know who framed me i dont know why i dont know what to do about it and as if that craziness wasnt enough this frigging killer thinks im his spiritual brother joined at the ideological hip by our mutual hatred for hmos i heard about that brain surgeon what you may not have heard was that the murderer called me ahead of time to proclaim his intention to kill another one of our enemies the pipers on the loose and he must be paid he said lord the cops been any help will conjured up images of last evenings embryonic connection with patty but couldnt even manage a smile for nearly an hour the two of them had sat together on his couch his arm around her her head resting on his shoulder neither of them was willing to speak or break the mood in any way will sensed that their bond was forged as much by exhaustion and frustration as by their attraction to each other and he was determined not to read too much into the moment still they were together touching then suddenly having spoken barely a word patty had stood kissed him first on the cheek then briefly on the mouth mumbled an apology and left just like that they seem to be doing the best they can beano will said but the guy is good he knows handguns he knows explosives he knows surveillance electronics he studies his victims and finds ways to get at them without any witnesses and why is he doing this he only shares things with me a bit at a time its like a game but from what hes let me in on so far someone close to himhis mother it appearswas killed by what he perceives was managedcare policy im guessing she was discharged prematurely from an er or a psych ward and went ahead and killed herself she wouldnt be the first ive lost two clients whom we couldnt get into a detox because of refusal by their hmo beane donned a padded mitt and helped pour a mountain of spaghetti into a giant colander well he said i dont want to make things any worse for you but there is something i need to talk to you about he turned to a gangly teenager who was moving dishes out to the serving area arielle can you take over for will please get some help emptying those two other pots into this strainer rinse the pasta then fill up two of the deep serving pans glad to beane put his arm around wills shoulder and guided him to his office im not sure whether or not you know it will but after grace davis ran into you at your office she and her husband mark began coming in here to volunteer three times so far i think maybe four coming back completed a circle for her i was seriously considering hiring her part time to help out our counseling staff as soon as her chemotherapy was over although she was before my time when she used to be a client here her story and the way she carries herself now certainly impressed me me too i felt terrible having to tell her i couldnt do her surgery and even worse having to tell her why beanes grave expression brought a sudden chill is she all right will asked her husband called just a little while ago she had an allergic reaction during her first dose of chemotherapy he pulled a pink telephonemessage pad sheet from his pocket and read the words he said it was shock anafilacktic shock will felt ill anaphylactic shock was the most fearsome of allergic reactions massive histamine release causing hives precipitous bloodpressure drop due to widespread pooling of blood in dilated vessels and airway obstruction due to swelling of the membranes in the throat and bronchial tubes it was a terrifying medical emergency that was often fatal did she die he managed dreading the answer according to her husband almost one of the rescuesquad people performed an emergency tracheotomy in the cancer clinic shes in intensive care at your hospital im not sure whether or not shes regained consciousness thanks for telling me i can call the unit for information are you going to go over there will pictured sid silverman puffed with anger insisting that he not set foot in the hospital there was no legal order to back up the demand but will had seen no reason to make his situation worse by putting silverman to the test now there was one in the morning he said ill go in and see how shes doing first thing in the morning given the choice this night between table cleanup which was his usual job and staying behind the counter to serve will chose the latter he was in no shape for much contact with the public gina the fulltime staff person in charge of scheduling and deploying volunteers put him on salads the line of clients a number of whom still had their own home but could afford neither food nor fuel seemed endless will recalled the early days when the open hearth was more of a food pantry than a kitchen and marveled at the energy of the place tonight four paid staff were working alongside fifteen or so volunteers ranging from ten years old to seventy it was a good bet that none of those volunteers knew will was one of the founders and that was certainly the way he wanted it what he didnt want however was the notion that before long without a medical license he and the twins might end up in the line on the other side of the counter im sorry doctor but youre a little overqualified for our burger king trainee program hey there mister am i allowed two salads if i pass on the spaghetti and meatballs patty eyed him from over the foodprotection hood she had on her worn leather jacket and a floppy black and red leather cap that looked perfect on her i would hate to offend the memory of my sainted mother he said that spaghetti sauce is her recipe no its not youre right its not my sainted mother had trouble boiling water but she really would have loved that sauce i still think ill pass she said although i no longer have to be as light on my feet as i was when i was chasing after a certain serial killer they took you off the case to all intents and purposes they did yes shit im sorry will glanced at the line which was starting to build up and passed across two plastic bowls of salad dressings are over there he said i highly recommend the ranch and highly dont recommend the diet italian finish your salad give me fifteen minutes and we can blow this joint i have all the time in the world she said along with the hospital and a remarkable antiquecar museum will considered steeles pond to be among the best things about fredrickston tucked in the woods just west of the city two miles around steeles had paddleboats a popcorn cart and a hotdog stand in the summer and picturebook skating in the winter the air scrubbed by an afternoon of rain was crisp and cleanperfect for a walk patty said she followed him to the small parking area at the south end of the pond locked the camaro and walked with him to the waters edge after a few silent minutes staring at the dark still surface she slipped her arm in his and let him guide her to the rutted dirt track that circumnavigated the pond so she began sorry i left the way i did last night my brain was threatening to explode with all that was going on inside it no problem i enjoyed spending what time we did together me too was it okay for you to desert your post at the salad station people were still coming in ive always been the last choice to be stationed at salads maybe its the handeye coordination required there the trainee they replaced me with is already twice as good as i was benois beane the director was relieved to see me go having spoken with benois about you ill bet hes never relieved to see you go its really an amazing place you must be so proud of what you started thanks it wasnt just me but youre right i am theres no way the little group of us all those years ago could possibly have envisioned what it was going to become in a way it made me sad so much poverty i kept thinking that maybe someday it wont be needed wouldnt that be something of course such a world would require a few consecutive federal administrations that actually cared about educating the kids and making sure they have jobs waiting for them when they finish school and giving them reasons not to take drugs its all about having hope patty said its all about hope so youre off the case yup the killing last night was the last straw my co felt a reorganization was called for so in the beginning it was my case and now im off it altogether even though i really havent done anything wrong except maybe have two x chromosomes actually i have my cos permission to stay available to wayne brasco just in case he cant read my writing on any of the three or four feet of reports notes and documents ive got to turn over to him tomorrow not that brasco would be interested in anything ive generated you okay about this i dont know maybe maybe its for the best the thing i feel worst about is my father he never wanted me to be a cop in the first place i really wanted to be part of the team that nails this guy its hard youre playing the killers game by the killers rules and hes damn good at it i guess im not good at dealing with failure but i also know this isnt some sort of contest the blood all over that motelroom bed was quite real and even though he was a philandering jerk i feel awful about that surgeon from what i can tell he actually knew from our warning that there was potential danger last night but apparently seducing yet another trophy was more important to him than staying alive do you think a woman killed him its certainly possible if it was a man dr richard leaf must have been one surprised puppy they became aware of movement to their right and left a moment before three youths two white one black stepped from behind trees on either side of the path two of them were built like football linemen the third considerably smaller was wearing a celtics jacket and a red sox cap he stepped forward to confront them his hands twitching excitedly at his sides he had acnescarred skin and emitted a dense aroma of marijuana had will been alone he would have spun around and taken off but none of the three had a weapon that he could see and patty showed no inclination to run instead she continued holding gently on to his arm at one moment she tilted her head just enough to touch his shoulder he could sense absolutely no tension in her well well the teen said it appears we have visitors to our toll area we hope you are prepared to pay what do you want patty asked firmly well that wicked hat of yours for starters right guys right you are dude and for seconds oh um let me see how about your wallets yeah their wallets hey good idea dude good idea patty slipped her arm free of wills she pinched her cap by the bill took it off and wearily wiped imaginary sweat off her forehead with the back of her hand then she set the cap back in place actually dude its a terrible idea she said i have two other things you might want to see dude before we give you this cap and our wallets wanna guess what they are huh dude wanna guess she grinned at him most menacingly well first theres my badge and second perhaps a source of even more concern to you assholes is my gun she slipped her hand inside her jacket but the silent vote had already been taken in unison the three youths whirled and bolted off into the woods patty watched them go then slipped her hand back inside wills arm lets see she said where were we why didnt you bust them he asked and ruin a perfectly lovely romantic walk i dont think so there are plenty of punks like those around but evenings with a handsome funny doctor are pretty tough to come by is your gun really in there it was before i locked it in the trunk of my car i try not to be packing when i take romantic walks me too will said besides the two big ones were all blubber i could have handled them if i had to i know ive read all about your temper remember theyll never know how lucky they were now where were we he turned and cradling her face between his hands set his mouth on hers and rested it there until her lips parted their second kiss with will bracing his back against the trunk of a sprawling chestnut tree lasted a minute or more now do you see why i let them go patty whispered i see said the blind man as he picked up his hammer and saw ugh and i promise not to report you for dereliction of duty will put his arm around her and for a time they just walked you thinking about the case he asked finally i guess there were reasons they demoted me to being brascos assistant after it became apparent these were serial killings but i havent done anything to deserve being dropped from the team they needed a scapegoat is there anything you can do about it can your father intervene i doubt he would but i dont want him to anyway this is my gig i understand im not going to give up thoughespecially as long as youre our main connection to the killer ill keep at it on my own time if i have to any way i can help just keep letting me vent will ive looked at these murders from every angle i could think of but i still cant get past the feeling that theres something im missing or something i havent done maybe its in those letters maybe speaking of which m and n she said tucked neatly beneath the hand that had removed countless brain tumors by day and from what weve learned so far stroked countless womens bottoms by night i dont know why but try as i might im having trouble warming up to the guy thats okay hes having trouble warming up at all m and n huh do you think after we finish here we could go back to my place and use my set to play a little homicide scrabble triple word double letter i before e except after c precisely okay sergeant heres the way this all shakes down for me this is a family of killers at work not just one i mean family as in brothers and sistersat least one of each maybe more i feel almost certain of it the guy whos calling me said us over and over it looks to me like some managedcare company just tried to cut corners with the wrong patient and now its backfired on them all given their policies it was only a matter of time before someone went postal on them these killers are furious over the death of their mother and they wont stop until everyone everyplace knows what happened to her then why havent they just gone right to the press in time they probably will but at the moment even though theyre smart and professional theyre also insane and arrogant and imbued with a bitter angry sense of irony i think they want to involve me because having a doctor on their side validates what theyre doing theyre grooming me to be their spokesman just as i was for the hippocrates society but now youve fallen from grace big time i think if i dont set things straight and get back to work soon theyre going to lose interest in me theyve chosen me to present their case to the public and unless i can get out from under the charges against me theyll have nothing theyre either going to demand i find out who did this to me and get myself back on the staff at the hospital or or decide youre not worth the energy and maybe pay you a little visit with a couple of more letters rterbecnmn a phrase a name a clue with the scrabble board on the coffee table by the couch patty and will took turns arranging and rearranging the tiles look she said e temb r september or november or decembereven october if hes holding back a couple of os will shuffled around the remaining tiles searching for the suggestion of a word then shrugged and shook his head the mothers birthday maybe what about remember patty spelled out reme br then lined up the t c n and n remember somebody that may be it if it is its not nearly as obscure as i would have guessed whatever it is there still seem to be a lot of missing letters thats a frightening thought wei mean they have a cryptographer working on the letters there are ten of them now he should be able to come up with some serious possibilities heres some more will said lets see you solve this puzzle he placed tiles spelling ki s me across a triple word lets see now patty used the k and put an do beneath it she slid her hands behind wills neck and drew him close i never really liked scrabble before he said thats because you never played it with me at that instant the phone began ringing once twice its him three times four reluctantly will pulled away and hit the speaker button on his phone yes anticipating the frightening electronic voice he squeezed pattys hand will grant micelli here augie micelli patty and will sagged in unison hey this is a surprise will said believe me it is to me too listen i sure as hell hope youve been staying in shape during your time off because youve got a long tough road ahead of you ive decided to take your case and do whatever i can to help you out of the mess youre in will listened for the slurring that would suggest micelli was in his cups but the law doctor sounded sharp and focused thats wonderful he said im assuming you didnt take any fentanyl if youre lying to me about that were not going to be friends anymore i didnt take anything good that part of things is settled i spoke to a pal of mine in the das office theyre still of a mind to prosecute you for attempted manslaughter or something but i dont think it will take much of a breakthrough on our part for them to change their position lets get to it then the first thing weve got to do is somehow get them to back off and give us some time and space then weve got to get your license and staff privileges restored were not going to take this lying down just show me where to push will said our first second and third priorities are to figure out how a drug got into your body when you never took it after we know how we can start working on who and why put your thinking cap on and give me a call ill be in the office after eight tomorrow should i ask why youve decided to do this no micelli replied sharply i should be asking why i decided to do this will listened to the dial tone for a few seconds then shut off the speaker hey patty said thats great youve got yourself a lawyer ill bet hes very together when hes sober well hopefully dealing with you will help give him religion as far as that goes now youve got a team on your sidehim and me thats some team your new barrister did make one small error though he did yes she pushed him onto his back and settled gently on top of him he said we werent going to take this lying down chapter it was just after eleven when will entered the busy lobby of fredrickston general hospital from what he could recall not even his first visit back home after the separation from maxine felt this strange less than two weeks ago he had entered the hospital as a widely respected surgeon prepared to perform a difficult case by that days end he had been vilified as a narcotic addict signed himself out of the intensivecare unit against medical advice and gone home with a warning from the hospital president not to return to the place until the allegations against him had been resolved now here he was back at fgh again but like the monopoly square just visiting balanced against the uneasy tension of his return to the hospital were the feelings and sensations lingering from the night just past he and patty had made exquisite love then slept and loved again and finally dozed off until almost dawn she was at once caring and patient sensual and passionate she was witty and quick gentle and edgy absolutely cynical yet surprisingly naive and vulnerable and physically she was as pleasing comfortable and imaginative as he would ever need a woman to be although mark davis was the one who had picked eleven as the time to meet at the icu will knew the hour was about as good for him as it could be morning rounds were over for most of the docs and many of those who werent in the or were back in their offices in addition to his partners he certainly had friends on the staff whom he wouldnt mind running into but the majority he would be just as happy avoiding even with the favorable hour his return to the corridors of fgh wasnt pleasant by the time he reached the unit he had passed four physicians and three nurses although prior to the incident he was cordial enough with all of them none greeted him with any warmth or tried to extend their brief encounter into a conversation and one of the docs pointedly ignored him will wasnt surprised over the years beginning with a truncated medschool course on alcoholism and other addictions he had been to half a dozen or more aa meetings from the patterns of the stories shared at the meetings and the scientific studies discussed in the courses he had no doubt that alcoholism like addiction to other drugs was a medical illnessa psychological genetic and biochemical disease as opposed to the moral issue so many made it out to be unfortunately many other caregivers did not share that opinion doctors and nurses caught in the nightmare of drug and alcohol dependence too often found themselves deprived in their colleagues minds of the right to be ill and the chance to recover simply because they were healthcare professionals and should have known better the pervasive prejudice made will terribly sad even before he himself became a victim of it mark davis wearing a gray turtleneck and tweed sport coat was waiting just outside the door to the unit he was an angular intense man who sounded over the phone this morning as if he were still reserving judgment as to whether will had or had not gone into the operating room stoned on narcotics they just brought her back from getting an xray and theyre washing her up right now he said the nurse said it would be twenty minutes fine do you know who her nurse is anne something hajjar shes excellent one of the very best thats good to know visiting grace like this is very kind of you we dont have much family and her mother is too frail to make the trip up from new york nonsense we do go back quite a ways what she went through yesterday must have been absolutely terrifying im anxious to see her and also to translate medicalspeak if you need me to mark listen there are a couple of things id like to do around the hospital while i have the chance why dont i meet you back here in twenty minutes is this connected in any way with what you are going through will studied the teachers expression and saw only concern as a matter of fact it is yes im going to retrace some of my steps from that morning to see if i can figure out who could have done this to meand how i hope you find whatever it is youre searching for mark said you mean a great deal to grace and so you also mean a great deal to me will headed off pausing for a moment to glance back at the fine man whom once filthy intoxicated angry grace peng would one day meet beguile and marry you never know he thought as much regarding his current plight as the one grace had dealt with by finally letting go of her fears and immersing herself in recovery you stay in the game when the goings tough because you never know how its going to come out in the hopes that something anything would connect will headed back to the oncall room to recreate physically and in his mind the few hours between falling asleep that morning and stepping into the operating room the idea of doing this had been his new attorneys weve got to start somewhere micelli had said when will called and agreed to pay a modest retainer to seal their relationship and i suggest the beginning for the time being i can handle the cops and the courts but sooner or later preferably sooner weve got to come up with some answers before you tell me anything more retrace your steps and cement every movement of that morning in your mind well talk later in the day ignoring the whispers and the stares will went to the surgical oncall room and unlocked the door using the keypad it had been just after two when he went there for the first time that early morning he then slept uninterrupted until the wakeup call he had put in for at fivefifteen could he have been called out of the room for something and simply not remembered impossible could he somehow have been drugged earlier in the night and then injected with fentanyl while he slept not impossible but far out and the powerful narcotic rapidly absorbed would have had to be in a timerelease forma mode of delivery that existed only in a skin patch being both superstitious and a creature of habit it was not difficult to retrace his movements and actions from that morning when he reached the staff lounge in the er two of the nurses actually went out of their way to come in and ask how he was doingbright spots in an otherwise gray homecoming he fought back the urge to plug in the i didnt willingly take any drugs tape and simply thanked them for being nonjudgmental one of the women a mother of two in her early thirties named bobbi hamill checked the calendar and confirmed that the day he was drugged was her day to bring in the customary dozen doughnuts will and she had been quite friendly over the years and there was no way he could imagine her purposely trying to ruin him but then again there was no way he could imagine anyone purposely trying to ruin him the coffee they drank every morning in the er was from a pot prepared in the room and replenished by whoever finished off the dregs neither of the nurses could remember someone pouring a cup for will the oj they drank came in individual cartons will wondered to himself whether someone might have injected one of those cartons with fentanyl then set it aside until it was the right moment to hand it to him the possibility didnt seem that ridiculous but he had no recollection at all of who had passed the carton over to him finally he used bobbis memory and the staffing chart from that day to make a list of all those who were or might have been in the room the only person who stood out at all was gordo gordo as will retraced the path he would have taken from the er to the surgeons lounge he wondered about the man who had been his partner and friend for so many years he wouldnt be the first to work closely with someone and even see him socially but not really know him everyone had a dark side he tried to dismiss the possibility that gordo was the one but couldnt somebody had done this to him that much was certain the lounge was deserted will opened his locker using a key empty no surprise there his stuffsoap shampoo deodorant watch journals change of socks and underwearwas undoubtedly packed in an evidence box at the fredrickston police station mentally he retraced the steps he would have followed when dressing for the or nothing unusual the hair covers shoe covers and paper masks were all in boxes by the door to the scrub room gordo was already in the or when will was dressing could he have tampered with a paper mask or hair cover knowing that will was likely to be the next person to take one again far out but remotely possible with several scenarios playing in his brain each one of them seriously flawed will headed back to the icu anne hajjar the nurse he had felt closest to over the years was standing just inside the glass doors welcome back she said weve been worried about you another kindness wills battered faith began ever so slowly to return its been hell he said but im still out there turning over stones to find out how this could have happened to me you just make sure youre okay as far as drugs go she said her almond eyes fixed on him because if youre not if youre fooling yourself nothing will be okay i appreciate that will said and he did grace daviss husband around hes in with her she okay shes alive given what she went through thats okay the kid who did the trach had never done one before what a brave thing to do you said it he had a horrible decision to make and went with what he believed weve done everything we can to make sure grace and her husband understand that unfortunately while he definitely saved her life the guy made a bit of a mess of things the ent people are going to have to repair the damage to her trachea but before they can do that shes aspirated some blood and now has a bit of a pneumonia just make sure she gets you taking care of her until shes out of here thats very kind no problem ill stay close to her speaking of getting out of here it looks as if your patient kurt goshtigian is going to make it you know what will said ive been so wrapped up in my own deal that i completely forgot to check on him of course that may also have something to do with the fact that he and his family are suing me for like a gazillion dollars maybe theyll back off once hes home he really has had a tough go of it i lost the pool when he made it through last sunday his familys in there with him now so you may want to steer clear of room one thanks for the warning i think youll remember the room grace is in anne said with a wry grin it was yours will paused at the doorway to graces cubicle and tried to imagine what he looked like when he was transferred there from the er on a vent grace looked surprisingly good she was pale and extremely weak but awake and alert communicating with her husband by hand signals some carefully mouthed words and the clipboard and blank progress notepaper will knew only too well she had oxygen running into her lungs through the tracheotomy that had saved her life on the wall to the right side of the room her latest chest xrays were displayed on an illuminated view boxtwo views one shot from her back through her front and one taken from side to side at a brief glance will could easily make out the fluffy white density in her left lung that represented the pneumonia he had been told about greetings he said grace managed a weak smile and a wave in addition to her pallor her respirations were slightly rapid and shallower than normal so long as her condition remained like this the icu was exactly the place she should be you ok she wrote define okay i feel as though ive been hit by an invisible bus im trying to fight back at whoever nearly killed me but nobody seems to notice how about you grace made a soso sign she seems a little more worn out than she was earlier this morning her husband observed maybe they shouldnt have taken her down to radiology for those xrays we wheel patients down there if we can because theyre better quality than the films done by the portable machine will replied heres one of the reasons shes not feeling better this white stuff right back here a pneumonia he pointed to the area on himself at that moment another finding in the films caught his eye there was a small density inside the wall of graces right chest just below her third rib perfectly round and much whiter even than the bone which suggested that the object was metallic the lateral view confirmed the objects presence and located it toward the front and fairly deep almost certainly it was a bb look at this he said grace smiled bb she wrote brother shot me how old were you on purpose who knows i never even knew about this mark said my wife shot what a mysterious exotic woman you are grace having met the man though i dont have to stretch my imagination too far to see him doing it and it not be an accident grace waved him off but her expression suggested she agreed did your parents take you to a doctor will asked grace nodded i imagine he said trying to get it out was more trouble than it was worth and that it would either work itself out or stay there for the rest of your life another nod obviously he was right because there it is there it is she wrote and there it will stay keep your spirits up i appreciate that listen dont worry about me somehow ill come out of this okay and dont worry about whats going to happen with your chemo i know there are alternatives right now you should just concern yourself with getting better well i think i should leave you to rest thanx im just grateful you made it what a thing to go through you too will smiled kissed her on the cheek shook marks hand and turned toward the door dr grant mark said will turned back mark had moved closer to the xray view boxes and was peering at graces films yes if this bb is here on her chest films then wouldnt you expect it to be on her mammograms as well some of the views yes of course well it wasnt there pardon it wasnt there are you sure as you can probably tell dr grant i am a very meticulous mannot obnoxious about it i hope but i am a stickler for details there was no bb on graces breast filmsnot any of them did you see it there hon she shook her head tentatively never thought about it she wrote will tried to remember the distinctive density in grace daviss mammograms but he couldnt it would only have been on a couple of the viewsperhaps two or three out of tenbut from what he could tell it definitely should have been on some he did sense that just as with these films had there been a bb on the mammograms he would not only have noticed but commented on it instantly a meteor shower of questions flashed across his mind could the camera angles of the mammograms possibly have cut out the bb possible but not likely could he grace and mark davis all have missed the bb in the other set of films again possible but not likely did he ever read the radiologists dictated report doubtful there wasnt any question about the cancer that was there so what the radiologist had to say really didnt matter to him could graces mammograms have been accidentally switched with another womans ugh the possibility was sickening but not really feasible because the cancer in the xray had been biopsied and confirmed by a pathologist nevertheless it appeared quite possible that some sort of mixup had occurred over two decades of working in hospitals will had encountered almost every imaginable permutation of error working under enormous time pressures with massive volumes of patients and procedures handicapped by human frailties imperfections miscommunications and personality disorders to say nothing of fatigue mechanical failure and the vagaries of biology caregivers made mistakes many of those mistakes passed by totally unnoticed or caused no inconvenience of any great magnitude some of them altered lives and some either devastated lives or sadly ended them will knew he had enough problems of his own to work out without trying to track down the source of this odd conflict still he also knew there was no way he wouldnt do it guys listen he said i dont have a good explanation for this but im sure there is oneat least i think there is one ill check with someone in radiology here and then ill speak to the person at the cancer center who did those mammograms it was only then that he recalled his unpleasant encounter over the phone with radiologist charles newcomber that time he had gone over newcombers head and prevailed but it would be a pleasure to put the pompous prig on the hot seat once again please keep us posted mark said oh dont worry will replied knowing that this time the encounter with newcomber would occur in person and that this time he would have the hospital xrays tucked under his arm i will alone in his office augie micelli sipped on a brandy stared across the room at a spider plying its trade in the corner and scratched boxes around words on a yellow legal padhis way since college of working through problems from the portable cd player on the floor by his desk gene ammonss soulful tenor sax was playing willow weep for me a drug addict ammons was known as jug perhaps for the way he drank micelli thought fondly or maybe for the stretches he did in the jug before at fortynine he died although micelli had been there at his desk for several hours with a drink close at hand he was still far more sober than not there was significant work to do so he had been treading the delicate line between maintaining a clear head and keeping the shakes in check it was a case that when all was said and done might not even pay the electric bill but if will grant was telling the truth if he had been framed and was now being purged from medicine much as micelli himself had been taking the case had been the right thing to do now the trick was seeing to it that grant never made it anywhere near a courtroom and that meant figuring out how he could have been railroaded so smoothly spread out across the desk and on the floor around him were articles xeroxed book pages and printouts from the internet all dealing with the narcotic fentanyl usual dose onset of action route of administration duration of action pharmacologic effects side effects symptoms of overdose chemical formula metabolites gene ammons had moved on to i remember you micellis favorite on the album which was to say the one that made him feel most blue not good he muttered as he considered the case not good at all the only explanation that fit all the facts was that will grant was both an addict and a liar micelli bounced the eraser of his pencil on an article dealing with the pharmacokinetics of sufentanil ten times more powerful than fentanyl eight hundred times more powerful than morphine and of carfentanil which was nearly fifteen times more powerful even than that he found himself thinking about a statement from one of his lawschool professors and wrote it in block letters at the bottom of the yellow sheet if your beliefs dont fit with the facts then just pound the hell out of the facts until they do he snatched up the phone and dialed will grant answered on the first ring okay doctor micelli said making a series of boxes around the words take me through that day again chapter embarrassed angry frustrated humiliated impotent patty couldnt remember ever having felt more uncomfortable for more than two months her life had been consumed by the need to find a killer and bring himor herdown now to all intents her part in the case was over she would be helping to keep the daytoday operations of her unit moving along while wayne brasco would be working with sean digby who had come on board well after she did and a veteran detective named brooks who had transferred to middlesex from hampden just a month ago look at it this way jack court had tried to explain to her with me tied up with this case along with the others youre going to be like running this place brooks is too new to have that responsibility and digby is too green the rest of them arent nearly as competent as you are bullshit in some ways it felt as if she was leaving the force altogether she sat at her desk grateful that the phone hadnt rung and that no one had felt the need to stop in and talk to her set in neat piles on the floor around her were the tangible products of countless hours of work and thought about the managedcare killerstacks of documents computer printouts interviews newspaper clippings photographs and transcripts it wasnt right she was thinking as she identified each of the piles with a carefully printed sheet and bound them with heavy rubber bands there was some sort of commission or aclu lawyer someplace who would be more than happy to take up her banner and prove in court that she was being removed from her case without just cause but then even if she could find such a champion her career on the force would be over it was loselose for her all the way around if she could just hang in and get past this disappointment and embarrassment there would be other times for her to prove herself in fact although she wasnt about to tell court or brasco she wasnt totally certain she was going to let go of this case yet even thoughts of will and the night just past werent enough to give her flagging spirits much of a boost he was a bright caring terrific guytotally genuine and very attractive making love with him was great while it was happening but she knew as she suspected he did too that both of them were stressed vulnerable and needy the passion spontaneity and chemistry between them were real and she had absolutely no regrets but she suspected will would agree that they would probably have been better off to have waited stacked on top of one another the piles of exhaustive work reached two feet or more reluctantly patty hauled them down to courts office as far as she could tell neither the lieutenant nor brasco had looked at much of what she had amassed to this point and there wasnt much chance they would now the two men were sniggering about something but stopped abruptly when she arrived and didnt bother to explain what it was all right pat court said with fake cheer lets get this over and get you onto a couple of new cases i thought maybe we could take a few minutes and i could explain how all this is organized she said i have these areas crossreferenced heres the key i put together for that she passed over three sheets single spacedthe product of hours of work brasco favored her with a disinterested grin and set the sheets down on the stack where they would likely remain for eternity court perhaps sensing an impending escalation in tension cleared his throat so pat he said is there anything else you feel we should know before we get on with business well yes as a matter of fact there is okay then go on could court have possibly been more patronizing brasco clearly had one use and one use only for women but the lieutenant had a bright social worker wife and two daughters surely his disregard for her couldnt just be that she was female thanks she said i just want you to know that something feels off to me about this whole thing i keep sensing that the real object of this guys anger isnt the managedcare executives its usi mean the police brasco raised his hands in bewilderment sergeant maybe its because i dont have a masters degree like you do but that theory of yours just went right over my head whats to question this whackjobs mother croaks because of something a managedcare company does to hermaybe a premature hospital discharge maybe refusal to have her evaluated in an emergency ward they do such things all the time only this time the lady dies and her kid just happens to be a professional killeror else he becomes a damn good one in a big hurry he sets out to right the wrong of her death while at the same time humiliating the hmos and terrifying their executives an arrogant egomaniac son of a bitch court added just like all the others who go around killing to make a point i know thats what the profiler is telling us patty said and that may be the whole deal but but what brasco demanded his voice up an octave or so it just seems too neat thats all why would he just tell us its about his mother the way that he did because thats what its all about brasco exclaimed hes insane over losing her now we even know her name brasco was mindless of the glare from court patty felt as if she had been slapped what are you talking about the letters brasco replied now clearly into his braggadocio too deeply to back out after that neurosurgeon bought it i went over all the letters with the cryptographer it only took us a couple of hours the m and n were the key according to him theres a ninety percent chance the killers spelling remember clementine the mothers name is clementine thats right so now all we have to do is scan the databases of all the hospitals and also the medical examiners office looking for the death of a woman named clementine meanwhile were going to wayne listen court cut in if you havent any further questions for pat perhaps its best to just let her get on with her work patty had already caught on that brasco was supposed to shut up about whatever it was they were planning to do it took somewhat longer for him to come to that conclusion huh oh yeah sure he said listen thanks for all the paperwork doll well keep you posted patty willed herself not to burst into tears and also not to leap on brasco and claw off his face at the moment there wasnt a damn thing she could do except to find a safe quiet place to lick her wounds if brasco caught the killer good for him but she decided for certain at that moment one way or another he was going to have competition you got it she said head high she made a military aboutface and left courts office taking pains to close the door softly behind her wayne what in the hell were you thinking court said as soon as it was clear patty wasnt going to return i thought we decided she was out if shes out then just let her go i agree with you that trapping the killer through that drugaddicted doctor is the way to go but sharing anything with her can only mess things up shes screwing the guy for chrissakes jack court slid the blackandwhite eightbyten photo from an envelope on his desk patty and will were locked in an embrace just inside the open door of his condo a work of art brasco said its a good thing the guy who took this owed you a favor brasco puffed out his chest like a pigeon sometimes its better to have a little bargaining session with a perp than to bust him or even better her keep your methods to yourself wayne as you can see they work ol garyd been set up in the bushes opposite grants place off and on for days this wasnt exactly what he was looking for but hes photographed ms moriarity before and there she was at five am this morning all blearyeyed and sexed out given the high profiles of grant and the managedcare killings he felt it might have made it all the way to the front page im glad you were able to dissuade him i have much better uses for this photo like payback for a certain colonel tommy moriarity badmouthed me out of a promotion i deserved when we bust the managedcare killer i dont want his frigging daughter snagging the headlines now with this photo theres not a damn thing moriarity will do about my taking her off the team after we get this jerk brasco said maybe we should have a little talk with tough tommy about a couple of promotions maybe we should court said maybe we should at that so are we all set with the vds people just about later today they tell me believe me this is the way to go and they assure you they can do this thats what they say good enough stay on them so long as they dont screw things up were all set for tonight meanwhile well keep up the search for clementine court examined the photo once more cozy little scene this i cant believe iceberg pattys caved in like this i suspect tommyll do just about anything to protect his little darling from the fallout ill tell you something else too whether its drugs or aiding and abetting or both will grant is dirty hes going all the way down with this and if were lucky shes going to fall with him with her mood as gray as the afternoon sky patty took route north to lexington she had beethovens darkly heroic third symphony the eroica playing at almost top volume given the disillusionment and the politics of deception that surrounded the piece it was the perfect choice for the day this was the masterpiece beethoven had originally planned to publish as the bonaparte symphony when in napoleon turned his back on democracy and the people and crowned himself emperor of france in a beethoven biography she had read not long ago it was written that upon hearing of the tyrants action the composer ripped the title page from the score patty knew that jack court bore some resentment toward her until this latest session though she never realized how much wayne brasco and he were always tight but his behavior today was unconscionablerisky too given that tommy moriarity could easily quash any advancement for him should he learn about the way his daughter had been treated well she wasnt going to tell her father anything but neither was she going to slink off the case on which she had worked so diligently brasco with all the intuition of a mollusk seemed to be following a script written by the killer find clementine get the names of her children and arrest the suckers it was as simple as that and maybe it was too but pattys intuition would not stop crying out that something wasnt right resting on the seat beside her was a printout with the names and addresses of the four executives that some individual or group had murdered assumptions are the detectives greatest nemeses her father had once told her class at the academy when a case isnt going well clear your mind of all assumptions and force yourself to go back to the beginning patty hadnt been able to get hold of the widower of marcia rising but ben moraless widow was waiting to meet with her as was cyrill davenports richard leafs distraught widow had agreed to be interviewed again but only if absolutely necessary patty had decided to leave her for last morales murdered with a single shot to the head was victim number one he was a young vibrant leader active in civic affairs who seemed on paper at least to be a man of compassion and character able to handle wealth and power without making many enemies it was the descriptions of him by his friends and coworkers that troubled patty most as her investigation progressed marcia rising though respected by many seemed to have been avaricious and ambitious to a fault cyrill davenport was a reserved methodical moneymaking machine who at times showed open disdain for his alcoholic wife and richard leaf was from what patty had learned about him a megalomaniacal womanizing egoist who believed he was above most of societys laws none of the three would have been a poster child for the managedcare industry and it was easy to see how the killer might have chosen any of them to be the first victimbut not ben morales the morales home on a quiet unostentatious street had a wellgroomed front lawn that today featured a bicycle with training wheels lying on its side patty had met both of moraless young daughters and felt as ill today thinking about what life held in store for them as she had during that initial investigation moraless wife wendy opened the front door before patty had reached it she was a trim fairskinned blonde who seemed to have aged years in the two months since her husbands death she served patty some tea and willingly answered her questions does the name clementine mean anything at all to you nothing how about marcia rising still no bells after you called and asked about her i looked for her name when i cleaned out bens desk at work then again when i went through his study upstairs there was nothing wendy was maintaining her composure but patty could see the inestimable pain in her eyes are you all right to do this patty asked there really is nothing left for me from all this except to help find bens killer i appreciate that okay how about dr richard leaf the latest victim from what i read in the paper this morning and heard on the news hes not a man i would care to know me either i dont think ive ever read his name or heard ben mention him but i didnt look through all the boxes again after ben wasafter he was killed are those boxes still here upstairs its fine with me if you want to look through them i do how about cyrill davenport wendy shook her head the truth is i was crying a lot going through bens things and i dont think my concentration was really all that good i understand if you dont mind working in his study i can set you up there our nanny is away but ill do my best to keep the girls out of your hair they wont bother me i still cant believe this i just cant civic organizations loved him business organizations honored him her eyes moistened do you know much about him what you told me when i first was investigating hishis death and also from interviews i did at his business he was born in absolute poverty in mexico i do know that and do you know that his companys worth more than doubled in each of the five years he was the ceo he sounds like quite a guy as patty trudged up the carpeted stairs she suddenly felt a consuming fatigue take hold this whole investigation had felt like one step forward two steps back now here she was all the way back to the beginning here you go wendy said gesturing to the carpeted floor in a richly paneled study patty looked inside the room and deflated even more there were five goodsize cartons piled with files and papers that looked as if they had been tossed in randomly reflexively she assessed the situation time to completely examine the material hours chances of coming up with anything significant zero or close to it end of assessment later wendy i think ill come back another time to do this the words were midway from her brain to her lips when she heard her voice saying thanks if i need anything ill yell cursing herself for not simply backing off and letting brasco make a fool or a hero of himself she settled into ben moraless soft leather highbacked chair and began an hour passed with one carton done and most of a second outside the afternoon light had begun to fade moraless papers were mostly dry and technical and gave little feel for the man who had guided premier care to a very solid place in a fiercely competitive industry near the bottom of the second carton thick with bound legal documents and loose sheets was a cardboard file pocket with the word merger written in pencil in the upper right corner of one side her curiosity suddenly yanked from the doldrums patty dumped the contents of the file onto moraless empty desktop and started with the first sheet a memo to morales written in a flourished hand on plain white typing paper it was dated six months ago dear ben i was very pleased to hear from you and to learn that although you have reservations you are at least willing to allow us to present the benefits to all of us from bringing our companies together responses from the others we have polled have been quite encouraging but i feel that the inclusion of premier care would be the boost that really gets the project rolling ultimately i feel certain a merger would be to the good of all lets meet in the next week or two to share our feelings on this matter after that if we are in agreement we can involve the lawyers and bankers and begin to tinker with possible formulas for stock disbursal warmest regards boyd boyd it had to be boyd halliday the faneuil hall debate where patty had first laid eyes on will and boyd halliday seemed eons ago will had come across that night as earnest intelligent humorous and selfeffacing halliday as brilliant intense droll and urbane the fact that patty had a longstanding personal bias against the profitmotivated hmos probably affected her overall negative impression of halliday although wills unassuming good looks may have had something to do with that as well the legal reports seemed to be repeated attempts on the part of several different mergerandacquisition experts to devise a formula for assigning stock and power to at least seven managedcare companies all of them located in the northeast in addition to premier health cyrill davenports unity comprehensive health was on the list however the companies headed by marcia rising and dr richard leaf were not aside from the original memo there did not seem to be any further direct contact between halliday and morales a merger patty thought as she set the last of the documents aside now whats that all about had it ever actually happened was it still on the table where did ben morales stand on the possibility were the other victims companies involved suddenly energized she inspected the contents of the final cartons in much less time than the first two then called and firmed up an appointment with gloria davenport when patty finally came downstairs wendy morales was preparing macaroni and cheese in the kitchen find anything helpful wendy asked maybe did you know anything about a merger or proposed merger between premier health and some other companies no but thats not possible ben would never allow it why this company was his life he had wonderful plans for it someday he hoped to use it as a vehicle for bringing healthcare coverage to those who couldnt afford it he would sooner have lost his arm than his company do you mind if i borrow those cartons for a while id like to go through them again i promise to return everything very soon no problem just a minute and ill help you carry them down you cant stop right in the middle of preparing kraft macaroni and cheese you know i add a little ketchup and some sour cream thats how my mother used to make it for me sounds delicious patty said for me its always been chunks of hot dogs after the last of the cartons was loaded into the camaro wendy shuffled back to the house head down if patty needed a reason to keep pounding away at the managedcare murders there she was she waited until ben moraless widow had closed the door then took the beethoven out of the cd player and replaced it with willie nelsons if youve got the money ive got the time a merger she thought again as she pulled away is that a piece of the puzzle or is that the puzzle chapter the mammography unit of the excelsius health cancer center was beautifully appointed with richly paneled walls and warm inviting furnishings given the unpleasant exchange that had taken place with charles newcomber over the surgical referral for grace peng davis will decided that a frontal assault on the man was the way to go rather than trying to call and set up an appointment shortly after will left home for the drive to the cancer center augie micelli called his cell phone and insisted that he pull off to the side of the road okay now the attorney said give it to me once more i want to hear your account of the day you passed out in the orinchbyinch momentbymoment i want everything i just spent a while this morning retracing every move i could remember okay tell me about that too theres a hole in this someplace and weve got to find it the law doctor sounded vibrant focused and energizeda completely different man from the one will had watched get progressively drunk during their first meeting sounding very much like a courtroom barrister he guided will through his account with carefully phrased incisive questions designed to coax out information without being leading when he was satisfied will had nothing further to add micelli shared what he had learned about the pharmacology of fentanyl it was an astounding amount of informationfar more than will had ever possessed has learning all that helped in any way will asked not yet but knowledge isnt represented as a torch for nothing assuming you are telling the truth and i choose to make that assumption we are searching for an explanation of an event that defies explanation i understand im behind you all the way on this grant he said but i sure could use some sort of a story that makes sense about how that stuff could have gotten into your body i have a whole bunch of stories that make absolutely no sense will replied will that help keep trying and remember it doesnt have to be right it just has to be plausible finally with the promise to stay in touch at least twice a day will hung up and pulled off the soft shoulder back onto the road with his understanding of both law and medicine micelli was going to be a godsend as will headed off he almost immediately became lost in yet another conundrumthe strange finding of the bb in graces chest that did not appear in her mammogram as with the fentanyl no explanation made sense but there was a reality that simply could not be ignored the scenario that he kept coming back to was that grace was a rather thin woman though broad across the shoulders perhaps somehow the angles of the xray camera in taking her breast films simply missed the bb not very likely but as the law doctor said plausiblecertainly a possibility worth reviewing with newcomber and also with one of the radiologists at fgh in fact will decided as he pulled up to the clinic he was going to get a second opinion no matter what the trick would be getting back into the hospital again without being spotted by sid silverman or one of his security people and tossed out onto the street like a barfly he had made it once making it a second time might be asking too much wills plan to get to charles newcomber was simpleact as if he knew what he was doing and not use his real name before leaving for the mammography unit he had called in as dr davidson hoping to review some films with dr newcomber he was assured by the operator that the doctor was in fact in his office and currently on the phone will entered the building carrying an xray envelope containing films of his left ankle taken several years ago after he twisted it in a pickup basketball game remember he told himself look confident keep moving the crowded waiting room was just what he needed two women were queued up in front of a silverhaired receptionist who was manning the counter alone and seemed frazzled seven or eight others most of whom had someone with them filled many of the chairs will surveyed the room quickly as he strode toward the reception desk there was only one corridor off the waiting areanewcombers office had to be down there someplace dr davidson he said smiling and holding up the envelope of films as he marched confidently past the receptionist and down the corridor for several uncomfortable seconds he expected her to call him back and demand more information but selfassuredness and the title doctor won the moment to his left a sign directed patients to the dressing and xray rooms to his right were a series of offices the doors to each of them were closed except for the one farthest away which faced the corridor a discreet plaque fixed to the wall beside it read dr newcomber seated inside behind his desk dictating into a handset was an unimposing rotund ruddyfaced man with a mop of pure white hair will was still approaching the door when he realized that what looked like a full head of hair was actually a silver monks fringe topped by one of the worst hairpieces he had ever seen he was at the doorway before charles newcomber glanced up the radiologists expression was one of interest as he scanned will up and down looking for someone he asked his voice soft and highpitched his tone somewhat inviting dr newcomber you found him newcomber continued his appraisal will stepped into the room and gently closed the door behind him dr newcomber im dr will grant the radiologists color drained he placed the handset on the desk i thought you were in prison what do you want to come in and speak with you im busy and youre a drug addict get out will took a small step forward its about grace davis he said the woman i called you about a while ago who wanted to switch surgeons i dont talk about my patients you read a cancer in her mammogram and she had the tumor removed and diagnosed by pathology but i dont think it was her xrays you read thats crazy newcomber had picked up a pencil and begun fidgeting with it nervously shes had a bb in her chest wall since she was a child will went on its there in the chest xray that was done this morning but not in her mammogramsat least not that her husband or i remember thats ridiculous im sure you just missed it probably stoned on something now get out the mans discomfort was almost palpable will took another step toward him he was now five feet or so from the desk and reminding himself not to lose his cool or do anything stupid lets just look at her films together he said you have a notarized release im a doctor for goodness sake dont you want to know if theres been some sort of mistake i dont make mistakes now get out or ill call security i didnt come here looking for trouble will said feeling his frustration and his temperature beginning to rise just get the films and lets look at them together no the pencil snapped in two newcombers face was radish red he was on his feet now his hands gripping the edge of his massive desk will decided to press on either the man was going to break down or he was going to go ballistic and let something slip to explain why he was reacting so excessively certain he was in command of the situation will made the slightest move forward again the moments that followed were a blur newcomber suddenly yanked open the righthand drawer of the desk jammed his hand in and came out with a snubnosed revolver clutched in his stubby fingers hand quivering he aimed it at the center of wills chest will had never had a gun pointed at him for any reason he froze his mind frantically sorting out the possibilities available to him there was no way to tell how close newcomber was to pulling the trigger but the amalgam of fear and fury in his expression said that a shooting accidental or purposeful could happen any moment will raised his hands and took a step back toward the door easy charles he said easy dont do anything youll regret now get out his eyes still fixed on the portly radiologist will backed away without looking he reached behind him grasped the knob and opened the door he could now whirl and dive into the hall but if the man began spraying shots one or more of them was bound to hit i didnt come here to cause you any trouble he heard himself saying newcomber said nothing the revolver drifted slightly to the right away from wills chest the mans tension seemed as if it might have lessened just a bit will risked pressing on listen charles whatever is going on with you maybe i can help im a really good doctor im sure you are too we only want whats best for our patient that woman grace peng davis is very special she was once a hopeless alcoholica real fringe player in life an outcast then she got sober and pulled herself out of the gutter yesterday she almost died from her first chemo treatment now therapy for her cancer is going to be a problem she doesnt deserve this charles were doctors if theres something the matter with all this we need to help her get out newcomber rasped now clearly hyperventilating get out or i swear ill kill you call me will said wolf hollow drive in fredrickston im in the book please call and we can talk he backed through the door half expecting to see flame suddenly spit from the muzzle finally he pulled the door closed turned and hurried down the hall charles newcomer sank back into his chair sweat accumulating beneath his toupee soaking through his shirt and glistening across his forehead and upper lip more than a minute passed before he loosened his grip on the revolver finally some of his composure regained he lifted the phone and dialed an answering machine took his call there was no greeting only a beep listen he said will grant was just here he knows somethings wrong with grace daviss mammogram you told me she was the last one you promised me no one would ever know well grants suspicious hes going to keep poking around i can handle him but im going to destroy the filmsall of them i want the rest of the money you owe me i want the videos and i want out he slammed the receiver down you promised he muttered removing a printout list from his desk drawer folding it in thirds and slipping it into the pocket of his sports coat the money the video and a ticket out of here you promised chapter for the second time in six hours will entered the hospital from which he had been professionally and physically suspended this time though the security guard in the lobby merely looked at him and nodded he was expected the phone in his condo was actually ringing when he arrived home shaken and bewildered from the bizarre encounter with charles newcomber as with every call now will lifted the receiver expecting to hear the killers unsettling electronic voice grant yes its sid silverman sid listen will came close to blurting out im really sorry i came into the hospital this morning i had to see a patient of mine whats up he managed instead we need you to come into the hospital for a meeting three oclock whats this about id rather everyone learned about this at the same time but i can tell you that just a little while ago your friend the serial killer called jim katz but why would he sears conference room third floor three oclock okay okay ill be there should i bring my lawyer you can do what you want but you wont need one sid i trust you so much that i wont bring one will replied with syrupy sarcasm what now will wondered as he entered through the lobby and headed downstairs to radiology what can the psycho possibly do to me now that he or someone else hasnt already done surely the killer couldnt have selected jim katz as wills replacement katz was a political conservative who had nothing to do with the society and in fact was on the board of one of the managedcare companies he was independently wealthy and was just playing out the string in his surgical practice because he loved the hardearned stature and universal respect he enjoyed throughout the hospital in fact will gordo and susan often wondered if katz would be one of those whose health collapsed shortly after his retirement or who took to drinking for lack of anything stimulating to do it was twothirty and always the multitasker will had taken advantage of his free pass into fgh by making an appointment to review graces chest xrays with rick pizzi the radiologist on duty disappointed that there was no message from patty waiting for him at the condo he had called from a pay phone and spoken briefly with her that was a really nice night thanks was the extent of her comment on their lovemaking for me too hed replied wanting to say much more patty having spent much of her day on the case to which she was no longer assigned was behind in chasing after those cases to which she was including the wounding of a shopkeeper during a holdup there wasnt time for more than the brief exchange of reports of her interview with the widow of ben morales and his encounter with charles newcomber lets talk later if we can she said but with the shooting they just set on my plate and this next interview i think ill be working most of the night the toobrief conversation had left will with an aching emptiness in his chest he left for the hospital reminding himself that over the past fifteen years maxine was the extent of his serious involvement with women that hardly qualified him as an expert radiology was as usual busy rounding a corner will nearly collided with gordon cameron the scotsman was a spectacular vision in a boldly striped dress shirt paisley tie and deep burgundy trousers held up by a pair of broad plaid suspenders each of the colors seemed to clash with every one of the others as well as with his thick redorange beard will me boy youre off a couple of floors were meetin in the conference room on three for years any contact with cameron raised wills spirits today though he had to hold his niggling concern about the man in check it was hard to look directly at him without demanding to know if he was the one who had somehow managed to poison him with fentanyl gordo you have really cloaked yourself in sartorial splendor this day will said you are positively intimidating if braveheart had dressed this way i believe hed still be charging through the heather slicing off heads and mooning the british trust me lad you dont know the half of it the hard part of pulling this outfit together was finding a set where the suspenders and thong matched ouch so do you know what this meeting is about just that it has to do with jim and you listen will i need to tell you that im really sorry i havent been in better touch things have been so hectic around here without you that i havent called to see how you were doing nonsense ive been far too busy living the high life to make time for anyone well it may not seem it but i have been thinking about you duly noted and appreciated thanks now what are you doing down here in the bowels of the hospital ive run into an interesting problem with a film rick pizzis going to go over it with me the only suspended doctor in the history of the hospital who manages to run into an interesting problem with a film now thats what i call devotion to the profession want company in there we cant start this meeting without you anyway come along pizzi stocky and higher strung than most radiologists had come to fgh at almost the same time as will however their career paths as least from an economic standpoint then quickly diverged radiology without much patient contact wasnt a specialty will would have chosen but it certainly had things to recommend it an avid pilot pizzi now owned a pressurized cessna as well as a snazzy fishing boat and a porsche he also was still in his first marriage and spent most of his infrequent oncall nights asleep at home two sets of graces chest xrays taken a day apart were in place in four panels of the ten that filled the wall behind pizzis desk so he asked were you able to get ahold of mrs daviss mammograms not yet theyre at the mammography center of her hmo i will though i can promise you that and you feel certain there was nothing like this in any of the views as you may have heard rick ive been under a little stress lately so im not going to claim to be one hundred percent certain about anything but i did look at the mammograms carefully when mrs davis first came to my office and i never noticed anything like this her husband doesnt remember seeing anything in her films either hes a teacher not a doc but he claims to have an unusually sharp eye for details the question is will said is it possible for every one of the views of a standard mammogram series to miss this pizzi considered the question then shook his head i dont believe so he said depending on technique it would be present in three standard views maybe four and if it wasnt rick pizzis expression darkened then he said i would have to adopt the position that the mammograms werent hers mammograms that werent hers mother of god will what have you gotten yourself into cameron asked as they trudged up four stories from the basement this time pardon you mean what have i gotten myself into this time this is the woman who almost died from an anaphylactic reaction to her first dose of chemotherapy i heard about this case the rescuesquad paramedic did a trach on her yes exactly saved her life from all i can tell fascinating actually shes a patient of our practice susan did the biopsy and excision so the woman really has breast cancer had i hope the cancer was about two and a half centimeters but the sentinel lymph node susan took was negative the thing is the cancer that was removed might not be the one depicted on her mammogram cameron stopped after three floors to catch his breath tsk tsk gordo will said too many doughnuts not enough treadmill he was pleased with the doughnut reference even though it had been unintentional ach laddie you couldnt be more wrong its nothing i do wrong its just my hereditary familial inherited genetic bronchitis it acts up every year on precisely this day there its already better so he went on as they headed up the last flight let me get this straight the radiologist mixed up her films with someone elses but that person happened to have a cancer in the same quadrant of the same breast as our patient i think that about sums it up thats one lucky radiologist i should say cameron paused outside the sears conference room so what do you make of it all he asked dont know but i do know im not done thinking about it or about whether youre the one the chairs in the conference room which were normally set up in rows were stacked along the walls except for those dozen or so that were spaced around a large cherrywood table hospital president sid silverman was seated on the far side flanked by cardiologist dr hans gehringer and an attractive conservatively dressed brunette who just had to be a lawyer silverman inadvertently caught wills gaze and nodded a weak greeting his expression that of a man about to be sick to gehringers left were susan hollister and jim katz cameron took the chair between katz and pattys nemesis wayne brasco occupying the two seats to brascos left were bookend women in business suitsalso attorneys will guessed he suspected they might be connected with the board of registration in medicine he hesitated briefly then took the middle of the three remaining empty chairs there was no sense in even trying not to stand out in this group apparently it had been decided that silverman was going to run the show well thank you all for coming on such short notice he began i assure you we are confronting an emergency of the highest order and that every one of us needs to be here he then asked for introductions around the table hans gehringer medical chief of staff here at fgh im susan hollister a surgeon in the same practice as will grant i am also a supporter and longstanding friend of his james katz also a member of the practice and the reason for this meeting gordon cameron what susan said goes double for me i know will grant is a good man and a great surgeon and i feel we should do whatever we can to help him get through this mess detective lieutenant wayne brasco massachusetts state police ive been directing the team assigned to the managedcare killings we expect to bring this criminal to justice and quickly he looked directly at will his reign of terror and death will be brought to an end one way or the other wills dislike for the man already fully formed mushroomed brasco was arrogant selfserving and violenta man to be feared it was no wonder patty had had such a difficult time with him as he suspected the two women to his right were both from the board of registration in medicine one jane weiss introduced herself as the chief counsel and the other diana emspak was the head of the investigation and enforcement unitprocess server sam rogerss boss will supposed im will grant he said when it was his turn i never willingly took any drugs i havent done anything wrong i have never wanted to be anything other than a good doctor i understand your needs to protect the patients of this hospital and the people of the state but terrible action has been taken against me without consideration of the lack of any corroborating behavior in my past we appreciate your feelings silverman said his tone patronizing and insincere enough to knot the muscles in wills neck at that moment tom lemm the president of the hippocrates society entered the room wearing a navy sports coat and perfectly knotted iridescent blue bow tie it seemed that lemm took too long searching for a seat before he realized that both of the two available chairs were next to will he settled into one shook wills hand uncomfortably and accepted silvermans introduction dr lemm we appreciate your being able to get here on such short notice i know it was a long drive for you jill im jill leary the darkhaired woman on silvermans right said chief counsel for the hospital silverman cleared his throat for transition we are here because of something that has happened involving dr grant and dr katz and indirectly all the rest of us dr katz katz straightened some notes on the table in front of him it was only then that will realized the man did not look at all well he was pale almost ashen and there was a slight tremor in his hands as well as the faintest tic at one corner of his mouth katz coughed swept an errant wisp of thinning hair from his forehead and poured a glass of ice water at eight oclock this morning he began a call came for me at home on a line that is unlisted the voice was electronically altered in the way dr grant has described initially i thought it was a crank call of some kind but after a few words i had no doubt it was the killer i was in my study at the time and had a pad of paper close at hand so i wrote down what hewhat ithad to say and typed my notes out immediately afterward i believe my recording of the incident is quite accurate if i may dr katz listen to me and listen to me carefully i will not repeat myself dr willard grant is being treated poorly by those who do not understand what a martyr he is in the struggle to avenge the harm brought down on so many by those companies that control health care in all likelihood framing him for drugs was the work of one of those companiesretribution for his victory over them at faneuil hall perhaps or more likely because we have chosen him to speak for us as he has done so eloquently for the society he should not be suspended from his hospital and his profession rather he should be honored you have been chosen to right the wrongs that have been done to this man a leader in the war against managed care dr willard grants reputation is crucial to our mission he must be quickly restored to the practice of medicine to the staff of your hospital and to his position within the hippocrates society or punishment will be meted out and you dr james katz will be the recipient this is no idle threat we hope you know by this time that we are very good at what we do and very determined to have our point driven home about the dangers of managed care you have seven days from this noon to use your influence to see to it that our demands come to pass in the top right drawer of your desk at work are two envelopesone is for you and one for dr grant we have chosen dr grant to present our views and grievances to the public for him to do so effectively the stain currently on his reputation as a physician must be removed we want you to see to it that dr grant is in the position to state our position publicly as we have written it for him you are either with us on this dr katz or you are against us there is no middle ground i hope for your sake that is clear katz actually sloshed water from his glass trying to raise it to his lips even though the years had taken some toll on the man he still was a skillful surgeon who lived his life with quiet dignity will ached to see him in such a state even though he had predicted to patty that the killers might make some effort to restore his decimated credibility he was stunned at the cruelty of their threat it was quite apparent that the others were too nice friends you have there dr grant silverman said detective brasco one second doctor brasco pulled out his cell phone made a call and spoke in hushed tones nodding his head importantly as long as youre done with the envelopes why dont you bring them right over he said raising his voice loudly enough for all in the room to hear thirdfloor conference room at the hospital he grinned in an odd smug way no the l doesnt surprise me at all not at all an l jim katzs death sentence had arrived in an envelope in the form of the letter l undoubtedly block printed on white cardboard brascos expression at that moment was as subtle as a wrecking ball the l didnt surprise him in the least why not it had to be that he knew something will thought it had to be that he and the cryptographer had solved the killers puzzle sorry brasco said setting his cell phone aside where were we ah yes we were starting to debate the merits of giving in to the demands of a serial killer i would like to say here and now that our position like that of the president is that we dont bargain with terrorists the knot in wills neck muscles tightened once again brasco was a cowboyan explosive with a minuscule fuse well lieutenant silverman said clearly appalled by brascos insensitivity toward jim katz i would say youve made your position quite clear however i would like the rest of you to feel free to tell us what you can and would be willing to do to protect dr katz who has done so much for our hospital and community miss leary he nodded to the hospital attorney since we first learned of the nature of the killers demands leary said we have been discussing how far we might be able to go in reinstating dr grant at least temporarily there is some precedent in our hospital albeit from a number of years ago for lifting a physicians suspension while the claims against him are being investigated our medical staff executive committee is willing to consider the possibility out of deference to dr katz but they would insist on a psychiatric evaluation of dr grant as soon as possible by a therapist chosen by us or the board of registration in medicine they would also very much like some other sort of mitigating evidence relative to the allegations of drug use which dr grant has so staunchly denied they have requested at least some notarized affidavits from respected members of the medical or civic community attesting to his moral character and they would prefer something more concrete and substantialhard evidence that at least suggested dr grants innocence ms weiss silverman said to the boards attorney is there any chance the board would agree to stay dr grants suspension pending an investigation of the allegations against him weiss dark and studious held a brief whispered exchange with the other board attorney ordinarily i would say no she replied the board exists to protect the public we take a very harsh position in disciplining physicians when there has been patient harm as in this case or in many instances even the possibility of patient harm however there are most certainly extenuating circumstances here dr katz i was informed that you actually served as one of the members of our board that was a few years ago but yes katz said still quite gloomy governor wilcox appointed me i served for two years you have a fine reputation throughout our office thank you again the board attorneys whispered to each other given the severity of what happened with dr grant in the or we cant make any promises weiss said finally but if your executive committee approves his reinstatement it is possible the board would follow suit dr grant have there been any new developments in your efforts to determine what happened to you theories will said taking pains not to look in gordon camerons direction but nothing firm yet and you do agree to get an evaluation by a psychiatrist certified in addiction medicine absolutely and some letters attesting to your personal character ill do my best the more the better no problem weiss turned to katz dr katz attorney emspak and i are both terribly disturbed by what is happening to you we will do everything we can to help ensure that no harm comes to you i very much appreciate that katz said just as i appreciate that there are no guarantees at this point dr lemm silverman asked our organization has a great deal of respect for dr grant and the work he has done both as a surgeon and as a member of the hippocrates society we are looking for any valid excuse to reinstate him however as im sure you all know his is a very highprofile case it sounds as if all three of our agenciesthe hospital the board and the societywill be out on a very thin publicrelations limb as the press is almost certain to latch on to this i think we should have a carefully crafted and wellcoordinated explanation as to why we have changed our position on this case perhaps in the absence of anything other than a supportive psychiatric evaluation and some letters of support we can allude to other elements of dr grants case that have come to light without being specific i am sure that i speak for the society when i say that what it seems we need to do is to give detective brasco and his people enough time to catch this killer while at the same time protecting dr katz in any way we can silverman allowed multiple conversations to hold sway for a time then turned to will dr grant i would ask that you redouble your efforts to save us from the publicrelations volcano that is certain to erupt the moment it is learned that our organizations have reinstated youif in fact we do the killer has given us one week to reverse the suspensions i suggest we meet here again at this time the day after tomorrow by then well know from dr grant if any other information has been unearthed regarding his claims of innocence and from the board if you have found an addiction specialist to evaluate him hopefully well be in a position to vote and if we decide to proceed to begin preparing whatever explanation we need for the press good said weiss dr grant do you have any problem doing your part ill be happy to pay the independent evaluator and to try and come up with some theory or evidence you all can use with the press before i promise anything else id like to see what the killer is insisting that i say to the media but of course i would do anything i could to protect dr katz at that moment as if on cue there was a knock on the door brasco leapt to open it and returned with two manila folders he glanced at oneapparently the one that held the letter lkept it and tossed the other in front of will i admire your nobility dr silverman brasco said returning to his chair and yours dr lemm and also the good ladies of the board of medicine but i would have to say that in my opinion you are choosing a path that could backfire in a bigtime way if this man goes out and gets himself overdosed again personally i feel we can supply enough protection for dr katz until we put this psycho away for good believe me doctor weve protected witnesses against larger threats than this one excuse me detective brasco will said but i think you are underestimating these people they are predatorsvicious brilliant and remorseless just look at the way theyve killed having dealt with them already i can only say that in my opinion if they want dr katz dead they will find a way thats only because youre probably one of them you friggin junkie brasco snapped with startling abruptness youre just trying to save your own hide he stood sending his chair hurtling backward well let me tell you something this whole discussion is unnecessary because before your week is up well have nailed the bastard you all can do whatever you want but let me tell you one more time we dont make deals with terrorists and we also dont make deals with junkies before anyone else could say a word brasco whirled and stormed out of the room chapter for several minutes those remaining in the sears conference room sat in stunned motionless silence finally sid silverman stood adjusted his vest and gathered his papers together the day after tomorrow then he said as if brascos outburst was too outrageous even to acknowledge dr grant please be sure attorney weiss has a way of getting ahold of you herere my cell phone and home numbers will said passing them over to her i i know this situation isnt easy for any of you jim i just want you to know that i am horribly sorry for what this monster is putting you through julia too if you all decide to go along with the killers demands and reinstate me i promise to keep a very low profile and not cause any problems i doubt lieutenant brasco will be back here for our next meeting but i will hopefully before too much longer youll all know what i know namely that im not guilty of anything the meeting ended without fanfare drained will remained in his place as the others left the room jim katz still pale and shaken hurried out without so much as a glance at will of the others only susan and gordo made eye contact with him will felt sad about this latest turn in his insane saga but he also felt in some strange way vindicated from the moment the fentanyl was detected in his blood he had been a pariah in the hospital among his colleagues and in the press now thanks to a murderera multiple murdererthe society the hospital and the board of registration in medicine were begging him to give them a reason any reason to restore his medical license position within the society and hospital privileges if he was being selfish in the face of jim katzs anguish so be it no one could fully understand what he had been through or how desperately he wanted his life back he wanted to belong to be challenged again he wanted his children not to be ostracized from their playmates he wanted to matter in the world that had mattered so much to him he wanted to be a doctor again was that so wrong it was quite possible that even letters of support from benois beane and susan and gordo and jim and maybe a couple of the docs who hadnt turned away from him would not be enough to convince the attorneys from the hospital and the board but for the moment that was all he could think of to do susan will was gathering his notes together when he realized he had intended to speak with her after the meeting about the bb in graces films radiologist rick pizzis opinion and the strange violent reaction of the man who had referred grace to her in the first place he stuffed the papers in his briefcase and was just pushing back from the table when sid silverman returned to the room his moon face was more flushed than usual i thought id find you still here he said i was just fixin to leave i came back to see to it that you do what youre still suspended from here so so i want you out of this hospital untilwhen and ifwe restore your privileges to work here personally grant i think youre dirty i think you took that drug and i think that somehow youre more involved with this killer than you would let anyone believe if it werent that jim katzs life is at stake i would have leapt up to support brascos position in a heartbeat and if something happens to katz i hope youre prepared to live with it now get out of here having issued the order rather than leave silverman stepped back against the wall and waited his arms folded against his chest as tightly as his anatomy would allow will wanted so desperately to charge across the room and punch the hospital president senseless stupid insensitive bastard in what he hoped was exasperatingly slow motion will stood up and made a pretext of repacking his briefcase it was then he realized his cell phone was ringing gesturing what can you do to silverman he answered it grant micelli here the lawyer rasped you someplace you can talk i can talk augie the longer you have to stand around and wait sid the happier it makes me grant listen as i told you earlier ive been studying the pharmacology of fentanyl and thinking about how this could have happened to you and the drug had to be inside your shoesthose red sneakers you wear every time you operate its the only explanation that makes any sense other than that youre a liar and ive chosen not to consider that possibility anymore the drugprobably a lot of itwas soaked into the insoles of your or shoes and allowed to dry there then your own sweat reconstituted it and you absorbed it through your feet just as if your socks were giant fentanyl patches we have to find those shoes grant any idea where they could be stunned will sank down into the chair the cell phone pressed tightly against his ear was it possible micelli was crazy there was no way he was right this time still will was well known for the red chuck taylor all stars he invariably wore in the or he decided to hang on to the possibility at least for the moment like micelli had said they were long on facts and way short on explanations i have no idea where they can be now will said the er nurses put everyones clothes into a labeled plastic bag i never got them back maybe the police have them they dont i checked i can check with the nurses in the icu no weve got to find them but we need a cop there with us when we do a cop or someone from the das office and also someone in authority at your hospital so for gods sake dont go looking for them because if you luck out and actually find them youve ruined everything well need a tight chain of custody listen i know someone in the das office who owes me a favor maybe hell come meanwhile see if you can get someone from your hospital to meet us in the lobby there at say eight tonight call me if you cant pull that off ill do my best i know a state police detective i might be able to get terrific for this search the more witnesses the merrier its the shoes pal its always the shoes will slipped the phone back in his briefcase and turned dramatically to silverman we need to talk sid he said sid silverman flatly refused to represent the hospital in the search for wills or shoes instead he led will to attorney jill learys office stayed long enough to ensure she would be available at eight and left with another warning that when his business with leary was finished will was to wait outside the hospital until micellis group convened in the lobby learning that the infamous law doctor was representing will did nothing to brighten silvermans day i thought micelli just sued doctors he said hes making an exception in my case why i think its because he believes i could be innocent sid well i dont you know what i think i think micellis right i think the shoes are how i was poisoned and i think youre frightened to death that you might be wrong about me and wrong in the way youve treated me and when we find out that hes right and youre wrong i want my staff privileges back on the spot and you know what else i want sid i want you never to speak to me or about me again it took most of half an hour for will to bring jill leary up to speed on the pharmacology of fentanyl and on the evolution of his relationship with augie micelli given her outwardly severe demeanor she was surprisingly kind and from what he could tell nonjudgmental still he felt distracted and rushed his account wherever he could he hadnt yet had the opportunity to call patty and invite her to meet them at the hospital and he also needed to track down susan to see if something could be set up involving the two of them and charles newcomber tell me something leary said if what your lawyer believes happened is actually what did dont you think that whoever is responsible would have gone out of their way to locate your or shoes and dispose of them it was a good questiona very good question in fact will took some time to think his answer through i guess its possible they did just that he said finally but if the police dont have my clothes from that day and theyre not in the icu and not in the er then either a clothing bag with my name on it was thrown away accidentally or someone took it and since i cant imagine housekeeping just chucking a patients belongings bag away without giving it to a nurse we would have to deal with the likelihood that whoever poisoned me got rid of it i suppose at first blush i can buy that logic the lawyer said her smile genuine and warm well its my night to make dinner for my husband and kid so id better run ill see if i can poke any holes in your theory on the way home and ill see you back here tonight at eight terrific and dr grant yes im sorry this is happening to you using a hospital phone will tried patty at home and on her car phone they had agreed that so long as his home his cell and his office phones were tapped they would try to avoid talking on them when they did connect through one of those phones it would be strictly business use of the word danger meant that will would call her car phone from someplace safe when will arrived at the office of fredrickston surgical associates susan was seeing the last of her patients it had been more than a week since he had been there and the staff greeted him with edgy warmth it was he knew a natural reaction the more time that passed without his exoneration the more doubt that accrued doin fine he said to the receptionist before she even asked not to worry im doin fine he failed to reach patty again this time using the phone in gordos office then he sat at his uncharacteristically ordered desk bending and unbending a paper clip as he tried to remember what normal felt like what would life be like now if he had simply said no when tom lemm and the rest of the society had so skillfully maneuvered him into the faneuil hall debate hey big fella i heered you wuz waitin fer me susan sidled into wills office and took the chair opposite him she was unpretentiously elegant in an anklelength skirt with a bright african print and a beige silk blouse her sorrel hair was as usual pulled back in a tight bun thanks for sticking up for me at that session today will said i wish that fop silverman had given me the chance to say more im sure this has been hell for you im ready to have it be over thats for sure maybe tonight what do you mean will recounted the call from micelli and the search that was to commence at eight youre welcome to come along suze if i thought it would make any difference i would i hope you know that even though believe it or not i am being taken to the bruce springsteen concert tonight for emphasis she bit on her lower lip and played a few notes on an imaginary guitar i didnt know you were into the boss let me put it this wayeveryone i know is excited that im going so i am too youll love him anythings possible hey before i forget whats going on with grace davis and her xray thats actually what i wanted to see you about graces husband told me she had a bb in her chest that wasnt in her mammograms exactly she was shot by her brother when she was a kid you saw the mammograms i did that day you agreed to let me take over her case i cant be sure the bb wasnt there but it seems unlikely i would have missed it yesterday i went to see dr newcomber the mammographer at the excelsius health cancer center hes an odd little duck youve met him a couple of times i think hes gay but other than that i have no read on him well what i think happened is that he read her films correctly then mistakenly put someone elses films in her jacket i just didnt notice that the name on the jacket and the name on the films were different someone who also had a left upper outerquadrant cancer i guess its the only explanation i can come up with if thats the case i must have missed the name difference too i studied those films before i did her surgery its possible the name on the film isnt something we go out of our way to check i suppose susans nonplussed expression made it clear she was searching for other explanations so what happened when you went to see newcomber are you ready for this when i asked to review graces films with him he got really frightened he was gripping the edge of his desk so tightly i thought it was going to splinter then he said he needed a notarized release from grace to show me anything then when i said that was a ridiculous demand to make to a fellow physician without any warning he reached in his desk drawer and pulled a gun on me a what a snubnosed revolver he threatened to shoot me if i didnt get out and it seemed he was just panicked enough to do it his face was flaming red and his hand was shaking i half expected to see smoke coming out of his ears if he had done that to me he wouldnt have had to bother pulling the trigger because i would have just died on the spot so what do you want to do i want to see him again this time with you in tow and clutching a notarized release from grace davis and if he makes a move for that righthand desk drawer im going to launch myself over his desk rip off that godawful hairpiece of his and ram it down his throat goodness the dark side of will grant believe me there is one no ones ever pointed a gun at me either should i call and make an appointment with him the cancer centers not that far away from here i favor just showing up maybe ill sort of hang back in the corridor until youre through the door of his office then ill slide in behind you nine am okay fine ill meet you here and we can drive over together and the notarized release jill leary that hospital attorney will be here tonight when we look for the shoes if she cant or wont do it ill figure out something i hope this search works out for you will im sick of people getting angry at me because youre not here to take care of them and they have to settle for me thats nonsense just keep your fingers crossed tonight while youre at the fleet center screaming for springsteen susan stood and held up four sets of crossed fingers just practicing she said hey one more thing could you give me the names of a couple of springsteens songs in case you couldnt guess i really dont know much about him except that hes a hunk im on fire born to run and badlandsall theme songs of mine at the moment for that information i want a tshirt see you in the morning doc if my dates impressed with those titles you get your shirt chapter detective kristine zurowski please tell her its detective moriarity calling her phone on handsoff patty was mired in traffic halfway to serenity lane in dover the cartons she had taken from ben moraless study rested on the backseat of the camaro although she hadnt made it through all of moraless papers what she had read and learned from wendy morales had her head spinning morales had blocked a merger attempt by boyd halliday and excelsius health not long after that he was murdered now it was time to see if she had stumbled onto a pattern one memo nearly lost within reams of paper suggested that the new corporation which would include moraless premier care would also include cyrill davenports unity comprehensive health hey patty are you okay im fine kristine someone just told me you got taken off the big case the rumor mill is really cranking you heard about it almost as soon as i did that thug brasco he had some help from our co but yes they thought some new blood was needed blood with y chromosomes possibly no make that probably you should file a complaint maybe someday right now im complaining the only way i know how by staying on the case without their knowing it yea patty thanks so kristine have you guys made any progress nada the going theory is that these are vengeance killings but what else is new we have the alphabet letters but no ones been able to crack them yet we hear hq is putting together a task force to centralize all information i thought you might actually be involved in that only by not being on it listen as far as the letters go i can make you a hero brasco and the cryptographer have come up with remember clementine the codebreaker is ninetysomething percent certain thats it they think clementine might be the name of the killers mother you believe that i dont know maybe the killer sure as hell wants us to believe that so im at least a little skeptical clementine kristine mused you know anyone named clementine only the one who is lost and gone forever dreadful sorry it does sound a little bogus to me see what i mean im going to ignore clementine for the time being and keep heading in this direction you need a buddy do yourself and your career a favor and steer clear of me for the time being if i can ever get out of this onetwentyeight traffic im on my way over right now to speak with gloria davenport thats actually why im calling you she know youre coming yes i wanted to clear my visiting her with you first though being as shes in your bailiwick consider it cleared especially after giving me remember clementine i also want to know anything youve got on her you think shes got something to do with her husband being blown up no but you may be closer than you realize well weve interviewed her twice the first time she was intoxicated and the second time she was merely drunk she handles her booze impressively well though ill give that to her and she puts up a pretty good front no one here including me is suspicious of her except for the fact that she is as of the explosion one wealthy woman how wealthy you saw where they live i dont know how much the stock shes about to inherit is worth but i can tell you that as of this moment the company is privately owned and i must believe that a good chunk of those tens of tens of millions once possessed by her husband now belong to her interesting listen youll keep me up to speed if i know it youll know it it was nearing six when patty pulled up the driveway of serenity lane cocktail time as she approached the front door she was thinking at least in part of how good a gentle gin and tonic with a wedge of lime would taste provided she could put her feet up on something at the same time the massive colonial showed no sign of the carnage and wreckage that had so recently occurred therea testimony to the power of money gloria davenport whom patty never saw when she was last at serenity lane answered the door herself although patty caught a glimpse of a maid scurrying past in the background the mental image she had formed of a fiftyish overly rouged bottle blonde wasnt that far from the truth but in some ways perhaps with the help of surgery gloria had managed to retain a good deal of femininity in her figure and bearing as well as her neck face and especially her eyes which were a very soft blue she didnt have a drink in her hand but patty could tell one had been there not that long ago why youre lovely gloria said extending her hand and welcoming patty into a home that was at once elegant and comfortable i thought police detectives who looked like you were only found on tv or in the movies thank you i dont think the people i arrest pay much attention to my looks the sitting room to which patty was led featured matched satin love seats that might have been centuries old and an array of other antiques a filled ice bucket and glasses were on the coffee table along with some mints and a halfempty glass of something amber patty commented on the room and the house and confirmed her notion that in fact the love seats were louis quatorze i know better than to expect you to be drinking while on duty gloria said after establishing that patty should address her by her first name unless youre one of those tragic tortured detectives whose character development they try to compress in the interest of a twohour movie by simply making them alcoholic i drink patty said sometimes more than i should at the moment though i have a lot on my mind and ive found that alcohol often makes me not as sharp as i could be you should certainly go ahead if you wish and i shall well arent you a breath of fresh air you investigate murders you know antiques you give your hostess permission to drink and most important of all you say louis quatorze with a decent french accent thank you again my father barely made it past high school so he pushed education on me and my brother he used to say that every single day we managed to stay in school translated into ten thousand people in the world we wouldnt have to take bs from in our lives glorias raspy laugh was robust and genuine thats a very wise observation possibly so but at the moment with about six years less formal education than i have hes my boss gloria laughed again if she was in any way intoxicated kristine was right she handled the state well as if speaking to that point she refilled her glass and added two ice cubes gloria i know youve been interviewed more than once regarding your husbands murder patty said that would be correct so im sure you know that his is just one of what looks like a string of serial killingsfour of them nowapparently related to someone trying to avenge the death of a friend or relative the mother of the killer one of the policemen told me we have reason to believe there is more than one killerpossibly a brother and sister why would you believe that the killer has been funneling information piecemeal to us through a physician he keeps callinga physician with a very public position against managed care its as if he or they have chosen the doctor to be their press secretarysomeone whose own stature more or less validates them someone from the hippocrates society patty looked up at the woman impressed as a matter of fact yes so you know about the society not all that much but everyone in our industry knows about them theyve become quite a thorn in our side over recent years our industry before this visit patty had formed the impression of gloria davenport as some sort of dilettante uninterested in anything other than drinking and finding ways to spend her husbands money forming impressions of people on too little information was a habit she resolved once again to break gloria you say our industry were you very involved in your husbands business im not surprised that you are the first policeperson to ask me that question the rest of them seem content to believe that i am nothing more than a chronically besotted spouse who was lucky enough to marry a healthcare baron and now even luckier to inherit all his money but thats not true well maybe the besotted part is i dont blame cyrill totally for my drinking but i will say that he was how should i put it difficult do you know much about ocd obsessivecompulsive disorder some well cyrill hashad it unfortunately he was the only one close to him who didnt know it and for as long as i knew him chief among the things he was obsessive and compulsive about was making money pardon me for saying so but it seems like he did a good job of it i suppose youre right of course he did have a running head start glorias expression was mischievous okay patty said ill bite what sort of running head start my maiden name was storer as in storer and elliot the investment house complete with our own padded celli mean seaton the new york stock exchange when cyrill and i married i was worth somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred million dollars thats some neighborhood patty said cyrill was worth maybe a million cents depending on the status of his car payments but he was full of dreams and to his credit he had gotten a business degree from wharton actually thats where we met i was a year ahead of him i bought unity comprehensive health for him as a wedding present and out of curiosity to see just how good he could be the rest is history were you involved in the business of course i was i was on the board of directors from the start i had to protect my investment it wasnt that hard to have cyrill believe he was making all the brilliant decisions he didnt lets just say he made some on his own and lots that he thought were on his own so whats the status of the company now well to all intents unity isnt really a company anymore except on paper were now well on our way to a merger with excelsius health patty cut in excitedly gloria looked at her queerly now thats a piece of information not many people are supposed to havecertainly not people outside our companies patty reached in her briefcase passed over ben moraless file and explained how she had come by it gloria freshened her drink before opening it and then scanned each sheet as if she were taking the final exam in a speedreading course in just a couple of minutes she was nodding her head in understanding there are several more cartons of moraless papers that i havent gone through yet patty said so there may be more material on all this well gloria said with a sigh i tried to stay in the background but i knew ben morales a bit and most of the ceos of these other companies as well and i knew boyd halliday at excelsius was on the move but until recently i didnt know how fast excelsius has already absorbed two of these companies and if you count unity its three i just read where steadfast health which used to be a pretty wellrun outfit although not that big has gotten itself into financial trouble and sold out to halliday so why did your husband sell out to excelsius oh he didnt he never would have parted with unity it was like an extension of him i on the other hand was sick to death of the place if youll pardon the gallows humor i had been encouraging cyrill to get out for more than a year in the interest of kickstarting our marriage but no go he had traded me in for the company such irony the day after cyrills funeral his friends and former employees at unity approached me with an offer i couldnt and didnt want to refuse and i gave my blessing and control of my stock to them a couple of days later the wheels of merger commerce were turning and turning fast gloria tell me something patty said now barely able to stay in her seat assuming this serial killer who has led us to believe he is avenging his mother picked the ceos he was going to murder randomly or according to the ease with which he could get to them dont you think its strange that two out of four of the victims would never have allowed excelsius health to take over their companies had they stayed alive my research has shown that in this state alone he had about a hundred managedcare companies to choose from i suppose so but what about the other twomarcia risings company and that other one theyre not on this list no patty said thoughtfully no theyre not dr leafs widow was not at all involved with his business affairs nor it would seem his personal affairs either i think it would be a good idea to speak with people at his companyrisings company too you could be way off base gloria said patty gathered her things stood and embraced her hostess warmly youre right she said i could you know something though that quote i told you from my father the colonel about education isnt the only one hes famous for theres another he writes it on the board in just about every class on police work that he teaches and shouts it out at the students im all ears gloria said what is it its i hate coincidences gloria took pattys arm warmly as she led her to the door i hope you solve these crimes quickly dear she said i just might patty replied her thoughts continuing to whirl she stopped and turned to her hostess one last thing yes does the name clementine mean anything to you gloria shook her head nothing she said except for the movie movie im something of a movie buffespecially westerns my darling clementine was an old john ford film with henry fonda as wyatt earp midnineteen forties i would guess its really a classicmaybe the best of the dozen or so movies that have been made over the years about the famous gunfight at the ok corral interesting patty said no longer surprised by any revelation from this woman and wondering if there could be any connection at all between the film and the killer where did that gunfight take place wasnt it kansas you might be thinking of dodge city no the gunfight at the ok corral took place in arizona tombstone arizona chapter something big was going on patty knew it the moment she set foot in her office there was an electricity in the air people who generally flew out the door the moment their shifts were over were still there one of them brian tomasettia burnedout department lifer but a favorite of hers nonethelesswas actually cleaning his service revolver something was definitely up after her meeting with gloria davenport patty had gone over to see marcia risings husband a surgeon named michael springer who was in practice in norwood toward the south shore springer who still seemed genuinely distraught over his wifes murder knew a great deal about medical politics managed care and his wifes company what he didnt know was anything about excelsius health or any merger plans with marcias eastern quality health still it was possible one was in the works that made two victims connected with the merger list one maybe or maybe not the pendulum swung several degrees toward coincidence but not nearly far enough for her to dismiss the belief that the killings were not the least bit random and also that they were not the least bit related to the death of anyones mother this was businesspure and simple so bt she said setting a bag of m ampms down on the keyboard of his computer whats going on here youre on days yet here you are oh this is big patty tomasetti said loosening his belt a notch before tearing open the m ampms real big i told them id man the phones sort of control central look at meim so excited about this one that im cleaning my gun even though im not even out there in the field that is excitement so so what tomasetti poured the last half of the bag onto his desk blotter and divided the candies up by color so what gives whats going on as she asked the question patty felt an eerie tightening beneath her breastbone she had been on duty all day and had called in any number of times yet she hadnt heard so much as a whisper about something big going down now she felt certain that she had been purposely excluded from whatever it was margie moore one of the secretaries swooshed by packed up for home and headed for the door hey patty hey bt she said hope this is it us too tomasetti said well all be at the top of the pig pile if it is have a good one margie bt patty asked after the secretary had left does this have something to do with the hmo killings youre shitting me right im not shitting you now whats going on boy have they ever cut you out of this one patty boiled over hands on hips she swept around the desk and stood at tomasettis elbow towering over him with menace that she did not have to conjure up goddammit bt tell me and tell me now okay okay nobody told me not to tell you anything i thought you already knew it once being your case and all i thought you knew brascos set up a meeting with the killer its going down intomasetti checked his timexfiftyfive minutes thats not possible the killers never even made contact with us not once except for those damn letters he leaves at the murders well it wasnt exactly us he made contact with it was that doctor the one youve been what i mean is will grant patty said exasperated that if tomasetti knew undoubtedly the rest of the squad knew as wellprobably her father too just how badly was it possible for her to screw up yeah him tomasetti said apparently the killer told grant he could put a personal ad in the herald if he ever needed to meet we took that information off the tap on grants phone i gave it to brasco and lieutenant court myself well brasco used it and set up a meeting with the killer patty was feeling more uneasy by the second where at a place called camp sunshine believe it or not its an old rundown unused summer camp on lake trumbull north of fredrickston im surprised you didnt know about all this well im not who picked the place the killer brasco allowed him to choose the meeting place so he wouldnt be suspicious but brascos had our swat team geared up for like two days now the moment he gave the word they infiltrated the area theres a chopper on standby too i know the camp brian the killers too smart for this way too smart how did brasco get him to believe he was talking to will grant patty im sorry i know this was your case i appreciate your concern but dont worry about it i only look soft in here where it countsshe pointed to her heartim tough as nails now tell me how brasco convinced the killer he was talking to grant vds tomasetti said simply voice duplication and substitution from what i understand an r and d company on onetwentyeight has been under contract for this and theyve come up with a machine that can take a persons voice and substitute someone elses for it i know about setups where a man can speak and a girls or boys voice can come out vice people all over the country are using it to contact predators who want to set up a rendezvous with young girls or young boys they meet online but youre talking about recording a specific persons voice and then having it speak someone elses words exactly so the killer responds to the ad and calls grant and brasco intercepts the call and uses grants voice to say his words apparently the killer bought it hook line and sinker you know just because brasco doesnt look too bright doesnt mean he isnt yes it does brascos using will grant without grants knowledge and by doing so hes putting him in harms way ive been on this killerthese killersfor months they never make a careless or dangerous move even though it might seem like thats whats happening and they dont care a rats behind for anyones life but their own and that includes grants if brasco thinks hes outsmarting these people hes even dumber than he looks and thats saying something i never heard you talk that way i might be just getting started you have directions to the camp yes but but what brasco said not to let anyone come out there something like that bt give me the fucking directions tomasetti slid a paper from one corner of his desk and passed it over copy it and tell them you stole it from my desk without my knowing it okay you got it thanks pal how much time do i have maybe fifty minutes now youve gotta really bust it in that camaro of yours speed is my middle name i thought that was danger dangers my confirmation name patty grabbed the directions made a quick stop at the xerox machine and raced out to the parking lot the pipers on the loose and he must be paid the killers proclamation issued shortly before he assassinated dr richard leaf with surgical planning and precision resonated in her mind as she skidded out of the lot and into a tight righthand turn there was no shaking the grisly belief that soon very soon people were going to die by seven fortyfive when he returned to fredrickston general will had given up on recruiting patty to join the small safari about to explore the hospital for his clothing bag several calls to her cell phone had succeeded only in reaching her voice mail and a wishful call to her place fared no better with a dense overcast and intermittent drizzle night had descended prematurely around him it was business as usualvisitors filing through the revolving glass doors along with a scattering of employees many of whom will knew two of them grinned uncomfortably and nodded but most of the others simply averted their eyes and studied the pavement even though none of them meant anything special to will it was painful to be innocent and to be judged and it would be an incredible relief to be reinstated but that reinstatement he knew was still anything but automatic the board the hospital and the society had been placed in a very difficult position it would make the decision much easier for each of them if by some miracle his chuck taylors were found and the insoles tested positive for fentanyl that possibility seemed remote the most likely scenario he believed was that tonight they would find nothing and would be left speculating about what might have happened to his clothing even if micellis theory about the shoes was right it was unlikely that someone resourceful enough to frame him would allow the evidence just to lie around of course it was also possible they would have felt confident enough in the sophistication of the frameup to leave the shoes where they were good evening doctor jill leary a trench coat belted about her trim waist came up from behind and touched him on the arm hey welcome back will said i really appreciate your doing this no problem i hope we find something but as you said in my office there will be some significance if we find nothing at all ive tried but i still havent been able to poke any holes in your theory except to say that in hospitals dumb things happen all the time and yours wouldnt be the first clothing bag that was inadvertently thrown out will sighed momentarily and inexplicably consumed by an immense fatigue i suspect well be left with that possibility he said learys look was understanding guilty or not it said she appreciated that he had been through a great deal will immediately felt his composure begin to regroup kindness and compassion cost so little lets wait inside for the others she said finally im sure sid wouldnt mind will followed her into the hospital a few minutes later augie micelli arrived wearing a rumpled navy blazer gray slacks a red power tie and a dominating cologne he looked like a premature retiree in florida or arizona but he seemed excited and best of all totally sober his eyes were bright and keen and showed none of the ennui will had noted when they first met micelli was accompanied by a nattily dressed black man carrying a briefcase whom he introduced as gil murray an assistant da from middlesex behind murray was robert mcgowen a young uniformed fredrickston policeman whom will had worked with a number of times in the er the law doctor guided them over to a deserted corner of the lobby so he said clasping his hands together enthusiastically this mighty task force has been assembled to answer the question of what became of will grants clothing bag ms leary thank you for sacrificing your evening on our behalf no problem dr grant and i have each spent a good deal of time on the clinical side of hospitals and so are well aware of the chaos and confusion that can accompany a medical emergency such as his officer mcgowen assures me that the many cases he has helped haul to the er here have taught him the same thing given that a massive amount of the drug fentanyl was in dr grants body that day and given that dr grant is adamant in his denial of having taken any we are forced either to brush him off as a loser and a liar or come up with another explanation i have chosen to discard the loserliar alternative and instead after considering and rejecting many possible scenarios have chosen to focus on his or shoes which at least as of this moment appear to be missing a chemist at one of the pharmaceutical houses that manufacture fentanyl believes that my theory is physically and physiologically possible provided enough drug is soaked into the insole everyone ready all set mcgowen said well then the supervising nurse in the icu is expecting us as is the nurse in charge of the er this shouldnt take too long the idea of having gil and officer mcgowen along is that if by any chance we actually come up with something it will immediately need to be handled by strict chain of custody gil has plastic bags and gummed seals we can all sign and officer mcgowen will take the bags directly back to the station do you really expect to find anything after all this time leary asked the truth is i dont know what to expect people in hospitalsin most workplaces for that mattertend to ignore anything that isnt directly their job its not that hard to imagine a custodian or nurses aide or even a nurse working his or her way around a clothing bag assuming someone else had placed it there for a reason i suppose any other questions will found himself wondering about the managedcare bureaucrats who shelved micellis career as a physician without so much as the courtesy of an interview the companies were the charybdis whirlpool that would suck a physician under even after he had survived the scylla that was the board of registration in medicine he was he saw now facing the same peril guilty or not his license had been preemptively suspended by the board as a result of his suspension at the hospital in all likelihood even if he was deemed acceptable to practice by the board many of the multiple managedcare panels to which he belonged would remove him as a provider of treatment for their subscribers simply because he once had been suspended it would be okay for him to practice surgery they would in essence be saying but not to earn a living doing it his involvement in the society and that damn debate at faneuil hall were sure not to help matters there probably wasnt a managedcare company within a thousand miles that wouldnt relish the opportunity to bring the hammer down on his career this was the first time he realized that regardless of whatever happened today or even down the road he might well be finished as a doctor easy does it satisfied he had waited long enough for questions micelli turned and led the group down the hall to the elevators in nearly ten years at the hospital except when accompanying a patients litter will had never used any of the elevators he suspected that not one of the other three would have passed on the stairs for just one flight but micelli was leading this expedition and there was nothing about the man that suggested he would ever opt for the more physically challenging of any two options as they headed down the corridor will found himself behind the others and next to gil murray thanks for doing this will said im really grateful i would do just about anything for augie murray replied his voice a bit like james earl joness i had a back operation a few years ago under general anesthesia only i wasnt asleep during the procedure and had no way to tell anyone because i had been given a drug to paralyze my muscles some unkind remarks were made about me when my surgeon thought i was asleep i heard them all augie fixed me up with some people who were able to prove that was the case and he even found an organization named anesthesia awareness thats made up of others whove experienced the same thing ive heard of them will said cringing at murrays story its one of the worst things thats ever happened to me augie helped me get a settlement for what i went through but its the other things he did that really mattered hes had some tough times and doesnt take such good care of himself but underneath it all hes the best im learning that on the way over patrolman bob there told me that augie had helped his dad as well up ahead micelli was holding open the elevator door motioning them to hurry up loss of a child loss of selfesteem loss of health loss of a hardearned profession no one would argue that will wasnt going through a devastating situation but the law doctor still had him beat nurse anne hajjar usually on the day crew was waiting for them in the icu she was as usual radiant and upbeat even though she explained she was working a double because of a hiring freeze on rns she nodded to will her expression neutral if not a bit cold he felt a deep pang they had worked so well together for so long back when life was normal now her respect for him seemed all but gone hajjar turned her attention to micelli so what are we after here the truth micelli said he gave her a quick capsule no chance she said the only thing we are more short of than nurses is storage space theres a little closet over there where we keep some supplies and cleaning stuff but i go in there all the time and id have to be as deaf dumb and blind as the pinball wizard to miss a clothing bag with dr grants name on it is there any other possible place wedged way up under the bed dr grant was in without debate hajjar entered the cubicle where grace was sleeping knelt down and peered under the bed she returned shaking her head no go can you think of any other possible space besides that closet hajjar gave will a prolonged look then perhaps reflecting on the way things once were between them she went to the other cubicles and looked under each of the other beds nada she reported could we check the closet micelli asked suit yourself just you though the rest of you will have to wait over there a couple of our patients are touch and go right now i dont want any commotion will watched as hajjar led the law doctor to the far end of the unit and a supply closet that will knew wasnt any more than sixbysix the inspection took less than a minute without a word hajjar returned to her patient and micelli came back grinning sheepishly nothing i didnt expect he said even if we dont find anything here or in the er i have documents drawn up for each of you to get notarized stating that fact stop by my office after were through leary said and ill notarize whatever you need almost subconsciously she glanced down at her watch will who was again feeling deflated and peeved with himself for getting so enthusiastic over micellis theory in the first place felt his spirit sink another notch jill leary could and probably should be at home with her kid right now not offering to notarize worthless documents for him she was a genuinely caring soul but there was no way this fruitless expedition was going to supply the hard evidence he needed to free up the board the hospital and the society to reinstate him absolutely no way so micelli said pumping his fists to demonstrate that his bravado was intact this setback is not totally unexpected next we go to the er unless any of you has another thought how about we all go home will was thinking ms leary micelli continued if you would lead the troops i have a matter to go over with dr grant he waited until will had dropped back then lowered his voice sorry about the strikeout in the icu he said i didnt expect any different maybe the er will come through maybe listen if im going to adjust my attitude the least you can do is to stay in this game until its over sorry augie really i am all of a sudden i just started overthinkingprojecting like hell getting myself all tied up in knots over things that havent happened and might not ever happen been there done that micelli said for so long i just took being a doc for granted i understand you know that i do ill pull it together good so whats the deal with patty moriarity will snapped around to face him what about her shes on our side right right i told you a little about her shes the detective who got taken off the managedcare case well she called my office while i was on my way here but i had the line on call forwarding to my cell phone why didnt she call me she said something about not being able to get through to your cell and not wanting to call you at home she said to tell you she was off on business and would be in touch either late tonight or tomorrow she said another thing too she doesnt want you to go home until you speak with her what you heard me dont go home tonight but why no idea but she made it sound as if you might be in some danger if you do this is crazy i asked her if you should stay with me tonight and she thought that would be a good idea why not with her will wondered you have room he asked i do i have some business to attend to tomorrow morning but i suppose i can go from your pad as well as mine she give you any idea whats going on nope i dont get it listen youll come to my place tonight ill fix you up with a toothbrush and a set of purloined scrubs and well talk they had arrived at the er leary motioned micelli to the head of the line and he led the expeditionary force into the waiting room the er seemed surprisingly calm especially considering the miles of rainslicked roadways outside the waiting room could probably hold twentyfive but at the moment there were just a mother and her baby neither of whom seemed particularly ill and a grizzled man with a hard hat on the seat beside him and an ice pack on his wrist good news micelli said after a brief trip to the inner sanctum of the er we can all go in what interest will had left in the fruitless search for his shoes had been shoved aside by the news of pattys call and her insinuation that he would be in some sort of danger should he return home tonight barbara cardigan the charge nurse had two decades of experience in the er and a carefully maintained gruff exterior that will knew would crack for almost anyone with a legitimate illness or injury she met the five of them by the nurses station how are you doing will she asked her concern genuine its been hell im sorry well much as id like to i dont think were going to be able to help you out weve certainly had clothing bags left around but not for more than a day or two you were brought down from the or to the crash room and intubated there i wasnt here that day but renee romanowski was i just called her shes certain that you were stripped down here not in the or and that someone put your clothes in a bag will visualized the scene and found himself feeling embarrassed in front of the others i was in scrubs he said for no particular reason well i certainly hope so cardigan said given that you came from the or mr micelli how would you like to proceed how many rooms do you have altogether fifteen two of those have four beds five of them have two and how many of those have closets i think about half of them do the rest just have shelves and theres a closet in the crash room yes the largest one will saw the muscles in jill learys face tighten seven or eight closets to inspect followed by a notarizing session in her office to document that they had found nothing coming off a long workday and with her husband and child waiting at home she had to be desperate to have the safari disbanded ill tell you what micelli said as if reading learys mind im assuming the crash rooms empty right now it is well lets all go there together and if we have no luck we can split up and each of us can check a closet in the rooms where there are no patients perhaps ms cardigan can check the others the nurse nodded her agreement and the six of them trooped into er the crash room which was reserved for major emergencies both medical and trauma will still distracted was brought back to the moment by the sight of the room where he had so often been one of the central players in a lifeanddeath medical drama he was again captivated by the vivid image of himself lying naked vulnerable and unconscious endotracheal tube down his throat ivs in his arms a catheter draining urine from his bladder into a plastic bag his career as a physician about to slip away goddamn whoever did this to me damn you the er used narrower beds than the icu each with a wire holder underneath for a patients belongings under normal circumstances there was no way a clothing bag could remain unnoticed for long but with a major emergency such as wills and a roomful of technicians nurses and physicians it was possible albeit remotely so that someone could have shoved the bag aside or even into the closet at the moment the accordion door of the closet was pulled shut but during a code it was often left open to make supplies more accessible micelli and barbara cardigan agreed to inspect the closet together will gave passing thought to waiting in the hall but instead stood off to one side feeling somewhat foolish for having gotten so excited about micellis theory in the first place the lawyer and nurse entered the supply closet which will knew was perhaps twelve feet by eight and filled with both medical and janitorial supplies a minute passed then another the four remaining in the crash room could hear snatches of an animated conversation coming from within finally micelli appeared at the doorway his expression neutral dr grant he said why dont you come on in here will did as he was asked the bag was thereheavy bright blue plastic somewhat larger than a shopping bag with white plastic handles it was on the floor wedged in a corner behind two mops a broom and a bucket dr w grant was printed in black magic marker across the front will stared at the clothing bag in utter disbelief as if the numbers on his lottery ticket had just matched the ones shown on tv we havent opened it micelli said but we each felt it there are two shoes in theresneakers from what we can tell he pulled a small digital camera from his jacket pocket and took half a dozen shots then he turned put his hands on wills arms and squeezed i dont believe this will muttered well get this bag sealed up initialed by all of us and off to the station evidence room with bob mcgowen as soon as tomorrow i might be able to have the state lab examining those shoes one of the women who works there had her renal artery accidentally tied off during a tubal ligation and lost a kidney lucky for us shes still working at the lab but with the law doctor on her side will said imagining a six or even sevenfigure settlement not for much longer ill bet youve got that right brother micelli said beaming youve got that right chapter with the camaros windshield wipers throbbing against what had become a steady downpour patty slashed through the night toward camp sunshine several miles back she had passed the white h on a purple background indicating that there was a hospital somewhere off to her right wills hospital he would be there right now with augie micelli searching the emergency ward and intensive care unit for a bag of clothing that had been taken from him two weeks ago it felt strange knowing that she was so near to him and that she couldnt simply swing a right and be there but at the moment she had a more pressing matter to deal with wayne brasco operating with zero insight and no feel for the case and probably with lieutenant courts cooperation had concocted a plan that was either going to fail utterly and without a whimper or fail utterly and get people killedquite possibly brasco himself unless she was greatly overestimating the skill and cunning of brascos quarry and she seriously doubted that she was they would know that the classified ad and phone conversation were bogus and would take brascos attempt to trap them as a challenge putting will in danger by pirating his voice without his knowing was as irresponsible as any police action she had ever encountered after this night was over providing brasco survived she was going to find a way to make him and their co answer for what they had done even if it meant going to her father at least will was safe for the moment calling micelli when she couldnt get through to him had been inspired it was clear he really cared for will and would do whatever was needed to ensure that he was out of harms way until brascos grandstanding stunt played itself out one very legitimate concern she had was that while brasco was trying to lure the killer into the open at camp sunshine the killer was poised somewhere within range of wills apartment waiting now at least she could shove that worry to the back of her mind there were still unanswered questions about the serial killings of four managedcare executives but one by one pieces of the puzzle were falling into place misdirection and mayhem smoke and mirrors boyd halliday and his killers had been operating that way from the very beginning and patty was ready to bet her career that it was going to be that way tonight misdirection and mayhem brasco you jerk it was quarter to nine when she skidded onto the narrow twolane that the map on the passenger seat said would lead to the entrance of camp sunshine three to four miles to go she had five or six minutes to cover that distance but she knew it wasnt going to happen even if she made it to the camp entrance on time there was no way she would be allowed simply to drive right up to the rendezvous area and make an impassioned plea for brasco and court to forget about their grand scheme and pull everyone back to safety the streetlights became more widely spaced then disappeared altogether the trim little houses gave way to dense woods making it even more difficult for the headlight beams of the camaro to slice through the rain and heavy darkness patty switched on her brights then just as quickly cut them off and actually slowed down she wasnt going to make it on time anyway and the last thing she wanted was to be wrong about brascos plan then to compound her stupidity and arrogance by alerting the killer this was parkland she rememberedmaybe a state forest not too far ahead on the left would be a long serpentine dirt drive ending at a narrow rectangular parking area demarcated by a ragged border of large decaying logs camp sunshine ten years ago she and a bunch of classmates had celebrated their fifth highschool reunion at the place not that it mattered to their softball swimming drinking flirting and cookout but even then the camp was in a state of impressive disrepair of the former sleeping quarterscanvas tents set on wooden platformsonly rotting sheets of flooring remained the outbuildings were in a similar state of decay and overgrowth in addition to the minuscule rent which was by far the cheapest they could find the features of camp sunshine that had led pattys reunion committee to choose the site were the natural beauty of the woods the ball field and the waterfront in addition there were acres of dense hilly woodland crisscrossed by narrow dirt trails the ball field was as wellmaintained as the rest of the camp was ignoreda vast grassy space with a rusting wire backstop in one corner and a barbecue pit the waterfront on a lake that was perhaps a mile long and half a mile or less across featured a sandy beach and a twostory rec hall that at least at the time of the reunion was intact and used for outings when the weather made softball impractical as patty turned onto the narrow winding access road she wondered about the person or people who owned the decaying camp which even nearly a decade ago was simply begging to be turned into condominiums or some other kind of profitable development perhaps there were zoning constraints perhaps a clause in a will or perhaps the owners were sentimental eccentrics no matter tonight serial killers had selected their camp to humiliate the state police and wayne brasco it was never about a vendetta against managed care it was never about a mother tragically dead it was never about principle it was never about will grant it was always about business smoke and mirrors misdirection and mayhem remember clementine remember tombstone death to the policeman who thinks hes smarter than we are a hundred yards or so down the road two men stepped out of the forest their powerful flashlights intersecting upon pattys face blinded she skidded to a stop grabbed her shield from the passenger seat and held it up in front of the lights at the same time she smoothly opened her window hoping that neither of the men thought she was reaching for a weapon they split up and headed for her car from both sides their lights still fixed on her face police the man to her left whispered harshly holding a semiautomatic weapon possible some sort of mp where she could see it both hands let me see em patty lifted her hands palms out dangling the leather case with her shield and id from between her thumb and index finger detective patty moriarity state police she said urgently ive got to get in there i have reason to believe this is a trap and the officer in charge is in danger maybe others too the policeman dressed in black with a black watch cap and greasepainted face told her to cut her headlights then motioned her out of the car kara you got her he said stepping back and sliding a radio from his belt patty actually managed a wry smile at herself for assuming the two cops were men a slight woman who looked absolutely gigantic with a semiautomatic at the ready moved around the camaro and kept her at bay from a respectful distance weapon she said stonily on the floor drivers side listen ive got to quiet the woman sidestepped around so she could shine her flash inside the car then motioned patty to get her gun and drop it on the ground patty could hear the man conversing in hushed tones with she suspected lieutenant court were close to being out of time she whispered shut up kara punctuated the order with a menacing flick of the muzzle of her mp patty sighed and did as she was commanded no sense getting her head blown off by a cop finally the other officer shoved his radio back into its holder and returned those people down there arent exactly your biggest fans he said thats because i dont leave the toilet seat up in the precinct loo patty thought she saw kara crack a smile beneath her blackface kara take her down the road to the others ill stay here with b squad and take care of her car be careful did they say if anythings happened down there patty asked nope i think thats good your carll be on a little road into the woods off this one about ten yards down there on the right there may be some camouflage netting on it fine my weapon why not patty retrieved her shoulder holster from the trunk slid in her smith amp wesson fiveshot and slipped it on nice piece kara whispered as they made their way into the darkness fifty feet from the parking lot another swat team member materialized from the heavy underbrush quickly got the skinny on patty from her guide then took charge leading her across the narrow parking lot over the rotting logs and down a rocky uneven trail toward the waterfront thirty yards from the lake he motioned her off the path and into the woods raised a finger to his lips and pointed to a spot nearby gesturing that she should stay there with the forest and dense cloud cover the scene ahead was impressively dark although patty knew that somewhere overhead the moon was nearly full the rain had given way to a fine mist which was being blown by a steady wind from directly behind her across the lake isolated lights from scattered houses battled feebly against the night closer patty thought she could make out the twostory blackness of the rec hall what in hell are you doing here the mans voice a harsh angry whisper from behind the trees to her right nearly stopped her heart lieutenant court either the rustling of leaves had masked his footsteps or he was incredibly good at this sort of thing ive unearthed some information about the victims she risked saying knowing that staying on the case after court had removed her would be grounds for a suspension if not worse somethings wrong i think this is a trap the killers want to punish you and wayne for messing with them like this court dressed like the others was wearing earphones moriarity you are a total screwup he said and furthermore youve been mucking about on a case that i specifically removed you from i had to finish some things i had started bullshit youll answer to me tomorrow at the office now just stay here out of the way until this thing plays itself out but he had already started off moving smoothly and silently through the trees toward the water patty hesitated then followed fired for a penny fired for a pound she was thinking ten yards from the shore just inside the tree line court dropped to one knee adjusting his earphones as if something was coming in for the first time patty inched toward him she was no good to anyone if he wouldnt listen to her and she had no chance of being listened to if she didnt try lieutenant courts glare would have cut glass he lifted one earphone an inch what is it with you i told you to lieutenant i really need to speak with you i went through ben moraless office and shut up its him court hissed brascos wearing a wire hes talking to the bastard right now patty moved back into the densest shadows six feet to courts left did he mean the killer was there at the waterfront if so she was wrong about everything the killers werent shrewd at all and the only misdirection and mayhem that was going on was between her ears in which case she and the helpwanted sections were about to become serious friends five silent minutes passed finally court turned to her weve got him he whispered his tone an equal mix of excitement and triumph hes coming in in from where its not clear he left a twoway radio on the beach for grant when did he do that if your people have been here i dont know must have been before the swat guys infiltrated the area fortunately we predicted he might do something like that our technicians brought the vds here and hooked it up brasco just spoke to him through it and what did the killer say he ordered brascoi mean grantto take the radio go up to the center of the balcony off the second floor and wait for instructions why the shit theres no way he can get the vds mike up there brascoll just have to wing it what makes you think the killers coming in he said so im looking forward to meeting you dr grant thats what he said now just shut the f up will you a chill knifed up pattys spine she wasnt wrong after all brasco and court were outmatchedway outmatched either this was going to be a godzillasize joke at their expense no harm done or wayne brasco was a dead man with jack court focused on the rec hall she edged further away from him to the right dropped to her hands and knees and began a silent crawl toward the water in moments she was at the tree line facing a sandy beach that was eight or ten feet across the wind had died off and the thin mist was gone the lake was an ebony mirror overhead patty thought she saw moonlight filtering through a rent in the clouds was he out there in a boat she wondered that made no sense escape would be impossible if as was the case will grant had ignored his demand to come to camp sunshine alone scuba gear elaborate and james bondish but risky could he be somewhere on land nearby right now right here in the camp thumbing his nose at a legion of highly trained police setting up for a closein shot insane there was no way the killers she was coming to know would put themselves in that kind of jeopardy what about explosives the fatal blast at serenity lane was an expert job could the rec hall be wired wired and waiting to go up like a giant tinderbox noisy colorful and undeniably effective she thought but really not that much of a challenge and open to discovery if the police took precautions still what other options were there a big bangthat had to be it bend over you fraud put your head between your legs and kiss your dumb butt goodbye to her left perhaps fifteen yards away patty could see brasco making his way to the side of the building and up the outside set of stairs to the secondstory porch which ran the full length of the building she imagined him getting edgy maybe panicking as he thought about trying to improvise without the vds why the second story was the killer waiting inside the building no chance unless he actually believed it was will waiting for him and waiting alone this is very weird she thought why the second story patty inched out so that she could see brasco positioned midway across the porch staring out like a sea captain searching for land the gap in the clouds had widened and moonlight was now pouring through sparkling off the still water and illuminating the far shore the far shore carefully patty rose to her feet brasco was motionlessa dark statue silhouetted against the brightening sky motionless patty panned across the lake the far shore seemed closer now than she had estimated from the scattered lightscloser even than she remembered with the right weapon and the right sniper scope in the right hands wayne brasco was nothing much more than a target in a shooting gallery granted a successful head shot at this distance would be olympian but any number of rifles tripodmounted and fired by someone who knew the physics of longdistance shooting could pull it off that was why the killer had picked this spot and why brasco had been so meticulously set up a single shot patty squinted as she scanned the far shore her imagination visualized the man she suddenly felt certain was out there grinning as he tightened the bolts holding his galil or la in place or peering through the infrared scope on his fn the ceos were deadtwo or three that mattered one or two that probably didnt the mergers forged in the heat of their blood were nearly complete so much misdirection and now the killer was playing the police like marionettes sowing the seeds of chaos as he prepared for what was probably going to be his last kill at least for this operationthe exclamation point on the managedcare murders barely aware of what she was doing and well beyond considering the consequences of her act patty broke past the line of trees and onto the beach sprinting toward the stairs brasco had ascended to the porch brasco down she shouted its a trap get down totally bewildered brasco stood riveted in place as patty took the wooden stairs two at a time get down she heard herself scream again she was just a few feet away when she saw a bright light flash in the darkness across the water launching herself at brascos midsection patty slammed him backward against the railing at the instant a bullet ripped through her scalp and gouged the bone just above her right ear the two detectives one totally stunned the other barely conscious exploded through the dry weakened wood and arced downward twisting in the air so that when they landed on a rocky corner of the beach brascos full weight was on top pattys head snapped against a boulder cracking the already weakened bone in her skull instantly what little awareness she had left was replaced by a deep impenetrable darkness in slow motion pattys ragdoll body toppled off the rock and came to rest facedown in the wet pebbly sand chapter it was twothirty in the morning before augie micelli stopped celebrating his coup with a wide variety of spirits and lurched off to bed by that time will had pulled out the sofa bed and tucked in a rumpled pair of forestgreen sheets printed with an armada of mallards for the past hour he had more or less been a detached observer of the battle between his need for sleep and his desire to share the moment with micelli of course the moment he finally killed the lights and settled onto the waferthin pullout mattress he became unable to sleep with the aromas of micellis alcohol and cigars hanging heavy in the air will lay in the darkness wondering why he hadnt heard from patty he had left a message on her machine trumpeting the find in the er and asking her to call anytime to share the good news and to explain why he was spending the night with the law doctor competing with his concerns for patty were thoughts about what the day ahead held in store from the moment he spotted wills clothing bag micelli had been on his cell phone wheeling and dealing he was now optimistic that preliminary results of the analysis of wills sneaker insoles might be performed as early as noon calls to sid silverman and tom lemm had brought their promises that if the chuck taylors tested positive for any amount of fentanyl they would immediately urge the board of registration to restore wills license and would then reinstate him at the hospital and in the society as soon afterward as possible while micelli was making his rapidfire volley of calls will made twothe unsuccessful attempt to reach patty and a call to jim katz the older surgeons relief was almost palpable if the killer was true to his promise he would be off the hook after that only time would tell whether or not his frangible relationship with will could heal beyond patty and the vast implications of the overlooked clothing bag will wondered about charles newcomber and how the odd little radiologist would handle a visit from both him and susan hollister images of the radiologistredfaced terrified trembling and perilously close to firing a bullet into wills chestbrought a fistsize knot to his gut susan was as calm and elegant as he was emotional and if anyone could break through newcombers bizarre paranoia it was sheespecially armed with a notarized release from grace davis still dealing with the man would be a test will rolled from his back to his side and finally felt the beginnings of sleep settling in for a time the blue plastic clothing bag floated through his thoughts like the goodyear blimp then quite strangely he envisioned himself as he would from the dirigible lying in the bed in the icu an endotracheal tube connecting his lungs to a ventilator it was a sickening vision but symbolically the scene marked the beginning of the hell he had been through and envisioning it now so soon after augies incredible find in the er supply closet meant that he had begun the journey back to reclaim his life finally finally as his breathing slowed and the tension in his neck and shoulders abated two words echoed in the darkness in his mind who and why where could she be whats happened to her will awoke the way he had drifted offbewildered by a torrent of questions by the time he left micellis apartment to pick up susan he was consumed with fear for patty she knew where he was staying something had to have happened to her last night or she would have contacted him worse still there was no obvious way he could find out if his concerns were founded phoning her office got him only an answering service he left a message for her and then one for wayne brasco as well feeling that the man now in charge of the managedcare murders would return any call from him will pulled into the lot behind his office a captive of worry and his own wild imagination was there anything else he could do to locate her what kind of danger did she feel he was in last night had it passed was it safe for him to go back to his condo had she been in danger too would she be angry with him if he tried to call her father susan looking the total professional in a conservative charcoalgray suit kept her phone pressed against her ear and her conversation going as she motioned him to the chair across the desk from her well thanks again she was saying i really never expected to enjoy the boss as much as i did it was just great well talk later okay bye the breathless way she said the last word left no doubt in wills mind that she was talking to someone special to her so youre a new springsteen fan i want him to think so she replied gesturing to the phone but if i had just one last concert i could go to id still take cecilia bartoli or yoyo ma lets hope you dont have to make that choice for a long time amen to that well the hospital lawyer stopped by and left a notarized authorization she went and got last night from grace davis so were all set amen to that are you all right why well were partners and ive seen you almost every day for years and you always look exhausted dont take this wrong now but today the bags under your eyes are baggier and the droop of your lids are droopier and you nicked yourself shaving which you almost never do and okay okay enough the truth is last night was a real emotional roller coaster that ended at around three or four oclock this morning with me sleeping on a pullout in the law doctors living room the law doctor will i forgot to ask did anything good come of last night well he said dragging out the word and managing a selfeffacing grin i think you could say that yes susan exclaimed pumping her fist will hurried through the events surrounding the clothing bag susans expression was one of amazement and excitement incredible she said dyou think the insoles will be positive for fentanyl i dont want to even consider the possibility that they wont me neither so did you drink too much last night is that why you ended up on the couch will hesitated then checked his watch they had half an hour he hadnt really spoken to anyone about his connection with patty but suddenly he wanted to and susan who had supported him in the society and worried about his isolation and long work hours like a protective sister was the perfect person on whom to unburden you know patty moriarity the detective very cute very serious carries a gun well she and i have begun um seeing each other aha you know when she was hanging around here interviewing everyone i actually thought in passing that she looked and sounded like an interesting match for you the gun turned me off though im a little embarrassed to say it but even though at first the notion of it made me edgy recently its actually begun to sort of turn me on i thought you said newcombers gun scared you half to death correction newcomber scared me half to death having him standing there like an apoplectic frog his hands trembling as he held a gun on me merely came close to completing the job well im happy for you youre going through tough times and having someone has got to help it would only she seems to have disappeared disappeared she left a message with augie micelli that i was in danger and should stay with him last night then she never got back to me i dont know susan said i wouldnt worry too much police are always going on stakeouts and clandestine operations and such and ah no young sir you are too simple you might have said a great many things about this proboscis of mine mon dieu why waste your opportunity the bellowing was coming from the waiting room for example thus aggressive sir if that nose were mine id have it amputated on the spot there was no question the voice was gordos yet it wasnt friendly how do you drink with such a nose you ought to have a cup made specially will and susan hurried through her office door and down the hall to the waiting room entrance the descriptive tis a rock a crag a cape cameron gleaming epee in hand darted about the deserted waiting room with surprising grace furiously fencing against an invisible adversary he was sartorially quite subdued this daytan slacks white dress shirt sedate suspenders blue tie a navy blazer lay over one of the chairs a cape nay say rather a peninsula the curious what is that receptaclea razor case or a portfolio amused and astounded as much by camerons deftness with the sword as the recital itself his two partners stood by the wall arms folded and watched the kindly ah do you love the little birds so much that when they come to sing to you you give them this perch to sit on cameron noticed them and lowered his sword his head tilted back haughtily cyrano will asked very good lad cameron replied his brogue now returned richer than ever believe it or not ive won the role of de bergerac in my local community theaters upcoming production thats wonderful gordo susan exclaimed cyrano de bergerac is a marvelous play yes bravo will said you surely seem to have the skill and the voice but wasnt cyrano um i mean wasnt he thin cameron said instantaneously changing his accent from robert burns to olivier i sir am the consummate actor i can do british i can do frenchbonjour mademoiselle et monsieur i can do germani vas only following orders i can do confederatefrankly scarlett i dont give a damn and by god i can do thin he switched accents facilely as he spoke and was right on with each of them will suddenly remembered a number of times over the years when gordo had regaled a cocktail party with stories requiring accents and even impressions the man was good well gordo he said if anyone can pull off a twohundredandfiftypound cyrano my moneys on you he smiled and patted his partner on the back but something had started gnawing at him when he was retracing his steps through the hospital searching for the way someone could have gotten fentanyl into his body and trying to tie the frameup to the serial killer he wondered about gordo simply because he was around that fateful morning now another piece had fallen into placethe or shoes gordo had ready access to his locker and will kept the key to it on the ring with his car keys if the man really wanted to there were any number of ways he could have gotten the key to make a duplicate in fact will felt certain within recent weeks cameron had borrowed his car at least oncemaybe even twice troublesome though in linking gordo to the phone calls was that even with his voice electronically distorted the killer had absolutely no accent and certainly no brogue there was no way will could believe the caller was gordono way until now opportunity methodall that was missing to close the circle was motive we should get going susan said in an hour i have some varicose veins to make magically disappear hey cyrano knees slightly bent head more erect and keep your tip up since when did you become interested in my tip lass come on will this is cyrano de pigsty with a flourish will thrust a phantom sword deep into camerons gut keep your tip up gordo he said over the short drive to the excelsius cancer center susan had will fill in the rest of last nights story including more about the unsettling call from patty to augie micelli if youre worried then im worried she said but i certainly sense that this is a very capable woman who almost surely can take care of herself if she hasnt called its probably because whatever operation she was involved in simply isnt over yet i hope youre right and i appreciate your listening to me hey im all for young love like the boss sang at the fleet center last night i wanna die with you wendy on the streets tonight in an everlasting kiss born to run exactly so he did get to you just dont let yoyo find out the parking lot of the mammography unit of the excelsius cancer center was largely deserted how should we do this susan asked carefully thats how very carefully the mans sanity seemed to be hanging by a thread i know it would probably go smoother if just you went in but the truth is newcomber and i have some unfinished business and i really do want to face him again i didnt leave his office easily or without comment even with that gun waving at me it was clear that something was terrifying him the man was screaming at me like a banshee when i first called him about changing his referral from you to me he sounded angry way out of proportion to the situation same deal yesterday the thing is even though i was the one who was there im not at all sure it was me he was frightened of i tried to calm him down to convince him i wasnt a threat i told him graces storyhow she made it all the way back from the gutter i begged him to get in touch with me to let me help him with whatever was wrong but he just got more and more agitated until it really did seem as if he might pull the trigger and you want me to be the first one through his office door will turned her to him by the shoulders and perched her chin up on his fingertips maybe thats not such a good idea after all no its okay susan said ive met him before remember besides who could shoot someone with such an angelic face as this the entrance to the mammography wing of the excelsius cancer center was on the south side the waiting room was empty save for two women in their fifties and the silverhaired receptionist who had let will visit newcomber on his last visit dr davidson she said nice to see you again will nearly corrected her then remembered making up the name he made a major upward revision of his initial impression of the womans sharpness susans expression said that she had caught on immediately thank you for remembering me mrs medeiros martha medeiros i have a thing about remembering names and faces sort of a hobby she tried for a coquettish smile that missed by about four decades this is i know i know dr hollister she said proudly sandra susan susan said thats remarkable absolutely amazing its been about a year since i was here thank you i enjoy shocking people consider me shocked mrs medeiros were here to see dr newcomber was he expecting you no but we just need to pick up a set of mammograms from him well dr newcomber isnt here will and susan exchanged disappointed glances he never comes in on thursdays until after one its like his day off only its just half a day dr debra grossbaum is here can she help you susan stepped forward and handed over the release signed by grace davis and notarized by attorney jill leary all we need are these films can you help us out there i can try i think our film copiers broken though so youll have to look at them here again disappointment we cant take them out martha shook her head its a strict policy any idea when the copier will be fixed none dr grossbaum just made a call about it a little while ago let me call daphna in the film library and see what she can do martha retrieved graces xray number from the database then called the librarian after almost five minutes with the phone tucked under her chin during which she registered two new patients martha set the receiver down a puzzled expression darkening her face mrs shemesh in the library says the copier isnt expected to be fixed until at least tomorrow no one seems to even know whats wrong with it thats okay will said frustrated we can view the films here well thats a problem too martha replied she cant find them theyre not signed out so she thinks theyve just been misfiled shes going to keep looking what about a computerized storage service susan asked martha made another call then shook her head daphna says theyre talking about getting a service like that but not yet apparently theyre quite expensive always the bottom line will muttered pardon nothing were just a bit disappointed daphna is upset too she apologizes and says shell keep looking do you want to wait or should i call you will glanced over at susan and shook his head apologetically at the same time he could tell she was wondering as was he if the disappearance of grace daviss mammograms was something more than a clerical error and coincidence what in the hell is going on he could almost hear her thinking he wrote their office number down and then remembering that their receptionist would be quite certain she knew nothing of a dr davidson he scratched it out and replaced it with his home phone it was doubtful martha medeiros would be calling anyhow if grace daviss films were gone they were gone for good will passed the number over and then hesitated hoping against hope that the film librarian would ring in with good news i guess we should have called first he said finally i can certainly leave a message for dr newcomber that you were here or maybe you can try calling him or stopping by this afternoon well figure something out susan said meanwhile feel free to leave him a note that we were here and tell your recordsroom person that wed appreciate her doing everything possible to find those films ill do that martha said coming out from behind the reception counter to bring a clipboard with some forms over to one of the new arrivals as she turned back she stopped staring out the window now thats funny she said to will and susan what thats dr newcombers car in the parking lotthat silver lexus sports car over there its his pride and joy maybe it broke down and someone drove him home i didnt notice it when i came in to work at seventhirty because my husband dropped me off at the main entrance but it must have been there will had noticed the exquisite sc model when they arrived those cars dont break down he said maybe he got here before you came and hes stayed in his office i dont think so could we check i um i suppose so let me call martha dialed newcombers extension waited a few rings and then hung up will flashed on the unbridled fear in the strange little radiologists eyes on the shaking of the gun in his hand and on the vibrant flush of red in his cheeks i think we should check in there he said motioning down the hallway susan i dont like this clearly bewildered martha hesitated and then finally withdrew a ring of keys from her desk drawer will was still ten feet away from newcombers door when the air changed it was a smell familiar to him after almost two decades of hospital workan amalgam of feces urine blood and body odor it was the scent of death he moved to stop martha medeiros but the knob to newcombers office turned in her hand she swung the door open and stumbled backward uttering a strangled gurgled cry her hand across her mouth the rancid odor of wellestablished death flooded the room the portly radiologist sat bolt upright in his highbacked leather chair held in place by a band of duct tape pulled firmly across his throat his wrists were similarly bound to the arms of the chair his dress shirt was ripped open at the front revealing a fleshy hairless chest that was pocked by half a dozen or more dark pennysize sores even from across the room will could tell they were burns still attached by an edge of adhesive to his glistening pate newcombers silver hairpiece flopped down over his left ear his graygreen eyes like a taxidermists marbles stared sightlessly across the room dried blood cascaded around the corners of his mouth from the nostrils of a nose that was quite obviously broken marthas legs had gone out from beneath her will eased her gently to the floor and then stayed in the doorway as susan hurried over to the desk the fewer people in the room until the police arrived the better and this man was far beyond needing medical intervention susan didnt bother confirming wills clinical impression no obvious mortal wounds or injuries she said a coronary maybe will i think these are electrical burns some sort of cattle prod maybe its possible he died while he was being tortured jesus from her place on the floor leaning against the wall martha tried to speak but managed only a piteous whimper easy does it mrs medeiros will said well help you in just a minute im going to call nineoneone wait come in and look at this will checked to make certain martha was secure against the wall then crossed over to the desk impaled on the pen and pencil of newcombers handtooled leather pen holder were two cardsplain white three inches square the letter c was printed meticulously on one the letter m on the other chapter the excelsius cancer center was set on a verdant lot in the bedroom town of moorland four miles west of fredrickston within five minutes of wills the first of what would be nine police cars from three jurisdictions arrived the cancer center was cordoned off and patients with appointments were told to reschedule seated alone in one corner of the mammography unit reception room will waited until a graying potbellied moorland police officer had finished taking a statement from susan and motioned that it was his turn on the way over he stopped briefly to speak with her just another routine day at the office he whispered poor little guy so with those two letters do you think it was the same person as killed the others i dont know what to think this isnt the usual highlevel target or even the mo of the managedcare killers but those two alphabet letters would certainly suggest thats who did this you still think its more than one i do in fact its a little hard to believe newcomber would have allowed a single person to truss him up like that without putting up a fight the office looked just like it did when i was here before and you saw when i slid open his drawer that his gun was right there so i dont think there was a struggle i dont know about you susan said but i can handle this sort of thing in the hospital a lot better than i can out here in the real world i understand same here you think a heart attack torture first then heart attack i didnt see any wound that looked as if it could have been mortal i wonder if he survived long enough to tell them whatever it was they wanted to know maybe they didnt want to know anything maybe they were just doing it for the fun of it ugh susan shuddered then put on her trench coat well ive got to get back to the hospital after this little adventure im really not up for doing any surgery but my poor varicosevein lady is already there and believe it or not theyre holding the or for me give em heck will said wistfully listen my friend before you know it youre going to be back in the or beating yourself into the ground again i hope so were all pulling for that to happen all minus one will thought thanks he said any ideas what we should do about graces missing xrays not really im not certain theres anything we can do lets talk about it later fine thanks again for coming here with me suze youll understand if next time i beg off huh i wont even bother asking she motioned toward the window looks like my cabs here i owe you one at least as susan headed off over her shoulder will could see the portly moorland police officer speaking with a new arrivala tall angular man wearing a neatly pressed belted tan trench coat moments later the man quickly approached will dr grant detective court state police if youll wait right over there ill be with you in a couple of minutes court pattys co he had to know where she was for fifteen minutes will waited the crimescene people came and hauled their equipment down the hall soon after an ambulance crew arrived and wheeled off martha medeiros who was now virtually catatonic will recalled the pride in her expression as she boasted about her unusual skill with names and faces he found himself wondering if the killers thought for even a moment about the spouses friends children employees and other victims of their zealous beliefs he knew it was a stupid question so grant another death and here you are court had come up from his left and now stood there staring down at him with piercing slategray eyes here i am will echoed sweetly court had already set the tone for their exchange so will felt there was nothing to be gained by trying to act as if the two of them were on the same side the detective pulled a chair around to face him and settled in his keen eyes still probing you going to be able to shed any light on this i saw those two letters on the pen holder in there if thats what you mean so you think your phone pal is responsible for this murder too it does seem like a logical conclusion for someone who drugged his way out of medicine you are a smug son of a bitch i can see why brasco doesnt believe you i couldnt care less what brasco thinks of meyou either for that matter wheres detective moriarity where were you last night at nine whats that got to do with anything you going to answer my question or do you want to see how miserable i can make your life wheres moriarity im going to give you five seconds to answer me then im going to walk away if i do that you can count on being arrested before you leave this building now where were you last night before three of those seconds could elapse a young acnefaced uniformed policeman came rushing over lieutenant court he said with breathless excitement the station just radioed the victims got a record sir ten years ago molesting a young boy in fort worth texas courts glare could have frozen magma you get the fuck home right now youre suspended but get out of here tell your co ill speak with him later and after that go sit in a corner and think about what you just did but go will watched as the decimated young man shuffled toward the door still it appeared in the dark as to what he had done wrong a little hard on the lad doncha think will said he deserved worse for speaking like that in front of a witness youre next if you keep dicking around with me in case you couldnt tell im not in a very good mood now where were you at nine last night will sighed and decided this was not the time to stand up to the man i was with augie micelli the law doctor thats right now where is she all night from eight oclock until this morning if youre lying youre toast there were three or four others with us at nine theyll vouch that i was there now where is she shes in your hospital if you hadnt gone and gotten yourself thrown off the staff youd probably know that shot fell camp sunshine blood clot on the brain operated on intensive care only a few words in courts abbreviated explanation registered but they were devastating i need to get out of here will said youll stay until im done with you dr hollister was in there with me and shes already given a statement im going listen we know all about you and sergeant moriarity making dirty together will nearly leapt at him were grownups he managed fuckups would be a better way to put it shes in a coma grant so rushing over there wont make any difference neither will talking to you will snapped before court could react will sprang up and raced out the door get back here he heard the detective shout dammit grant this is a murder case half expecting to hear a gunshot from behind him will raced across the parking lot and scrambled into his jeep i knew it he said out loud to himself i knew something had happened to her he screeched into a uturn and sped out of the parking lot moments later a darkblue mercury sedan pulled out from between two parked cars and followed at a professional distance as usual the main parking lot at fredrickston general was full as were the two rows reserved for physicians will finally found a place on the street a block away he entered through the main lobby and eyes down melted into the crowd and carefully skirted the lone security guard on duty even though the clothing bag and or shoes had been found it was unlikely sid silverman would lift his ban at the hospital until he absolutely had to like brasco court and so many others silverman had formed his opinion of wills guilt much quicker than he would ever let it go even if the insoles of the red chuck taylors were as loaded with fentanyl as will and micelli expected them to be it was likely that many of his detractors would still believe he was somehow responsible as he hurried up to the icu he wondered about those inmates who were awaiting execution on death row in so many states all the while knowing that they were innocent as he entered the unit will could see a crowd gathered in cubicle for an instant he thought there was a code blue in progress but the lack of frantic movement suggested otherwise then over at the bedside he saw peter ng the slopeshouldered neurosurgeon who for several years had been a member of the hippocrates society albeit not a very active one that detective moriarity in one he asked the nearest nurse yes but dr grant we have instructions that the bans been lifted besides shes a relative without waiting for her response he walked confidently past and into the glassenclosed room ng watched by two nurses a resident and a couple of medical students was peering through an ophthalmoscope examining the arteries veins and optic nerves inside pattys eyes to the left of the bed on the xray view box were two filmsone showing a panel of ct images and the other a preop side view of pattys skull even from ten feet away will could see the fracturea jagged threeinch crack dark against the white of bone the ct scan obviously taken before surgery showed a rather large collection of blood beneath the area of the fracture unwilling to push to the front of the group will peered over the shoulder of one of the med students hunched over patty ng was blocking some of his view but he could still discern that she was motionless and connected by a breathing tube to a ventilator much as he had been at the beginning of this nightmare i am looking for any blurring of the margins of the optic nerves ng was saying and also a loss of the slight pulsations in the veinsnot the arteries but the veins either of these findings would be a warning of the buildup of pressure within her skull that would signify brain swelling at the moment i see no signs of trouble but im going to keep her on steroids just in case if she remains stable for the next four hours well pull the breathing tube how she does from here on out will depend on how long this coma lasts ng dictated a set of revised orders which his resident dutifully wrote down then he stepped back from the bed and noticed will gratefully there was nothing in the neurosurgeons face to suggest that anything had changed in their alwayscordial relationship got a minute peter of course go ahead everyone ill meet you all in the hall he waited then turned to will gosh its good to see you you all right his concern was genuine to his left will could see more fully the battering patty had taken the entire side of her face was contused and swollen from this angle she bore little resemblance to the woman who had made such sweet love with him im all right he said flatly someone set up that drug thing i still dont know who or why but im going to find out its been hell but theres some light at the end of the tunnel im glad to hear that you know this woman shes a good friend well she should do all right but i confess i am a bit worried about why she hasnt woken up ng reviewed the circumstances of her injury but couldnt supply any details of why she had been at camp sunshine or who the fellow officer was whose life she had saved will wished he had paid more attention to courts account you can see her fracture ng was saying the result was a tear in the middle meningeal artery as you can see on the ct scan over there we were lucky to be dealing with epidural blood not subdural lucky was an understatement will knew the prognosis from bleeding between the skull and the durathe protective membrane covering the brainwas not nearly as grim as if the collection of blood was subduralunder the dura between it and the brain itself but you have no idea why she hasnt woken up from what i can tell she fell twelve feet from a balcony and landed headfirst on a rock with a mans weight on top of her i didnt see any actual brain bruising but given the concussion from such a blow im not that surprised she hasnt woken up yet he saw the concern in wills eyes listen this is an epidural not a subdural and with no major brain contusion shes going to wake up will and shes going to be okay im glad she has you for a doc peter will said ng took his hand and shook it im glad she has you for a friend he replied for twenty minutes will sat in the dimly lit cubicle listening to the soft dependable whoosh of the ventilator the steady beep of the cardiac monitor and the faint whir of the iv pumponce the sounds of his world now a hymn to his helplessness to his right lay the woman who had opened his heart in ways none other had for many years if they ever got out of this messif she ever woke up if he ever found his way back into medicinehe was going to do things differently it would be the kids first then patty then maybe some sort of exercise program to get back in shape the society could still have a piece of him but a smaller one managed care had to be stopped but his role in the battle could and would be less and as long as the twins wanted to share the open hearth experience with him he would continue signing up there but he was through working eighty hours a week in the hospital just to break even he was through living in a chronic state of exhaustion just to keep maxine from siccing her lawyer hounds on him he was through saying yes simply because he hadnt developed the gift of being able to say no over the years since his marriage had begun coming unraveled what he did had completely overwhelmed who he was he wouldnt wish the nightmare of a suspension on any doctor but in one way having to endure his suspension had been a blessing the wonderful paradox was that he was ready now truly ready to go back to being a surgeon because he didnt need to he reached across and set his hand on top of pattys her skin was cool and dry the monitor overhead showed a regular heartbeat but just the same he slid his fingertips around her wrist and assured himself that her pulse was strong any change doctor the mans voice from just inside the doorway startled ten or fifteen minutes off wills life he pulled his hand back and spun around although he had never seen the man before he knew it was tommy moriarity moriaritys arms were at his sides his posture ramrod straight even through the gloom will could see pattys eyes and mouth in his as well as the shape of her face the policeman was dressed in jeans and a plaid flannel shirt and carried a thin book in one hand shes stable will said good i guess you know who i am i guess you know who i am too the two men shook hands awkwardly and moriarity crossed to the other side of the bed does she need that tube he asked dr ng her surgeon just left if her condition hasnt deteriorated after a few more hours hes going to have it pulled shes tripping the machine on her own right now and the tube could damage her trachea if it stays in she got hurt saving a fellow officers life i heard that but i dont know who wayne brascothe man who took over for her inwardly will groaned and hes okay he asked barely a scratch shit do you know what happened nobody seems to know there was some sort of sting operation brasco set up to catch the managedcare killer patty showed up uninvited and tried telling people they were on the wrong track and were being set up finally she knocked brasco away just as a shot was fired she took a bullet along the side of her head then hit a rock when she and brasco fell the bullet didnt do more than stun her will said the rock is what did the damage but shes going to wake up right will looked across pattys inert form at her father for all his gruffness and military bearing he looked frail and frightened still will carefully avoided any kneejerk reassurances given the sort of injury she had and the location of the bleeding she could wake up any time but head injuries are very unpredictable until she wakes up we have every reason to be worried thanks for being straight with me moriarity said rubbing briefly at his eyes he held up the thin tattered volume he had carried in this is one of her favorite books from when she was growing up its poetry by emily dickinson i thought maybe id try reading to her from it thats a wonderful idea when someone is unconscious we never really know what senses are still working i wanted her to be a professor or even a lawyer shes a good cop will said i know well why in the hell didnt you ever tell her that will wanted to shout out he stood to go youre a hero to her he said so are you from what i can tell moriarity replied for what its worth she knows i havent done anything wrong she told me that at the moment im giving you the benefit of the doubt there but do yourself a big favor doc and dont ever do anything to hurt her again will held back any reflex reaction fathers protect daughters it was as simple as thatat least it should be you have my number he said if you have any medical questions or any questions at all for that matter please calljust remember that your guys have my phone tapped will battled back the urge to stop by sid silvermans office to see if there had been any news from the lab instead he walked the block to the jeep through a raw gray early afternoon and headed home the piecemeal sleep he had gotten on micellis pullout plus the tension generated by the events of the day were taking their toll all he could think of was an hour or two of oblivion on his own bed followed by a shower some fresh clothes and a return to the icu given the urgency of pattys warning yesterday he wondered if he was still in some sort of danger or if the events at camp sunshine had altered things for a time images of charles newcombers grotesque corpse dominated his thoughts was his death in some way related to his history of pedophilia or his homosexuality could it possibly have been connected with grace daviss films in view of the two alphabet letters skewered on newcombers pen set no explanation made sense other than that his name had popped up on the screen of the managedcare killers but knowing what he knew of their motives and methods will felt no comfort with that explanation either the wolf hollow condominiums looked as unruffled and serene as usual there was a prim white guardhouse at the end of the entry drive but shortly before will moved into the complex the condo association had voted down the expense of manning it or installing any of a number of possible electronic security systems cautiously will drove past his unit scanning for anything the least bit out of the ordinary finally determined not to spend another night on the law doctors couch he parked in his space and entered the town house through the rear door his personal security system was still on he disarmed it with the twins birthday and crossed to his mail slot by the front door his antennae still searching for trouble the note was on top of a small wad of bills and circularsan undistinguished business envelope with will grant printed in pencil in an unsteady somewhat juvenile hand wills first impulse was to treat the envelope and its contents as evidence and to handle it with a tweezers before opening it with a knife but he was hardly in the mood to be patient with some care he held the envelope by one corner took it to the kitchen slit it open with a steak knife and extracted a piece of typing paper folded in thirds the writing also in pencil was by whoever had addressed the envelope for a gift from charls come alone to the corner of dennis and spruce in roxbury tonite bring cash roxbury during his surgical training will had done several rotations through boston city hospital which drew many patients from that section of the city the population there was largely black and poor and the areas reputation was simply put that whites should avoid it after dark bewildered will wrote down the address and carefully replaced the original sheet in its envelope charles newcomber had been dead less than a day was this note from his killer what did the foppish little radiologist have to do with roxbury will had a street map of boston in the car but had only driven through a few blocks of the community while taking the kids on excursions to the franklin park zoo he had absolutely no idea of the layout of the streets was he insane just to bop on in there at night should he notify jack court about the note and perhaps the most perplexing question of all did he even have in his bank account chapter whatd you say the elderly black man dapperly dressed in a sports coat dress shirt vest tie and plaid walking cap had been ambling past a row of shops that were all secured with metal accordion gates now in no apparent rush to get anyplace despite the inclement weather he hunched down by the open window of the jeep beneath his small black umbrella and squinted in at will it was already twenty minutes after eight dusk had come and gone yielding to another in what seemed an unending string of raw drizzly nights the tangled narrow streets of roxbury many dating to colonial times had completely overwhelmed wills tattered street guideor at least his ability to read it dennis street he said in the exaggerated voice he had unfortunately developed over years of treating older patients in hospitals and nursing homes dennis im looking for the corner of spruce and dennis thats spruce right over therehe pointed to the cross street behind himbut i cant find any dennis off it or on my map hey the man said no need to shout just because i been on this earth longer n most dont automatically mean im deaf will managed a grin at himself sorry bad habit you sure these streets are in roxbury the manmaybe in his eightieshad a creaky highpitched voice that reminded will of a child in a school play trying to portray an old man thats what the guy wrote roxbury see right here careful to cover up the part about bringing will showed the man the note and he studied it for a time you know what he cackled suddenly i think i know why you been havin trouble i dont think dennis is a street at all i think its like an alleydennis way its calledtwo blocks maybe three down spruce that way if theres a sign and as i recall there usually is one its nailed to one of the buildings not on a pole thanks youre great will moved to put the jeep in gear but the man stopped him with a raised hand i dont think the alleys wide enough for a car he said especially this one youd best park someplace near and walk ill do that you know what would even be a better idea what go on home and come back tomorrow during the day take it from ol lionel at night theexcuse me for cussindarn gangs own this part of the city cabs almost never come here the cops only come round when they have to and then they only stay long enough to say they did it i never carry moren a dollar with me when i go for my evening constitutional the cobras used to shake me down if they were particularly desperate for money but now theyve pretty much given up on me you go walkin about these streetsespecially back in there where dennis way isan theyll know youre there quicker n you do its doubtful that youll make it out with your wallet or maybe even your car for that matter most of thems pretty good boys but they dont have much in the way of parentin if you know what i mean ill be careful lionel carefuls good lionel said but it might help for you to be bulletproof too that does it will thought as he drove away from the man down the virtually deserted street and made a slow left onto spruce i am out of here with cars parked on both sides spruce was barely more than a lane wide to either side will now noticed narrow alleys each with a name bolted in some way to the brick facade of a tenement alley one of them read wrights path another the fourth sign he saw was dennis way will opened the passenger window and peered down the alley which was illuminated by a single lowwattage hooded lamp jutting out from a building halfway down to the next street there were two small dumpsters several trash cans and enough loose trash to fill a good portion of them he reread the mysterious note if he drove off now would he ever get another chance to find out what charles newcomber had left for him if he didnt leave would he still be alive in half an hour at that moment as if by divine intervention the lights on a parked car pierced the night two blocks ahead moments later it pulled out and drove away will raced to the spot although there was absolutely no competing car on the street silently he promised himself that if the space was by a hydrant he was out of there and on the way back to fredrickston he had mixed emotions that there was no hydrant and so no need to put the deal to a test in less than a minute after a brilliant job of parallel parking he was standing on the sidewalk in a gloomy windblown drizzle peering uncertainly down a deserted street in one of the toughest most dangerous neighborhoods in boston perhaps whoever had left the note had waited and was gone he thought confirming on his casio that he was a full half an hour late again he thought about leaving again he talked himself out of it and headed cautiously back toward dennis way although both the street and the alley seemed deserted he couldnt shake the heavy feeling that he was being watched he stopped at the mouth of the alley zipped his windbreaker and debated whether to stay where he was or move ahead the note had instructed him to be at the corner of the alley not down it he was about to turn and leave when the muzzle of a gun was pressed tightly into the small of his back dont turn around the youthful almost certainly black voice said you grant will waited until his pulse rate had dropped back below a thousand yes he managed you dont need that gun ill decide what i need and dont need now jus head down that alley all the way down eyes straight ahead will did as he was told hesitating halfway down as a rat the size of a cat scurried across his path less than a foot from the toes of his sneakers no collar he said i wonder if its had all its shots the response to his nervous humor was a sharp nudge from behind they passed under the light and were almost at the far end of the alley when the gunman grabbed him by the jacket take this off he said he patted will down from behind lingering a beat it seemed by the front of his jeans then he pushed him out of the alley and onto the sidewalk of the street that seemed to run parallel to spruce finally he turned will around and tossed his jacket back he was in fact a teen maybe sixteenseventeen topsbaggy chinos pricey leathersleeved jacket with chris embroidered in script over the left breast ornately stitched rasta cap his unlined richly black face was equal parts pretty and handsome his eyes even in the dim light were bright and intelligent enough but they were way past being the eyes of a youth and will sensed the hard times they had seen cradled in the young mans right hand was a snubnosed revolvera saturdaynight special in his left was a large manila envelope the sort used for transporting or mailing xrays the buildings at this point blocked most of the wind and rain and will noted with relief that aside from a few drops the envelope was dry did you bring the money the teen asked i did believe it or not it wasnt so easy coming up with five hundred on such short notice but ive got it i thought you were a doctor ive fallen on some hard times too bad stick around here if you want to really learn what hard times are all about hand it over let me see what youve got for me hand it fucking over there was no mistaking the edge in his voice this was not the time for negotiation will did as he was told the teen flipped through the stack of bills and then shoved them into his jacket pocket that your name chris what if it is chris put that gun away im no threat to you ill decide whether youre a threat or not how did you know newcomber was dead i i just knew will could tell he was lying despite the gun and the attitude he began feeling sorry for chris you didnt know did you well someone was in the process of torturing him and he had a heart attack why i dont know maybe it was about those xrays shit he been callin me twice a day eight in the morning eight at night he said if he missed a call i was to get this envelope to you his gun still leveled at wills midsection chris had already regained his swagger the five hundred was your idea will asked what if it was like the man in the movies says its all about the benjamins how do you know newcomber for a second it seemed to will as if he was in for a flip answer or none at all then a look that might have been sadness drifted across chriss face ol charles liked me i did things for him he did things for me you like to have things done for you i dont think i like the kind of things youre talking about hey dont knock it if you aint tried it and dont go talkin like a smartass at someone with a gun pointin at you neither listen chris why dont you just let me have that envelope you got your money now how about giving me the envelope like charles asked you to and let me go home chris hesitated then passed it over it was thick with xrays although in the gloom will could tell nothing beyond that well he said his pulse racing at the notion that in just a couple of minutes he would be behind the wheel of his jeep heading out of roxbury and back to his condo thanks for keeping your end of the deal charles would be very pleased with you dont mean shit to me whether a dead man is pleased with me or not chris said with forced bravado hes gone and there are plenty more like him out there anxious to take his place is it okay for me to go now no grant actually its not the mans voice came from the darkness along a brick wall just inside the alley it was a voice familiar to will although he couldnt at that instant figure out from where drop the gun chris now you fucking bastard chris hissed at will i didnt the gun the voice snapped from the darkness still looking like something of a bookworm despite the broad shoulders narrow waist and heavy pistol he held aimed directly at chriss chest stepped boyd hallidays executive assistant marshall gold wills thoughts spun wildly as he tried to get his mind around what was happening and why nothing made sense i have no beef with you pal gold said just put your gun away in your pocket chris hesitated then did as he was told who are you he asked hes the man who killed quick as a rattlesnake gold whipped the muzzle of his pistol across wills face opening a gash on the side of his jaw and dropping him to one knee calmly his cold eyes fixed on will through his wirerimmed glasses gold bent down and retrieved the xray envelope from the pavement okay lets go hotshot he said he reached down grabbed will by the collar and yanked him to his feet with little effort will felt blood dripping down his neck but refused even to touch his wound he did use his tongue to probe the inside of his lip which was cut and his teeth one of which seemed loose what in the hell is going on if gold had killed newcomber and left the two alphabet letters then he was also the managedcare serial killer it made no sense was he trying to mislead police by being a copycat listen pal chris said suddenly to gold those xrays are for sale to the highest bidder how much you got on you gold laughed ive got the gun and here you are shaking me down you are a pile of balls my little friend a pile of brass balls but here you go where i come from having brass cojones gets rewarded he pulled a money clip from his pocket and with one hand worked off what looked like a hundreddollar bill then he flipped it in chriss direction it blew a few feet away and fluttered to the sidewalk the teen made no move to pick it up instead chris folded his hands disdainfully across his chest that aint nearly enough he said well get used to it because thats all youre getting come on grant you and i have some business to attend to i dont think thats all our man chris is gonna get from this dude a rich bass voice said do you rod a man clearly older and heavier than chris stood up from between two parked cars at the moment an even larger man moved out from somewhere in the shadows of the alley both held guns pointed at gold one of them some sort of submachine gun i dont think its nearly enough rod said how bout you smitty what you think no way its enough i say mr tough here is downright cheap thats what i say how about you guys a third man materialized from the night and slid out from behind gold pistol ready then two more appeared from across the street seems like we never get visitors around here anymore eh biggs a wiry man in his early twenties emerged from a tenement doorway and moved in next to chris this is biggs chris said to the two white men he says jump you ask how high biggs had narrow closeset eyes a broad flat nose and a thick northsouth scar that crossed his upper and lower lips just to the right of midline hail hail the gangs all here he said now mr tough why dont you jus put that fine piece of hardware on the sidewalk and kick it over here his eyes still all business gold complied will sensed that despite the firepower fixed on them he was actually evaluating his chances in a shootout these xrays belong to my company gold said this man here killed to get them im willing to pay you well to get them back thats a lie will said hes the killer he does it for a living how much more you got on you biggs asked will ten dollars hand it over i find you got any more im gonna shoot off one of your fingers you how much moving with deliberate slowness gold slid the money clip from his pocket and tossed it over biggs counted the remaining bills which will thought might add up to as much as a thousand and stuffed them in his deep pants pocket you jus bought yourself some serious consideration my man ill leave him and the xrays here with you while i go and get some more gold said twice that much then i want them both i wonder what it is about you that i just dont trust what you all think guys you think we should let him just take off bogus he sucks you can throw him farther n you can trust him we aint standin around here in the rain the will of the cobras has spoken biggs said we aint waitin around for you or anyone you want this dude mr tough you gotta catch him chris will you feel you kept your part of the bargain if we give this hangdog say a minutes head start a minuted be fine biggs a minute it is then give him that envelope mr tough youre costing yourselves a lot of money well decide what were costin ourselves now give it to him and lay down on your face but down okay now hangdog you got a minute ready go wait i fiftyfive seconds no no not back up that alley down that way fifty seconds now get going fortyfive seconds with biggss voice echoing behind him will sprinted off down whatever street they were on which he believed ran parallel to spruce forty seconds frantically he searched for an alley crossing over to spruce instead the street began sloping upward and curving to the leftaway from where the jeep was parked thirty seconds biggss voice still seemed to be coming from just a few feet behind him wills legs felt as if they were moving through molasses he looked in better shape than he was and countless nights on call hadnt helped matters the muscles he needed for standing at the operating table or prowling the wards of the hospital were strong but aerobically he wasnt much of a specimen already he was breathing heavily and a sharp stitch had formed in his side gold had perhaps five or six years on him but he was also fit with the xrays tucked against his body wills stride was choppy and unbalanced in addition to the dagger in his side every step sent a railroad spike hammering into his battered jaw a right turn where in the hell is a right turn initially he had been grateful they left him his car keys and certain he could make it to the jeep before gold caught him now he debated whether it was worth abandoning the notion of the jeep and instead trying to find a place to hidea dumpster perhaps or a doorway into a building his minute was over he felt certain of that but the bend in the road made it impossible to see if gold was closing on him ahead on the right he spotted a street sign fixed to the side of a building like the one for dennis way alley a right here then maybe two more rights and he might find spruce it seemed like a better bet than trying to hide someplace maybe just the turn would be enough to lose gold still sprinting full bore trying to ignore his mounting discomforts he charged into the alley which was cleaner and less cluttered than dennis ten yards in he caught his toe in a pothole and fell sprawling face first onto the slick pavement he cried out as skin tore off his knees and palms air exploded from his lungs the envelope of films skidded out of his grasp he glanced back as he retrieved it and scrambled to his feet nothing yet ignoring pain in half a dozen different places he sprinted ahead he was nearing the end of the alley when he heard a gunshot from behind him a piece of brick to his left shattered off silhouetted against the dim light at the far end of the alley still a good distance away gold appeared to be on one knee steadying himself for another shot will lurched to his left as the second shot ricocheted off a wall not far from his head damn biggs would never have given gold back his gun he must have had a second one hidden somewhere no surprise the man was a pro the end of the alley was just a few yards away a car splashed past on what seemed a much wider street than spruce right then maybe another right will guessed realizing at the same time that he might have gotten completely turned around even if he could put a little more distance between him and gold would he have a chance to reach the jeep jump in and get it out of a tight parking space doubtful even if his sense of where he had parked was right on the money it was extremely doubtful he could make it out in time still however remote there was a chance he pushed himself even harder blocking out the aches and the hopelessness of his position charging around the corner he narrowly avoided colliding with a man walking toward him it was lionel still on his evening constitutional gasping for air will grabbed him by the arm and roughly pulled him into the shadow of a brick tenement lionel lionel listen he heard his desperate voice plead im in big trouble here take this and hold it for me wait in here until it seems safe then go home ill find you who panicked beyond waiting for any reply or working through the potential consequences of what he was doing will thrust the envelope into the old mans hands and pushed him into the rear of the unlit recessed entryway to the building then praying gold wouldnt realize that his initial move had been to the right he hunched over as if he were a running back with a football and sprinted across the rainswept street to the left another shot snapped off from the alley then another both sounded much closer than had the previous ones he was across the street now pounding past a beauty parlor then a tax office trying to keep his speed up as pain in his hands jaw and knees and the horrific stitch in his side slowed him down a block passed then most of another grant give it up gold called from behind those were warning shots i can kill you right now but i wont just give me the films the killer was gaining rapidly now will knew that barring the sudden appearance of a patrol car or police station it was almost over for him ahead and to his right was the entrance to an old unlit cemetery from what he could tell none of the headstones seemed large enough to offer a place to hide still the route would take him even farther from lionel and if he made it through maybe there was more activity on the other side with no plan other than to keep moving he cut sharply to his right between two shoulderhigh granite steles and into the graveyard he hadnt gone more than twenty or thirty feet when he tripped over a low stone nearly obscured in the long grass and pitched forward slamming shoulder first into a marker that looked to be centuries old at that moment part of him wanted to quit to just roll over and wait instead he scrambled to his feet and stumbled ahead the far side of the small cemetery seemed to border a fairly busy street two cars sped past then a third if he could just make it there he sensed he had a chance what little remained of his hope lasted only a few more seconds before he reached the low hedges marking the far border of the graveyard he was tackled from behind with stunning force his face narrowly missed a stone as he pitched forward into cold wet mud with golds full weight upon him another instant and he was on his back his attacker straddling him looking furiously about his dirtstained face a mask of rage squeezing wills cheeks inward until his mouth involuntarily opened gold thrust his pistol to the back of his throat okay you son of a bitch he rasped where are the frigging films chapter there was no way will could tell what was first to work its way into his fragmented consciousnessthe freefloating disconnected images of the hours perhaps days just passed the distinctive odors of animals and disinfectant or the intense pain the room was quite long and fairly narrow with a high ceiling illuminated by two rows of fluorescent tubes and the light from three windows along the wall to his left he was naked lying faceup on a hard thin mattress whether out of pity or anger someone had thrown a moldy brown army blanket over him he flashed on the similar sensations of waking up on a respirator in the icu following his fentanyl overdose he was absolutely helpless then and terrified of the tube down his throat this time he was simply miserable there was swelling about his eyes that made it difficult to see clearly his face felt as if it were caked in cement he could open his mouth but only at an agonizing price his nostrils admitted only thin streams of air shakily he reached up a puffed abraded hand and confirmed that the cement was in fact thick layers of dried blood covering his nose lips chin and chest bits of memory continued to drift together then flutter apart like windblown leaves he knew that at some point he had been drugged then hurt then drugged again a wiry little man with bad skin and yellowing teeth had cut him or burned him in some way asking over and over about the xrays had he told them about lionel given that he was alive it didnt seem likely he had always had a welldocumented stubbornness and bulllike obstinacy could those traits so often a source of problems for him possibly have been enough to resist torture and at least for the moment save his life again the smell of animals worked its way past his swollen nostrils a farm of some sort he struggled to focus he was in a virtually bare room in what seemed to be a housepossibly a farmhouse little by little the fog shrouding his senses and his memory began to lift the rain the cobras the guns the envelope marshall gold hunched over him his face pinched with rage the muzzle of his pistol jammed so hard against the back of wills throat that it seemed ready to tear through to the other side there abruptly the memories ended had he passed out had the drugs and the pain ablated the final pieces of his illfated trip into the city the questions kept coming how had gold gotten him out of roxbury to this place who was the little man who had tortured him when they were ready for him to die how were they going to do it would the kids ever know for certain that he was dead or would he simply become a missing persona photo in a thick binder or one of many flyers on the bulletin board of a police station and perhaps most baffling what were the thick collection of xrays in the envelope all about gingerly he tested first his fingers and hands then his arms feet and legs none of them was painfree but none brought the sharp boring discomfort of a broken bone it seemed strange that gold hadnt bothered to tie him down in some way he rolled uncomfortably to one side and squinted into what might have been morning sun filtering through the gauze curtains that covered each of the three windows the unadorned walls of the room were painted light blue the door and trim around the windows white to his right was a small gouged wooden table with no chairs piled by one of the legs were his clothes the notion of trying to retrieve them brought a wry painful smile given the agony of even minute movements the clothes might just as well have been lying on the floor of his closet at home still his nakedness felt unpleasant and demeaning enough to push him to try it wasnt until he had propped himself on one elbow that he first noticed the burnssmall black discs of seared flesh a dozen or more of them half an inch or so in diameter covering his chest and arms in a more or less random pattern he shuddered these same burns dotted much of charles newcombers corpse whatever instrument was responsible had apparently been more than the radiologists heart could handle will was relieved that the fingers of his own memory seemed unwilling to fully grasp his experience with it he rolled off the mattress onto the chilly hardwood floor doing his best to ignore the stabs of a thousand daggers he pulled his way across to the pile of clothing and began arduously pulling on his underwear as he finished he noticed that beneath the nearby gauze curtains the windows were unbarred he scanned the room but saw no obvious cameras if they werent watching him through some sort of monitoring and if the room wasnt any higher up than the second floor he had a chance he could use a table leg on the window and strips of blanket tied to the table to get to the ground he leaned against the wall and inched into his jeans which were filthy and sodden apparently he hadnt been in the room long enough for them to dry he was turning back to inspect the window when the single door to the room opened marshall gold entered accompanied by the slightly built man with the pencilthin mustache and pockmarked face gold handsome and fit in a buttondown dress shirt and tan slacks looked rested and refreshed he was pushing a wellused highbacked wooden armchair his unpleasantlooking companion dressed all in black clutched a scuffed leather briefcase to his chest as if it were an infant will had little doubt that the contents of the case had everything to do with the burns on his body dont bother doctor grant gold said those windows are halfinchthick plexiglas is that why there are no cameras wills voice was sandpaper he tried unsuccessfully to clear away the raspiness do you think we need them i think youre sick maybe maybe so gold replied thoughtfully i think ill take that as a compliment well now my friend youve given us quite a night fuck you i believe weve heard him say that before dont you dr krause krause nodded a tough nut mr gold he said his formality sounding like wint or kidd the handholding killers in james bonds diamonds are forever a tough nut indeed its too late will said youll never get those xrays i dont care whether we get them or not gold said i care whether anyone else does how did you get me here will began to pull his sweatshirt over his head but quickly gave up exhausted and aching from the effort you mean after you passed out on me or after the kids spotted us in the cemetery and ran away those jerks took my favorite weapon but not my cell phone and not the other gun will said as a few more pieces of the hideous night just past fell into place not the other gun gold said moving the ominous chair a foot closer potentially a lethal move there were only six of them so i could have just taken them out and walked away with the films now it appears that perhaps i should have done it that way pity golds expression darkened you will tell us what we want to know fuck you so pardon me for saying it doctor but youre really not in very good cardiovascular shape take that up with my personal trainer the point is you really didnt get very far before i caught up with you still by that time the films were gone gone will echoed holding his hands up in mock dismay he glanced at the chair then at krause and decided that from then on he had best keep his flip retorts in check he had won round one but at a severe price round two was certain to be even more horrible and if he lost that round if he gave in and told them about lionel it was going to be over for himno more twins no patty no more anything but where gold went on that is the question that has been troubling me for most of this night where after we removed you from roxbury several of us retraced the steps of your flight inspecting every can dumpster and doorway along the way nothing i dont believe we would have missed a postage stamp let alone an envelope the size of the one you were carrying you could have had someone waiting for you but we were watching you from the moment you left the parking lot at the cancer center to the hospital then to your condo to the bank and finally all the way into roxbury there was no one im certain of that you could have given it to a passing driver but none of them even slowed to help younor would they in that part of the city he moved the chair to the center of the room so how did you do it there were a few seconds in the beginning when you were out of my sight then a few more just as you were crossing the street thats when something happened isnt it you gave the films to someone right there but who youre way off i shoved them in a mail slot we actually checked that there were none on the route that were large enough no sir you had to have handed it to someone and the only person i can think of is that old man you stopped just before you parked your carthe one with the umbrella you stopped him to ask directions then ran into him again at that corner he told you his name didnt he he told you how to find him youre way off base you will tell us who that man is and how you were going to meet up with him again if you dont then you will have suffered through a mountain of pain for nothing because sooner or later were going to find him were just going to go back there and work the neighborhood with enough money until we find someone who will send us to the right door then do it i dont think were going to have to do you dr krause krause pulled the table over near the chair and set his briefcase on it i dont believe so at all he said we have a bet you and i mr g and i never lose a bet will felt a wave of nausea wash over him slick sweat materialized beneath his arms he had passed out during krauses last go at him and had awakened with a merciful amount of amnesia how far would his stubbornness take him this time so dr grant gold said you have just two choices at this moment tell us the name of the man you gave the films to or take off your clothes for an encore of last nights festivities fuck you will managed your choice gold turned to the doorway mr watkins a black man the size of a pickup truck stepped into the room at your service mr watkins our guest is complaining about feeling hot and also about a sudden desire to be up in that chair do you think you could help him out i would love to help him out watkins said he reached behind him brought in a metal bucket and a mop and lumbered across the room toward will you only threw up once last night before you passed out gold said dr krause has promised me he wont cut things so close today chapter lying in their darkened bedroom donna lee felt her husbands fingertips slip under her t and begin gently kneading the muscles in the hollow of her back and down over her buttocks she had never been a very deep sleeper especially over the year since little davy was born and she was awake in seconds honey cant you sleep she asked dreamily i dont want to she stopped herself at the last possible moment from asking what would happen if one of the kids walked in on them and was it worth locking the door when was the last time they had made love in the early morning maybe a couple of years she rolled from her side to her belly and he responded by massaging her behind in slow patient loops one side to the other the way she loved itthe way that never failed to turn her on oh baby she moaned softly that feels so good so good his hand slid between her thighs and helped her become even wetter than she already was she could feel his hardness against her responding she raised her arms over her head pointed her toes and stretched her body out as taut and straight as an arrow the tradeoff for fewer surprises in their lovemaking was that each of them knew so well what pleased the other not predictable really just comfortable she pulled her shirt off and he turned her toward him kissing her in the way no other man ever had or ever wouldpressure just right on her mouth lips apart but not too much tongue exploring caressing even as hers explored him oh i love this jeff she said and i love you so much she took him in her hand and stroked him rhythmically until he had grown so large she could barely get her fingers around him and so hard it seemed he might break fifteen years of marriage and rubbing him this way still excited her so dont stop donna dont stop donna huh donna donna pushed away from her desk and rubbed her eyes anne hajjar arms folded was looking down at her mischievously like donna she was dressed in a set of aqua scrubs and a flowerprint hair cover beyond her donna could see the icu pulsating the way it always did when the census was near capacity today though they were again short a nurse so everything was if possible moving even faster whats up she asked trying for a businessasusual look you were actually out werent you her longtime friend said teasing asleep at the switch it was my break come on you looked like you were smiling there so anne peered down at her then suddenly grinned knowingly you had sex this morning didnt you donna raised herself up regally i refuse to say you bimbo jesus hajjar youre not a bimbo when you make love to your husband i wouldnt know i divorced mine before i could find out what it was like listen go back to your daydreaming its good that at least someone around here is smiling today im jealous as hell and i hate you for jeff but ill still handle the new admission the er just called about nonsense im up for the next one and ill do it i can put jeff on pause what do they have sixtyeightyearold man with chest pain looks like it may be an evolving mi theres still a chance they may want to take him to the cath lab to open up a couple of his arteries with stents so this guyll fill us up do you want to ship someone out to keep a bed open if we can do it sure who do we have mr turnbull he had runs of extra beats all night remember or were you busy reliving youknowwhat during report hey cut me some slack with three kids this is not an everyday occurrence what about lila its either her or patty moriarity all the others are too unstable i vote lila her cardiac enzymes are down and her pacemakers working fine and shes even more of a demanding pain in the neck than she was the last time she was here besides pattys still in a coma and hasnt even been here for two days yet even though shes medically stable and off the vent dr ng would go ballistic if we tried to ship her out to the stepdown unit in this condition so would dr grant he was in there with her for a good long time yesterday hmmm should we be crossing him off the hospitals mosteligible list i think he crossed himself off the list with the fentanyl but he may be back on i just heard hes getting his license back something about somebody soaking the insides of his or shoes with fentanyl i heard that rumor too who would do a thing like that i dont know but i am really relieved theres an explanation for what happened will is a very good guy so you think will and patty the doc and the cop how romantic were you in with her just now i was shes breathing easily and handling her secretions okay between the surgery and whatever she went through saving that guys life she is really battered still its probably just me but i think she seems a little lighter than she did yesterday epidurals tend to do better than subdurals i hope so because im going to be very upset if she doesnt wake up shes a hero i want to get to know her come on lets check her and lila and make a final decision about who goes lila the two friends made their way through the icu looking in on each of the glassenclosed rooms as they passed they were both seasoned veterans of their profession and were blessed with a sixth sense that often told them a patient was about to go sour or even sometimes that the icu was about to be inundated today short a nurse they were both a bit edgy but comfortable knowing there wasnt a situation that could arise where they wouldnt know how to react patty moriarity lay serenely still breathing easily patches of gauze were taped over her eyes to protect them against dryness the right side of her face was gentian with bruising and in places streaks of black and blue had made their way across the midline patty donna said bending over the bed rail and straightening the oxygen prongs patty its your nurses donna and anne squeeze my hand if you can hear me anything nope she doesnt look as light as i thought she did my experience with epidurals is that the coma seesaws lighter and deeper and then most of them just wake up okay that cinches it lila is history shell do fine in the stepdown unit or even on one of the floors listen our resident hero here is due for a neuro check you want to stay and do that and ill get the paperwork started on lila sure but no reliving your youknowwhat with youknowwho im all business with pleasant thoughts of her husband hovering just below the surface donna removed pattys eye patches her pupils which were initially quite dilated from having been covered gradually became smaller and reacted to direct light by constricting even further good signs patty its donna squeeze my hand please squeeze my hand nothing donna pressed her thumbnail into pattys forcefully enough to cause discomfort ever so slightly pattys thumb twitched at least donna thought it did she repeated the maneuver nothing and again same result shrugging she worked each of pattys limbs and digits through a full range of motion no resistance finally the nurse ran her thumbnail in an arc heeltotoe along the bottom of each of pattys feet minutely pattys great toes responded with the slightest downward movement toward the irritant sensation the babinski sign a reflex upward movement of the toe often signifying a disconnection between the brain and the extremities was absent it was another positive findingor at least not a negative one pattys neurologic status was no worse than it had been and if the slight movement to a painful stimulus was real it might even be better carefully donna pulled down pattys lower lids and squirted in a small amount of lubricant then she took new patches and taped them in place come on baby time to wake up and smell the coffee at the thought donna reflexively inhaled deeply through her nose then again she looked about quickly going to red alert seeing nothing she hurried to the doorway hey annie she called out anne hajjar poked her head out of lila terrys room patty awake i wish come down here will you i smell smoke or something anne was halfway down the corridor when she smelled ita faint chemical odor more acrid than simple smoke she stopped short as donna hurried past her to the nurses station and grabbed the fire extinguisher they were moving together trying to locate the source of the odor when with two loud gunshotlike snaps acrid black smoke began billowing from someplace beneath the beds in rooms and call a dr red annie donna shouted as she dashed into the first of the rooms extinguisher at the ready jeannie lesley get ready for an evac respirator patients first as soon as we have ambu bags to ventilate them and a minimum of three people per patient each of the other patients needs at least two with them put signs on their beds send one through four to the er all the rest out to two east donna hurried past her moments later the hospitalwide page system broadcast the operators uncharacteristically urgent voice dr red to icu stat dr red to icu stat dr red to icu stat dense black smoke had now nearly filled the two patient cubicles and was drifting out into the corridor connecting all the rooms with the nurses station donna felt certain this was an electrical fire of some sort probably within the wall she was the charge nurse today and until someone in authority arrived from security or the fire department all decisions were hers the acrid fumes were making it unpleasant to breathe there were two ambu bags in the icu and three portable oxygen cylinders according to the dr red protocol the respiratory therapist should be up with as many more breathing bags as she could quickly get her hands on followed by someone from the er with the ones they had and finally just in case a nurse with the bags from the crash carts on each floor donna pulled on a blue paper mask handed them out to the other nurses and then saw to it that those patients not on respirators had them in place okay annie she called out lets get portable oxygen into two and six and move them first before any patients could be moved the icu began to fill with people and noise two medical students burst in along with a surgeon and several nurses a huge uniformed security guard suddenly appeared on the scene as well barking out orders like general patton at anyone who would listen and trying at the same time to convince people that he was in charge and they were to pay attention to him the patient in cubicle was removed from her ventilator by one of the nurses a med student transferred her bags of iv fluids from poles onto her bed then they slowly guided her bed through the crowd and out of the unit while a tech from respiratory inflated her lungs from an ambu bag hooked up to one of the cylinders of oxygen one gone the number of people milling about was increasing almost as rapidly as the density of the smoke what seemed like dozens of voices were shouting and issuing orders at once oxygen hook a portable tank to the bag where are the portable tanks there are none just go you cant move him like that he just had a hip replaced everybody just quiet down and listen to me the iv pole its falling over watch it the icu continued filling up with far more nurses physicians technicians and security people than were needed to move the remaining patients everyone was talking or shouting or coughing certain her voice was just adding to the commotion donna quickly gave up trying to coordinate anything and focused instead on getting the very unstable eightyyearold postop cardiac patient in cubicle ready for transfer across the bed from her partially enveloped in smoke rubbing at her eyes with her sleeve anne hajjar did her best to keep up ive got this a man was bellowing let go for chrissakes no you dont you dont know what in the hell youre doing youve got to turn off the oxygen dammit turn it off or youll risk blowing us all up more bodies more noise more turmoil more smoke donna anne and another nurse all of them sputtering were maneuvering the bed with their unconscious patient toward the doors as fast as they could manage while still adequately breathing for him adrienne donna called over to one of the respiratory techs unhook the vent in two and follow us you got it do you have a room for this guy on your wing donna asked the nurse twosixteen is empty people should be there waiting for us we have twotwelve as well if we need it great adrienne were going to twosixteen god that was awful in there anne said when they had reached the corridor leading across the hospital to the medsurg wing you can have all the fire drills in the world but when it isnt a drill all of a sudden no one remembers anything and everyone either wants to be in charge or wants to be a hero people just want to help i suppose we could have done better with the five of us who were in there when the whole thing started here let me help you get martin over to his new bed then ive got to get back to the unit what do you think happened in there some sort of short in the wires in the wall i suppose well hang in here with martin annie ill see you later donna hurried back to the icu the smoke could now be smelled halfway across the length of the hospital and she wondered if the entire building might have to be evacuated before the fire was under control from outside sirens were wailing any moment now an army of police and firemen would be added to the hellish scene in the icu the hallway outside the unit was full of milling people now many of them newly arrived and some of the others sootcovered and ordering everyone to stay out of the way there are more than enough people in there stay away from the doors keep back the firemenll be here any minute move back down the corridor and make room for them as donna reached the glass icu doors they glided opened a billowing of dark smoke preceded lila terrys bed being hauled out by two nurses and three or four others some of whom were barely able to keep one hand in contact with the bed katie how many patients left in there donna asked as they passed her i dont know just one i think better get in there and make sure no ones gotten trampled good point the density of the smoke had lessened or at least had grown no worse the mob perhaps finally realizing that it like the patients might be in some danger had begun shoving its way back through the main doors donna hurried down the row of cubicles all were empty except for room and the nurse and two security men were ready to move the patient from there black smoke was continuing to pour from the wall sockets in rooms and no flames no heat just acrid smoke donna helped see the last patient out of the unit and had returned for a final inspection when the first four of the firemen arrived including one who was clearly in charge in seconds the unit had been emptied of everyone except her she quickly reviewed the chain of events occurring over what had seemed like hours but in truth had been only slightly more than fifteen minutes you did a great job she was told she looked around at the bizarre scene i guess i did she was thinking she left the unit and returned to the medsurg wing where she had helped bring the patient from room anne hajjar gave her a thumbsup martins tough she said he actually looks a little better than he did before the fire nice job the fire people have taken over im going to the nurses station to find out where all the rest of our patients and staff are donna took over a small builtin desk and commandeered the phone after five minutes of calls she sat in utter dismay staring down at a page of notes shed taken then just to be certain she called each of the floors again bewildered she was rubbing at the irritants and fatigue that were stinging her eyes when anne hurried over from room denise just came over she said breathlessly referring to the nursing supervisor she says there was never any fire apparently someone set off a very elaborate radiocontrolled smoke bomb the fire people have no idea why i think i know why donna said her face ashen what patty moriarity is gone annie i dont understand i mean shes not in the hospital ive called everyplace twice from all i can tell someone wheeled her into an ambulance and just drove away shes been kidnapped chapter cascading images of the twins preceded wills realization that he was awakea realization that also mean he was still alive like coming out of deep anesthesia one by one his senses began reporting in the farm smell mixed with a number of other pungent odors once again he was naked on the fetid mattress no one had bothered to clean the sickness off him but to his right he could see that there was a grimy white hand towel on the floor and water in the bucket that the behemoth named watkins had dragged in a sledgehammer inside his skull was monitoring each heartbeat every muscle in his body ached but it was his fingers where the throbbing was most acute his fingers the maniac krause had done something to his fingers now he remembered he remembered screamingscreaming over and over to blot out the pain no fuck you stop please stop go to hell go to hell go to hell let go of my hands you bastard let go noooo fearing the worst he withdrew his hands from beneath the army blanket they were covered with brown caked blood but no part of any digit was missing the source of the bleeding was three of his nail bedsthe ones on each middle finger where the nail had somehow been pried up but not completely removed and the one on his left index finger which was dangling obscenely by a single thread of tissue he could only believe that he had passed out before krause had gone after the joints themselves that was the only explanation that made sense it was certainly doubtful the creep had drawn the line at permanent mutilation jesus he murmured how did this happen to me he raised his brutalized index finger to his mouth and bit through the strand of skin releasing the nail the air from his gentle exhale passed across the raw bed and produced the pain of an abscessed tooth he rolled over gasping as he lowered his hands into the cool water he didnt remember telling krause about lionel but then again there was still much he could not recall gingerly he washed the gore from his hands the pain seemed to sharpen his memory the twins that was it he had battled the little monster by forcing his mind to focus on them dan and jess at age one at five on the swing set in the backyard serving clients at the open hearth throwing snowballs at him and each other he knew that the moment he told the moment they had the xrays he was as good as dead the moment he gave in he would never see the twins again as long as he held out against the pain and misery as long as he battled his rodentfaced torturer there was hope however slim he blotted his hands dry then reached into the bucket again and rubbed water over his face his senses cleared still more gratefully the memory of precisely what had been done to him remained cloudy but one thing now seemed certain he had beaten krause again with the help of his kids and the determination that had pulled him through countless allnighters in various hospitals his jackass stubbornness had stood up once more to marshall golds pervert as before he located his clothes under the small table and painfully put them on crying out every time his wounded fingernails brushed against fabric quickly he learned to keep his hands up near the level of his heart as much as possible ignoring the pulsating pain he crawled to the wall beneath the plexiglas windows and forced himself to stand for the first time he got a prolonged look outside his prison the sky was slate gray the light filtering through the overcast suggested morning was well along if not gone as he had suspected he was being held on the first floor of a large farmhousewhite with black shutters from this point of view he could see two weathered outbuildings a large wellused tractor and the corner of what seemed to be a sizable barn also white there was a corral of some sort beyond the barn with hay a water trough and several cowsjerseys if he remembered rightwith hides like tan and white jigsaw puzzles not far beyond the outbuildings was a vast fencedin field and beyond that forest there was no hint as to where the farm might be located using his elbow will tested the window it was as gold had said thick plexiglas firmly bolted to the house he wondered how many others had been imprisoned there and why and acknowledged that if he were ever to escape from this room it would be through the door at that moment as if on cue the lone door opened and marshall gold stepped inside he was absolutely resplendent in pristine nikes a pair of black satin workout pants and an unadorned gold tshirt that accented the striking v from his shoulders to his waist a towel was draped over his neck it seemed clear to will that in public boyd hallidays executive assistant went out of his way to dress in conservative styles that underemphasized his impressive physique no sense tipping anyone off that the mildmannered bookkeeper also just happened to be a professional killer grant good to see you up and about he said cheerily drop dead i can have my man watkins bandage up those fingers if you wish he was a corpsman in the army that must have been before he discovered pizza actually theres a surprising amount of muscle in there so bandages or no send him in tell him to be gentle though i have a very low pain threshold gold grinned well we still want those xrays and you still havent told us how you managed to get rid of them and where they might be now good i figured when i didnt wake up dead i hadnt told you i guess after he killed charles newcomber you told krause not to be quite so heavyhanded something like that lets just say he wanted to get closer to the line and i wouldnt let himat least yet youre fortunate that you have the propensity to pass out some people never do what kind of animals are you before he um suddenly passed out newcomber did tell us he had earmarked the films for you thats why i was following you when you drove to roxbury whats so important about those films anyhow will asked do they show how your cancer center screwed up and diagnosed grace davis as having cancer when they werent her films will knew even as he said the words that the explanation really didnt make sense to him almost certainly the mammograms werent graces yet she did in fact have breast cancer one other thing was bothering him although he never got the chance to open it the envelope he had managed to pass over to lionel was bulky and heavy it had to contain many more than just one set of mammograms why we want those films is our business gold said and i promise you we will have them why would i want to give them to you when if i do im dead correction gold said his pale eyes menacing soon events will transpire that will obviate the need for those xrays when that time comes we will no longer have a need for you and you will in fact become history however if you cooperate now and help us remove the chance that those xrays might surface at an inopportune time you have my word that you can go free you will be no threat to us anything you say will be your word against ours and pardon me for saying it but at present your word isnt worth too much will weighed golds logic and found it badly flawed regardless of what the man promised there was no way will was going to be allowed to leave the farm alive he steadied himself against the wall and clenched his teeth against the throbbing pain in his fingers was there any way he could survive another session with krause leave me alone he said with more panic in his voice than he had expected he held up his hands how can you do this gold sighed theatrically suit yourself he said we havent time for you to keep passing out on us so we have decided another approach is called for he returned to the doorway wat come on in and put some bandaids or something on his fingers i want him looking and feeling his best for his lovely guest wills eyes narrowed as he tried to read beneath golds words jess his mind shrieked jesus theyve got jess he stopped himself from screaming anything out loud just in case he was wrong although using the kids seemed like the sort of thing gold would have already considered massive watkins lumbered across to him with a firstaid kit which he opened and set on the small table the scissors inside were plastic as were the tweezers no help there will craned his neck to see past gold and through the doorway hurry up gold hurry up his heart was threatening to pound through his chest wall as watkins used peroxide then applied antibacterial cream and a bulky gauze dressing on each finger come on come on finally the giant packed up the kit and returned to gold you want me to bring her in he asked i think its time will gritted his teeth and held his breath patty her head bandaged eyes patched nasal oxygen prongs in place an iv bag resting on the sheet that covered her from neck to ankles was wheeled into the center of the room on a telescoping ambulance stretcher the bag attached to her catheter hung down from one of the horizontal struts she lay motionless breathing steadily clearly still in a coma will tried not to show how stunned and ill he was feeling how in the hell had they gotten her out of the icu whats this supposed to mean to me he managed sorry grant that doesnt work you two have been an item for a while now policewoman sleeps with murder suspect everyone knows it thats bullshit okay then if you dont care you dont care wat go find dr krause and tell him i want this womans little finger cut off tell him not to worry because she wont feel it and besides shell still have nine left he turned back to will next time though it could be one of her lips will felt smothered unable to breathe jesus what kind of monster are you he managed someone who wants information from you and is rapidly running out of patience you son of a bitch will knew he was beaten he gave up his pretense reached beneath the sheet and took pattys hand in his at that moment krause arrived his narrow pockmarked face glowing at the prospect of getting back to work pretty he said leering down at pattys bruised face very pretty you have work for me it seems so gold said feigning a helpless resigned expression as if giving krause the green light to begin mutilating patty was taxing for him dr grant one last time help us get what we need and i promise you your friend here will be dropped off unharmed someplace where she will be quickly found and taken back to the hospital i have every reason to despise her given that she messed up what would have been the greatest shot of my career but i will release her will knew that despite golds earlier promise of amnesty for him there was no chance whatsoever the man would let him live but with patty in a deep possibly irreversible coma she certainly posed no threat there had to be a way to stall things until he could think of a deal of some sort that would guarantee she would get safely back to the hospital his mind was working furiously sorting through various scenarios none of them provided any deal on which gold couldnt easily renege at that moment minutely but unmistakably patty squeezed his hand startled wills surgeons mind and reflexes instantly kicked in his hand remained virtually motionless but tightened around hers he bowed his head shaking it in apparent frustration as he shifted his weight checking to see if the sheet moved there was little if anything to be seen and certainly neither gold nor the other two seemed alerted to the change once again as if to be certain he knew pattys hand tightened just a bit then relaxed watching the sheet as much as he dared will returned the pressure i know i know just be careful i need some time he said time for what gold asked i think ive made myself perfectly clear i need some sort of guarantee patty will be returned to the hospital unharmed i gave you my word gold cut the crap you kill people ten minutes give me ten minutes to see if i can come up with something better than your word and if you cant will looked down at patty and gently brushed his hand across her forehead again immediately there was pressure from her hand she was not only awake she was wide awake if i cant ill have to decide if theres even a chance youd make a promise not to harm this woman and actually keep it what do you think dr krause should we give grant his ten minutes or just go ahead and see what hes really made of you know my answer to that krause said surveying patty from head to toe ten minutes gold said after that either were on our way to roxbury or i turn her over to the good doctor here wills stomach turned at the notion bring me a chair so i can sit here he said no problem wat bring dr grant a chair and bring one in for yourself its okay to stay over there by the door just keep an eye on him make sure he behaves under that sheet there krause snickered will ignored him he was processing the fact that gold had probably been telling the truth about there being no hidden surveillance camera although a hidden microphone of some sort remained a possibility as krause and gold moved through the door and watkins moved past them will bent down and kissed patty on the temple one is yes two is no he whispered understand one squeeze ten minutes gold said tapping his rolex then following krause out of the room if you were me what would you do watkins will asked should i go out to roxbury and get those xrays one squeeze huh oh sure i would do whatever mr gold says hes not a person to mess with will scanned the narrow room for anything that might have been a bug there didnt seem to be one but if he screwed up now and gold realized patty was awake they would have lost the only advantage they had from what she had said before her injury it seemed possible she had already figured out that excelsius health was behind the murders that had to be why she wanted him to cooperate if they somehow got out of this there was other evidence besides the xrays that they could use to nail gold and his boss there was slight pressure on his hand pushing it a half an inch at a time down the thin stretcher mattress until it hit against the catheter you want out he asked one squeeze whats that watkins asked i asked if you wanted out of all this you dont seem like such a bad guy i do my job watkins said whatever it is if mr gold tells me to be bad i can be real bad the catheter was kept from being accidentally pulled out by a round balloon blown up just before the tip it was inflated not with air but with water inserted by a syringe through a port on the near end will found the small syringe taped to the drainage tubing carefully deflated the balloon and then slid the catheter out the corners of pattys mouth turned up slightly not only was she awake but now she was more mobile gold says hes the one who shot her will said did you hear him say that one squeeze impatiently watkins checked his watch if mr gold says something its generally true you got three minutes is there anything you need from you one squeeze lying virtually motionless patty hooked one finger around the iv tubing and touched it to wills hand he stood lifting the sheet enough to see that the iv catheter in her wrist had clotted off he loosened the tape holding it in place slid it out of the vein and kept pressure on the puncture site with his finger still more freedom of movement for her i meant is there anything i can do for you that might convince you to let me go two squeezes not likely suit yourself i could do a stapling procedure on that stomach of yours youd be out modeling bathing suits in no time id rather eat watkins was checking his watch again when the door flew open marshall gold showered and now dressed in dark slacks a sports jacket and a tangerine turtleneck strode past the giant to stand across from will just inches from the stretcher with a final tightening on pattys hand will withdrew his from under the sheet dont move baby his mind was screaming dont move a muscle so i gave you two extra minutes grant whats it going to be i want your promise again that youll get her back to the hospital unharmed youve got it youre lying you son of a bitch okay but i also want your word that the guy with the xrays wont be hurt either he hasnt done anything i want watkins there to hear you promise you really have brass balls to be ordering me around like this in your situation okay okay if the guy is not a danger to me i wont hurt him will hesitated as if he were still considering he felt sick at the notion of putting lionel in harms way but there really was nothing he could do i gave the films to the man who gave me directions at the very end of the street where i lost you for just a couple of seconds thats right i gave the envelope to him and told him to take it home and id buy it back for a thousand dollars then you ran across the street in the other direction exactly golds expression was absolute glee in that instant what little hope remained in will vanished he and patty were dead and poor lionel would likely fare no better i knew it was something like that gold said how are you going to find him again im not sure i know his first name and the area he lives in i didnt have time to get his last name i planned to bring as much cash as i could come up with and bribe as many people as necessary until someone told me where he lives i would guess a lot of people know him he seemed like a real character whats his name id prefer gold whipped a bonehandled switchblade from his pocket flicked open the fiveinch blade and grabbed pattys little finger whats his fucking name he roared llionel its lionel golds fury instantly vanished and he smiled across at will benignly lionel nice name well lets you and i go and find this lionel marshall youre not going anywhere we have business to attend to will recognized the voice after the first word he flashed back on the faneuil hall debate that had started everything as boyd halliday strode into the room and took up a place at the foot of the stretcher i want those films before tomorrow gold said speaking to the excelsius health ceo more as an equal than an employee i understand marsh i want them in our control too but ed wittenburg is due here any minute to go over the figures for tomorrows meeting and to put the folios together and i must be home by five for a dinner party my wife is throwing for the board officers of our soontobe subsidiaries he turned to will well if it isnt the darling of the society welcome to the farm dr grant life seems to have been rather unkind to you since we last met will shook his head derisively is that what this is all about halliday he said acquiring companies halliday looked back at gold i need you here with us marsh as it is were barely going to have enough time to finish our business today and the meeting is set for ten tomorrow morning how about sending mr watkins with our friend he might do better than you in roxbury anyhow but halliday gestured toward patty shell be here with us right yes but so theres no chance dr grant will cause mr watkins any problems isnt that right doctor whatever you say will muttered if he does cause even one bit of difficulty if mr watkins doesnt call in every fifteen minutes on the dot the good doctors relationship to this sleeping beauty will be how should i say cut short what companies are you acquiring tomorrow will asked wait wait dont tell me let me guess the companies youll be acquiring just happen to have been controlled by the four people who just accidentally happened to have been murdered by a killer out for revenge what a convenient coincidence actually halliday said we were only interested in two of them but patterns can be so revealing mr watkins are you ready whenever you say wat gold ordered before he leaves this room put a pillowcase over his head and tie it at the bottom take it off only when you reach roxbury use the handcuffs for the trip too just in case he loses his mind and decides to be a hero if he gives you any shit at all just shoot him through the knee then the balls and then drag him back here you got it boss we can keep her right here in this room marsh halliday said he reached down and gave pattys great toe a playful tweak im sure dr krause wouldnt mind watching her chapter what kind of car is this watkins lincoln town car nice i knew i was kneeling on the floor of something pretty spiffy smells new i take good care of it keep your hands up on the seat where i can see them youre threehundred pounds of frigging muscle and im kneeling on the floor of your car with handcuffs on my fingers all torn up a pillowcase tied over my head and my girlfriend being held as collateral what are you worried about mr gold tells me what to do and i do it and this time he told me you are not to be trusted so get your hands up on the seat where i can see them or im going to reach down and grab them and put them there and i dont think you want me to do that will did as he was ordered there was an abruptness to watkins a coldness that he hadnt fully appreciated at the farmhouse despite his buddhalike physique and moon face and the care with which he had bandaged wills fingers there was nothing soft about him if watkins needed or wanted to kill chances were he would do so without remorse gold knew that otherwise there was no way he would have trusted the man as he had they were maybe twenty minutes away from the farm and at golds insistence will had spent the entire ride on his knees his butt crammed under the dash his face pressed onto the front seat at first influenced by any number of hostage movies he tried remembering turns and listening for the sort of telltale sounds that might enable him to retrace their journeythe tolling of a church bell the whistle of a train the jackhammering of road construction he heard nothing that he could pinpoint of course before retracing any steps he had to deal with his handcuffs and overpower the gargantuan at the wheel of the town car quickly he gave up listening for clues and instead forced his mind back to the conundrum of how to guarantee that gold would release patty he had yet to solve that puzzle and time was running out its not going to happen jerk face it shes as good as dead and so are you gold and halliday had been several steps ahead of everyone throughout this nightmare they were not likely to leave any loose ends just because they promised they would to wills right he could hear watkins fumbling for something in his jacket pocket a moment later he dialed a cell phone with a single touch the checkin call they were fifteen minutes out not twenty mr gold wat here just reporting in no problems so far hes doing just fine sir just fine but he doesnt like being on the floor okay mr gold ill tell him ill speak to you in fifteen minutes we should be in roxbury before too much longer yes sir whatever you say is the way its going to be he returned the phone to his pocket mr gold says for you to get used to it down there isnt he just a sweetie shut up what did he say to you watkins whats the way its going to be mean shut up or i swear im gonna do some work on those fingers i bandaged them and i can just as easily unbandage them youre a real prize will sank down on the seat mulling over what gold might have said the possibilities he came up with were unsettling several of the electrical burns on his body had been itching mercilessly he asked for permission to scratch and got the predictable response they were making the frequent turns and stops of city driving now watkins had made his second checkin call this one much briefer than the first then drove on in silence for maybe ten minutes more almost there okay watkins said slowing down were near where you met lionel you can untie that pillowcase and take it off theres a bow in the twine right under your chin bless you now slowly push yourself up onto the seat and turn around what about these handcuffs just keep your hands in your lap how will i fasten my seat belt will waited in vain for watkins to respond to the humor okay he said once he was upright and had worked the stiffness from his shoulders and a painful cramp from his hip thats where i stopped lionel to ask directions right over there but i think its too early for his evening walk mr gold wants us to check in some stores he says if this lionel is the way you described him someone will know who he is smart man youre going to come with me but youre going to keep your mouth shut unless i ask you to speak try anything and mr gold has instructed me to shoot you and whoever were talking to you know ill do that right right chief wiseass half a block down watkins found space by a meter and skillfully maneuvered the boatlike lincoln into the spot then he lumbered around to wills door undid the manacle on wills left wrist and clicked it onto his own what direction was this man coming from when you stopped him for directions he asked from there will pointed across the street at a row of modest stores the late afternoon was gray and breezy but not all that cold still there was little foot traffic along the block watkins nodded toward a florists on the cornerbethanys flowers the woman behind the counter of the fragrant shop was in her late thirties with a neat figure blackframed spectacles and pleasant eyes she glanced minutely at the handcuffs joining the two men then back to their faces clearly unsure as to which of them was the alpha male will expected she would be both surprised and pleased to realize that for once in such situations it was the black one my name is joe dunn watkins said flipping open his billfold to reveal a bogus id im a private investigator and parttime bounty hunter this man is my prisoner carol pleased to meet you the woman said without fear her expression now one of respect before i take him in and waste everyones time i need help in identifying for certain that hes the one ive been after people have told me that an older man named lionel can do that and that he lives around here theres a hundreddollar bill in it for anyone who can point me to him lionels his first name she asked carefully avoiding any eye contact with will yes maam i dont know his last heres the hundred watkins slid the bill out just far enough for carol to confirm the denomination still she shook her head i guess he doesnt buy flowers she said well thank you very much anyway the huge killer said as civil and composed as a diplomat it seemed to will that some connection had formed between watkins and the slender florist wait she called out as they approached the door let me call my mother shes bethany this used to be her shop she knows almost everyone in this neighborhood she took the phone out from under the counter and dialed youre doing fine watkins whispered harshly just keep it that way you know youre really quite charming when you set your mind to it will replied winking at watkins conspiratorially i think she digs you shut up i told you my mother would know carol called out from behind the counter she thinks the man you want is lionel henderson hes a widower very dapper dresser mother says goes to her church but not too often that sounds like him watkins said find out if she knows where he lives carol asked her mother then hung up and searched through a low twodrawer file cabinet mother says hes bought flowers here if he has she probably has him on file she kept incredibly accurate records for promotions or christmas cards or whatever im not doing nearly as well at that as shewait here he is lionel henderson twothirteen spruce street apartment six just down the street that way she wrote down the name and address and handed it to watkins will read the attraction in her face but still had trouble understanding it perhaps nearing forty she had pared down her requirements perhaps his knowing that the behemoth killed people for a living had something to do with his underappreciating the mans desirability here you go watkins said taking the card and handing over the ben franklin dont you want to wait and see if its the right man before paying me if its not him you can still keep the money for being so helpful thats my card the number of the shop is on the other side oh enough already will twisted his wrist to stop the manacle from chafing and his captor shot him a sideward warning glance perhaps well see each other again watkins said continuing the dance that would be very nice the florist and the thug will thought savagely as they headed out to the street the walrus and the carpenter may no longer be the most bizarre pairing ever they paused long enough for another checkin call to gold and then headed down spruce number was a deteriorating fourstory brick tenement absolutely nondescript except for three cement gargoyles jutting out from just below the roof in the gloom of approaching dusk it was impossible to appreciate the detail of the sculptures but from what will could tell they were as unique as they were incongruous he wondered briefly about the building in its earlier days proudly displaying its unusual art then he pictured himself in his earlier days poised beside the operating table ready to lead a team of technicians nurses and physicians into battle the foyer of the building was surprisingly clean with mailboxes that were locked and a row of a dozen or so bells identified by black plastic labels the inside oak door was also secure l henderson watkins said here it is apartment six just like the nice lady said he undid the handcuffs dont do or say anything stupid just follow my lead i dont want to have to kill you but if i do have to shoot it will be to your spine first then your knee then your balls got that he reached into his jacket pocket assuring himself it seemed that his gun was positioned just the way he wanted it to be watkins just remember will said your boss promised you wouldnt hurt this guy hes an old man and he doesnt have any idea what this is all about he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time yeah sure watkins mumbled pressing the bell dont be home lionel will screamed silently dont be home he knew it made little difference sooner or later the dapper little man would return and watkins would be waiting still gold wanted the xrays asap and that was more than enough to root for any delay watkins pressed the bell again nothing i guess well just have to there were sounds from inside the door and moments later lionel opened it his gaze was drawn first to the huge black man but quickly he fixed on will recognition took only a second well if it isnt the mystery man will my name is will you all right you dont look so good im fine lionel i never thought youd get away from those cobras ill bet they tried some sort of double cross right exactly thats just like them well at first i didnt know how youd find me then i remembered telling you my name aint too many lionels around here my names dunn the killer cut in joe dunn you have a reward comin to you for keeping that envelope safe he smiled his most disarming buddha smile you do have it right oh i have it all right well then may we please come up and do some business lionel looked from one of them to the other then erroneously decided they were no threat he led them up a flight and into a little apartment that was as fastidiously kept as the man himself the living rooman overstuffed sofa and easy chair set in front of an ancient console tvwas decorated mostly with framed photographs of various permutations of a large family the dapper groom in the handsome wedding photo gracing the top of the tv was clearly lionel his arm around the waist of a lovely young woman who exuded charm and dignity to one end of the living room was a closed door that almost certainly led to the bedroom to the right was a neat surprisingly large eatin kitchen why dont we go into the kitchen lionel said i can make you both some tea if you like that would be f wed really love to stay for tea mr henderson watkins cut in but we have a doctor waiting to see those xrays is that whats in that envelope xrays i thought about bringing it to the police but they havent been much help to folks from this neighborhood and the cobras have a way of finding things out so i decided that please sir watkins pleaded the envelope will wondered why watkins wasnt speeding things up by flashing the reward money the way he had in the florists shop the only explanation he could come up with was disturbingvery disturbing the big man needed to play the reward card to get through the door but now that they were inside there was no longer any need the moment they had the envelope the moment watkins was sure the films were there lionel was a dead manand quite possibly will was too it was at that moment will noticed the knife resting on the countera large carving knife it appeared although it was mostly obscured behind a plump tomato a head of lettuce and an as yet empty salad bowl there was no sign that watkins had seen it will felt his pulse accelerate as he forced his eyes away from the weapon and moved a nonchalant six inches to his right cutting down watkinss angle of sight like i told you mr dunn ive got it lionel was saying he turned to will you sure this is okay you really dont look so good no no im fine really i am ol joe here is my friend the reason i dont look so good is that ive had like the flu i havent been sleeping too well lately oh okay well you two just wait here he headed over and opened the bedroom door youre doin fine watkins whispered to will just fine watkins dont you hurt him this time the giant didnt even bother to respond will risked a glance at the counter gauging the best approach to the knife if he even got the chance it would be only fleeting he was going to have to take it and move decisively there was little doubt that both his and lionels lives were at stake here you go lionel sang cheerfully i hid it under my mattress in case the cobras came callin you did good will said then he added stalling as he tried to create even a momentary advantage joe my friend its not that i dont trust lionel but you never know one thing i do know is how angry our pal mr gold can get when things arent exactly the way he wants them i think youd be making a big mistake if you didnt let me examine the contents of that envelope to ensure that everything thats supposed to be inside is there hey wait a minute lionel said you can trust me i never even looked to see what was inside that envelope its not just you lionel the cobras could have messed with it too i know exactly what should be in there clearly nonplussed watkins hesitated then decided that of his two choices more trouble could result for him by not checking inside the envelope and bringing gold a sheaf of cardboard he gave will a good look at the way his hand was thrust into his jacket pocket quickly he growled we dont have much time his pulse hammering will settled onto a chair and slid the thick stack of films out onto the table it looked as if all of them were mammograms at least one man had died because of them and both he and lionel henderson were on the brink why he was about to spread the xrays out when he saw the corner of a white envelope protruding from the stack he covered it with one hand and in almost the same motion grasped half of the films with his other allowing them to slip through his fingers and onto the floor between lionel and watkins clumsy bastard watkins exclaimed now listen here lionel said cussing is not allowed in my home he glared at watkins then dropped to his knees and began gathering up the glossy xrays they had scattered over quite an area and were awkward for him to handle watkins reflexively bent over and grabbed a few before sitting up and warily turning his attention back to will but during those precious seconds when the killers attention was diverted will pulled the businesssize envelope out folded it in half with one hand and stuffed it into his pants pocket come on watkins growled sorry sorry joe thanks lionel no problem no problem eightyone and i can still get down and do my own floors but i cant believe you suspected i might have messed with the stuff in that envelope i never even looked to see what was in there sorry will said dammit grant lets go are they all there or not there was a small wall lamp tacked up just to wills left once the shade was removed the light though not great for a detailed reading of the mammograms was adequate will quickly arranged the films in stacks by patient there were ten different patient names altogether grace davis was one of them even though the cancer was there in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast the absence of a bb assured him the film wasnt hers the next two sets also showed cancers one in the right upper outer quadrant and the other a rather large mass just lateral to the right nipple with bright white flecks of calcium throughoutoften an ominous sign the fourth stack of films held the key the name on those xrays was different from the patient of stack three but the cancer was identical will was absolutely certain of it same location same size same pattern of calcium deposition in fact even the pattern of the blood vessels and other markers in the rest of both breasts were the same watkins shifted edgily and jerked his head in a demand that will hurry up stack five was identical to graces films in all although the mammograms were labeled with ten different patients names dates and clinic numbers there were actually five identical pairs of films will suspected that the variation in the films coincided with the size and shape of the patients breasts he also began suspecting something elsethat none of the xrays actually belonged to the women whose names were on them if he was right about those two possibilities a third one sickening almost beyond imagination seemed quite likely as well none of these women all of whom were probably treated for cancer at the excelsius clinic actually had the disease will slumped back in his chair trying to get his mind around what he was seeing one thing seemed certain as with everything involving the excelsius hmo at the root of the films and the deception one way or another was money watkins stood thats it he said are there any problems or are these all the xrays no no problems will replied so lionel said theres a reward in it for me is there watkins turned toward the little man and in what seemed like slow motion will could see what was about to happen there would be no gunshot no telltale bullet hole in lionels body no suspicion of foul play no police questioning neighbors and others such as carol in the flower shop watkins was going to do this with his hands in the end there would only be a frail old man dead at the bottom of the stairs his neck broken by the tragic fall watkins had reached the bewildered lionel and was raising his huge hands toward the mans neck when will moved with one step he was at the counter grasping the carving knife before watkins could effectively react to the movement behind him will leapt at him locking his palm under watkinss chin on his tiptoes powered by a massive adrenaline rush will yanked back with all his strength and pressed the blade of the knife firmly against the giants exposed throat move and ill kill you he snapped tightening his grip even as he felt the enormous power of the man he was trying to hold in place i know exactly how to do this watkins believe me i do one slice thats all its a terrible way to die he added some pressure for emphasis and felt the killer wince as the blade broke skin what in the heck are you doing lionel cried watkinss body stiffened for an eternal few seconds will could sense him sorting out the odds then the tension in his body lessened youre crazy he said the gun ease it out of your pocket and drop it on the floor muttering threats and obscenities watkins did as he was ordered youre signing your girlfriends death warrant he said lionel get out of here now will ordered dont tell anyone dont go to the police just get out of here get off the street and dont come back for two hours watkins give him your wallet now lionel take all the money in it youve earned it now get out quickly the little man hesitated then took the stack of bills from watkinss wallet grabbed a jacket from the back of a chair and hurried out of the apartment watkins slowly dramatically lifted his hand and checked his watch you really fucked up asshole he said careful not to move any further against the knife im five minutes late your little honeys probably dead already call gold will said no way will tightened his grip across watkinss chin but this time the killer didnt react at all i said call in drop the knife at that instant watkinss cell phone began ringing answer it watkins laughed derisively another ring five rings and the recording starts he managed three will stepped back and threw the carving knife to the floor grinning watkins flipped on his phone sorry mr gold we were getting the envelope and i lost track of the time no hes right here he had a little accident and banged his face but hell be all right yessir ill bring him well be back soon no problem hes been acting up some but i know hell behave from now on watkins flipped the phone shut and dropped it in his pocket then without warning he swung from his hip smashing will flush in the face will heard his cheekbone snap an instant before the pain exploded from it he was sputtering on a gush of blood down his nose and throat before he hit the floor chapter discipline discipline dont move not a flicker not a twitch breathe in hold it hold it breathe out hark the herald angels sing glory to the newborn king discipline discipline for most of a year during college patty and one of her roommates had taken yoga classes together they had both dropped out partly because of the pressures of class work but also because each had met a man what in the hell was his name she wondered now he was supposed to have been the one now she couldnt even remember his name why hadnt she stayed with yoga breathe in hold it hold it breathe out slowly slowly dont move dont move at least an hour had passed since will was sent off with the man named watkinsprobably closer to two boyd halliday and marshall gold had departed just a few minutes after that for an important session with their lawyer and hadnt returned before they left they had said enough for her to know that tomorrow at ten there was a meeting scheduled at which the excelsius takeover of several companies would be completed the new conglomerate still to be called excelsius health with halliday as ceo would instantly be among the largest healthcare providers in the east if not in the country power and money the managedcare killings believed by almost everyone to be about revenge and retribution had never been about anything except power and money now unless she or will could do something the body count of those sacrificed on that altar was about to rise patty had begun experiencing momentary glimmers of consciousness for a while before she was taken from the icu but it wasnt until she was being transferred from her bed to the stretcher that she had started to come around on all levels by the time she was secured inside the ambulance the conversations around her were increasingly penetrating the darkness that had enveloped her mind in snatches she heard about her brain surgery and her persistent coma some sort of a diversionmaybe a firehad been set off in the hospital solely for the purpose of getting her out of there she had no idea where she was being taken or why but what she did hear told her that the best she could do was to remain stillabsolutely still as the ambulance ride wore on beneath the patches that covered her eyes she opened and closed her lids then carefully concealed by the sheet that was draped over her she tested her arms and legs from what she could tell everything was working but she also knew of the phantom pains of amputees and the phantom movements of paralyzed limbs in stroke and spinalcord victims breathe in hold it hold it breathe out since will and the others had gone she had been alone with the torturer krausethe man gold had referred to as the good doctor he was seated toward the door maybe ten or fifteen feet from where she lay several times he had come over and stood beside her breathing heavily and she sensed touching himself first it was just a few seconds at a time then a minute then even more good she thought stoking her anger the more you get turned on the better creep as the visits to her stretcher became longer they also became more frequent it was as if krause was battling his own instinctsand losing each time patty tried through the mans breathing and the sound of his movement to create a mental picture of him and to focus in on his position and posture she felt certain from his footfall and at what height she placed his mouth that he was slightly built and not very tall finally perhaps unable to control himself any longer the good doctor pulled her sheet down below her breasts and stood by her shoulder staring down at her she was wearing some sort of hospital pajamas or perhaps a set of surgical scrubs but still she felt naked exposed and vulnerable how beautiful you are how beautiful his breath reeked of cigarettes and garlic his voice was raspy and rather highpitched she honed in on the image of a very thin wiry man maybe fivesix or seven and for no objective reason whatsoever decided that he fancied himself an intellectual and a poet krause replaced the sheet and patty silently sighed relief he had stopped short of uncovering her hands and the loose iv tubing that rested beneath them the clear plastic tube was the only accessible weapon she had but applied quickly and with the proper leverage she felt it might be enough the green polystyrene oxygen tubing was a bit thicker with perhaps less give but it would be impossible to get at without lifting her arms and risking the loss of the small advantage surprise was going to give her strangulation from the front and back was a maneuver they had studied at the academy mostly so that they could learn how to defend themselves against it she had never paid that much attention to technique when she was the attacker now she wished she had it frightened her that any move she made would have to be done with the patches covering her eyes but she sensed right or wrong that this unpleasant little man was physically weaker than gold or watkins or even halliday if she was going to defeat any one of them he was the best bet and if he gave her the chance she was going to take it she had barely completed the thought when he was back again the sheet went down this time after muttering how beautiful she was he bent down and kissed her lightly on the lips at the same time setting his hand on her breast it was all she could do to keep from cringing instead her resolve grew krause was testing now perhaps seeing how much he could get away with without waking her up perhaps fearful of being caught by gold or halliday should he linger too long however excitement and his perverse nature clearly had a grip on him not knowing whether he was watching her or not patty had not yet dared to move enough to wrap the iv tubing around her hands if she tried and he was looking at her it was all over still she felt she was running out of time she had to sense the opportunity and make her move youre so beautiful he was whispering again increasing the pressure on her breast just so beautiful his vocabulary was woefully limited patty noted distracting herself from being touched by him if he was a poet he was a very bad one finally after what seemed an eternity krause lifted his hand from her breast and again drew the sheet up she listened to his heavy breathing and envisioned him standing there a hand down his pants fondling himself then she heard the scuffing of his shoes as he turned away from her to return to his chair for a few precious seconds his back would be to her he was too stimulated to keep away for long when he returned she had to be ready it had to be now keeping her movements minimal she located the iv tubing gripped it and using quick minute circles wound it around each hand the polystyrene garrote she had created nearly two feet long rested across the tops of her thighs now she had to pray that krauses lecherous ambitions remained above her waist across the room from near the door she could hear him breathing clearing his throat and shifting in his chair she tried envisioning his movements as she rehearsed her own in her mind many times since joining the force she had asked herself whether she was capable of shooting to kill in order to protect herself or others always the answer had been yes but in the scenarios she created firing her weapon to kill had always been reflex and instinctive this time the kill would be premeditated deliberate and at close range and once she was committed there could be no hesitation no turning back she tested the strength in her arms by pressing them tightly against her sides while clenching and unclenching her fists then she continued her deep breathing allowing images of golds victims and their families to flow through her thoughts and keep her still several minutes passed krauses breathing seemed more rapid now was he masturbating he began humming to himselfa bizarre tuneless incantation that patty found quite chilling come on come on finally he stood up and returned to her oh baby you are so beautiful he whispered so beautiful and all mine he lowered the sheet to her waist and pulled her top up above her breasts she sensed him devouring her with his eyes then she felt the heat of his breath as once again he bent down and set his lips on hers in seconds he would put his hand on her breasts again getting the tubing past his arm and around his neck would be much more difficult it had to be nowright now she drew her hands up clear of the sheet then just as krause was reacting to the maneuver she swept the tubing around his neck and pulled his face down against her breastbone tightening the loop with all her strength as she had envisioned holding him tightly against her reduced what he could do with his arms he flailed at her face but was unable to land a blow with any real force behind it the patches were torn from her eyes sending a painful blast of light through her widely dilated pupils one random swing hit directly on the incision and bone flap on the side of her skull she cried out but intensified her grip even more the tubing felt as if it was going to tear through her palms but she battled the pain and pulled even harder it strengthened her to realize krause hadnt uttered a sound his airway was completely occluded as were his carotid arteries harder harder dont let up no matter what dont let up the blinding light was rapidly giving way to movement and color she could see his jetblack hair then one blurry ear then her own hand blanched and bloodless with the effort of killing him krause struggled to straighten up but instead lurched to one side and fell onto his back on the floor patty was pulled off the stretcher and landed heavily on top of him the tension in her grip held instantly what little leverage he had vanished his arms went limp and flopped to the wooden floor patty was looking directly into the torturers bulging bloodshot eyes when he died she heard then smelled then felt his bladder and bowels give way the tension in his body ceased his jaw went slack and a trickle of blood emerged from the corner of his mouth still she maintained her grip on the tubing holding fast until she could no longer bear the throbbing in her hands and arms ignoring as best she could the shell bursts going off in her skull and the stench of violent death she rolled off krauses corpse and lay on the floor nearby gasping for air finally she propped herself up unsteadily on one elbow and took her first careful look at the man she had just killed if she was feeling any remorse at that moment any at all she certainly couldnt identify it as such krause had a narrow rodentlike face with burnedout acne and irregular cigarettestained teeth his bloodred eyes still bulged almost out of their sockets beautiful patty muttered just beautiful with difficulty she grasped the frame of the stretcher and hauled herself upright her legs held her there but not without some conscious effort across the room was the chair from which krause had so vigilantly guarded herhighbacked with a caned seat and no arms there was a copy of penthouse on the floor beside it along with a glass halffilled with what looked like coke draped across the back of the chair was a black sports coat and hanging over the coat nearly invisible in its black shoulder holster was a gun suddenly energized she hurried over it was a colt specialreliable but with a bit less stopping power than she would have liked still in her hand and at close quarters it was certainly enough expertly patty flipped the cylinder open and assured herself that the six chambers were full then hefting the revolver in her hand she managed a thin bitter smile the odds on their making it out of this mess had just shortened considerably patty checked the windows and satisfied herself that without tools there was no way out of the room except the door through the dense overcast the gray afternoon light was fading fourthirty she guessed maybe five boyd halliday would probably be gone by now hurrying home to join his wife at the dinner party they were throwing for their new business associates she had heard stories of managedcare ceos with villas in majorca and stables of rare antique cars what sort of place did halliday live in she wondered would any amount of money any amount of power ever be enough for him she scanned the buildings and grounds outside trying without success to get some sense of where the farm might be located with will unaccounted for and no definite idea of the firepower beyond the door she decided that her best chance was to stay in the room and wait the odor emanating from the body on the floor was testing that decision but she knew that she held the advantage so long as the first person to arrive could be induced to move through the doorway and into the roomespecially if that person was marshall gold the aromatic dr krause was quite literally dead weight she gave thought to somehow pulling him up onto the stretcher covering him with a sheet and then flattening herself against the wall behind the door quickly though she passed on the notion of hauling him up that far as a physical impossibility instead staying tensed for the slightest noise outside the door she rolled the body on its side and left it where it was next she brought the chair over and laid it on its side adjusting krause into a sitting position against it using the oxygen iv and catheter drainage tubing and krauses belt she lashed the body to the chair surprised and utterly grateful that the chair legs didnt shatter she hoisted her creation upright with surprising ease and dragged it to a spot about ten feet in from the door facing the stretcher with the good doctors sports jacket draped over the back of the chair the illusion was nearly complete and quite good if she did say so it became even better when she added the finishing touch of the small table that stood near the ratty mattress she assumed was wills bed setting krauses arm at a jaunty angle on the top she wrapped his fingers around the halffinished glass of coke the position also helped brace the body against toppling over prematurely voila she whispered proudly cest si bon the lure calculated to draw her first visitor at least several steps into the room was in place there was little she could do with the stretcher other than to put the thin pillow under the sheet but by the time anyone got that far hopefully she would be in charge the door to the room opened inward patty checked krause one last time then positioned herself against the wall so that it would swing toward then past her the extra half second might make a difference now there was nothing to do but wait inside her head there seemed to be a serious synergy between her concussion and the massive pounding of her heart created by her battle with krause she was feeling vague and sluggish one moment sharp and focused the next images of her father and of will of lieutenant court and brasco of marshall golds victims and their families flowed through her mind as she crouched on one knee and waited it was going to be over soon she told each of themvery soon finally she heard footsteps outside the door an instant later it swung open and marshall gold strode into the room so doc he said cheerfully hows our prize patient he reached krauses side and actually touched the corpse on the shoulder before realizing that the stretcher was empty at the same moment the body and chair toppled over taking the table and coke with them the glass shattered on the floor welcome back mr gold patty said standing and kicking the door shut keep your hands where i can see them patty was totally unprepared for golds reaction without a moments hesitation and with a furious bellow he charged her teeth bared he covered half the distance between them with a single step and launched himself arms outstretched at her head his hands slammed ferociously against her shoulders driving her backward and off her feet she was in midair almost parallel to the floor when she heard a shot she landed heavily on her back air exploding from her lungs her head snapped against the polished wood with stunning force sending an explosion of white light through her brain she lay there dazed unable even to lift her arm to fire helpless to keep gold from finishing the attack then she realized he was screaming you bitch you fucking bitch goddammit oh shit my leg you bitch you bitch desperately he grabbed her ankle but patty kicked at him and pulled free easily his face twisted with rage was ashen he was clutching at a spot just above his right knee blood was seeping between his fingers bone patty thought the shot had to have shattered his femur she pushed herself out of his reach and lay there propped on one elbow breathing heavily next time im going to aim she said it was a while before the dizziness and the pounding in pattys head allowed her to move during that time she twice thought she saw golds hand drift toward his left ankle her eyes riveted on him her revolver aimed at his midchest she crawled around to his feet and felt up inside his pant legs even though she tried to be gentle on the right he cried out with even the slightest movement his gun a slendermm glock was strapped just below his calf on the left she removed the bullets from the colt then sent them and the revolver skidding across the floor to the far end of the room now with the glock she had some serious firepower warily she patted gold down even though there was precious little else he could have hidden beneath his turtleneck and formfitting slacks he seemed to have regained some composure although the pallor around his mouth said that he was in some degree of early shock who else is in the house she demanded go fuck yourself those are really nice shoes how about i just tap that right one on the sole why not you asshole cops are no better than krause there anyhow go ahead do it bitch jarred by golds words patty stood up and stepped back glaring down at the man who had brought so much terrible pain to so many not tonight she said softly she moved cautiously to the door and listened if anyone else had been in the house surely they would have reacted to the gunshot all she had to do now was find a phone and call was there danger in leaving gold here unguarded it would take a hell of an actor to fake the signs of early shock but if he were acting and the bullet hadnt shattered his femur there was plenty of danger at that moment from somewhere nearby a door opened and closed moments later a man called out golds name mr gold mr gold were back i have the package ill bring our friend into the blue room watkins patty pushed the door closed and again flattened herself against the wall one word gold she whispered fiercely one sound and ill put a bullet into your face i swear i will fuck you gold moaned but there was little force behind the words the door opened and will his wrists handcuffed and a bloodsoaked pillowcase over his head was shoved rudely onto the floor get in there jerk watkins said stepping in after him his boot drawn back poised to land a kick patty came at him from behind and jammed the glock against the base of watkinss skull police down on your knees she snapped put your hands on your head or ill blow it off now i mean it dammit in slow motion the giant complied will pulled the pillowcase off his face was a bloody mask his left eye swollen shut blood was still oozing from his misshapen nose hes got a gun in his right jacket pocket he said thickly the keys to these are in his pants pocket keeping the revolver in contact with watkinss skull patty pulled his jacket off and threw it aside then she forced him onto his belly had him retrieve the key and helped will remove the manacles hands behind your back will can you put those on him i can do anything you want he said looking from krause to gold and back bad things happen to people who dont he snapped the handcuffs onto watkins i think ill swallow this key and bring you a weeks worth of my dung so you can look for it he dropped it into his pocket do you need help right away patty asked my cheekbone is broken and im a little dizzy and i cant see so good out of this eye but im not in any immediate trouble patty i cant believe you pulled this off i dont think ive told you yet but i have quite a nasty temper i dont think ill have much trouble remembering that find a phone and call nineoneone take watkinss gun just in case make sure the safetys off and dont shoot yourself by mistake will retrieved the pistol had her check that he had released the safety and headed off patty surveyed the human wreckage around herone handcuffed one disabled one dead what would tommy moriarity say if he could see her now probably that she had violated some protocol or procedure and had just lucked out she smiled at least therell be photos of the scene from the crimelab people maybe she could have one matted and framed for fathers day she was still smiling a few minutes later when will returned he stopped in the doorway staring at her strangely not moving or speaking will are you okay she asked did you make the call will stepped into the room followed immediately by his partner susan hollister her hair still wet from the shower the powerful automatic weapon held expertly in her right hand was aimed directly at pattys heart chapter sit down you stupid bitch right there now or i swear ill just blow you apart did she do this honey did she do this to you god but this room stinks krause is that smell from krause not even in the most critical surgical situations had will ever seen anything approaching such fire in his partner there was a pressure to her speech and a detached chilling wildness in her eyes that left no doubt she would carry out any threat instantly and without remorse she knelt next to marshall gold stroking his face and hair with her left hand while keeping her submachine gun leveled at patty with the other gold had quieted down considerably but will wondered if his demeanor might be a reflection of persistent even worsening shock he suspected susan sensed the same thing will get over here and tear off his pants leg she ordered hurry or ill cut your girlfriend in half she punctuated the order with a burst of bullets that splintered the floor between pattys legs one actually grazed her blood instantly began seeping through a rent in her pajamas just below the knee will started moving to help her but she stopped him with a raised hand im okay will she said her voice meek and whiny just do whatever she says will remembered the fearlessness with which patty had dealt with the two toughs by steeles pond and could only imagine how in her condition she had managed to take out both krause and gold sounding fearful and subdued at this moment was purposeful he was certain of it patty knew as did he that there was no chance either of them would be allowed to live in truth there never had been she was sizing up both susan and the situation searching for an openingany kind of an openingthat would give them a chance at the gun the best he could do to help was to keep susan as calm as possible and make himself essential by helping to stabilize gold when the moment was right he would try to heighten the tension and create chaos in the room at that point he and patty would have only seconds for some sort of coordinated unscripted attack before one or both of them were dead he inserted two undamaged fingers into the bullet hole in golds trousers and with difficulty ripped the leg off gold still awake though definitely slowed moaned in pain at even the slightest movement careful will susan warned you and i both know youre not that clumsy thats when my fractured cheekbone isnt throbbing and i have all my fingernails will showed her the bandages golds leg looked badvery bad there was a massive amount of swelling in the thigh beneath the wounda unit of blood will guessed possibly even two almost certainly the femur had been shattered and the femoral artery had probably been severed as well use his belt put a tourniquet on rather than jostle him any more than necessary ill use mine so it was you and gold all the time and here i thought you were just a mildmannered surgeon susan laughed compared to the life ive led surgery has been a big yawn over the last six years this man has taught me things and taken me places surgery never could youre the one who sabotaged my shoes i had to otherwise you would have operated on that davis woman and we just couldnt have that because i would have discovered that she didnt have any breast cancer at all i get it now we had a bit of a problem because we had developed you so carefully as our public spokesman but something had to be done quickly to get you out of the or killing you would have been so messy and so final and would have started people wondering if they were wrong about you and the society and the managedcare killer all being on the same side so after you crucified me and took the davis case back you threatened jim katz to try and get me reinstated at work as long as the attention was diverted from excelsius you were serving your purpose your pal the law doctor actually helped us out by planting those shoes in that er closet he planted them of course what kind of a dummy do you take me for i would never have just left your chuck taylors lying around the hospital the lawyer made a calculated guess about how we got the fentanyl into you and he guessed right im sure the insoles of those shoes will turn out to be loaded with fentanyl its not that hard to get will couldnt help but smile augie realized that the only one who could prove he had hidden a pair of counterfeit fentanylsoaked sneakers in the er was the person who had actually framed will the man had rolled the dice for him with both his law and medicine careers at stake and he had won so how many women got treated for breast cancer they didnt have enough to force steadfast health into selling out to us they were paying over a hundred thousand a case with more and more women getting breast cancer these days it wasnt hard besides we had a one hundred percent cure rate but halliday couldnt do that with every other company he wanted to take over no it was a brilliant idea that worked but we needed to develop a more direct method jesus listen susan this belt isnt tightening enough hes still bleeding i suspect his femoral arterys torn if so this legs in trouble hes in trouble i think we should use that iv tubing tied around krause over there and maybe break off the leg of the chair to twist it tight rope would be even better hes really getting shocky youve got to get him to the hospital watkins get up and help us susan ordered my medical bag is in the trunk of my car get the bag and also some rope and i need something like a tire iron to tighten the tourniquet look at me dr hollister im handcuffed hes got the key in his pocket will unlock his cuffs now susan swung her machine gun toward him and will saw patty instantly change her stance so that one leg was beneath her now ready to shove off it was time to raise the ante without thinking twice about it he pulled the key from his pocket and swallowed it i told him i was going to do that will said lightly hoping to lessen susans anger and the tension in her index finger god damn you she shrieked her cheeks crimson from the corner of his eye will saw patty shift again dont worry dr hollister watkins said ive got another key in my room in the drawer right by the bed i can get it the giant began struggling awkwardly to his feet lost his balance and tumbled heavily onto his side another distraction it had to be now as watkins was righting himself will kneed golds thigh at exactly the fracture point the killer bellowed with pain and took an ineffectual floppy swing at will reflexively susan turned toward them in that instant patty sprang forward viciously swinging her bare foot upward in a punting motion against susans wrist the machine gun flew out of susans hands and landed at the base of the wall a dozen feet away will who was on one knee was trying to stand when watkins slammed into him like a semi driving him back against the wall powered by adrenaline will hammered at the man with his fists and feet and managed to pull himself upright patty followed her kick by trying to dive over susan toward the gun but the surgeon moved with the quickness of a gymnast striking her with a backhand fist flush against her skull flap while in the same motion spinning and lunging toward her weapon patty cried out from the blow and dropped to her side dazed she remained composed enough to grab on to one of susans legs absorbing kicks to her face and chest she hung on for a few precious seconds but there was no way she could beat the woman to where the machine gun lay run will she shouted losing her hold and rolling over and over toward the open door run will grabbed her by the arm as he raced past and dragged her to her feet and through the doorway they were sprinting down a long corridor toward what seemed to be the back of the house when they heard a burst of gunfire from behind them will risked a glance over his shoulder susan had fired wildly from inside the room and hadnt yet reached the hallway straight ahead patty gasped pointing to a windowed doorway that led outside they charged past a richly appointed conference room and a vast gleaming brilliantly lit kitchen neither held any hope of protection or concealment getting outside was their only chance will dropped back a step to allow patty to reach the door first if only one of them was going to make it he wanted it to be her please dont be locked please patty had already considered the possibility with her left hand she slid the deadbolt lock aside and simultaneously pulled open the door with her right the aluminum storm door with a full pane of glass was also locked without hesitation she drove her knee and forearm into the pane shattering it outward onto a small unlit porch stay low she screamed without hesitating she stepped onto the shards of glass with her bare right foot then leapt over three stairs and onto the lawn finishing with a perfectly executed roll it was an incredibly athletic move and not one will had any chance of duplicating instead he pulled the inside door nearly closed behind him and was carefully stepping through the stormdoor frame when a staccato of bullets snapped into the wood one of them ripped into the muscle overlying his right hip he fought through the intensely burning pain and drove ahead susan had to be wondering whether she could chance leaving her lover to go after them or whether any risk was worth taking to keep them from getting off the farm alive the longer they could keep moving the more they could increase her indecision the less effective she was going to be by the time he reached patty she was braced against a tree pulling a twoinchlong stiletto of glass from the sole of her foot he moved to help but she waved him off then raced with him toward the barn the night was black and raw the grass unpleasantly cold and slick and she was barefoot and battered still she ran it was as if by example she was willing him not to be hesitant or afraid ignoring the searing in his hip he hobbled along beside her until they had rounded the small corral and flattened themselves against the far side of the barn clouds of their breath hung in the chilly blackness as they gasped for air ahead and to the left of them all was dark and quiet but to their right not too far away were the lights of another house what happened to your leg patty asked between breaths will needed several seconds before he could answer my hip well my butt really i took a bullet there for the home team patty squeezed his arm be tough that was amazing what you did back there does your foot hurt badly itll hold me patty inched back to the corner of the barn and peered around it shes out there just beginning to move this way i guess she decided that getting us is more important than staying with marshall that choice is a nobrainer if we get away life as they have known it will be over lets hope so what do you think that house is over there probably belongs to the farmer who actually works this place maybe he doesnt know what his landlord does when hes not looking like a respectable healthcare provider maybe its either go there or head across the fields and try to find a way out of here patty risked a second look around the corner of the barn watkins is with her now no handcuffs weve really got to move youve got to take my sneakers i dont no argument she sighed and did as he insisted muttering about clownshoes moments later she shuddered and then began to shiver intensely will held her and for a few seconds she allowed him to then she pulled away if i had known we were actually going to make it out of that room he said i would never have taken my jacket off hopefully the people in that house over there will help us out your hands are like ice theyre okay my heads the problem its like a kangaroos in there bouncing through a minefield setting off explosions that settles it lets go meet the farmer much of their path to the house was obstructed from their pursuers by the barn over the final twentyfive open yards they kept low and moved steadily ahead until they were flattened against the house in the distance they could still hear faint snatches of susans voice and see the beam of a flashlight piercing the night they turned and were peering through the window into a small cluttered kitchen where a grizzled man in his fifties sat at the table in overalls and a narrowstrap tshirt drinking beer from a bottle and watching a small countertop tv beside him a disheveled silverhaired woman sat in a wheelchair a beer in the cup holder by her right hand american gothic will whispered they look friendly enough i think we should go in i dont know do you have any other ideas weve got to get away from here quickly or get inside and make a nineoneone call i think those two will be able to help us im a great judge of character by peoples faces at that moment they heard the phone start ringing inside shit patty whispered the farmers conversation lasted only a few seconds he hurried out of the kitchen and returned with a shotgun which he held on to as he pulled on a redandblackchecked hunting jacket and a rifle which he handed to his invalid wife i forgot to add that sometimes im a lousy judge of character will said they stayed pressed into the shadows and worked their way to the far end of the house there was a broad expanse of fields perhaps a quarter mile or more between them and the forest weve got to try it will whispered at that moment the farmer shotgun at the ready clunked across the back landing and made his way into the field a short distance from where they were standing the move effectively cut them off from any kind of race to the woods now what will asked they were peering back at the barn expecting any instant to see susan and watkins come around the corral and the other corner cutting them off even further from any escape we have one chance patty said what the tractor did you see it just past the barn if we can somehow get around that side of the barn and onto it we can try and drive it around the house and down the drive what about the key people always leave the key in tractors especially on a place as isolated as this one and if theres no key id be surprised if i couldnt hotwire it of course how stupid of me not to think that you knew how to hotwire a tractor you are really a remarkable piece of work do you know that right now im a freezing cold miserable piece of work lets head back to the barn before susan and monstro show up from there maybe we can make a run at the tractor if they leave the barn unguarded maybe you can even find a pair of boots inside my feet are okay for the moment they moved back along the shadows shielded from the farmer by the house and from susan and watkins by the barn just a dozen or so yards ahead washed faintly in some of the light from the old farmhouse they could make out a splitrail fence enclosing a fairly large corral which featured a water trough and filled hay bin patty put a finger to her lips and motioned in that direction seconds later they were crouching by the fence initially will thought the corral was empty but then he noticed four cows standing huddled together at the far end we should cut through will whispered youre barefoot ive got socks on besides ive stepped in shit before you really are a piece of work maybe its contagious they hunched down and carefully slid between the middle and highest railing into the corral for the moment at least they were hidden from the barn by the shoulderhigh hay bin patty look talk about american gothic propped against the far side of the bin nearly as long as the bin was high was a pitchfork just as will seized the handle they heard susans voice close enough to make out her words she had come around the side of the barn and seemed to be headed directly toward them with the submachine gun pointing their way she was speaking on a cell phone as she moved cautiously forward quick over there patty ordered pointing to the cows keeping low enough to be partially screened by the fence they hurried across to the massive animals and worked their way among them there was some slight irritated movement from the beasts but otherwise no reaction to the intrusion susan had reached the far corner of the corral no more than thirty feet away watkins i dont see anything out here she was saying just cows you watch the front of the barn call sanderson and tell him its his ass if they get past him then call your people and tell them to get the hell out here now those two are still around here someplace im positive of it im going in to check on marsh and get another flashlight ill be right out stay sharp will pressed his face against the cows flank and patted her silently as she shifted nervously from one foot to another easy bossie easy does it come on hollister leave leave he didnt dare to raise up and look to his right patty seemed completely concealed between two cows an endless minute passed is susan still there dammit he never should have told her about newcomber he was so certain gordo was behind everything that he just didnt think things through finally moving with exquisite slowness patty crouched down peered out under the cow to where susan had been and then gave him a thumbsup sign they crossed the corral and slipped out through a gate patty now limping even more noticeably moved close to him and took his arm with one of hers then appropriated the pitchfork to use as a walking stick if we split up she said and you go that way toward the forest and i go that way one of us might make it no go were getting out of here together besides neither one of us is moving very well we look like that painting of the spirit of seventysix only no ones bothered to bandage us up now lets get to the tractor you can really hotwire it she shrugged at him modestly i can try it may be tricky in the dark rather than cross between the main house and the barn they chose to work their way back around the barn and the small empty corral on the other side taking that route they would be in clear easy range of the farmer sanderson should he spot them but they would be concealed from watkins until they were no more than twentyfive yards or so from the tractor and also from susan when she reemerged through the back door no matter what they knew that there was little chance of their making it unseen to the tractor getting it started and avoiding the bullets of two heavily armed professional killers i dont like these odds will said we can do this cautiously more than grateful for the heavy overcast they hobbled along the vast wall of the barn until they had reached the corral to their right past sandersons house they could just make out the silhouette of the farmer as he patrolled the broad grassy field that separated the working farm from the forest to their left well beyond the far corner of the corral facing the entrance to the barn stood the tractor with fivefoot wheels in back threefoot wheels in front and a snout like a submarine it was larger than will had initially appreciatedcertainly large enough to tow serious attachments for threshing or plowing and also he hoped to generate some speed with the two of them on board if they could somehow make it out to a paved road there was at least a chance of piling up some distance before susan or watkins reached their cars and caught up with will keeping an eye on sanderson and patty watching for watkins they reached the end of the corral i know its weird will said but after all thats happened after all ive been through and dealt with all of a sudden im scared stiff thats because all of a sudden we have a chance im thinking that these are not the people i want to have end my life amen to that will whispered slipping his arms around her well i guess weve got to go for it we do she took his face in her hands youre a hell of a guy will grantvery brave and a terrific lover too thats a combination i like their kiss was brief but intensely sweet how long did you say it takes to hotwire a tractor he asked i didnt lets hope we dont have to find out listen though one thingyouve got to drive even in your sneakers i cant step down very well with my right foot if any of them get in our way youre probably better off trying to run them down than avoid them sometimes people dont react well with something coming at them head on got it ill do what i can with this she held up the pitchfork okay doc ready and now there was no sense trying to conceal their movement any longer hand in hand they loped awkwardly across the grass as rapidly as patty could manage just as they reached the tractor the dense night was pierced by a piteous screeching wail coming from the farmhouse susan the key will said its here thank god patty muttered will scrambled up onto the broad seat theres not much protection up here try praying ahead of them watkins had appeared at the doorway of the barn and without looking in their direction started toward the commotion in the house patty balanced herself on the metal step hanging on to the seat with one hand and the pitchfork with the other will turned the key and with a brief cough the powerful engine kicked over thrumming loudly how do i make it go forward he asked suddenly panicked patty anticipating the problem grabbed the shift lever beside the seat and snapped the huge tractor into gear i was the fourh queen in junior high she explained amazing watkins had swung around and was lumbering toward them his gun drawn when the tractor lurched forward duck down patty cried head right at him they were gaining speed when watkins began firing bullets clanged off the grill and one splintered the top of the steering wheel will was crouched awkwardly on one knee peering along the side of the engine casing reaching overhead to steer by one hand wondering how long he could survive a bullet between the eyes to his right patty was now hanging off to the side of the tractor by one arm completely exposed to the gunfire the pitchfork extended forward like a lance thats it she hollered right at him will then keep him on my side for several frozen seconds the massive killer looked confused then with the tractor bearing down on him he took several clumsy steps to his left stumbled and fell to one knee although he still had a grip on his pistol he never got the chance to fire it again as the tractor rolled past him patty drove the pitchfork straight through the softness beneath his chin and then upward almost to the hilt in his brain his death was instantaneous stop will she yelled will slammed down on the brake clambering off the tractor patty retrieved the pitchfork grabbed watkinss gun and was quickly back on the step as will again accelerated i think that way he said pointing youre in charge boy am i glad that isnt true will swung the tractor to the right in a wide arc that would take them around to the front of the house at that instant susan appeared on the back porch brandishing the submachine gun and screeching at them hysterically you killed him you bastards you killed my marsh she rattled off a burst then raced down the stairs but the tractor was moving away to her left and it seemed as if none of the shots had hit firing like a commando as she ran susan took a line that would cut them off before they made the far side of the house what should we do will called out over the wailing engine just hold us steady patty answered real steady she gripped the seat with her left hand and lay her right arm down across her left sighting down the barrel of the pistol payback time she murmured as she cracked off a single shot through the gloom thirty yards away susan cried out and fell clutching her thigh and cursing she was up with incredible quickness though hobbling after them almost dragging her leg but what chance she had to cut them off was gone will swung the tractor to the left alongside the house that was an unbelievable shot it was a terrible shot i was aiming at her chest take me past those cars if she gets ahold of the keys to any of those shell catch us in no time will stopped beside watkinss lincoln patty limped over to it and drove the pitchfork through the tire why dont you just shoot it will called down i may need whats in here it took two tries but she stabbed through the left rear tire of susans nifty porsche then she climbed back onto the step over there the jaguar she cried they were still twenty feet away from the car when susan appeared at the corner of the house she was bathed eerily in the light from the windows her lips pulled back in a snarling wolflike rictus as she fired go patty cried she fired once at susan and once at the jaguars tire missing both times the third shot produced only an impotent click with the cracks from susans gun growing fainter will steered the tractor around two huge oaks and back onto the gravel driveway one of the only things he remembered from the drive to roxbury with watkins was the right turn he took at the base of the drive even boyd halliday might have difficulty explaining that mess back there will said as he made the right and they rumbled off down a narrow deserted country road he was feeling absolutely buoyant you have this thing wide open patty asked grimly full speed ahead why i dont think we can chance being on this much longer dammit i should have taken more time for that shot at the jaguars tire nonsense just the same assuming hollister limps inside finds the keys to the jag and limps back out shell be on top of us before you know it then theres the people she told watkins to call they could come driving down this road at any second will rapidly deflated so what should we do id rather take our chances in the dark in the woods than out here on this noble steed you want your sneakers back no way youve earned them besides given where my socks have been i dont think i want to risk even touching them we should get off this thing soon she said one more minute two at the most im out of bullets but i guarantee you that your pretty practice partner has plenty ill get off and move inside the tree line you drive about a hundred more yards then ditch the tractor get into the woods and work your way back here ill go straight in twenty or twentyfive yards thats where well meet without questioning will did as he was told nosing the tractor off into the edge of the woods then gingerly hiking back to where he estimated patty was waiting in just a few minutes he heard her harsh whisper calling him to the right he was holding her tightly concealed in a dense grove of young beech trees when they heard a car skid to a halt by the tractor another minute and it accelerated headlights slicing through the blackness as it sped past them toward the farm once again the woman in the pajamas proves her worth he whispered genuinely impressed as he had been so many times this night you are the master speak and so it shall be well i say we head diagonally away from the tractor and away from the farm theyll be back as soon as they meet up with hollister if we can put some distance between us and that road i think weve got a chance its cold out here but not cold enough to kill us as long as you can walk if we just keep putting one foot in front of the other sooner or later weve got to run into some sort of civilization massachusetts isnt that big your feet okay i can manage how about yours the right one where i stepped on the glass is starting to kill but i can handle it the sneaks are a godsend and they really look good on you too as rapidly as they could manage they pushed deeper and deeper into the forest at one point early on they both heard voices but those quickly died away soon there was only silence intense darkness and the damp chill of night after an hour they sank down at the base of a tree and held each other should we keep going or try to wait until morning will asked i dont mind resting for a bit but i think we should push on halliday has a big meeting in the morning he spoke about it when he thought i was in a coma a number of companies are going to sign themselves into a merger with excelsius the way corporate lawyers operate these sorts of business dealings are much easier to stop before they happen than they are to untangle afterward if we cant stop it halliday may not only get away with murder but hell get away richer than ever i see what you mean we really have no proof of anything we may not even be able to find our way back to the farmhouse i think with a chopper well be able to but id be surprised if hollister and sanderson and the rest didnt have the place cleaned up by then she sighed what what i have a feeling its going to come down to our word against hallidays without those xrays we dont have much in the way of hard evidence i suspect the fake slides have already been taken care of and the pathologist who cooperated with hollister and newcomber dealt with one way or another so at the moment theres nothing tangible to connect excelsius and halliday to the killings or even to the breastcancer scam well come up with something will said that bastard isnt going to get away with what hes done even if he wasnt the one who pulled the trigger come on if youre up for it lets keep going will helped patty to her feet then kissed her softly youre right she said one way or another well get him just the same i hate that we dont have one hard piece of evidence will will are you all right what did i say will was smiling down at her in an iknowsomethingyoudontknow way he had just brushed his hand across his pants pocket and remembered for the first time since roxbury what he had thrust in there he slid his hand into the pocket and slowly withdrew the creased damp sweatstained letter charles newcomber had sent him in the envelope of mammograms he had no doubt that it contained the link between halliday and the cancer scam merry christmas sergeant he said bullock and carruth widely referred to as b ampc had been the brightest star in the boston legal firmament for years ed wittenburg in his twentyfifth year with b ampc was the senior partner in charge of acquisitions and mergers now he looked across the fortiethfloor conference room past the massive floortoceiling windows with their grand view of the harbor islands and silently asked halliday when the show was going to get under way janet daninger was worried she had come over to excelsius health along with halliday and gold after halliday had been wooed away from bowling green textiles to become the new ceo marshall gold had been his executive assistant at bowling green just as he was now it was absolutely out of character for gold to keep his friend waitingespecially for a meeting as significant as this one which represented the pinnacle of boyd hallidays career to this point janet smiled inwardly at the objections from those who initially opposed his appointment as ceo by pointing out that successfully repositioning a textile manufacturer did not necessarily translate into dealing with the highly competitive and volatile managedcare industry how wrong they had proven to be try once more janet halliday said i think weve got to get going its just that marshall did so much to ensure that this day came to pass it seems only fitting that he should be here he turned to the twenty men and women seated a comfortable distance apart from one another around the massive mahogany table in front of each of them was an elegant name plate with their name and the name of the company they would be bringing into the excelsius family premier care unity comprehensive health steadfast health coastal community care in front of each of the attendees was an inch of documents flagged where signatures would be needed beside those documents was a glossy brochure trumpeting the new corporation excelsius national health when enh stock comes out halliday had told janet with a wink i recommend you have those in your family buy a share or two now he fidgeted for another minute until he sensed the increasing restlessness of those in the room then he cleared his throat and stepped to the table over more than a decade together he and marshall gold had functioned as a unit with virtually no philosophical or professional differences marshalls missing a meeting as monumental as this one would be a first youd better have a damn good reason ladies and gentlemen im sorry for the slight delay i was waiting for marshall gold my executive assistant whom i believe most of you know hes tying up some loose ends relative to this meeting and im sure hell be here shortly he took a deep proud breath and so without further ado its time for us to make history by the time we adjourn this meeting each of us will be an important part of one of the largest most influential healthcare delivery companies in the nation indeed in the worldexcelsius national health the twothousanddollar custommade diamond and gold diablo de cartier fountain pen on top of each stack of documents will be your souvenir of this day but another pleasant and constant reminder of it will also be your bank accounts the laughter from around the room was generous now then if you will each take your pen and refer to item one we the elegant double doors at the far end of the conference room swung open welcome marshall halliday almost exclaimed instead he watched in stunned silence as will grant and patty moriarity stepped shouldertoshoulder into the room they were showered and dressed in clean casual clothes but nothing could hide the fearsome bruising covering their faces wills left eye was completely swollen shut and his hands were bandaged pattys eyes were enveloped in violet with gentian streaks running down her cheeks and over her jaw both were limping moments after they entered the room a third person followeda tall distinguished man marching ramrod straight wearing the uniform of a colonel in the state police tommy moriarity remained there unmoving as patty and will split apart and slowly rounded the massive table giving each of the people seated there a slow closeup of the battering they had taken when they reached halliday patty handed him a folded piece of paper then another boyd halliday she said this is a warrant for your arrest on what charges the da is just getting started on those but the one you have in your hand is for fraud and accessory to murder i can promise you that there will be others the fraud part is outlined in that letter from a certain radiologist at the excelsius cancer center would you like us to add copies of these documents to those already in front of your business associates will asked boyd halliday raised himself up and stared stonily out the window that wont be necessary ed will you come here please and make certain these people dont violate any of my rights no one around the table moved as ed wittenburg held whispered conversations first with patty then halliday finally he stepped aside as patty handcuffed hallidays wrists behind him and led him from the room joined at the doorway by her father will bracing himself on the back of a chair turned and faced the others i hope most if not all of you are completely in the dark about what is happening here he said in time much will become clear to you for now all i can say is the stakes in the struggle between organized medicine and managed care have just gone up considerably none of us should be taking care of the health problems of others until our patients or clients concerns come before our own i challenge each of you to go back to your companies and figure out just how to put those words into practice oh and meanwhile feel free to keep your souvenir pens epilogue chicago ten months later winter sun glistened off the surface of lake michigan and the new powdery snow that blanketed much of the city physicians more than of them streamed across neatly shoveled walks and into mccormack place south on the vast convention campus the healers including several thousand chiropractors and hundreds of optometrists and podiatrists represented every specialty and medical organization as well as every state organized by the hippocrates society the gathering was unprecedented in its spirit of cooperation and its mission which was to carve out the framework of a singlepay national healthinsurance plan and to back up its demand for implementation by congress with the threat of a slowdown or even a general strike its going to happen will said can you believe it its gonna happen thanks to you patty tightened her grip on his arm and led him over to a spot where they could look out across the lake the magnitude and cruelty of excelsius healths perfidy had galvanized physicians in ways that had previously been unimaginable almost overnight chapters of the hippocrates society sprang up in cities across the country and membership swelled the ama threw the force of its members behind the search for a solution to the crisis a widely publicized and completely televised congressional hearing uncovered unacceptable business practices on the part of a number of healthcare provider companies patients and physicians at the hearing were joined on the witness stand by employees of a number of those companies suddenly anxious to share shortcuts they had encountered that adversely affected patient health subsequent to that a significant number of congressional seats had gone to candidates advocating immediate action on revamping the healthcare delivery system toward federal control meanwhile desperate corporations were quickly restructured ceos were replaced other officials simply took off some of them absconding with tens of millions in illgotten profits sentiment against continuing the status quo in health care grew like a tidal wave the uninsured middle class became martyrs to the cause of change the society national steering committee charged with organizing the chicago conference had originally planned for ten to fifteen thousand attendees twentyfive thousand was beyond anyones wildest imagination but adjustments had been made i really love chicago patty said dreamily and i really love chicago too you know i hope the day you realize youre not very funny isnt too hard on you okay thats it ive taken enough verbal abuse if you dont think im funny then the weddings off you can call it off if you want but youre going to have to tell my father on second thought i think ill opt for the verbal abuse wise move patty guided him back toward the convention center i just wish your old partner susan could be here with us she worked so damn hard in the interests of better health for all especially for folks like charles newcomber ah yes and lets not forget all those women from steadfast health whom she helped to experience the joys of learning they had cancer and undergoing surgery and chemo god but i wish that bullet i fired at her had actually gone where i was aiming she pointed to the center of her chest what goes around comes around will said it aint over i hope not baby but take it from a cop bad guys do get away and susan hollister had most certainly vanished even with lawyer ed wittenburgs help it had taken the statepolice chopper most of the day to locate the farm when they finally did susan was gone there were bullets and bullet holes everywhere but the bodies of the torturer krause and marshall gold and his man watkins were gone the farmer and his wife were questioned extensively and threatened with charges but neither caved in and they were ultimately sent back to their farmhouse the excelsius pathologist who had been paid to cooperate with hollister and newcomber by labeling cancerous slides with the names of women who were given breast cancer agreed to a plea bargain which helped to send boyd halliday to prison though not nearly for as long as patty and will felt he deserved the pathologists statement also led to the indictment in absentia of hollister the lawsuits from patients were just beginning but soon after hallidays arrest excelsius health was dissolved it would be years before the finances of the conglomerate were untangled and settlements awarded in addition to the individual suits augie micelli was assisting a top boston law firm in a class action against the former healthcare giant it was the opening session of the fourday consortium for effective national healthcare coverage and the vast convention hall was rapidly filling up for the keynote address to be delivered by diana joswick a texas anesthesiologist and the recently elected president of the hippocrates society a banner proclaiming affordable health care for all stretched across the wall behind the dais the atmosphere was electric will had tried to decline the societys request that he be seated on the dais with joswick and other notables citing his resignation for personal reasons from all but general membership in the organization in the end though for the sake of unity he demurred at his request seats in the center of the third row had been set aside for patty and augie micelli theres augie patty exclaimed pointing will followed her into the row and settled temporarily into an empty seat next to hers micelli much lighter and healthierlooking than he had been the day he first met will was beaming this is a bigger happening than frigging woodstock he gushed talk about making a difference you two have changed the world lets not get carried away augie whos getting carried away you look great patty said how many pounds nineteen and threequarters but whos counting its amazing what cutting alcohol out of your diet can do for the old waistline how long has it been since i left for rehab eight months tomorrow has it been hard reasonably but im still not ready to cave in i keep telling myself that anyone who can come up with as much fentanyl solution as i did in as short a time can stay away from a drink for a day at a time all those aa people i used to make fun of have helped too in time maybe youll consider going back into practice not until this mess is straightened out i wont micelli gestured toward the banner plus i still have some bigleague suin to do medicines ready for you as soon as youre ready for it will said go theyre waving for you up there micelli replied i still dont feel comfortable being just go will took his place on the dais he had been reasonably prepared for his introduction in which he was presented as a physician whose courage spirit and dedication defined what the hippocrates society was all about what he was not prepared for was the ovation standing spontaneously and applauding whistling and shouting out for fully two minutes below him patty was beaming and laughing out loud at his discomfiture finally the tribute subsided and diana joswick was introduced never in our history she began have our medical students and residents been better prepared for the rigors of taking care of patients but ironically never has the care their patients are receiving been poorer hospitals are no longer safe accessible havens for the ill and injured getting admitted to one is often more difficult than getting into an ivy league college cost of care has become our standard of care the stethoscope and careful physical exam have been replaced by paperwork and excessive documentation and all of this for only one and a half trillion dollars a yearmany many times what the very effective and accessible canadian healthcare system costs health care in america the most affluent and resourceblessed nation in the history of the world is a disgrace and expecting change to come from insurance executives who are the oilmen of medicine is just not going to cut it that is like asking the fox to build improvements in the chicken coop it is time my friends to step forward and be heard it is time to step forward and be counted it is time we made health care something other than an oxymoron applause reverberated throughout the cavernous hall as it would again and again throughout her fortyminute address five thousand miles to the south in a barrio of the village of talavera in the state of guaira in south central paraguay the assassin sat slumped on a rickety wooden bench near the corner of a cantina asleep to all appearances in truth beneath the broad brim of her straw hat her dark hawks eyes were open a slit and fixed on the doorway of the building across the streetclinica medico beneath her loose cotton robe her right hand inside a rubber glove was loosely wrapped about a snubnosed not daring to try to bring a gun into the country she had settled for the best the shopkeeper in asuncion had to offer the pistol which he said was russian felt cheaply made and the price was inflated but no matter he had let her fire it at some bottles and her plan called for only closerange shotsvery close range the would be enough an hour passed then most of another nothing for three days she had watched from the bench noting the comings and goings of her prey for three days the doctor had arrived at the clinic almost precisely at nine and remained alone inside until she opened the door to patients at ten casually checking through a side window two days in a row the hunter had watched as her quarry performed advanced martialarts forms in the small waiting area power balance speed had something gone wrong today had she taken the day off the assassin was casting about looking for signs of trouble when she spotted the doctor approaching casually through the dust and hazy midmorning heat nodding to a woman hanging out clothes waving to a fruit vendor relaxed happy the woman on the bench clenched her jaw and tightened her grip on the pistol she had waited long enoughit was time even though the doctor was two hours later than usual she showed no indication of opening the clinic to the public right away for five minutes ten the door remained closed the doctor was alone inside probably practicing her forms finally her hat still pulled low across her eyes the assassin rose ambled across the street and knocked on the door somos cierros the doctors voice slightly breathless called from within were closed another series of knocks come on come on footsteps from within thats it soon now very soon the door opened first a bit then all the way hola buenas diasenque le puedo servir may i please come in there was surprise on the doctors face at hearing english i suppose im very busy right now she stepped back and allowed the assassin two steps into the waiting area where she had been working out dr hollister weve had a hell of a time finding you the assassin brushed her hat up away from her eyes recognition took a few seconds by then the was in position grace davis your grateful devoted patient grace could see susan hollisters hands tense and knew the professional killer could take her in an instant she and her husband had given up more than eight months of their lives and all of their savings pointing to this moment throughout their hunt grace pictured the confrontation over and over in her mindpictured it and wondered if she could do it if she could actually pull the trigger if she could actually kill now it took less than a second to find out as hollister swung her foot up in what would have been the equivalent of a decapitating kick grace fired into her spinning formonce then again hollisters lethal pirouette stopped in midair she stumbled back against a table and fell heavily blood expanding from two rents in the side of her white t her eyes widened as grace stepped forward the barrel of the leveled at her forehead dont do it hollister gasped dont the third bullet fired from less than three feet entered the center of susan hollisters forehead and exited the back of her skull with enough force to embed itself in the clay floor grace peng davis stripped off her robe and dropped it next to the body along with the gun then she exited through the back door of the clinic and calmly made her way along the street leading out of the village a block down the road mark davis pulled over in a rented kia is it over he asked as his wife climbed in and he pulled away grace bit down on her lower lip and nodded her eyes were full take me home she said
