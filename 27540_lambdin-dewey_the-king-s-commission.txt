dewey lambdin the kings commission lewrie this ones for marrin mary delle fleet in memphis we shot our way through memphis for years when we were all in television production and sailed our way into more whiteknuckle experiences than i can shake a stick at by now they must feel like partowners in wind dancer one long splice at a time and to both my exwives dont flatter yourselvesneither one of you is in this he rises fastest who knows not whither he is going attributed to oliver cromwell foreword before diving right into alan lewries latest naval adventure if one may do so without besmirching ones own fine sense of honor by exposing it to such a rogue it might be a good idea to discover just exactly who in the hell this alan lewrie character was of course for those of you with a taste for stirring action and some salacious wenching you may plunge right on to chapter one and elide this brief curriculum vitae but for the more inquisitive reader unfamiliar with the previous accounts about our nautical hero a reader not entirely taken in by splashy dust jackets and titillating blurb copy believe me this chronicler understands your plight you have found this tome and it sounded as though it might contain scads of blood and thunder shivering topsls and timbers as in shiver me timbers mate lots of derringdo and some naughty bits tucked into the odd corner but its a wrench trying to pick up on the middle release of a whole series of nautical adventure in midtack as our protagonist has learned to say at this stage of his career so allow me to condense this young corinthians past for you before getting into all the sex swords and sailing ships not necessarily in that order i look upon it as a public duty after all did c s forester do this for you no you had to wait for the homblower companion did sherlock holmes ever have a biography or did you have to search for clues in the works themselves alan lewrie was born on epiphany in st martins in the fields parish london his mother elizabeth lewrie passed away soon after this blessed event and he began life a bastard in the parish poorhouse quite appropriately since the sobriquet of you little bastard was said about him by quite a few people in his life rescued from the orphanage and poorhouse ending a promising career of oakumpicking and flaxpounding for no apparent good reason by his true father sir hugo st george willoughby of st james parish st james square unfortunately not the good side knight of the garter excaptain th regiment of foot the kings own member whites almacks hellfire club and the society for the diminution of the spread of venereal diseases there is a long biographical gulf between and for lack of information but since most childhoods are wretchedly uninteresting who bloody cares the american colonies rebel alan lewrie discovers what a goosegirl will do for a shilling and chambermaids and mopsqueezers may do for free if one can only run fast enough to catch them entered into westminster school obviously to get him out of the neighborhood instead of being tutored at home with his halfsister belinda and halfbrother gerald expelled same year for licentious behavior though he did post some decent marks entered eton expelled eton see above entered harrow expelled harrow as above but with the codicil that he was implicated in a plot to blow up the governors coach house in youthful admiration for the gunpowder plot there was no mention in the school records of licentious behavior this time so we must assume that such goingson were not taken as seriously at harrow as at other places in those days nabbed in flagrante delicto with his aforementioned halfsister belinda willoughby for once this incident was not his fault well not totally anyway booted from the bosom so to speak of his family with one hundred guineas a year and told never to show his face in society or the family digs again turned over to an officer of the navy impress service and entered the royal navy as a midshipman in portsmouth january signed aboard hms ariadne rd rate sixtyfour guns capt ezekiel bales seven months atlantic convoy duties during this time he became believe it or not a passably competent midshipman which says volumes for the return of corporal punishment in schools and flogging as a spur to proper naval discipline july ariadne fights a bloody battle with a disguised spanish twodecked ship and upon arrival at antigua in the leeward islands is adjudged too damaged to repair her captain and first officer are courtmartialed for her loss the third officer for cowardice none of this was alan lewries fault either in fact he acquitted himself well under fire on the lower gun deck and won some small fame for his coolness in action though readers of the kings coat remember his behavior differently especially his wish to go below and hide among the rum casks august appointed midshipman into hm sloop parrot lt james kenyon master and commander there followed five months of enjoyable duties wenching and swilling all over the caribbean and atlantic coast january a new personal best of two older ladies in kingston jamaica in two days but during a week on passage for antigua he became second officer when almost everyone senior went down with yellow fever saved the ship from a french privateer brig burning her to the waterline in the process saved a titled royal commissioner and his lady who were their passengers almost had the leg over the lady and came down with yellow fever himself a damned trying week in all februarymarch recovering on antigua then staffserf to rear adm sir onsley matthews met wooed and fell in thrall with the admirals niece miss lucy beauman fought a duel for her honor her family was awfully rich killed his opponent and was posted to sea before he could say jackketch april to presentmidshipman into hm frigate desperate th rate twenty guns comdr tobias treghues one of gods own cuckoos several successful raiding cruises raid on the danish virgin islands many prizes taken battle of the chesapeake siege of yorktown from which he escaped or we wouldnt be following his career any longer would we evacuation of wilmington north carolina november see the french admiral made acting masters mate confirmed in december one might just mention in passing a smallish theft from a captured french prize a trifling sum really of oh some two thousand guineas more ren contres with young ladies of the willing or commercial persuasion just to keep his hand so to speak in and one surprisingly chaste bout of amour with a penniless young loyalist a miss caroline chiswick chaste perhaps because he had served ashore with her two tory soldierbrothers and knew what he could expect if he ever ran into them in a dark alley chaste perhaps because theres damned few places to put the leg over even the most obliging female aboard a man o war or chaste perhaps because he had seen the light become a better person for his service in the navy and really did like her and through her found a new respect for womankind andbut no we have deduced a pattern here and a mans usually true to his nature when the bloods up damme if he aint one more annoyingly minor matter of biographical minutia before we proceed to the flashy stuff and i promise broadsides before you can promise broadsides before you can say jackketch the alleged rape of his halfsister was discovered to be a theatric staged by his father sir hugo to gain unlimited access to a positive shower of guineas from the lewrie side of the family but sir hugo was diddled in return by alans grandmother who obstinately refused to go toesup at the proper moment and alan lewrie ended up smelling like hungary water with two hundred pounds per annum remittance since this last involves so much stupendously boresome legal mustification we hope the reader will appreciate the chronicler cutting that short as he goes bleary pondering the matter himself acknowledgments it would be impossible for me to begin an alan lewrie adventure without the assistance of the us naval institute and its reference bookssuch as john harlands seamanship in the age of sail to mention one of manyand the staff of the history department of the us naval academy to them my many thanks for details about turks island and horatio nelson i am grateful to mr iain mackenzie of the national maritime museum in greenwich england who was kind enough to dig up lieutenants journals and material from contemporary accounts such as schombergs naval chronology and beatsons naval and military memoirs i would also like to thank derek rooke of memphis tennessee who culled a lot of material for me i had to repay him by being his only crew when he wanted to race his thirtythree foot sloop which is the sort of long painful and humiliating tale id rather not go into ever even if we did come in seventh in a class of twentyeight boats clenell wilkinsons biography nelson provided good insight into the famous admirals personality thanks also to mr herbert sadler of grand turk island the turks and caicos who serves as historian to the islands john richard aldens the south in the revolution and gloria jahodas florida a history provided details on the role of the southeastern indian tribes in the revolution a debt must be expressed as well to charles hudsons excellent onevolume treatise the southeastern indians for the wealth of information on the social life customs and language of the creek and seminole tribes i chapter chapter it is confessed by all that from his youth he was of a vehement and impetuous nature of a quick apprehension and of a strong and aspiring bent for action and for great affairs life of themistocle plutarch the french fleet made a brave sight to leeward twentynine massive ships of the line bearing up toward the smaller british fleet on a bow and quarter line their gunports gaping and filled with hard iron maws the whiteandgold battle flags of bourbon france streaming in the moderate winds and their halyards bedecked with signal bunting if this is going to be anything like the chesapeake battle were about to get our arses knackered masters mate and midshipman alan lewrie observed sourly comparing the twentytwo english vessels against that bellicose spectacle to the west frogs like ta fight ta looard said mr monk the sailing master shrugging as he worked on a bite of halfshriveled apple but we got em this time caint work ta windward of us ta double monk waved a stray hand at the shore close aboard to the east past which they barely scraped nevis island ghosted by crowding the disengagedside frigates such as desperate up close to the battle line un youll note young lewrie the winds a prodigy ta looard of an island monk went on got a kink in the trades here thatll bear us along on a nice quarter wind too close into shore yonder an wed be winded by the hills o nevis too far out as well but winds come slidin down the hills and touch water out here where we are see how yon french are luffin and fillin ta keep station further out too far out for this little river o wind were ridin second lee if the battle line crowds us much more well be winded sir alan observed noting the strip of azure waters that was shoaling and shallows close aboard to starboard even if we dont ran her aground well end up in the islands lee under those bluffs last in line of the repeating frigates last in line for pretty much everything since yorktown too cant go spoilin the admirals dinner with our stink lewrie monk spatliterally and figuratively for he wandered over to the binnacle to fire a dollop of tobacco juice at the spit kid how the man could eat and swallow fruit and reserve his quid in the other cheek almost made alan ill just contemplating the feat wasnt our fault we escaped mister monk alan said going to the wheel to join him and peer into the compass bowl lord cornwallis give us verbal orders we

losin the army an all our other ships well itll take a piece o time er somethin ta rub the shite offn our boots fer their likes for what we are about to receive may the good lord make us grateful comdr tobias treghues desperates master and commander said as the french fleet began to open fire at long range with the wind carrying the sound of cannonading to leeward it sounded no more dangerous than the thumping of pillows and the sour greytan wall of smoke climbed above the bulwarks and lower masts of the enemy ships to be ragged away to the west admiral hoods ships began to return fire and their view of the proceedings was obscured as great billows of expended powder blotted out the sky now well give those french and this de grasse a proper english quilting treghues prophecied with a tight superior grin not bloody likely alan thought they had been at the battle of the chesapeake where this selfsame admiral de grasse had snatched victory from a budding disaster and the british admirals including hood who now commanded their fleet had stood about in stupefaction until there was nothing left to do but call if off hood had kept back the strongest division of the combined leeward islands and north american fleets never even fired a ranging shot all day and desperate had been trapped in chesapeake bay at the siege of yorktown and alan nearly lost his life ashore had stood with the army expecting the navy to return and break the siege and save the men before they had been forced to surrender it need hardly be said that alan lewrie had a low opinion of admiral hoods reputed fighting qualities in point of fact he also had a rather low opinion of a naval career since it wasnt his choice in the first place but everyone knew that by now which took the bite out of any carping he might have done in the privacy of his midshipmens mess they had had a hard dash south under a full press of sail for barbados to carry word to hood that the island of st kitts had been invaded by de grasse and the french on the eleventh of january hood had sailed for antigua to pick up seven hundred or so troops all that could be spared and then made a fast passage to round the southern shore of nevis the twin island to st kitts to confront the french dragging desperate in the fleets train like a barely tolerated relative yesterday had been thought to be the day of decision but all they had accomplished by their presence was to draw this massive frog fleet out of its anchorage out to sea off basse terre rumor had it that hood had wanted to sail right in and fire into the anchored ships as they should have at the chesapeake but that had been postponed once more this de grasse had been given a heavensent chance to escape the massacre of his fleet the last time he had destroyed any last chance to recover the colonies would his luck hold and would they begin to lose the fabulously wealthy sugar islands now theys a gap monk pointed out with alarm in his voice oh my dear lord treghues whispered more a short prayer than a curse for he was a fanatic when it came to quelling the english sailors easy penchant for blasphemy prudents never been a fast sailer prudent a seventyfourgunned rd rate fourth from the rear of the british line had not been able to keep up to the speed of her consorts and the ships behind her were backing and filling to avoid running her down and tangling their yards in collision part of the french line led by the massive threedecker flagship ville de paris de grasses own ship bore up to close in and penetrate it would be the beginning of a disaster alan couldnt watchhed been there beforeand made his way to the starboard side to stand by midshipmen avery and burney who had been relegated by duty to a poor view of the proceedings mister lewrie avery said coolly echoed a second later by the startlingly beautiful burney avery burney lewrie replied touching a finger to the brim of his cocked hat to return their salutes avery had been his best and nearly only friend in the navy especially on desperate until alan had returned from the debacle at the chesapeake and had been appointed an acting masters mate they had caterwauled together schemed together and shared almost all of their innermost thoughts but now they were separated by the gulf between a junior warrant officer and a midshipman though alan knew that if he well and truly fucked up in his new posting he could end up swinging a hammock in the cockpit with david avery and burney in the blink of an eye goddamn my eyes i hope they brought a good lunch alan spat as he looked shoreward at the last and most westward point of land above fort charles on nevis quite a crowd had gathered treating the naval battle like a spectator sport and an excuse for a feast civilians sir avery agreed with a properly naval scowl of displeasure may they get an eyeful sir burney said with some heat alan didnt know quite what to make of burney he was sixteen had a good kit and was obviously from money but he was so keen nautical and unfailingly of good cheer that alan felt his skin crawl every time he was around him little gets got a fiddle he thought suspiciously as was lewries usual wont besides burney was so beautiful in a manly gentlemanly way his features so clear and wellformed that alan felt like throwing shoes at him where were the usual boils the pimples of a teenaged midshipmangod help he didnt even half stink like most people it was uncanny at em canada treghues enthused would that lord cornwallis had shown half the bottom of his brother captain cornwallis yonder the next ship ahead of prudent had shivered her topsls and lost way to seal the gap against the french probe and the two ships ahead of the gallant canadaresolution and bedfordhad also slowed down to form a solid wall of oak and iron to frustrate their foes foiled aha treghues laughed another sign of incipient madness to alans lights comdr the hon tobias treghues had been a straightlaced prig of the worst bluestocking sort at first but between a head injury the year before a slight trephination by the ships surgeon and a course of medication consisting of a rare south american weed that dr dorne referred to as nicotiana glauca taken in wine and smoked he was as fickle now as some young miss he had made alans life a living hell then half a joy then again a hell as his moods shifted now he seemed favorably disposed to lewrie but one never knew and alan missed the security of knowing that he was either a hopelessly lost cause or some nautical paragon to be praised and lauded to the skies and to the admiralty which was more useful for a career sensing that treghues was safe enough to approach this day without fear of being bitten alan wandered back past the wheel and the binnacle to the larboard side after pausing to check the quartermasters on the wheel the compass bearing and the set of the sails bosun were nigh past the last of nevis be prepared at the braces to take the wind abeam alan cautioned aye mister lewrie coke grumbled disliking to be told his duties by a jumpedup younker but forbearing philosophically wonder if they left anything in the anchorage lieutenant railsford asked plying a telescope northward toward the westernmost point of land below st kitts maintown basse terre and the anchorage in frigate bay if they did theyd best shift em afore ya kin say jackpuddin monk opined er well be among em asharin out some solidshot grief were headreachin the devils damned if we aint desperate leaned a bit as the wind shifted bringing their collective attention inboard away from the engagement before them hands to the braces mister coke lieutenant railsford ordered by god thisll put a bone in our teeth with the fresher airs playing between st kitts and nevis down the narrow mile and a half channel their small frigate began to fly as did the larger ships of the line leaving the leeward vessels in the french line behind still caught in a pocket of stiller air to nevis lee even prudent was catching up handily now now whats de grasse done wrong here today treghues demanded of his officers once the ship was fully under control and the braces had been belayed by the waisters along the gangways above the guns avery abandoned his anchorage sir avery said brightly burney he doesnt seem too eager to close us sir and fight at close pistolshot burney piped up the eager student and he stranded himself out in the second lee of the island before making his approach lewrie youre the student of that fellow named clerk what do you say treghues asked and alan flinched recalling the last time he had dared to open his mouth back in september about clerks tactics book if he wanted to fight sir he could have defended his anchorage or backed and filled during the night much closer towards st kitts sir alan surmised starting that far to the suthrd and out to sea from us he practically gave it away and he could have pushed through the gap prudent made if hed tried has admiral hood made any mistakes yet treghues went on loving his role of experienced teacher to his neophyte officers he almost abandoned the last four or five ships sir burney ventured but it was more important to get on north to st kitts very good sirs very good treghues nodded with a pleasant smile and strolled away with his hands clasped in the small of his back hood had indeed headreached on the suddenly baffled french and as they watched and the afternoon of january wore on hoods lineofbattle ships gained the anchorage swung east and anchored in lineahead from almost the reefs of frigate bay stretching back west to seaward blocking the french from entry into their former anchorage desperate had to snake her way between the heavier rd rates as they rounded up to anchor passing to the disengaged side through the battle line which was the proper station for frigates to find safety once more inside the screen of larger ships find us good holding ground to leeward mister monk treghues said we shall anchor west and north of the last ships in the line of battle charts show thirty fathom therebouts sir monk replied after a long squint at one of his heavily creased and much doodledupon charts soft sand un mud though not good holdin ground hard coral bout a mile closer ta shore though we could fetch to sir lieutenant railsford suggested if there is a threat wed be caught putting put a kedge anchor from the stern and not have the springs ready anybody ta looard o usd take the devils own time beatin up ta windward ta get at us though monk chuckled we might have time ta put out the kedge un bower un get springs on the cables or get caught anchored by a rd rate sir alan stuck in to try the waters it was not desperates place or function in life to become an immobile target for a larger ship that could blow holes in her hard to get a bower up out of soft sand and mud treghues speculated audibly very well bring her to mister railsford back the mizzen topsl and shift the head sheets with the foresails cocked up to produce forward motion and the squaresails laid aback or furled to the yards to retard her desperate fetchedto her helm hard over as though she were trying to tack and had been caught in irons by a capricious shift of wind drifting slowly and making barely discernible sternway to all intents at a dead stop stand the hands down from quarters mister railsford treghues ordered as eight bells chimed from the belfry at the break of the focsle ending the afternoon watch and beginning the first dogwatch at pm cooks to light the galley fires sir railsford asked it took time to develop enough heat under the steeptubs so the rations could be boiled up and the first dog was the usual time to start cooking not yet not until we are sure we shall not be called upon to engage should a foe break the leeward end of the line the captain said frowning ill not risk fire aboard until dusk theres still daylight enough to do something glorious freed of the tedium of duty alan betook himself below after one last lungful of fresh clean tradewind air below decks in the cockpit it would be a close and humid fog of humanitys reeks the day had been pleasantly warm and the wind bracing and his nostrils pinched at the aromas of a ship when he reached his tiny dogbox of a cabin pea soup farts armpits unwashed bodies and rancid clothing the garbagemidden stink of the bilges and holds where cheeses breadbags dried beans and peas slowly rotted where kegs of salt meat slowly fermented in brine got you you bastard he exulted as he managed to mash a large roach with his shoe at the foot of the accommodation ladder at least half a dozen more scurried from sight he tossed his cocked hat onto the peg above his cot peeled off his tailcoat and almost tore the stock from his throat to open his collar oblivious to the continual booming and thudding of artillery that still roared between the two opposing fleets freeling fetch a bucket of seawater alan demanded past the flimsy lath and canvas door to his cabin indeed the whole dogbox afforded nothing more than the semblance of privacy framed out in light deal and canvas that could be struck down before battle coomin zurr the mournful freeling intoned joylessly sounding even more putupon than normal alan had finally gotten the mans measure and was no longer in thrall to the cockpit servants truculent behavior as he had been when still merely a midshipman once the water arrived alan took down a mildewed rag sniffed at it and thought it could do for a few more days then soaked it in the seawater and stripped to scrub himself down aboard a ship of war the water was rationed at a gallon a day per man and officer but not much of that went for washing or drinking most of it was used in the steeptubs to boil food personal consumption for cleanliness or shaving was limited to a pint a man and most people found drinking the smallbeer or wine more palatable than ships water after it had been in cask for a few weeks for it usually turned whiskeybrown stained by the oak casks or the animalcules that grew in it it was best when used to dilute rum or wine which killed the brackish taste certainly seawater made you itch all over and one developed rashes and boils from constant exposure but that was a sailors lot besides everybody itched and scratched constantly even ashore at least ships were free for the most part anyway of lice fleas and ticks ah that feels good alan whispered working up a slight lather from a stub of soap cake he had purchased in wilmington he would be sorry when it was finally gone for in his lengthy shore service with the army at yorktown during the siege one of his few pleasures was a soak in a creek or a hot halfbarrel of clean water with some soap at least once or twice a week most of the hands who came from poorer circumstances thought him tetched for his obsession with hot water he rinsed down and shook out his clothing now that he was a junior warrant his clothes did not take half the abuse of a midshipmans uniform the tar and linseed oil stains were almost gone from the days and weeks he had lived in the rigging aloft and had turned positively grimy from the running rigging standing rigging and the spars sure he could pass muster he flapped his breeches and shirt to air the last of the sweat from them and put them back on hed save his clean clothing for sunday divisions no sense getting potty about things bloody frogs burney was crowing from the cockpit outside his flimsy door as they rumbled down to their berth from the gun deck what a jape on those bastards freeling trot out some black strap avery called ant been no eesue zurr freeling mooed mournfully then break out a bottle of our personal stores and be quick about it man avery insisted well drink confusion to our foes damme if we shant putting his stock back on alan came out from his dogbox and took a seat at the scarred mess table with the midshipmen which put a chill on their cockahoop airs i take it the frogs have indeed been confused alan asked they sailed right up to us in column and had to sheer away as our line took them under fire burney said proudly then they loped off to seaward to the souwest trying to think of something to do about us holding the harbor alan smiled probably try something tomorrow at first light are we to anchor the captain still hasnt said mister lewrie avery replied in his best professional manner unable to look alan in the eyes freeling arrived with some chipped glassware and a bottle of fairly decent bordeaux part of a lot the mess had gone shares on in new york after yorktown when desperate was still refitting from the pummeling she had taken before her daring escape only two glasses alan pointed out i mind i went shares on that case of bottles too freeling fetch me a glass oh freeling groaned aye zurr if you do not mind me joining your celebrations alan put the dig in with a sly smile not at all mister lewrie burney chirped honored sir avery added they were into their first glass of wine when railsford cheatham the purser dr dorne and the marine lieutenant peck came aft through their quarters for the airier and more spacious accommodations of the wardroom dead aft of them in the stern burney put down his second glass then was caught short and stumbled off for the beakhead up forward to make water leaving avery and lewrie alone in the midshipmens mess i dont think this frog de grasse is half as smart as weve been thinking sir avery said shyly we diddled him pretty well today aye that we did he was badly placed to get to grips with us too far to leeward and he waited too long to come about from south to north and take us under fire might have been better for him if he had reversed course and order as soon as he saw us and waited closer to st kitts yes david grinned gotten to windward inshore of nevis himself frogs like to fight to leeward though david alan stated makes sense if youre a twodecker and can keep your heaviest artillery on the lower deck in action if you take the windward your guns are slanting down and even with the quoins all the way out you dont have the range an upward slanting deck could give you and they like to fight at long range too and shoot for the rigging stead of closing for a clean shot probably top their whores at arms length too alan laughed wont get to grips like a good englishman avery added getting more comfortably into the conversation like that buttock shop we went to in charleston on your birthday lewrie reminisced what was it maudes lady janes david hooted i still owe you for that well it was only a crown apiece or are you thinking of the brawl we got into after we left alan shrugged and made free with the bottle to top up both their glasses i owe you for that one too theyd have split my skull in that street if you hadnt been there sir david shot back sir is it alan asked damnit all david well you are a masters mate now thats only because were shorthanded im still the same as you just another midshipman i could be chucked out of my dogbox and back in a hammock next week youve been acting like ive been made post the navy and its discipline be damned its not just what the navy expects david sobered its the way you came back aboard after yorktown maybe even before then when we went inshore before we were equals fellow sufferers in this nautical misery eh david essayed a small laugh but you changed became a hard man like youd aged ten years and i was still seventeen dya see so youre afraid of me alan gaped in awe of my new grandeur nothing like that david replied with a sarcastic expression and your grandeur be damned cause you still break the vilest wind of any human ive ever seen youre miles ahead of me now alan i suddenly became your older brother lewrie chid him something like that david nodded seriously more like youd come back aboard a commission officer with years of authority about you youll make your commission before me maybe make post before me if i stay in the navy after this war is over alan scoffed damme im sorry you feel that way david i am too avery grimaced but there it is i still count you my dearest friend but friendship is based on equality and were no longer equal not as long as we wear uniform sorry if ive been acting standoffish but it comes with the service if we joshed each other as we were used then id get a caning and youd get a tonguelashing as long as were aboard ship at least perhaps on a run ashore things might be different i hope so anyway then we shall have one soon alan promised burney came back from his trip to the heads and alan stood up to finish dressing in waistcoat coat and cocked hat he went on deck to leave the two midshipmen to their fledgling friendship damme how did this come about he asked himself im not two full years older than david and hes looking up to me like a distant uncle maybe if we both make an equal rank hell feel different but no he realized there was a gulf greater than rank between them now some perception on davids part that saw him as some older and more competent man he didnt feel old he was barely nineteen looking back on his life he wasnt sure if he had ever been young and innocent but by god he didnt feel as old and competent as david implied he was still groping for his own way in the navy and in life still making stupid mistakes floundering about in society like a drowning man clutching at a floating spar even if his finances and family background had finally been ascertained neither he gathered with a smirk was he the same incredibly callow seventeenyearold that had crawled through ariadnes entry port soaking wet from a dunk in the solent because he had no idea how to manage scaling manropes and battens up a ships side he admitted to himself that he had made progress in skill and knowledge in the navy and had gotten a few glimmerings about life but was he not the same shameless corinthian brotheldandy and buck of the first head who could roister through london streets like a rutting ramcat with no thought for the morrow except a vague wonderment about where he was going to awaken and with whom jesus this fucking navy is making a doddering fossil out of me he grumbled lets beat this damned de grasse and have done with the whole humbug beforemy godbefore i start taking me seriously the bosuns pipes began to cheep then to break his irreverent reveries all hands all hands on deck prepare to anchor mister lewrie do ya take charge o the focsle monk bellowed in a quarterdeck rasp that could have cut through a whole gale clear hawse bucklers seize up ta the best bower with the twocable line un prepare ta let go the next morning de grasse had at them again during the night hood had ordered his ships to shift their anchorages so that an unbroken line stood from the point below frigate bay the van ship was about four miles soueast of basse terre so close inshore not even a sloop could have clawed inshore of her she was also inside the point and shoal as further cover twelve more ships lay astern of her to the westnorwest a mileandaquarter to a mileandahalf of lineofbattle ships with their artillery ready the remaining six liners bent about to curve the last of the line to the north with admiral hoods nd rate barfleur at the apex of the bend all ships had springs rigged on their anchor cables so they could shift their fire right or left as needed to take on a foe at extreme range as she approached and swing with her to pour more deadly broadsides into her as long as she sailed past them desperate had upped her own anchors and gotten underway shortly after breakfast and was now prowling behind the battle line like a caged wildcat waiting for something to maul should she be given a chance ready to pass messages or bear down upon a crippled british vessel to render her assistance the trades were blowing well out of the soueast so an attempt to get round behind the line would involve hours of tacking closehauled and the ships drawn up en potence guarded that vital flank from the attempt the french were presented with one hell of a quandary and the english waited to see what brilliant maneuver the wily de grasse would pull out of his goldlaced cocked hat here they come damn their blood lieutenant railsford finally spat after a hail from the lookout at the mainmast crosstrees the french fleet was strung out in a perfect order in single lineahead a cables length between ships aimed like a spear at the head of hoods line with implacable menace they bore down as if they would crash through the anchored ships and smash them in the process but the lead vessel drifted west unable to bear close enough to the wind and now aimed at the third ship in line when within range she turned west immediately hoods ships returned fire upon her bless my soul will you look at that now treghues rejoiced slapping his thighs can you mark her mister railsford pluton looks like sir rd rate seventyfour guns alan had access to a spare telescope and was standing on the bulwarks with an arm and a leg hooked through the mizzen shrouds for a better view the french ship staggered as if she had just run aground surrounded by a thin pall of dust and smoke as she was savaged by the fire of at least four british ships that had swung on their springs to direct their gunfire into her together i can see scantlings flying from her far side sir alan said theyre blowing her to flinders pluton if that was her as they surmised passed down that long mileandahalf line being taken under fire in order and a cable behind her came a second ship and a third and a fourth all taking the same terrible drubbing like sheep to the slaughter the entire french lineofbattle followed that dreadful course shooting high as was their usual practice but doing little damage to ships at anchor who couldnt have cared less whether their rigging was cut up the british followed their usual practice as well aiming twixt wind and water to punch starshaped holes into the hulls and gun decks to kill men and make the wood splinters fly scything down crews and dismounting guns desperates crew was jeering as the lead french man owar turned away and staggered back toward the south her masts sprung and rolling and her hull ripped apart by high velocity iron now damme alan relished over the din this is more like it desperate went about and worked her way to leeward past the bend of the british line for a better view of the proceedings loafing along under reduced sail away from the predictable thumping that the rest of the french fleet was suffering to see what would transpire as they bore away which was nothing threatening as they could see after half an hour the french were making no more attempt to do anything offensive what do you think of admiral hood now mister lewrie railsford asked him cocking one eyebrow in mirth well sir after the chesapeake i thought he was the biggest poltroon in uniform but hes showing well today alan answered if hed been in charge then wed have never swung away wed have been in that anchorage among the frogs and cut them to pieces or wed have winkled them out of their anchorage as we did yesterday and put up such a wall of gunfire de grasse would have shattered his fleet trying to reenter and gobbled up their damned army stead of them gobbling up ours sir alan concluded with a wolfish expression not that we could have really won against the americans even after such a victory indeed sir he said politely thinking mine arse on a bandbox too few men too big a country too much hatred by then even if we could have bagged washington and rochambeau on the march down from new york thered be another washington come out of the backwoods with another army railsford shrugged but we still come out of this rebellion with canada and the important thing now is to beat the frogs and dagoes until they scream for mercy so well not have any more of these coalition wars for the rest of the century if we do it proper de grasse isnt as good as we touted him to be is he mister railsford alan asked feeling as though there had been an exorcism we gave him victory in the chesapeake he couldnt help but show well there to my mind hes an overrated clown when up against the sort of admiral we have here today railsford opined lord norths cousin graves was a clown appointed by petticoat influence hood is not and pray god we get him back in the leewards neither is rodney the captain once told me something similar sir about getting hood and rodney together and sweeping the seas id love to see that would you aye sir i would alan said realizing that it was so halfpleased by the prospect and halfstartled that he cared anything more for the navy than getting out of it with a whole skin well now if you were this de grasse bugger what would you be thinking of about this time railsford asked by way of instruction well sir im french so id go below and have me a good sulk maybe boot hell out of my servants for starters alan chuckled some good fortifying brandy then id come back up and split my fleet half to attack the ships en potence half to beat up past our line as far as brimstone hill itd take hours but one could make eastnoreast then tack and fall back down on the anchorage hood would have to shift the van ships closest the shore to counter if he did id fight both halves of my fleet for a crossfire with us in the center lieutenant railsford studied him closely for a long moment lips parted as though about to sneer and alan felt a total fool railsford had been an ally in the early days after he had come aboard desperate an ally even after treghues had turned on him from railsford he had learned much more than he ever had from treghues teaching sessions for treghues was more fond of his own voice and opinions than in imparting anything worthwhile to his charges what improvements in his behavior and in his nautical lore he had learned for railsfords sake and now he had most likely revealed himself a complete incompetent idiot alan blushed and looked away with a shy grimace to show that he was not to be taken totally seriously god be thanked you wear our kings coat and not that of their slackjawed monarch railsford finally commented should this bastard try that hed have the leeward islands squadron on a plate fuck me alan exulted to himself have i said something clever indeed sir he asked with as much false humility as he could muster at short notice i shall say some serious prayers for anyone foolish enough to cross your hawse should you ever hoist your broad pendant lewrie lieutenant railsford went on you think on a grand scale for such a lowly sir alan stuck in the humility now in full ooze when called upon and if given warning enough to be on his best behavior he knew he could toady and suck up with the best that wont last not if you watch your helm railsford told him with a grin are you considering continuing your naval career well sir it may not be up to me alan sighed if we beat de grasse bad enough today the war may be over soon there was talk about a peace commission to parley with the rebels some guff about a meeting with all the belligerents to call it off soon and what use is one more lowly midshipman out of thousands when ninetenths of the navy would be laid up inordinary there i said that right well not my bloody fault if they dump me is it he thought why just blurt out id rather be whoring around seven dials than put up with another day of this misery and deprivation come to think on it either ones just as dangerous whats left mister lewrie railsford asked with a wry expression trade not exactly the ton for a young man raised as a gentleman like yourself clerking for someone youre too honest for parliament and too much a rogue for holy orders stick with what you do best and believe it or not young sir what you do best is the navy well thankee kindly mister railsford sir alan replied glad to be complimented and blushing a bit genuinely this time enough praise for the devil today railsford sobered else i shall expect your head to swell and burst aye aye sir deck thar came a leatherlunged shout from the lookout aloft theym be comin hagin now we shall see if de grasse has discovered something new to try on us railsford snapped turning back to the rail and i hope he does not commune with the same creative muse as you mister lewrie once more after reeling off to the souwest in a long curve the french came back their alignment and spacing in lineahead perfect as they could make it headed directly for us treghues commented nearby as everyone crowded the larboard bulwarks of the quarterdeck their turnaway took them down to leeward and beating back to try the line again did not work they shall assay their luck against the ships en potence this time what if they could get a slant of wind around the rear of this shorter line sir railsford asked the trades are still out of the soueast three points more would flank our dispositions mister railsford i would much admire if you do lay desperate as close to the wind as you may and bring her to on the opposite tack treghues said standing slim elegant and foursquare with his ornate personal telescope to his eye a th rate to impede the path of a nd or rd rate sir railsford asked aghast that anyone could even countenance such an idea not to match broadsides no treghues said laughing easily still intent on the sight of the enemy fleet but we should be able to deflect them they cannot sail closer to the wind to avoid us or theyd be in irons and get shot to ribbons by the ships en potence to bear away to avoid us would deny them precious minutes it is an acceptable risk aye aye sir railsford nodded in the hush that had fallen on the quarterdeck a captains decisions could not be argued and any unwillingness expressed volubly enough to try and counter a captains tactics could be construed as direct violations of several of the merciless articles of war cowardice in not being courageous enough to fight insubordination not doing everything in ones power to ready a ship for a fight they were all courtmartial offenses and usually resulted in the offender being strung up from a yardarm by the neck i knew i should have gotten off when i had the chance alan thought shakily i could be languishing in a rebel prison right now training rats closeorder drill or something on parole at the easiest maybe it would have been better to have been captured with the army at yorktown than to put up with this tripeskulled clown bosun ready to wear ship railsford bellowed quartermaster we shall put the helm up and bring her to on the starboard tack by the time they had finished their evolution and desperate rode cocked up into the wind once more the french fleet was sliding up on them with the wind on their quarter pluton was no longer the van ship having been pounded half to matchwood in the first attempt and a new vessel presented herself as a target barfleur the ninetygunned nd rate opened fire first at the apex of the line swinging about on her springlines to get off several hot broadsides at the same target and the other ships en potence joined in as the french came within range clouds of smoke soared into the tropic skies and artillery belched and thundered spitting long red tongues of flame and sparks from burning wads into the smoke clouds the view was blotted out once more it might have been a gunnery exercise as far as the men in desperate could see even the masts of the french vessels disappeared and the sun was eclipsed into dusk there sir railsford gasped pointing out the shape emerging to the west of the worst powder smoke a french rd rate broke free from the pall and everyone breathed out in relief to note she was not pointing her jibboom at them any longer but was hauling her wind to leeward to break away west her best attempt rejected hmmph treghues snorted contemptuously is that the best de grasse can do then not much heart put into this sally was there signal sir one of the new thirteenyearold midshipmen piped from aft in a reedy voice our number from the flag well done sir ah treghues preened is it with little risk to themselves they had finally done something to expunge part of that silent faceless and therefore uncounterable cloud of disapproval if hood could take a moment to be magnanimous perhaps even their squadron commander comdr sir george sinclair could forgive them for losing him his nephew one of their midshipmen who had not escaped with her that stormy night in the chesapeake it was all treghues could do to not begin leaping about the deck and breaking into a hornpipe of glee at that most welcome signal if thats all the excitement for the day gentlemen we may haul our wind and come about on the larboard tack once more course due west make easy sail aye aye sir lieutenant railsford agreed we made em look pretty stupid hey mr monk chortled this de grasse aint nothin like the ogre we made him out ta be i want you all to witness that we have done something glorious in the last two days treghues said handing his sword to his servant judkin before going below for a late dinner we bedazzled them out of their anchorage and just shot the heart right out of them give us another week of steady breezes out of the soueast and their troops ashore will be running low on rations theres no foraging here on an island as small as st kitts there may be six thousand men in their army a loss so large would be as disastrous to them as saratoga or yorktown was to us pray god all of you that this may come to pass and our merciful savior shall vouchsafe english arms with a victory so grand we shall speak of it as henry v did of st crispins day the hands cheered to his ringing speech but since treghues patriotic fervor did not extend to splicing the mainbrace and trotting out a celebratory tot of rum and he did not mention agincourt by name most of the unlettered could only scratch their heads and wonder what the fuss was about except that sam hood had laid into the frogs and given them a walloping but barely had the ship been put about the hands stood down from quarters and the galley fires been lit than the lookouts summoned treghues back to the deck where away he asked there sir railsford pointed with his telescope held like a smallsword in his hand a despatch boat of some kind forenaft rigged coming on close to the wind and theres a frigate out to leeward to support her mayhap a message from de grasse to his troops ashore sir aye today would take some explaining treghues sniffed get sail on her mister railsford we shall drive her back out to sea or take her and read her despatches ourselves dinner sir railsford prompted my dear railsford your concern with victuals is commendable treghues laughed biscuit and cheese and serve out smallbeer we may be beating to quarters within the hour tell the cooks to put out their fires chapter chapter among the many things alan lewrie hated about the navy was the need for cold dinners the biscuit was thick and unleavened hard as a deck plank and could only be eaten after being soaked in beverage that is as soon as one had rapped it on the mess table enough to startle the weevils out of it the cheese purchased by the navy was suffolk hard and crumbly and the very devil to choke down there had been no time to get freeling to dig into their personal stores for a more chewable cheddar picked up at wilmington and the sudden call to quarters had brought them boiling back onto the upper decks while the ship echoed with the sounds of expected combat doors and partitions slammed as they were struck down and carried to the hold so they would not form splinters that made most of the injuries in battle chests and personal gear went below as well a towed boat was brought up alongside and the captains furniture and the livestock were tossed into it the sheep bleating and the hens in their crates squawking a thinshanked bullock was simply tossed over the side to sink or swim as god and the tropical sharks willed hundreds of horny bare feet slapped as men ran to their guns the gangways to the clew lines ready to reduce the main course and brail it up to the yard to reduce the risk of fire chain slings were rigged aloft to prevent spars from breaking loose and falling onto the packed mass of men who would be serving the guns boarding netting was slung over the decks and draped in unseamanly bights to protect against a surge of men over the rails should they lay closeaboard an enemy and to form a screen against blocks and tackles and bodies falling from aloft twomasted schooner railsford said studying the despatch boat with a telescope i believe we have the reach on her sir shell not get past us even as weatherly as she is that frigate is closing as well though treghues nodded lost in thought i make her a twentyeight do you concur aye sir railsford agreed swinging his glass to eye the other vessel which was coming on in the schooners wake in her support a little wider off the wind since she was a squarerigged ship and could not beat as closehauled as a foreandaft rigged ship they were on a general course far north of the british fleet anchorage almost on a bearing for the northern limb of frigate bay where the french army had landed two weeks before one point harder up treghues said lay her full and by as close to the wind as we may i shall want the wind gauge even should she turn away and run down back to her protector aye sir alan turned to the starboard rails and looked back towards the fleet anchorage there was another british frigate back there to the south trying to close up with them but she was nearly two miles off and could not be up with them for some time laid close to the wind desperate put up a brave picture her battle flags streaming from every mast her bow slamming into the bright tropical waters and flinging spray as high as the bow sprit wetting the foresails with an atomized cloud of salt water and the quarter wave hissed down her side and spread out like a brides train of white foam alan leaned over the bulwarks to see how the suction of the wave on her quarter exposed the weeded quickwork of her bottom that rarely saw daylight heeled over as she was against the wind spray flew about in buckets splashing as high as the quarterdeck and showering him with cooling droplets now and again damme this can be exciting on a pretty day like this alan beamed this is a glory makes up for all the humbug ahem monk coughed drawing alans attention back inboard and he walked back down to the wheel and binnacle with some difficulty on the slant of the deck his shoes slipping on freshsanded planking getting traction from the hot tar that had been pounded between the planks i hopes the hull meets yer satisfaction mister lewrie monk said the captain aint payin much attention now but juniors dont go ta windward if the captains on deckthats his by right a codsheads mistake mister monk i admit alan realized but youll be happy to know the coppering is fairly clean aye im sure the bosun un the carpenterll be pleased monk drawled pointedly now stay down ta looard iffen ya dont object aye aye sir alan joined sedge the other masters mate he was older in his very early twenties a loyalist who had joined the royal navy years earlier and who was thirsting for revenge against the rebels who had ruined his family he was a thatchhaired and ungainly fellow with a hard hatchet face and so far had been no more friendly than he had to be to get along in the mess or on duty think well get a chance to fight em alan asked na this schoonerll run to momma an mommall drive us off sedge opined gloomily shes a twentyeight you kin mark her if youve a mind now long nines for chase guns on her focsle ten carriage guns abeamtwelvepounders most likeand sixpounders on her quarterdeck only one more gun than us per broadside aye but twelves not our ninepounders sedge said as though alan had uttered some lunacy worthy of bedlam an two of our nines aftre short brass pieces just as like ta blow up in our faces sure as damnit wish we still had the smashers alan shrugged giving up on making pleasant conversation with a man who looked more at home tumbling out of a haywagon than on a quarterdeck then wed give em the fear of god and british artillery aye but ya left em at yorktown didn ya sedge sneered i told ya there she goes haulin her wind runnin for safety alan thought the comment was grossly unfair the smashers the shortranged carronade guns that threw such heavy shot had been commandeered by the army they had lost them not anyone in desperate and now two older longbarreled sixpounders graced the frigates focsle as chase guns but then he realized sedge was ever the graceless lout the despatch schooner had indeed fallen off the wind to wear to the westnorwest to take the trades on her larboard quarter running off to leeward and the protection of the french frigate ease your helm hands wear ship due north quartermaster the waisters and idlers sprang to the braces to ease them out to larboard angling the yards to allow desperate to take the wind on her starboard quarter so they could interpose between the schooner frigate and the shore maintaining the wind gauge advantage the french ship eased her helm as well by at least a point screening her weaker consort the two warships were now on two sides of a triangle one headed north and the other noreast if allowed to continue they would meet about two miles west of the port of basse terre the schooner passed close ahead of her escort then gybed to the opposite tack and began to reach souwest away from the anchorage with the wind abeam moments later the french man owar came about as well but instead of wearing downwind she threw herself up into the winds eye for a tack since it slowed her down so much to do so desperate began to close her more rapidly helm up a point quartermaster hands to the braces treghues bawled desperate turned a bit more westerly of due north taking the trades more directly up the stern a landsmans breeze shell pass astern o us mebbe a mile mile un a half off monk speculated calculating speed and approach angles in his head after the frenchman steadied on a course sousouwest to provide a mobile bulwark for the schooner about two miles off now treghues commented rubbing his chin thoughtfully once astern they could come about and try again with us north of them and to leeward theyd get into basse terre before we could beat south to interpose again he paced about at the windward rail from the nettings overlooking the waist to the wheel and back his fingers drumming on his ornately engraved and inlaid sword hilt hands wear ship mister railsford gybe her and lay her on the same tack as yonder frog if we shall not have her information i do not mean to allow her to pass that same information ashore for lack of effort on our part aye sir railsford shouted stations for wearing ship main clewgarnets and buntlines there bosun spanker brails weather main crojack and lee crojack braces alan cried at the afterguard men haul taut up mainsl and spanker railsford went on with a brass speaking trumpet to his lips clear away after bowlines brace in the afteryards up helm desperate fell off the wind more her stern crossing the eye of the wind slowly for she was no longer generating her own apparent wind but sailing no faster than the trades could blow clear away head bowlines lay the headyards square railsford directed as the wind came directly astern gauging the proper moment at which the foresails would no longer be blanketed by the courses and topsls headsheets to starboard main tack and sheet clear away there spanker outhaul and clear away the brails alan added as the wind drew forward on the larboard quarter within a breathless few minutes desperate was squared away on a new point of sail paralleling the frenchman to the sousouwest and just slightly ahead of her by a quartermile smartly done mister railsford treghues nodded in satisfaction at how professionally desperates crew did their sail drill thankee sir railsford beamed steady out bowlines haul taut weather trusses braces and lifts clear away on deck hes shivering his mizzen topsl sir alan pointed out as the french frigate tried to slow down possibly so she could pass astern of desperate and still get up to windward for basse terre hes a game little cock isnt he mister railsford treghues chuckled once he gets an idea into his pate he wont give it up back the mizzen topsl and haul in on the weather braces get the way off her realizing that he could not dodge about desperate the frenchman came up close to the wind and began to put on speed once more closehauled closing the range slightly oddly treghues let her approach to within threequarters of a mile just about the range of random shot before ordering desperate to haul in once more and maintain the distance pretty thing alan commented to monk after a quick sharing of a telescope with the sailing master the frigate had a dark brown oak hull with a jaunty royal blue gunwale stripe picked out in yellow top and bottom with much gilt trim about her bulwarks scrollwork and taffrail carvings of cherubs and dolphins and saints her figurehead could almost be discerned a sword and shieldwielding maiden surmounted by a gilt fleur de lis crown shes hard on the wind to close us sir alan noted aye but well draw ahead if she stays so monk growled there was a sudden puff of smoke from the frenchman that blossomed on her far bow then was blown away to a mist by the trades seconds later the sound of a shot could be heard a thin thumping noise she had fired one gun to leeward the traditional challenge to combat evidently the french captain was so angered at being stymied by desperates maneuverings that he wanted to vent some roundshot spleen upon her alan looked back at treghues and saw the glint in his eyes it would be galling to refuse combat especially for a ship and captain under a cloud for previous actions no matter how unfair the accusation was and alan could see treghues jaws working below the tan flesh of that narrow patrician face no he cant be thinking of it alan quailed we cant fight a twentyeight weve done enough to clear our hawse already mister gwynn fire the leeward chase gun treghues said brail up the main course mister railsford i think this stubborn frog needs a lesson in manners mr peck would you be so good as to assemble the band and have them give us something stirring the starboard sixpounder banged and the ships boys with the drums and fifes met in the waist just below the quarterdeck rails and began a tinny rendition of heart of oak as the waisters and topmen took in the large main course and brailed it aloft on the main yard the marine complement paraded back and forth on the lee gangway by the bulwark and the hammock stowage which would be their breastworks in the battle to come a few of them who were better shots than others went aloft into the tops with their muskets and their swivel guns the frenchman was closing fast close enough to make out her open gunports alan groaned to himself when he saw that there were eleven of them two bow chase guns sixpounders like sedge thought but only four quarterdeck guns and eleven bloody twelvepounders in each broadside battery not ten he noted with a sick feeling he wished he could squat down below the bulwarks of their own quarterdeck for with her angle of heel desperated decks were bared just enough to make everyone aft a prime target the french ship fired a solid broadside as all her guns lit off together and his flesh quivered as the shot moaned in at them at twelve hundred feet per second the range was just about five cables half a nautical mile black shot droned overhead slapping a hole in the spanker over where lewrie stood fired on the uproll upward from a slanting deck the lee ship had the advantage of range over desperate alans passion was artillery of all the skills he had been forced to learn in the navy and he knew desperated ninepounders could not be elevated high enough to reach as long as she was closehauled and heeled over finish that verse and then get below treghues told his band and the ships boys scattered after a final tootle to stow away their instruments and revert to their roles as powder monkeys who would fetch up the wooden or leather cylinders that held premeasured charges from the magazines or to assist the surgeon in the cockpit once the wounded worth saving were hauled below by older men ease her helm a point free mister railsford get the heel off her and well try our eye treghues snapped stand by mister gwynn aye aye sir the master gunner said in reply from the waist desperate came more upright by a few feet the bulwarks seeming to rise up like stage machinery with the french frigate just slightly aft of abeam and the range dropping to four cables quoins halfout gwynn instructed his guncaptains point yer guns ready i leave it to you mister gwynn treghues said cheerfully as you bear fire first the reloaded starboard chase gun then the first of the long ninepounders began to bark the firing rippling down the ships side one at a time as steady as a fired salute with gwynn pacing aft at the same pace as the ignitions shot erupted from the black iron muzzles in a rush of flame and sparks and thick clouds of spent powder and bright beautiful feathers of spray leapt up closeaboard the enemy frigates side as iron shot ricocheted to thud home below her gunports lovely shooting mister gwynn treghues commented load with doubleshot and hull him this time alans legs were quivering with excitement almost too tremulous to keep him erect as he stood by the wheel with the sailing master in previous actions he had been a midshipman on the gun deck too busy supervising the loading firing and running out too intent on gunnery to think much about being afraid about being maimed or killed lost in the heat of the moment but as a masters mate his main role was to act as a sitting duck of no mean seniority on the bare quarterdeck which would be the prime target of the french after they got within musketshot another broadside from the french a positive avalanche of iron and desperate shrieked in oaken agony as things let go aloft the mizzen royal andtgallant yards were smashed by barshot or chainshot and the pieces rained down into the overhead nettings a marine and a topman from the mizzen topsl thumped onto the nettings like bloody steers the marine minus both legs at the crotch and spraying a scarlet shower on the deck firing high as usual treghues noted with a frown of disapproval when shall they learn desperates guns were thundering once more slamming fourinch ninepounder iron balls into the french ship this time concentrated twixt wind and water right into her hull planks were shattered and nibbles were taken out of her upperworks bulwarks scattering the enemy marines who had been gathered for a musket volley or two but being bigger and heavier enough to handle twelvepounder guns it would take a lot of nibbling to do her damage for her scantlings were thicker her beams and crosspieces were heavier and stronger youve made your point you damned fool alan grumbled aloud under the sound of the cannonading now get a way on and get us out of here honor is redeemed and all that shit but treghues was in nautical paradise pacing back and forth in a maniacal joy oblivious to the blood trails on the quarterdeck or the hurt desperate had suffered aloft for what were bout ta receive monk whispered the old saw as the frenchmans side lit up like red signal fuses seen through a thick fog a fog of powder smoke that rolled down from desperate to the foe the smoke seemed to glow and then the world was hammered into matchwood the starboard bulwark by the ladder leading below to the waist was flung into ruin and a cloud of oak splinters flicked through the air like startled sparrows men were screaming like frightened horses and desperate staggered as heavy shot burst through her sides the deck below lewries feet jumped almost throwing him to his knees eighteens if theys a pound monk managed to say grabbing onto the binnacle and traverse board table to stay erect no more than twelvepounders surely mister monk alan said in a shaky voice trying to maintain that maddening sang froid demanded of a professional sea officer felt like eighteens anyway monk spat as the smoke began to rag away alan could see that the enemy was now on a parallel course just two cables off she would not get closer but then he realized she didnt have to for she could lay out there a fifth of a nautical mile away and shoot desperate to lace unless they did something soon helm up quartermaster treghues yelled through the din as the guns belched fire again bear down on her two loblolly boys stirred the savaged body of a petty officer by the tornup starboard gangway they shrugged and rolled the body to the hoie in the bulwarks aid tipped the corpse over the vide that was mister weems alan burst out in shock aye poor bastard monk agreed therell be an openin fer a new bosuns mate tamorra a screaming waister was picked up on a carrying board and taken below to the cockpit surgery as they watched there was nothing to be done with the dead or the hopelessly wounded but to get them out of sight and out from under foot words could be said later from the prayer book more shot screamed in and desperate reeled with its impact more screams from the waist a puff of smoke from the nettings that set hammocks writhing like a box of worms as a roundshot scattered them a marine keened and fell from the gangway clutching his belly dull flames licked around the torn canvas from a small explosion and men from the larboard side rushed to pour water on the fire before it could take hold and eat their ship one cables range now two hundred yards alan went forward to the quarterdeck rail to look down into the waist a larboard gun had been overturned and its crew decimated as he watched the loblolly boys dragged another screaming unfortunate to the midships hatch a man as quilled with jagged wood splinters as a hedgehog the dead marine was being passed out a larboard gunport and someone was retching bile as he used a powder scoop to shovel up the mans spilled intestines the gun crews labored away with their scarves around their ears to save their hearing intent on their artillery burney up by the focsle and avery in the waist were pacing among their men shoving them to their places and speeding them along then the guns were barking and recoiling back against their breeching ropes hot enough now to leap from the deck instead of rolling backwards on their small trucks another broadside from the french and this one felt like an earthquake alan clung to the hammocknettings as the ship felt as if she had been slammed to a halt something whined past his head and the hammocks before him punched him in the crotch he looked down as he was bent over by the pain and saw a chunk of the bulwark nearly three inches across and a foot long sticking from the far side of the barrier bloody christ he yelped feeling his crotch in fear he had been debollocked and was relieved to feel that his weddingtackle was stillthere the deck continued to tremble with each strike and there was a lot of screaming from back aft as he winced with his pain lewrie stir yourself treghues bellowed pointing behind him to the wheel where men lay torn and bleeding alan limped aft bent over mr monk was propped up by the binnacle with sedge bending down over him the rotund sailing master had been struck in the leg with a grapeshot ball a full ounce of lead that had almost ripped his limb off above the knee and was now hanging by a few tattered sinews sedge was seizing a piece of smallstuff about the upper thigh to staunch the copious spurting of blood and lewrie knelt to aid him sedge yave more experience do ya take charge monk gasped from a pasty white face sheened with shocksweat aye i shall mister monk sedge promised as the surgeons assistants rushed to his side with a carrying board at least dorne wont have ta saw much to take this bugger monk tried to jest too freshly wounded to feel much pain yet the loblolly boys rolled him onto the board strapped him down and made off with him by the larboard ladder and monk began to moan as the pain hit him hurry me below damn yer blood he cried out spare quartermaster to the wheel sedge barked hot work aint it lewrie gods teeth yes alan concurred sedge laughed and strode away to assist toliver the bosuns mate in ordering the afterguard into shape once more leaving lewrie by the wheel with two new whiteeyed quartermasters who flinched every time something whined nearby their feet slipping in the blood trails of their predecessors watch your helm alan told them being careful to station himself to windward using them and the wheel drum as a shield the guns were now firing as fast as the frightened and weary crews could load and run out all order lost in the maelstrom of battle every few seconds there was discharge followed by one from their foe lieutenant peck and his marines were now firing by squads from the rail and the masts of the french frigate were towering alongside nearly as high as desperated own less than half a cable off perhaps sixty yards and adequate musketshot to confirm it a volley of balls hit the quarterdeck one warbling off the rim of the compass bowl another raising a large splinter from the deck before alans feet desperate reeled again like a gutpunched boxer mister lewrie come here railsford yelled through a speaking trumpet go forrud into the waist and take charge aye sir alan said dashing to his side gwynn is down railsford snarled shoving him to the larboard ladder go no time to chat about it keep the guns firing alan hammered down the ladder to the waist the master gunner mr gwynn was stretched out on the deck to larboard his shirt and waistcoat sodden with blood and flecks of bloody spume on his lips as he tried to breathe god save me alan whispered then mastered himself avery aye sir a whitefaced david avery asked trotting aft ill take charge go aft and tend the gunners there is burney still alive aye sir good quartergunners alan bawled glad to have something concrete to do pace your damned guncaptains ordered firing alan watched as the senior quartergunners passed among their charges and stilled their individual efforts making them work in unison once more loading and touching off together he bent down to peer out a gunport at the enemy direct these guns at the same aiming point here base of the mainmast is your target punch a hole clean through her burney do you aim at the base of their foremast wait for it ya stupid get prime your guns point your guns on the uproll fire three at a time the guns barked and leaped backwards first burneys charges then alans then the guns below the quarterdeck in the cabins aft better alan snapped he strode aft to look at the hands as they swabbed out and began to load gwynn gave a mournful groan as one of the men did him the merciful favor of smacking him on the head with a heavy mallet to knock him unconscious he was too badly hurt to live and the surgeons could do nothing with such a savage chest wound out cold and knowing nothing of the indignity he was passed out through a larboard gunport where he splashed into the sea to drown quickly more french iron hammered into them and alan fell to the deck as a rammer man staggered into him a covey of splinters took flight like passing quail over his head and his head rang with the shock wave of a concussion somewhere the rammer man was sprawled across his lap with his back flayed open to the spine and alan gave it a long thought before shoving him off and getting back to his feet damned if it had not felt rather safe flat on his back out of the line of fire spare man from the larboard battery here alan directed and a rabbity man darted forward to scoop up the discarded rammer and take his place in the starboard battery one of the new midshipmen the youngest and stupidest tugged at his coat tails and he turned to look down at the child mister railsford says prepare the larboard battery as were were the boy fumbled his teeth chattering in fear were ready to what damn your thin blood alan barked like an exasperated commission officer it felt damned good to yell at the boy instead of musing on his own quaking were to come about and rake her sir the boy finished larboard quartergunners to me when they had gathered round he told them to ready their pieces doubleshotted with grape for good measure wem short sir a grizzled older man told him then fetch the hands from the starboard chase gun alan told him that sixpounder is only making them sneeze run out as you are ready and get those ports open now starboard battery load and stand by for broadsides ware below oh jesus someone cringed as the repaired main yard came down with a crash across the crossdeck beams where the boats usually nestled so much fer fixin that fucker a quartergunner spat drooling tobacco juice from a massive wad in his cheek with a loud creak the mizzen topsl was thrown aback to slow their ship down alan bent down to peer out a gunport and saw that the frogs were drawing ahead rapidly on the uproll fire at such close range even their light ninepounder shot could do harm to a frigate with heavier scantlings and the broadside brought a groan of racked timber from the french ship as she was struck hard nettings and bulwarks flew and screams sounded from french throats this time alan could feel when desperated helm was put hard up to windward even without looking at the waisters on the riddled gangways as they flung themselves on the braces to wear ship take your time and reload the starboard guns sponge out your guns overhaul that tackle there or youll get mashed like a pasty alan called mister burney do you take charge of readying the battery larboard guns stand by the ship swayed like a drunkard as she wore downwind and the yards and masts of the french ship swung across the bow with the tip of desperates bowsprit barely clearing her mizzen shrouds and taffrail lanterns we may only get one chance at this so make your shots count alan warned his larboard gunners dont aim too high and blow holes in her quarterdeck lets put roundshot and grape down the full length of her gun deck just like a good game of bowls tear her stern out shake her mizzen to shreds willing or not alan had to climb up onto the larboard gangway to judge the best moment his hanger tangling between his shins they would pass the frenchmans stern at close pistolshot damme if we might win this yet alan thought as he drew his lovely gift hanger and let the pristine blade flash silver in the sun ready as you bear fire the larboard chase gun went off and its load of doubleshot and grape gouged the taffrail open shattering the carved cherubs dolphins and saints into gilt tatters strewing six french naval infantry down like cornstalks then the ninepounders began to discharge and the stern windows the larboard quartergallery and the transom were riddled in a flurry of broken planking the rudder twitched back and forth and the mizzen mast shivered as it was struck screams from the french ship could be heard as her gun crews were mown down by the shot passing down the length of her decks thats the way desperates alan howled in triumph waving his sword over his head in derision at the french he could see on the poop and quarterdeck swivels barked from the tops and the marine sharpshooters let fly peck and his squads formed up to larboard and began to volley into her sponge out overhaul your tackle charge guns desperate put her helm down and began to swing back onto the wind to rake the frenchmans stern with the other battery but the frigate bearing the name capricieuse on her torn gilt sternplacque tried to bear up as well blocking their way avast railsford screamed helm hard up lewrie ready to rake her again with the larboard battery quicker to return to her original course desperate wavered then got herself under control capricieuse tried to sag down off the wind with her but desperate was already to leeward the angle was acute but it would be a stern rake right up through the shattered wood at least into her after batteries wait for the transom wait for the transom alan screamed in glee as he capered up and down the gangway looking down on his gun crews sweating men hauled on tackles to heave the heavy guns up the slightly canted deck priming quills were inserted crows and levers were shouldered and muscles strained near to rupture to shift the aim of the barrels fists were raised in the air as guncaptains signaled their readiness a few shots were fired by the french from their own larboard side before desperate passed out of their gunarcs as you bear fire one at a time the guns roared out their challenge and spat their tongues of flame through the smoke wood on the larboard quarter was chewed up the rudder twitched again as a ball smacked into the transom post the mizzen swayed and jerked and alan could see one ball carom off an interior beam with a puff of smoke and dust and paint to go ricocheting down the length of the gun deck the after guns belched fire then desperate was staggered once more as though she had just been struck hard herself but alan could not see one french gun that could bear to do that damage capricieuse sagged down off the wind fully presenting her stern to desperate trying to bring her unused starboard battery into action and there was no movement from aft to shift their ships course alan scrambled back down to the gun deck off the gangway where it would be safer to suffer what they were about to get in retribution got a gun burst aft sir a runner told him one o them brass nines blew a hole right up through the deckhead tell avery to deal with it alan shrugged intent on his men load with doubleshot run out thas just it sir mister averys bad hurt an the quartergunners dead the man told him oh shit hogan leave the chase gun and go aft youre a quartergunner now alan chilled he grabbed hogan as he trotted by and held him close for a moment averys been hurt get word to me on how he is aye ill do that sir ports is openin someone warned gun crews lay down alan yelped if they were struck while the men were still on their feet it would be a slaughter a second later the broadside from the fresh battery struck them and wood and iron howled in agony and the deck shuddered beneath them alan stuck his head up and looked around coughing on smoke and engrained dust up and at em desperates come on larboard he called rising prime your guns point on the uproll fire a ragged cheer arose as the tortured mizzenmast of the french frigate gave a final shudder and toppled forward chopped to flinders below the deck by those stern rakes it fell into component pieces topmast dropping straight down as the lower mast fell forward and the tgallant and royal masts and spars spiraled about to drape themselves over the main topmast dragging it sideways in a tangle of rope and canvas damme will you look at that alan hooted just bloody beautiful keep it up lads and well have the bastard the aged carpenter came scrambling up from below decks past the parade of powder monkeys shoving them out of the way in his haste to get to the quarterdeck and alan noted that chips was soaking wet from midthigh down which made him suddenly wonder if desperate would stay afloat long enough to actually have the bastard or whether the bastard damaged as the french frigate was would end up having them the youngest midshipman was back suddenly tugging on alans coat once more his face streaked with soot and powder stains the tracks of tears carved into the grime please mister lewrie sir the captain presents his respects and requests could you spare half a dozen hands to assist the carpenter hulled and leaking are we alan asked close so the hands would not hear sinking sir the boy quailed but soft enough for discretion gods balls alan breathed what next i wonder maple aye sir the focsle gunner answered breaking free of the larboard battery select five hands who arent doing us much good at the moment and assist the ships carpenter if you would be so kind alan directed trying to remain calm but it didnt fool maple who rolled his eyes in alarm and glanced upward at the crossdeck beams where the boats most definitely werent any longer other than flotsam from a wreck the boats were the only lifesaving devices available oh shit mister lewrie sir maple sighed dashing off if id stayed in london id have become a wealthy pimp by now alan speculated sourly i cant even bloody swim there was a volley of musketry of such volume and intensity that only a company of infantry could have made it a larboard waister came tumbling down from the forebraces to sprawl across the breech of a gun his face shot away and his brains oozing and sizzling on the hot metal alan ducked to look out a gunport once more capricieuse was closeaboard not fifty yards off her bulwarks lined with men as though her last chance was to board desperate and take her in a hot handtohand action quoins out alan yelled to his gunners load grape and canister atop ball cease fire and stand by for a broadside doubleshotted zurr a guncaptain called back worm em out of there and reduce your powder charges ill not have another burst barrel got grape but no canister another shouted fuck it shoot out your loads alan thundered at the same time grabbing the nearest powder monkey on his way below with an empty leather cylinder tell mister tulley in the magazine i need grape and canister and reduced charges im going to tripleshot the guns that brought tulley up from below in a rush his ginger hair sticking up in all directions and his sunburned complexion glowing at the danger to his precious artillery damme sir youll burst my barrels wheres the master gunner ill see him and hes dead and gone mister tulley alan said brutally now we have a frog frigate at pistolshot and i want roundshot grape and canister with reduced charges or were boarded and taken so what are you going to do to help me excess loaders from the starboard battery fetch canister the burly gunners mate said his face paling with shock at hearing of his seniors demise and the straits they were in boys tell the yeoman of the powder room to issue reduced charges my god mister lewrie my merciful god the sound of cannon fire had ceased either the french had stripped their gun deck of men for a boarding party or they were also loading a massive broadside and were waiting for the proper time to fire it into desperate to shatter resistance just before they came surging over the rails lets go lets go alan prodded as the caseshot and grape bags came up along with the halfsize saluting charges with so much ironmongery crammed into the muzzles a larger powder measure would truly burst the barrels and at such close range a smaller amount of powder would be preferable anyway low velocity shot did not shoot through scantlings clean but bulged and ravaged them producing more splinters that ripped men apart creating more havoc the midshipman was back this time not so polite the captain wants to know what the deuce youre playing at mister lewrie sir the boy wailed they are close aboard and mister railsford demands you fire into them before they grapple to us tripleshotted broadside go tell them alan growled pacing past the boy as if he wasnt there go get aft you minnikin charge yer guns shot yer guns roundshot then grape then caseshot tulley was directing with the voice of a bawling steer his face its usual red flush once more mister lewrie the second young midshipman yelled dashing to his side holy hell will you stop pestering me mister railsford orders you prepare to repel boarders run out tulley screeched and the hands tailed on the tackles to draw their pieces across the deck with the rumble of a cattle stampede as the small wooden wheels of the trucks squealed and drummed guncaptains to remain tacklemen and loaders take arms and prepare to repel boarders alan cried tulley give em the broadside and then bring your hands to join me lets go men prick yer cartridges prime yer guns tulley droned on as the excess hands dug into the weapons tubs for cutlasses and boarding axes stripped the pikes from the beckets around the bases of the masts and flung open the arms chests for heavy and usually inaccurate pistols once more alan was at a disadvantage for he did not have any of his pistols with him he took a tomahawksized boarding axe for his offhand and stuck it into his breeches unwilling to try his luck with a sea pattern pistol again up to the gangway quickly now take yer aim stand by tulley called as they scrambled up to the larboard bulwark behind the marines who were still volleying into the foe sedge dashed past him on his way forward to join the youthful burney to protect the focsle alan looked back to see railsford bringing all the afterguard and mizzen mast crew to the break of the quarterdeck to defend the after portion of the ship musket bayonets glinted dully from those hands who had gotten a chance to break out the longarms pike heads bristled like medieval infantry ranks and cutlasses fanned the air as men loosened their arms for the bloody work to come the french lined their own rails stripedjerseyed sailors and men in check shirts much like british seamen naval infantry in blue coats with red facings with here and there an officer in blue coat edged with gold oakleaf lace and epaulettes with red waistcoats fire tulley finally shouted and everyone ducked below the bulwarks and nettings as the guns erupted so loudly avoiding the rush of hot gases and the clouds of smoke and the whining ricocheting bits of grapeshot and canisters of musket balls as each piece was turned into a scattergun alan stood back up just in time to see railsford leaping onto the after bulwarks and waving his smallsword in the air boarders he screamed away boarders with a lusty roar desperates crew went up onto the bulwarks themselves grapnels had been thrown by the french and british implements flew across to complete lashing the hulls together nettings came down as they surged across leaping the churning millrace of white water between the ships there wasnt much opposition that final broadside fired at the highest angle of a naval carriage gun had shattered the upperworks of capricieuse ripping the rails to knee height and scything boarders into mangled meat alan landed atop the torso of a french marine who had lost belly and intestines his feet slipping in entrails and excrement as he staggered to the inner side of the riddled gangway and fetched up on the rope railing overlooking the waist of the gun deck a weak volley of bullets fanned the air and he jerked his head back quickly there was resistance forward but sedge and lieutenant peck of the marines were dealing with that there was a large party of marines on the frigates quarterdeck but nothing much between the waist having been stripped of men and those men mostly were now dead or dying the few still on their feet tossing down their weapons and raising their hands in surrender too shocked by the sudden carnage and boarding to wish to continue fighting take the larboard gangway alan shouted pointing with his hanger at a knot of men still armed on the other side of the ship he dashed out onto one of the wide crossdeck beams that spanned the waist and reached the far side a man confronted him with a cutlass but before he could engage a hole sprang up in his chest and he tumbled to the deck alan whirled to engage a second but a boarding axe sprouted from that mans shoulder thrown by one of his men and that foe fell down as well screaming in agony the rest threw up their hands quickly and congregated into a submissive knot by the main chains stap me that wuz easy a marine corporal said at alans side jus bout wot yed expect from frogs ah reckon sir disarm the buggers before they get their wits back corporal alan shrugged sheathing his still unbloodied sword herd em up forward with that other lot and dont forget to pat em down for knives and such the corporals eyes lit up at that order for it would be a good excuse to loot the prisoners of what little value they carried on their persons regulations be damned ah spects yere right sir ahll atten ta that direckly alan strode aft to the quarterdeck where railsford seemed to be in complete charge the first lieutenant had a bloody gash on his head from which gore still oozed but his blade was properly slimed with the lifes blood of a foe and his face was split open in a magnificent and triumphant grin there were french dead laying about like rabbits underfoot all over the quarterdeck over which he paced unconcernedly i give you joy of this day mister lewrie he shouted and to you sir alan replied studiously trying to avoid the sight of so many men reduced to bloody offal god what a victory railsford went on an old tub such as desperate taking a th rate with twentyeight guns hows your french bloody awful sir alan told him beginning to realize just what an improbable thing they had just pulled off whod a thought such a thing possible railsford enthused at some length of course yon thirtytwo helped them make up their mind to strike but ours is the principal effort and theres glory enough to share alan noted a british frigate of thirtytwo guns falling downwind to them rapidly from the main anchorage possibly the ship he had spotted before fire had been exchanged lashed as she was to desperate capricieuse would have been made a prize even if she had emerged victorious over their puny efforts here i cant make out a word this queernabs is trying to say not half of it anyway railsford said gesturing casually with his sword to a knot of french officers and a suitably senior man jumped back with a start as the tip of that bloody blade got within scratching distance of his nose i thought you might help interpret pardon a mois monsieurs parle vous langlais he asked hopefully doffing his hat to the startled senior officer who seemed to be in command but that worthy merely pinched his nostrils and went into a positive flood of rapid frog and stepped back snapping his fingers to summon a junior officer monsieurs permittezvous ici ltroisiиme lieutenant de marine royale ow you say three officeur i ave en peu english the junior officer volunteered bloody good railsford beamed charles auguste baron de crillart а votre servis notre capitaine la frйgate capricieuse jules marquis de rosset the frenchman handled the introductions with all of them bowing in congй and doffing their cocked hats my capitaine e say e is ave tres honneur to be striking to you monsieurs in sign of their victory a blue ensign was hoisted on a mainmast signal halyard with the white and gold bourbon banner displayed below it and the crews of both british ships raised a great cheer the french captain screwed his face up into a grimace worthy of a halffrozen mastiff and undipped his smallsword from his belt frog to hand it over with a polished gesture with de crillart translating as best he could arrangements were made for quartering of prisoners the care of the many french wounded and the christian disposal of the dead railsford had to protest that their captain should not have to surrender his sword since he had put up such a spirited resistance and after more florid speeches this privilege was extended to the surviving commission officers as well de rosset then bowed his way to the ladders leading to his quarters as though leaving the presence of royalty where one never gave the monarch the sight of a human back and went below probably to see what he had been looted of while honor was being satisfied thank god thats over railsford said softly as they turned to go back aboard desperate the prize isnt that damaged but our poor ship was knocked about pretty badly get me a report from the carpenter and then see whos left in charge of the various departments aye aye sir desperate had indeed been knocked about she looked as though she had been eaten at by giant rats her bulwarks jagged and her decks ruptured and sprung nettings rigging and sails hung about her like a funeral shroud and those spars and sails still aloft had been shot through so completely a brisk breeze would have brought them down in a total ruin the sound of chainpumps clanking made a mournful tempo as streams of floodwater gushed from her men picked about her decks to find the wounded or the dead and the sailmaker and his crew were already at work on the quarterdeck sewing up shrouds for burials a quick trip below into the holds assured alan that their ship would not sink though the repairs and patches had not stopped the leaks but had only slowed them to a manageable inflow well be at the pumps all the way ta antigua sir but weve got a chance iffen we could fother a patch er two chips told him that seemed good encouragement which lasted only until lewrie got to the surgery on the lower decks and dorne gave him the bad news mister monk has passed over dorne began in between suffering seamen as the leather cover over the midshipmens chests was sluiced clean of blood and torn flesh with a bucket of seawater the loss of blood was too great im afraid and our captain was struck down in his moment of greatest triumph as well dead alan asked ready to spew at the sights and smells and sounds of the surgery could we be lucky enough to be rid of him he thought no praise a merciful god merely splintered and if suppuration does not set in he stands a fair chance for recovery hoist him up here dorne directed as a moaning body was laid out on the table that arm shall have to come off who is he one of ours a french seaman i believe cheatham the youngish purser informed him after looking at the pile of clothing on the deck that had been cut off the unfortunate cheatham took a swig of rum from a cup to steady his own nerves then offered it to the frenchmans lips for him to suck on as an anodyne wondered where he was alan muttered shivering with chill at the sight of the mans rivened arm and the instruments that dorne was removing from a bucket of bloody water for reuse who treghues alan said non non mon dieu non the frenchman screamed as the weary loblolly boys took hold of him to keep him still and dorne lifted up that arm and quickly flensed the flesh away above the major wounds not five inches below the shoulder cauterizing irons sizzled to stop the flow of blood from opened arteries and veins and the air was putrid with the reek of scorched flesh and the savage rasp of a bone saw oh jesus alan said turning away ready to faint ready to cast his accounts on the slimy deck fifteen seconds i make it dorne grunted pleased with himself as the amputated limb dropped to the deck it is a point of pleasure to my professional skills that i never cause undue suffering by taking long once a course of action has been found sutures quickly now while he is unconscious hogan more cotton bast for this alan staggered away from the table almost tripping on the legs of the many wounded who groaned and cried out in agony we win sor someone asked aye yes we did alan nodded almost unable to speak tis judkin sir is the captain arright the captains servant asked his face almost muffled with bast and bandages with only part of his mouth free i am told he shall live judkin ats right good sir es a good master ta me ere mister lewrie tis mister avery over here judkin piped full of good cheer mister avery sir mister lewries come acallin on ya avery had been stripped bare and covered with a scrap of sail and what flesh was exposed had been scorched by the explosion of that burst gun cooked the color of a welldone steak oozing red oh jesus alan reiterated kneeling down by his friend as david avery gasped air through his open mouth david hear me avery seemed to be trying to whisper his lips moved but no words could be made out his eyes opened for a moment bloodshot as cherries floating in coal sludge staring blankly at the deckhead david tis alan lewrie said louder bending down near the young mans ear avery only closed his eyes and gave no sign of awareness but continued to breathe as though each one would be his last his body was shivering as though the touch of air on that overheated flesh was excruciating do you want anything david water there was no response just the uneven heaving of that charred chest alan stood back up almost cracking his head on a deck beam in his haste to flee the compartment tears flowing down his face too many people he had come to like had just died too many of the warrants and mates he had dealt with on a daily basis for nearly a year in desperate so that it felt much like the grief a sole survivor would feel of a red indian massacre ah lewrie sedge called out as he spotted him on deck i was wondering where youd got to mister coke needs help with juryrigging the mizzen mast well get with it weve not time to moon about chapter chapter peaceful night in frigate bay with a light breeze flowing over the decks bringing cooling relief to crowded mess areas through windscoops and ventilators lanterns burned at the taffrail binnacle and focsle belfry and worklanterns glowed as the last of the major hurts to desperate were repaired saws rasped hammers and mallets thudded now and again as something was tamped home in the torn deck or bulwarks commander treghues was propped up by a mound of pillows in his bedbox hung from the overhead below his repeating compass his midriff was banded about snugly with white gauze and bast as was his left arm and shoulder beyond the hingedopen stern windows in the transom the riding lights of the fleet could be seen and closeaboard the lights of their prize the twentyeightgunned th rate capricieuse freeling had been borrowed from the midshipmens mess to tend to the captains needs serving him a cup of wine laced with his favorite medication and to serve glasses of wine to the assembled officers and senior warrants alan nodded over his glass wishing he could lay his head down on the fine mahogany desk and go to sleep on the spot as lieutenant railsford droned on through a list of repairs still necessary to both their own ship and the captured frigate admiral hoods flagcaptain has assured me he shall be taking charge of those prisoners ablebodied enough to cause mischief to us sir railsford concluded doctor dorne has replenished his medical supplies well enough to tend to the wounded both ours and theirs and a surgeons assistant shall be coming inboard at first light to aid very good treghues said softly too sore to take a deep breath or reply with his usual force doctor dorne how many of our men show a fair chance for recovery about eighteen sir there are nine that i can do little for limited as we are should we get them to hospital one or two may yet be saved dorne replied heavily looking as exhausted as a man could and still draw breath himself our casualties mister railsford treghues asked mister monk sir railsford said referring to a quick tally of the dead and badly wounded mister weems the master gunner mister gwynn midshipman avery murray the after quartergunner sergeant mcgregor of the marines corporal smart tate the senior quartermaster railsford intoned going through the long list altogether they had lost eleven dead and twentyseven wounded with many of the dead from the senior warrants and department heads damned near a quarter of the crew and marines alan sighed to himself tipping back his glass of celebratory claret without tasting it he held out the glass for freeling to refill and the lugubrious lout sprang to do his bidding now that he had a chance to strike as servant to a victorious captain instead of a jumpedup midshipman david had died just about an hour after alan had gone back on deck never regaining consciousness which dr dorne assured him was a blessing for they could not salve his worst burns without bringing away bits of charred flesh on the bandages mister sedge is more senior i believe treghues asked he was appointed acting sailing master by poor mister monk himself i recall aye sir railsford agreed and sedge sat up more erect to preen as his name was mentioned then we shall honor mister monks dying request mister sedge you are acting sailing master of desperate thankee kindly sir sedge beamed mister tully to be advanced to take gwynns place and the yeoman of the powder room advanced to gunners mate treghues went on his mind wonderfully clear for all the claret he had put aboard and his eyes shrunk to pinpoints by the drug a deserving quartergunner for yeoman of the powder room hogan focsle chasegunner sir alan heard himself suggest i sent him aft to clear away the raffle after that brass gun burst and he did good service aye a good report make it so mister railsford aye sir railsford assented borrowing quill and ink to make corrections in his quarterbills promote whom you think best into the other positions and give me their names for my report to admiral hood treghues said along with those discharged dead how many men shall we need for the prize a dozen hands sir railsford reckoned and id suggest a file of marines under a corporal to keep an eye on the senior frogs and the wounded who may try to retake her once shes away from under barfleurs guns make it eighteen hands and i shall be grateful to you mister peck if you could supply ten marines under a corporal into her aye sir peck agreed favoring his splinted and wrapped arm bless me but were a damaged lot this evening treghues said with an attempt at good cheer prizemaster well i could go into her sir railsford replied shyly if he were to take capricieuse into port he could parley the fame and the glory into a promotion to commander himself yet badly as he wanted it he had to act modest and shrug off his own suggestion no i shall need you here in temporary command unless dorne is playing the fool about my hurts you should not attempt to rise from that bunk for at least a week sir dorne warned him until we know there is no lasting harm from the splinters i withdrew treghues winced at the remembrance of how he had been quilled with wood and the agony of their extraction some of them acting like barbed arrowheads that had torn more flesh as they came out then i shall rest on my laurels until allowed to rise the captain said with a small grin laurels indeed he had taken a more powerful ship in bloody combat with a casualty list sufficiently impressive to awe the admiralty and the mob at home men had been knighted for less captain pearson of serapis had been knighted for losing to the rebel john paul jones after a splendid threeagainstone defense mister lewrie treghues said turning his head to gaze upon him in lieutenant railsfords stead i shall appoint you into the prize and i think the post of acting lieutenant would not be out of order after todays gallantry ah alan could only gawp in surprise and weariness damme but dont he shower his favorites with blessings he thought treghues positively glowed at him you did good service today with the guns and in carrying the boarding of our prize and i mind youve been prizemaster before after that fight off st croix see you shall have those paroled french officers aboard and i doubt they would stand for being guarded by a masters mate that captain of theirs probably would be insulted with anything less than an earl for his gaoler everyone chuckled appreciatively at treghues wit and he had a small laugh himself before a cough interrupted him and forced him to sit still until it had passed you shall take a care not to lose my prize though young sir treghues cautioned with only a hint of humor and alan knew if he did he would be hung from a yardarm in tar and chains until his bones fell apart they sailed on the last day of january passing noithabout st kitts and to windward of the prowling but ineffective french fleet desperate repaired enough to accompany them as escort and surety that capricieuse would make antigua without mischief the weather was balmy and the trades steady and a carpenters mate could have commanded the prize alan sneered to himself with the quarterdeck people and the marines armed to the teeth and desperates guns not half a mile off at any time the french gave them no trouble captain de rosset sulked in the officers wardroom along with this surviving officers and senior warrants and alan made free with the captains quarters as prizemaster lolling on fine cotton sheets and tippling the best wines and brandies he had tasted since he had left london two years before de crillart proved a cheerful companion once he had given his parolehe was only a year older than alan but a droll wit not given to too much sobriety about life in general and unimpressed by life in the french royal navy as well his family did not have connections good enough to gain him a commission in a good cavalry regiment so the navy was for him though most people in france looked down on that service as second to its magnificent army minor nobility or not the de crillarts were a genteelly impoverished lot and his purse had not run to the fineries of his marquiscaptain which while on passage he savored as much as alan did as his gaolers guest one rather sodden night in the privacy of the cabins alan and de crillart dined together with lewries hammockman cony serving as waiter to is brittaneec majesty george the tird de crillart proposed raising his glass on high which pronunciation of third sent lewrie reeling with mirth e ees votre roy what ees so foony de crillart asked turd you said alan explained between titters nombre trois in english is third not turd turd is merde dog merde merde dchien merde dchat merde dhomme oh pardon de crillart gasped as it hit him mon dieu we call him farmer george anyway alan went on wants to be thought of as a country squire when he cant even speak bloody english himself half the time vot gott in himmel eh vot to is britanneec majesty george the th third the frenchman managed this time they drained their glasses seated the king alan echoed and to your king to his most catholic majesty dat ees the espagnole lewrie well to louis whats his number then then de crillart had to propose a toast to treghues whose name he didnt even attempt to butcher and alan countered with one to his own captain marquis de rosset which drew a flash of anger from his supper guest before the young man drained his glass in a gulp not too fond of him are you alan surmised e ees the buffoon eh de crillart grimaced a fool so is ours alan confided leaning over the table alan explained how treghues had been addled by a rammer cut at to relieve pressure on his brain and what odd medicine he was taking he also told of the escape from yorktown and what the rest of the navy had thought of that you were in chesapeake de crillart gasped happily moi aussi une fregate in york reever formidable capricieuse aussi le potence to keep you in nestce pas sonofabitch really alan barked cony he was there oh notre capitaine very anger you escape after e swear no one get out and how tres ironique we fight at last capitaine de rosset e e ave great anger to pass you i zink e ave need to be victorieuse after york reever de crillart shrugged ours too alan agreed my god charles look here if we had had a different captain wed never have needed to have fought you just kept you from getting into basse terre with that schooner treghues needed a victory to regain his bloody reputation and de rosset need le combat to avenge ees criteecs merde eef any ozzer capitaine ave capricieuse we sail avec no challenge de crillart realized so many bon hommes are le mort for zees touchy bastards alan supplied oui toochy bastards after that mutual admission their friendship grew firm until by the time desperate and her prize were under the guns of the hill forts in the outer roads of english harbor he was sorry to see the fellow have to go they parted with many cries of bonne chance and promises to keep in touch and then the world settled down to a long string of boredom once more alan stayed aboard capricieuse for weeks as prizemaster sir george sinclair was out with some of his inshore squadron so only prize court officials and the dockyard superintendent were available to upset their lives some more repairs were made with little help with spares from the dockyard unless heavy bribes were offered but there were too few hands from shore to take over charge of her as she was laid up inordinary awaiting her fate desperate swung at her anchors too repaired as well as could be managed under the circumstances her burst gun replaced but with no orders to either join sir george their commodore or return to st kitts alan was loafing under the quarterdeck awnings tasting the last of his morning tea when a frigate came in from st kitts noisily saluting the flag and the forts hold up on inspection for a moment alan ordered tell the corporal to let his men stand easy while i read her hoists laboriously in the limited code flags the arriving frigate spelled out the baleful news that the fort on brimstone hill had fallen and the french now owned the island hood and the fleet would be arriving late in the afternoon after abandoning the anchorage during the preceding night and getting clean away leaving de grasse befuddled so thats all we get sir the senior quartermaster asked him as alan put the glass away into the binnacle rack no more ships took if there were we werent in sight to share the prizemoney any allied ship within spyglass distance even if all the view she had was topsis above the horizon could claim shares in any action that resulted in prizemoney so taking capricieuse within sight of all the lineofbattle ships in hoods fleet wouldnt provide enough silver per survivor to make a decent meal in a threepenny ordinary even counting the head money bonus per man in the crew of the prize might get a plug o baccy at best sir the quartermaster spat in disgust and alan knew it was going to be a grueling inspection that the quartermaster was about to visit on his small crew we may only hope for advancement from this alan comforted hoping mere was indeed advancement he had gotten used to having that large frigate under his sole control of being an acting lieutenant even for so short a period politics alan griped once more a masters mate back in the dreary misery of the midshipmens mess in the cockpit petticoat influence family connections dont take it so hard lewrie sedge told him sedge could talk since he had been confirmed as sailing master in desperate we get a new captain out of it and you should be glad for mister railsford hood had conferred with the prize court and instructed them to purchase capricieuse into the royal navy treghues had been made postcaptain into the prize and railsford as the senior lieutenant of such a magnificent seizure had been promoted to commander into desperate this also allowed hood and his flagcaptain to do favors for some of their patrons protйgйs or promote some of their own two young men had gone into capricieuse as lieutenants of a coveted frigate instead of loafing as very junior officers in a lineofbattle ship more midshipmen had to be appointed into both ships more junior and senior warrants transferred giving promotion to them and their replacements aboard their old ships more masters mates made of promising midshipmen theres always an examining board sedge yawned as he told his family now in new york of his luck by letter youve had over two years as midshipman or masters mate ask of railsford and hell recommend your name if they seat a board soon alan doubted that possibility very much for there was also the niggling requirement that one had to have been entered in ships books for six years of sea duty and from what he had learned from others who had gone for oral examination before a panel of captains it was more fun to be flayed raw with the chances of promotion by that route about as sure as the proverbial camel passing through a needles eye altogether alan was getting very fed up with sedge he had started out as a graceless lout and he was rapidly turning into an insolently superior and graceless lout well i shall shift my dunnage aft good luck to you mister lewrie sedge drawled in his nasal jonathon twang which sound was also a rasp on alans soul and you too sir alan was forced to say to his new sailing master may you have joy of your promotion and the pleasures of the wardroom damn his blood alan added to himself with some heat the new masters mate and new midshipman off barfleur were in the process of unpacking and stirring around the cockpit so alan took himself on deck to get away from them with all the ships back in harbor it was a damned busy place with rowing boats working like a plague of waterbugs at all hours and a constant stream of flag signals from shore or the flagship mister lewrie one o them boats is fer us looks like cony told him pointing off to larboard right mister toliver gather up your sideparty it looks as if the new first lieutenant may be coming aboard at last cony run aft and inform commander railsford aye aye sir once within hailing distance toliver the bosuns mate leaned over the entry port and cupped his hands around his mouth ahoy there aye aye the bowman in the boat shouted back putting up two fingers in the air to show that a commission officer was aboard and was for them sergeant muster marine party and sidemen fer a lieutenant alan paced back to the quarterdeck nettings overlooking the waist while marines and seamen formed up to welcome their new first officer and alan hoped that he was as equitable a man as railsford had been in that position he had seen just a glimpse past the oarsmen to an officer in the sternsheets a tanned face under a cocked hat with a dogs vane and buttoned loop of gold lace a slightly shabby coat bespeaking an officer of lengthy sea duty and probably bags of experience a real tarpaulin man pipes trilled as the new officers hat appeared level with the lip of the entry port and he finished scrambling up the manropes and battens to stand on the gangway doffing his hat to the sideparty the duty watch and the working parties stopped their labors to doff their own flat tarred hats in return or touch forelocks oh stap me alan muttered god he thought sadly we need to have a little chat someday about frightening the very devil out of me like this fashionably a deist he was still imbued with the myths of many a governess who had crooned or beaten a more personal and vengeful god into him from his breeching on and he spent a futile few seconds trying to discover just what was so bad that he had done the last few months at least to deserve such a fate their new first lieutenant the man who could make or break any warrant or hand was none other than alans former master and commander from the parrot sloop lt james kenyon there was possibly no other officer in the entire navy much less the leewards who had a lower opinion of alan lewries honor and morals the cruelly ironic thing about it was that it was alan who had saved the mans command from capture but had he acted the slightest bit grateful for that act hell no kenyon had been flat on his back with yellow jack lost in his delirium when they were accosted by a french privateer brig just days from port and safety parrot had already struck her colors her mate at a total loss and if alan had not disobeyed him and opened fire into the enemy ship setting her afire and scything away her jeering boarding party kenyon would now be languishing in some prison hulk on martinique if not dead as mutton but when alan had emerged from the throes of yellow jack himself in adm sir onsley matthews shore establishment on antigua he found a galling letter from lieutenant kenyon accusing him of everything low and base that the officer could think of kenyon had put out one hundred guineas at least to gift alan with the lovely sterlingsilver trimmed hanger he now wore on his left hip a parting gift intended for alan to use to defend what little honor he had left the next time it was called to question as kenyon was sure it would be the memory of those phrases still rankled firing into an admirable foe after striking the colors violation of a sanctified usage of the sea disobedience insubordination eternal shame and much more in the same vein kenyon had sworn on paper that he could no longer stomach having lewrie anywhere near him and were it in his power he would toss him out of the navy before he befouled it with a loathsome stench kenyon finished taking the salute and began shaking hands with the senior warrants whose lives he would control from that instant and made his way aft towards the quarterdeck to report to commander railsford alan doffed his hat to him as respectfully as he could and gauged lieutenant kenyons reaction as he recognized him just a little help here god alan prayed silently as kenyon squinted hard and turned down the corners of his mouth in distaste you is it he said mouth working as though sucking on some acid fruitrind he tossed off a brief salute in return which allowed alan to lower his arm i heard youd been posted into desperate last year matter of fact i was hoping you would still be here thank you sir alan replied evenly no no dont thank me lewrie kenyon laughed curtly there was always the chance i would not catch up with you if you had been behaving to your normal standards and had been dismissed from the service for licentiousness or another act of disobedience still prospering sir alan told him knowing exactly where he stood now and determined to ride it out with as much dumb civility as the lowest ordinary seaman the devils spawn usually do i fear kenyon said i see you still have the hanger i gave you cut anybody lately just that one duel sir and that over a young lady what right have you to wear it stead of a midshipmans dirk i am a masters mate sir confirmed back in december indeed kenyon pondered that for a time yes id heard some talk of you being brave and efficient but we know better about you do we not mister lewrie what sort of a sham whipjack you really are excuse me sir far be it from me to advise my seniors but the captain is probably expecting you to see him alan suggested softly oh how droll how politic of you kenyon sneered and how unlike you to find this sudden modesty about advising or disobeying your seniors as you put it you were quick enough to disobey mister claghorne werent you damme sir i saved our ship alan insisted but at what price mister lewrie kenyon hissed claghornes authority my honor the honor of the royal navy i shall attend our captain but then ill be wanting to talk with you further on this matter dont leave the quarterdeck aye aye sir claghorne is dead you know kenyon said over his shoulder so bloody what alan thought as kenyon left old friend mister lewrie sedge asked after the first officer had gone aft to present himself ah he was master and commander of parrot my previous ship alan replied feeling weak in the knees and second officer of ariadne back in sir what that old receiving hulk in the inner harbor sedge said you were in her when she was condemned my first ship sir alan informed him well what sort is he then kenyons a taut hand very professional alan went on putting on a grin and an air of old comradeship that he most definitely did not feel youll find him a fair man sir unless he hates the fucking sight of you alan qualified to himself then hell be a raving bastard was he much of a flogger no sir and neither was our old captain bales alls right then sedge sniffed in his jonathon twang and paced away to his own concerns satisfied that desperate would be getting a first lieutenant much like her new captain in spirit and that there would be no unreasonableness to upset his new rating fuck it is alan thought and wondered why these things had to happen to him so continually first kenyons animosity after parrot then that bloody duel with that sneering fop of an army lieutenant in desperate he could do nothing right in treghues eyes but had almost won the man over when up pops sir george sinclair and his flagcaptain who was the same man from the impress service that had carted him off to portsmouth to sling him into navy uniform treghues had turned on him meanly and probably would still despise him if it had not been for that blessed french gunner and his damned rammer erratic insanity could sometimes be a blessing he had settled the smut on his name back home found a family he didnt even know he had and a remittance anyone would kill for a small measure of fame in the fleet promotion to masters mateand now this every time he had things in hand some perverse twist of fate brought him crashing down in ruin until he did not imagine he would have any chance of security in anything this side of the grave better people than you have tried to ruin me damn your blood alan cursed softly as he pondered what kenyon had in mind for him and he grinned suddenly as he realized that it was true his father had laid a plot almost inescapable and look who still could trot his phyz out in public without being snatched into debtors prison if kenyon would use his power as first lieutenant to bring lewrie down then he would be forced to fire off his own broadside in reply kenyon was not invulnerable for all his rank and position and talk of honor the man was a secret molly a buttfucker of the windward passage wasnt he alan had been told that odd goingson between kenyon and their host in kingston had occurred in the wee hours alan had seen the men bussing like practiced lovers in the dark coach outside the grapes the last night in port kenyon and sir richard slade rekindling a boyish passion for each other when their paths crossed once again hadnt lieutenant kenyon hinted once that he had not wanted to go to sea any more than alan had but there had been reasons youll not have me jemmy alan swore to himself if you try ill have you railsfordll never abide a sodomite in his ship not with the navy trying so hard to stamp it out on long cruises were not in cambridge kenyon came back on deck once more and made his way owards the taffrail out of earshot of the other people in the larbor watch or the working parties he crooked a finger to iraw lewrie to follow him i am sorry to hear that mister claghorne passed over sir man said trying to mollify the man he shot himself lewrie ah too bad alan frowned claghorne had been an idiot but there never had been anything in his life that alan knew of that would force him to that gambling debts sir you you little bastard kenyon snarled admiral matthews gave him a commission after parrot made port he got ler as his command and the shame was too much for him but why in hell would they do that sir alan marveled hes the one struck her colors moody the bosun called him a coward to his face ah but remember lewrie our passenger lord cantner and his lady who thought you were so bloody marvelous that youd saved their lives and their profits from the sale of his jamaican prroperties all the gold theyd brought aboard with them kenyon sneered they went to matthews and bade him make sure you were written up a hero and that meant there could be no mention of the colors being strucknot quite the honorable usage of the white flagand they didnt want it getting round that a british ship had done such a thing fortunately there were no survivors from that privateer brig you made sure of that claghorne wouldnt allow us near her as long as she was fire sir and i was down with the yellow jack myself before we could do anything so that is grossly unfair sir alan shot back keep a civil tongue in your head boy kenyon ordered so poor claghorne is a new commission officer senior in a victory over a more powerful foe and whats the reward for a faithful first promotion and command sir alan stated in control again of his emotions yes and would they transfer him into another ship if they had half a brain sir given the circumstances aye they would but old onsley is not blessed with brains is he lewrie more tripe and trullibubs upstairs to match the suet down below what sort of chance do you think claghorne had in command of a crew that knew him for a man who once was forced to strike whether or not there was a chance to fight that privateer he was in command and his decision was correct simply because he was a senior officer do you comprehend that lewrie you disobeyed him so youd rather be dead or in chains sir alan demanded damn you to hell sir kenyon spat have you learned no shame no sense of guilt for what you have done you cost a good man his life i saved yours and every manjack aboard sir alan retorted besides claghorne was ready to strike as soon as he saw that brig and nothing you or anyone else could have said would have changed his mind and not doing everything in ones power to prepare a ship to fight or offering no resistance when theres a chance to do so is cowardice at least a courtmartial offense on one charge sir but we did offer resistance and i proved that resistance was possible so claghorne should have been strung up or cashiered now its not my fault sir onsley gave that fatuous clown parrot sir had he given it a little thought he would have known it was a death sentence and god i knew you were base but i had no idea you were such a coldblooded dissembling hound lewrie kenyon marveled had the colors still been flying your resistance would have resulted in every manjack as you put it slaughtered with cold steel and to smear a good mans name to call him a clown a fatuous clown i once thought highly of you lewrie i asked for you in parrot i took you under my aegis when i saw how you were floundering about those first weeks in ariadne id like to think that what little you have learned about the navy was partly my doing it is sir believe me i gave you my trust kenyon went on his heart almost breaking as the enormity of alans perceived sins overwhelmed his anger i brought you up from a seasick younker taught you gave you room to grow as a seaman gave you responsibility and i thought you were growing into a fine young man but then you let me down so badly i am sorry you see things that way sir alan calmed knowing he would not be able to get through kenyons screen of bile with any logic but i was technically second in command of parrot at the time and had a responsibility to do everything i could to prevent us being taken lord cantners knowledge of government secrets their persons the ships people dont cloak your actions in any false sense of duty kenyon snapped back in rancor again i told you in my letter id not abide you in my presence nor in my navy and i meant it theres a vile streak to you that belongs in the gutter not strutting about a quarterdeck as a junior warrant now im first officer into this ship i shall make sure you serve her and the fleet no longer than necessary and satisfactory performance at my duties could not alter your resolve sir alan sighed steeling himself to use his ammunition not a whit lewrie i mean to see you cashiered or broken to ordinary seaman and sent forward in pussers slops thats devilish unfair sir not to my lights it aint there are other officers who think highly of me in this ship sir alan countered your intent will look like persecution ive been in the navy ten years longer than you lewrie i can find a way believe me kenyon promised with a lupine grin that lit his countenance for a bleak moment and when you are broken ill shed a martyrs tears over your lost potential no one shall portray sadness more than i ah but you are good at acting sir alan let slip out as the threat loosened his last cautions by the way sir have you seen sir richard slade in kingston lately what do you mean sir kenyon asked suddenly on his guard i was just wondering if he was still buggering his little black linkboys and the odd houseguest alan replied in for the penny in for the bloody pound he thought grimly you think that i kenyon spluttered but alan was delighted to note that the man had blanched a fresh bookpaper white under his deep tropical tan and his eyes almost bulged out of his head i was in the grapes when you and sir richard came up in his coach sir alan went on i saw the crest on the door recognized the man and the naval lieutenant in the coach with him sir i never suspected until now just how filthy you are lewrie kenyon muttered still floundering after that broadside to his hull all the more reason to break you and toss you back into the sinks and stews you came from but do i malign you sir alan asked fighting a grin of triumph or is your manhood just another sham youll pay for this kenyon said once he had regained control over himself he smiled wickedly which smile made lewrie wonder if he was half the slyboots he had thought himself just a second before but he knew what he had seen didnt he a beslimed little get like youll not hope to threaten me with a blackguards tale lewrie kenyon swore i promised id break you and i shall and i tell you this for trying to blackmail me into leniency i swear ill see you at the gratings getting striped by the cat youll leave the navy wearing the checkered shirt that ill put on you ill see you flayed raw and halfkilled and you know i can find a way to do it dont you dont you answer me you goddamned rogue aye sir alan was forced to admit for the sin of not answering could be construed as a charge of dumb insolence enough to get him disrated from masters mate if railsford was of mind i assure you youll pay kenyon promised with almost a lovers sweetness youll not enjoy a moments peace from this day on and i also assure you youll not enjoy whats coming to you now get out of my sight aye aye sir alan said saluting and turning away as he made his way blindly forward he suffered a cold shivering fit at what a cockup he had made of things with his defiant remarks there was a sheen of sweat on his body and he was like to faint from the encounter damme how could i have been so abysmally bloody stupid he thought if it was just claghorne and parrot i could have found some way to prove my worth to the dirty bastard why did i have to say that in for the penny in for the pound indeed why why do i have to think im so bloody clever when i just dig my grave deeper every time i do so he fetched up somewhere on the focsle and pretended to study the angle of the anchor cable and the chafegear on the hawse as he found his breath and tried to still the rising panic in his heart where was salvation should he go to railsford immediately and tell him what he had seen there was a good chance railsford would not believe him or kenyon would have a good excuse for his actions in that coach he and sir richard had been childhood friends and what was more natural than a goodbye kiss between old friends it could be painted a lot more innocent than what alan had seen and he was sure of that wasnt he should he parley his new fame into a transfer he would have to state reasons and would be back to the same contretemps should he simply cash out and escape damned if he would you and your mouth lewrie he castigated himself you and your bloody stupid temper ive tossed the dice this time damme if i havent chapter chapter desperate spent another week swinging at her anchorage in the inner harbor as hoods presence forced the dockyard officials to pay attention to her final repairs and alan lewrie spent that week staying as far forward or aft of the first lieutenant as one could in so restricted a world as a th rate frigate when forced by duty into immediate vicinity he sweated buckets trying to shrink into his coat and hat to be as anonymous as possible oddly once kenyon had gone through the ship with a finetoothcomb with the warrants and department heads he had ducked aft into the wardroom as officers did in harbor and stood no watches and when forced to converse with him kenyon showed absolutely no malice or any signs that they had ever had a cross word with each other which possibly made lewrie even more nervous than anything else kenyon could have done hell wait till were at sea where he can really bugger me alan concluded to himself almost writhing in dread anticipation of how many ways he could be caught out at his duties by an alert and vengeful first officer with grudge enough the bloody wooden figurehead could be found derelict and flogged he realized passin the word fer mister sedge an mister lewrie alan was torn from his frightful imaginings and summoned aft to railsfords quarters which brought even more dread to his already tortured soul he could not remember one good thing ever happening in the great cabins even if treghues was no longer there as their occupant railsford had seemed to expand since his promotion to command he lolled in a leatherpadded dining chair behind a new desk in the day cabin the furnishings were not as fine as treghues had been much of the dining table and chairs bought used from a shore chandlery or put together by the carpenters crew out of such limited selection of lumber as could be found in english harbor or across the island at st johns railsford seemed merry enough as they removed their hats and tucked them under their arms he had one leg flung across a chair arm his shirt open and his stock removed to savor the balmy breeze that blew in through the transom windows and the open skylight and ventilator chute admiral hood informs us hes to seat an examining board day after tomorrow railsford began stuffing tobacco into a clay churchwarden while freeling puttered about striking flint and tinder to get a light for him i thought you two might be interested in it mister sedge what say you beggin yer pardon sir but id not be interested the devil you say railsford gawked youd pass easy aye sir i might sedge agreed with a small smile ive been at sea since i was nine on family ships sir but i intend a career in merchant service stead of the navy but still railsford shrugged his pipe now lit the navy dont pay sir and my family needs money to get back on their feet after what the rebels looted from us sedge concluded in a sigh the navys only been temprary sailin masters high enough for me and more suited to my future employment sir hmm if you are sure i dont suppose anything i say could convince you railsford acquiesced i wish you joy of your career but after the war therell be a glut of qualified officers once the fleets been reduced passing may give you the leg up aye sir but my uncle and my dad still have two ships and id be at least a mate come hellr high water sedge told him smugly thank you mister sedge thatll be all then well mister lewrie what about you railsford asked as sedge left yes sir alan answered with alacrity sensing escape from his problems but only i dont have six years on ships books sir oh the devil with that theres a war on and no one gives a tinkers damn about piddling details not on a foreign station really sir alan brightened wondering if he could stand on firmer ground as a passed midshipman if he wasnt immediately made a lieutenant please dear god i promise ill keep my mouth shut please if your records are in order and you may answer their questions sensibly theyd have no reason to refuse you mister lewrie railsford told him now puffing a wreath of smoke around his head then i would like to try sir alan agreed quickly youre fortunate that i can give you a good report as well as captain treghues over in capricieuse all in harbor at the same time and the former second officer and your old commander in your first two ships as well just in case you didnt keep your professional bona fides in order railsford maundered on lazily ah the first lieutenant sir alan turned a touch gloomy at the thought of lieutenant kenyon and the very idea of having to depend on him to put in a good word for him now ill ask of him for you railsford offered now theres not much time to study so youd best be about it dine with me this evening and i shall fill you in on procedure and what the likely questions are to be go through your falconers and especially your navigation texts mister sedge would be a good tutor aye sir alan nodded god what if im passed for lieutenant he speculated once on deck again there must be openings for dozens of officers in all these ships else theyd never seat the bloody board well maybe a dozen in all and how many midshipmen to examine a hundred in one day two days they cant spend more than half an hour on any of them could they maybe even a quarter hour im not stupid and i have learned a lot and there must be plenty of idiots wholl stand no chance before a board i could be one of those dozen who pass and receive a posting into a new ship even if i dont get an immediate posting i could become prizemaster the next time we take a foe and be away from kenyon again free as the birds or he concluded grimly god help me i could fail and be stuck here well turned out i see railsford commented on lewries uniform as he was announced into the after cabins i trust youre saving your best for the board aye sir alan replied feeling on tenterhooks at the sight of lieutenant kenyon seated aft on the transom settee with a glass of wine in his hand take a seat mister lewrie railsford directed meaning to put him at his ease address yourself to that decanter of claret in front of you just in from home on the packet though i fear it did not travel at all well still thankee sir alan replied clawing a stemmed glass from the towel and pouring it almost full i must tell you that when i informed captain treghues of your intent to attend the examining board he was delighted at the idea railsford related seating himself at the dining table mister kenyon do come join us for a companionable drink before supper is served aye sir kenyon said when he sat down alan was pleased to note that though the night was relatively cool the first officer wore a sheen of sweat on his brow and his upper lip and beads of moisture trickled down his cheeks little did you realize mister kenyon that our prodigy here would be presenting himself for the chance at a commission in your lifetime hey railsford began with a small jest indeed not sir kenyon chuckled with a superior little drawl like a gambler whose holecards will take the game as soon as he shows them id have expected more like another year or two of seasoning spent five years a younker before i stood a board the full six for me railsford reminisced two years and a bit though kenyon frowned warming to his theme well thats cutting it a bit fine even in wartime but we were callow little cullies of twelve or thirteen the captain laughed which made alan dart a thankful glance at him mister lewrie was more mature when he first put on kings coat and a cut above the average midshipman in intelligence to begin with seasick in portsmouth and adrift in old ariadne in harbor kenyon added with relish took an hour to report to our first officer after he stepped below still he learned quickly railsford said chuckling at the image of lewrie casting his accounts over the side of a ship safely moored in portsmouth some learn faster than others ive no qualms about his prospects if you dont did i not learn sir alan interrupted directing his gaze to kenyon so many things about the navy and people damned if he was going to sit there being discussed like a thing and damned if he was going to let kenyon lay doubts about him kenyon almost choked on a sip of wine at the last comment enough to stand before a board ill warrant railsford went on oblivious to alans little verbal shot captain treghues sent me a packet for you lewrie letter of recommendation and a list of some questions youll likely be challenged with ah heres the one about outfitting a ship from truck to keel and some other posers hes heard about over his years im most grateful for any aid from him sir didnt exactly love you when you first joined desperate did he railsford shrugged our late captain did not hold with dueling and our alan here had just put some army bastards lights out yes i heard about that kenyon said even if the girl was your admirals niece id not have approved either well i can say it now hes got his new command and is gone from us railsford stated captain treghues played the most devilish favorites sometimes for the worst people it was feast or famine for everyone and no sense to it no way of knowing how one may have offended his catercousin midshipman forrester sir alan grimaced thank god we left the surly turd at yorktown railsford said with a laugh yet prejudiced as he was in the beginning he came round to appreciate mister lewrie so his praise is doubly blessed to everything there is a season so to speak sir kenyon replied approbation or shame but did your captain shun the worthy and praise the unworthy by seasons sir then perhaps well if he had learned of young alans past and if he was as ive heard a perfect tartar on religion and proper behavior whos to know why captain treghues would recommend him now so highly or is it more of the same you speak of mister lewries antecedents sir railsford bristled a little at his first officer our pursers brother straightened that out for him theres no shame in having a shady past or a corinthian brotheldandy for a father if one may rise above it sir excuse me mister lewrie if i portray your father in that light one might add forgerer thief bigamist false witness and bugger sir alan ticked off cheerfully im told he only sticks his head out o sundays when he cant be taken for debts theres no family so blameless the light of day wouldnt turn up a rogue or two mister kenyon all the more reason to wish lewrie well with the examining board since hes risen so far above his own a captain must not become too familiar with his officers and crew so i will most definitely not mention the rumors of smuggling and shipwrecking spoken about the railsfords in the past back in weymouth he gave them a look in conclusion that indicated they should laugh i must confess i was not bound for the sea from the time i was breeched sir as you were alan said to railsford but once i did get to sea and i found my legs as it were i must own to an ambition to become a commission officer and serve as best i can oh god alan thought if i heard another shitsack like me spout such things i believe id box his ears first and then spew in his lap damn kenyon first poison about my abilities now these slurs on treghues opinion and my past surely railsford can see the bastards prejudiced against me ill most likely fail the board and then hell have me triced up and ruined if i dont put him in his place now one would think you harbored some grievance against lewrie yourself mister kenyon railsford chid his first officer i wish him fortune with the board sir though i doubt hes seasoned enough to be a commission officer yet kenyon countered with a beatific grin that belied his motives he did look a little desperate though as he realized that he had overstepped the bounds of subtlety he had his own place to earn with railsford in this new ship perhaps sir alan said to railsford mister kenyon remembers my first days aboard old ariadne when i as much confessed to him that i did not wish to make the sea my calling but mister kenyon i remember as well you once told me that you were not enamored of going to sea when you first joined but that certain reasons made it necessary would your own personal history be reflected upon mine ordinarily i would not presume to inquire but this seems such an informal occasion perhaps your beginning might make a merry tale squirm your way out of that you whoreson alan thought happily yes mister kenyon how did you get your haporth of tar railsford asked pouring them another glassful as the salad arrived kenyon had not expected such a frontal attack and he turned queasy as a landlubber in a full gale but over the years he had invented a plausible past and had polished it with retelling so whatever unnatural act he had committed that forced him to sea to make a man of him had been submerged it should have tripped from his lips without effort usually and he began it but didnt quite gain that casual bluff and hearty tarryhanded air he usually affected well sir boys will be wild animals you know he started with a shaky laugh taking time to glare evilly at lewrie in warning that carried them through soup and salad commander railsford in his turn related his own entry into the navy after that and through most of the main course unbending from the stiffness aloofness and anonymity expected of a captain who held the lives and careers of his dining companions in his hands for good or ill at least alan noted kenyon dropped his dirge about alan being so unready for the attempt at a commission and watched him with a chary eye for the rest of the dinner never knowing at what moment he might pop up with another question or a veiled comment that would expose him the man sipped from the same glass of wine all through dinner and sweated as though he had been forced to stoke the fires of hell which gave alan a great deal of pleasure to witness chapter chapter feeling nervous as a kitfox who has just heard the hunters horn alan lewrie climbed through the entry port into barfleur on the morning appointed for his ordeal the waters in english harbor had been swarming with boats trying to ply oars as midshipmen from all the vessels currently present had assembled to the summoning flag pendants bearing their hopeful occupants he clutched his canvaswrapped documents to his breast after he had saluted the sideparty and the quarterdeck feeling an urge to read through them once more to assure his twanging nerves that they were still all there and that they still sang his praises as nicely as they had when he had first received them treghues had penned a fulsome letter from his new command in capricieuse his aptly named capriciousness of mood had indeed turned full circle and now midshipman lewrie had been one of his best junior warrants right from the start more mature and quicker of mind than any young man he had ever met etc railsford had penned a neat little recommendation not so laudatory as to stir disbelief taut and nautical like the man himself and alan still marveled kenyon had added recommendations of his own with no mention of nagging worries that lewrie might be a little wet behind the ears beyond the bare recitation of the deeds in which alan had taken part and distinguished himself by his conduct and bravery or his developing knowledge of sea lore there was little real praise but it did leave the impression that he was at least somewhat worthy of examination lukewarm kenyons approval might be but at least he did not disapprove and alan thought that railsford had something to do with that he might have had to press kenyon for a favorable letter but what could kenyon do alan asked himself in a moment of smugness refuse to recommend his new captains favorite show displeasure with such a well thought of young fellow with so much promise there was also the possibility that kenyon was hedging his bets laying groundwork of his own so that when alan failed the board and came back aboard with his tail between his legs he could tell railsford that he had told him so and if alan failed would he lose enough of railsfords approval that kenyon could then begin to lay a stink upon him carp at failures and bring him down until he caught him out and then proceeded to break him there must be an hundred of us i swear to god a gangly midshipman commented at alans elbow and more coming all the time every fool with white collar tabs must think he has a chance this board the speaker was in his twenties and while all the others that alan had seen were turned out in their best kit this one was wearing a somewhat shabby coat and his waistcoat and breeches were dingy was he poor as a traveling tinker or did he just not care alan wondered let us hope most of them are abominably stupid alan said to be pleasant still praying as most of them did that he would pass this is my third board the older midshipman confided with a breezy air but ill pass this time think you i look salty enough aye saltys the word for you alan said with a raised eyebrow theyll have a host of little angels in there today all alike as two peas in a pod scrubbed up so their own mothers wouldnt know em the older lad reasoned but when they see a real tarryhanded younker theyll just assume theyve a prime candidate on their hands and go easy on me alan wished the fellow would go away he was trembling with anxiety and all the guidance set questions and trick posers he had been coached in had flown out of his head he was sure if he did not have space to think for a while before they started examining people his brains would leave him utterly but he had to respond i should think they would dig down for the most arcane stuff if you show too knowledgeable as soon as you enter the room alan said god dont say that the young man snapped losing a little of his swagger besides i know my stuff you see if i dont then the best of luck to you alan bowed wanting to be alone the quarterdeck was swarming with midshipmen all furrowing their brows as they reread their texts once more casting their hopeful faces skyward reciting silently the hard questions they had drilled on as though at heartfelt prayer right you lot an officer shouted above the low din now wholl be first below not a soul moved shocked by the suggestion of being the first sacrificial lamb to the slaughter what a pack of codsheads the officer grunted with a sour expression you lads to starboard then lead off you the gingerhaired one youre the bellwether whether you like it or not theyve had their breakfasts already so they might be pleasant that started a parade toward the ladders into the captains quarters on the upper gun deck where clerks met them and took down their names and ships all the furnishings from the outer cabins had been cleared so they were forced to stand alan was about twentieth on the list he had reasoned that the closer the examining board got to their midday meal the less time they would want to spend asking damnfool questions of damnfool midshipmen and might throw him two or three posers and then make up their minds quickly allowing him a better chance to show well without being grilled like a steak like a patient waiting for the surgeon to attend him he took a place against an interior partition and forced himself to think of something pleasant it was already too crowded and warm in the cabins and there was almost no elbow room to dig into his snowywhite breeches for a pocket handkerchief to mop the slight sheen of sweat from his face git off my fuckin shoes damn yer blood whos on the board then captain of the fleet napier off resolution captain cornwallis of canada oh fuck me hes a tartar boxhauling what the hell do i know about boxhauling hands flurried to open texts at that strangled wail of despair alan had considered bringing his own books with him but after two days of cramming in every spare moment he realized that he would either know the answers or he would not and anything he read at the last second would melt away before he could recall it so he did not have the diversion of reading to pass the time as the others did the first young aspirant the gingerhaired boy of about seventeen who had been first below went into the examining room and everyone hushed and leaned closer to see if they could hear the proceedings through the deal partitions close as he was alan could only hear a dull rumble now and then the boy was out in five minutes shaking like a whipped puppy and soaked in sweat its boxhauling he stammered tearing at his stock as though he was strangling fourteen steps of gundrill d d dismasting in a whole gale lord i dont know what else they love lee shores the next hopeful was in there for ten minutes and he came out fanning himself with his hat but wearing a smug expression as though he had been informed that he had been passed to their eager questions as to what had been required of him he had another terrifying list of stumpers which made all of them dive back into their texts and alan suddenly didnt feel so very confident any longer he could cheerfully have killed one of the others for a book to review the board also upset his hopes they went through a dozen young men in the first hourandaquarter and not two of them looked at all sanguine about their prospects when they emerged most were told they had failed and to try again in another six months or so the older midshipman in the shabby coat went in and he was out in three minutes his eyes moist with humiliation at the quick drubbing he had received please god alan thought as a litany please midshipman lewrie the clerk called from the open door at last midshipman alan lewrie here alan heard himself manage to say through a suddenly dry throat then get in here the clerk simpered at his own jest alan tugged down his waistcoat and shot his cuffs played with his neckstock and then strode to the open door as if he were walking on pillows in some feverdream he stepped through the door and past the partitions and the door was closed behind him he beheld a long dining table set athwartships behind which were seated at least a dozen postcaptains in their goldlaced coats and every one of them looked grumpy as illfed badgers there was a single chair before the table as though it was a courtmartial and alan almost stumbled over it as he took a stance before it well one of the captains snapped midshipman alan lewrie sir of the desperate frigate he managed to say clutching his packet of letters to his side and almost crushing his cocked hat into a furball under the other aim desperate hey one of the others said beaming almost pleasantly saw your fight with capricieuse damned fine stuff your captain treghues has a lot of bottom what aye sir well dont stand there like deaths head on a mopstick give me your packet alan handed over his letters and bona fides and the flagcaptain in the center of the board looked over them reading aloud salient points to the other members joined january of ariadne rd rate of sixtyfour guns only the two years of service aye sir mentioned honorably took charge of the lower gun deck after both officers were killed credited with getting the guns back in action and thus saving the ship my my we have been busy have we not the flagcaptain chuckled i remember you i believe you were the lad escaped yorktown with some soldiers turned a brace of river barges into sailing craft fought your way out too as i remember this aint so bad after all alan thought with relief was there some interest on his behalf of which he was unaware working in his favorwas it from admiral hood or his flagcaptain here aye sir we did but as for the boats he informed them i had two fine pettyofficers who did most of the creative work mister feather and mister queener both dead now unfortunately he congratulated himself as he saw the tacit approval of his comments on the captains faces it never hurt to share out the credit and sound a little modest while still implying you were a genius anyway so they went through his records from parrot his staff work for rear adm sir onsley matthews with alan dropping the blandest sort of hint that he and that worthy who was now in london controlling these captains were still in affectionate correspondence then his service in desperate and all her heroic exploits in which he had taken part including being a prizemaster the raid on the danish virgin islands battle of the chesapeake yorktown his promotion to masters mate the fight with capricieuse and his service as acting lieutenant by the time they reached the present he was damned near swaggering it was going splendidly and he could see by one board members large watch that they had spent over ten minutes just being pleasant and approving i could walk out of here without one question if they have that herd out there to examine today he speculated and most of those sluggards havent done a tenth of my service sit or stand mister lewrie sir do you prefer to sit or stand for the examination um ill stand sir he replied all the cockswagger knocked out of him knowing he would not get off scotfree think better on your feet hey captain cornwallis chuckled mister lewrie youre first officer into a seventyfourgunned rd rate at present laid up inordinary your captain orders you to prepare her to be put back into commission what steps are necessary and what orders would you give thats one of the questions treghues sent me to the letter alan realized striving to dredge up the proper answer or even get his brain to function but he took a deep breath to steady his nerves and launched into the long involved reply he was only halfway through it though when he was interrupted by one of the captains good on that now this same seventyfour is on a lee shore under plain sail wind out of the west and you are on the larboard tack as closehauled as may be shoals under your lee eight cables off almost embayed by a peninsula to the northrd extending norwest do you have that in mind so far aye sir the wind veers ahead suddenly by six points and freshens to half a gale what action would you take sir excuse me sir alan asked stalling for thinking time how far off is that peninsula you mentioned makes no difference one grumbled impatiently half a league another shrugged and the rest seemed it as good a predicament as any i would endeavor to tack immediately sirs alan began i would shift the head sheets and the spanker with the duty watch at the same time summoning allhands as i would be laid aback and in irons get her head about even if the squaresails would be flung aback i would lose all headway until i could free the braces and shiver the yards but i would be on a safer tack do you want more he wondered as they sat there staring at him he no longer felt any confidence at all ah hmm your cooks were preparing dinner during this emergency and the galley fire has been scattered by your sudden evolution captain cornwallis demanded what do you do to combat this fire below decks and how many hands may you spare as you are still attempting to tack your ship and square away your yards jesus are these buggers serious he quailed barely had he gotten a fire party together rigged out a foredeck washdeck pump as a fire engine than another captain added the complication of jammed braceblocks aloft on the main yards and a sprung main topmast that threatened to come crashing down from the wind pressure on those laid aback topsls alan decided to send two men aloft and cut the upper weather brace so the yard could swing acockbill to save the mast one hypothesis came at him after another mercilessly swift and demanding and his answers showed no signs of mollifying anyone they all frowned and leaned forward savoring his roasting much like grand inquisitors from spain watching a particularly enjoyable autodafй and wanting to hear the bleats of the torched victim better his shirt was clinging to him his breeches felt clammy as if he had just been dunked over the side into the sea and his face streamed so much perspiration it was all he could do not to reach up and try to mop himself dry before it all ran down into his eyes and made him blink and squint he had the distinct impression that he had begun to babble like a twoyearold instead of sounding like a young man with the prospects to be made a lieutenant am i making any sense anymore he wondered jesus just a little good fortune here please hmm alright mister lewrie the flagcaptain said finally which brought a pentup sigh of relief to alans lips before he could control himself youd probably have lost that topmast eventually but the ship might have been spared being wrecked on a lee shore as for that fire you forgot about it but im sure someone would have come and told you if it got out of control gentlemen fair enough captain comwallis said shrugging affably agreed then the flagcaptain peered down the table for a consensus passed for lieutenancy then thatll be all god alan blurted in total stupefaction well if youd rather not be a postcaptain laughed oh nossir thank you sirs i mean yes sirs hush take your records and go before we change our minds aye aye sir alan agreed stumbling over the chair again on his way out he stepped into the breathless hush of the cabin full of nervous aspirants who still had to endure their own ordeals my god you were in there near twenty minutes one gawped what did they ask another demanded it was alan began and then began to cackle in hysterical relief i cant bloody remember dismasting and a fire i think fire someone said opening his falconers to see if there was an approved firedrill on a lee shore mind you alan grinned unable to stop shaking with laughter and relief such as a felon must feel pardoned at the foot of the gibbet bloody daft on em they are well did you pass passed alan beamed at them drawing a deep breath yes bloody christ not one in five came a sorrowful moan best of luck to you all alan said meaning every word of it he pulled out his watch and consulted it trying to calm down ah what good timing i shall be back aboard just in time for dinner bastard someone whispered loud enough to hear but lewrie was too used to hearing it spoken of him to care and too proud and pleased for the world was suddenly a much sunnier place thats passed bastard he chirped on his way to the upper deck and ill thank you to remember it chapter the letter came aboard the morning before desperate was to put to sea after returning to his ship alan had time to reflect that passing the examination had not improved his chances much there was no extra pay with the honor since no one paid midshipmen anyway and it gave him no more perquisites that he didnt already have as a masters mate and after the glow of achievement had cooled there was still lieutenant kenyon to deal with once at sea the first officer could slowly crucify him one spike at a time destroying whatever good he had gained from his incredible fortune before that dour captains board lastminute stores were being stowed so alan was busy in the holds supervising so that the fore and aft balance was preserved and nothing would shift to either beam once they were under way cony his new hammockman who had been ashore with him at yorktown came below to fetch him theys a boat come mister lewrie an they brung a letter for ya from the flag i thinks he said quickly eyeing him with almost a religious reverence all of a sudden pray god alan said of one hundred and fifty midshipmen that had faced the board thirty had been passed but rumor had only promoted ten into immediate commissions part of that was based on favoritism whose son needed a place who had the better connections or more experience was it possible though could he have shown well enough to be one of the lucky ones god knows the navy was full of passed midshipmen who didnt have the luck or the interest to be lifted out of their penury and he had almost thought himself ready to join their embittered ranks with desperate out at sea on her own once more there would be no access to places that came open unless they took a suitably big prize was he one of the suddenly anointed ones and was he about to find his escape from the certain implacable wrath of lieutenant kenyon he charged up the ladders from the holds to the upper deck and the starboard gangway where an impeccably dressed midshipman of about fourteen was waiting with a sealed letter im lewrie he said wiping his damp palms on his working rig slop trousers as though the folded and waxed parchment was a holy relic for you sir from the flag thank you alan said turning it over he sucked in his breath in surprise it was addressed to lieutenant alan lewrie royal navy yes by god he shouted thrusting that missive at the sky in triumph it was salvation from kenyons wrath a certain posting into another vessel it was vindication for all the misery and danger he had faced willing or not since being forced most unwillingly into the navy two years before it was also he reflected in his victory the keys to lucy beauman and her fathers money as soon as he could get his young arse back to kingston and ask for her hand he broke the wax wafer and unfolded the letter he was instructed to equip himself as a commission officer and report aboard hm shrike brig o war twelve guns lieutenant lilycrop master and commander with all despatch or risk the senior admirals displeasure failing that he was to communicate to the flag any inability to comply either in accepting a commission or fulfilling his orders with the threat of immediate loss of income and dismissal from the fleet yes by god he repeated reading it through once more and savoring the words cony go below and start packing my sea chest yer a officer sir cony goggled yes i am alan replied in exultation beggin yer pardon sir but youll be agoin into another ship then youll be aneedin a servant sir an id be that proud ta be yer man sir cony offered then you shall be i must see the captain off with you he went down to the gun deck and aft to the main entrance to the captains quarters where a fully uniformed marine sentry stood to serve as guard and tiler es wif t pusser mister lewrie the sentry told him even better alan grinned tell him lieutenant lewrie is here to see him oh lor mister lewrie don you be japin now the sentry chided from long familiarity with a young man who was to his lights not much more than a jumpedup younker half his own age no jest alan said waving the parchment as proof the sentry shrugged and came to attention banging his musket butt on the oak decking and shouting at the top of his lungs leftent lewrie sah freeling opened the cabin door immediately and alan entered the great cabins where railsford and cheatham had been going over the books and having a glass of wine together this is not your idea of humor railsford asked his face somber but his eyes twinkling no sir the flagcaptain has promoted me a commission officer into a brig o war the shrike alan told him proudly my stars above cheatham said rising from his seat to take lewries hand and pump it excitedly how marvelous for you freeling fetch an extra glass railsford instructed well take a bumper in celebration sit you down mister lewrie or should i say alan by god it is marvelous news thank you sir sorry that we have to lose you though cheatham sighed after they had drained their glasses and sent freeling digging into the wine cabinet for a fresh bottle to toast his good fortune but my word what fortune you have had in the last year with us yes i shall miss you both sirs alan replied youve done so much for me both professionally and personally ill feel adrift without you as my mentors damme if i wont miss them he thought ruefully realizing at that moment that he would indeed be leaving desperate much as he feared remaining near kenyon and his wrath he would be departing the first ship he had mostly enjoyed service in where railsford had always been there believing in him and turning away treghues original ill humor toward him where cheatham had done so much to clear up his family problems back in london and get him absolved of the false charges that had led to his arrival in the navy theyve been good to me he thought and whatll a new ship be like without em well youll be on your own bottom railsford said but if you continue as you have lately im sure you shall prosper its the navys way of snipping the leading strings really there wasnt much more you could learn here and no way the navy could promote you an officer in the same ship in which you served as a junior warrant the letter says with all despatch sir alan told them does that mean that i depart instantly i would appreciate it if you gave me one more fair wind to steer by in this regard let me see railsford said taking the precious document hmm you shall have to go aboard the flag to get your certificate of commission since it is not here mister cheatham shall have to square away your accounts and i shall instruct my clerk to arrange your pay vouchers and prizemoney certificates go aboard the flag now and see the pertinent clerk or flaglieutenant theres daylight enough for you to take a nights lodging ashore and get to the tailors you might see woodridges cheatham suggested as freeling got the fresh bottle circulating he has a fine selection of ready coats and i know you may trade your old midshipmans jackets in partial payment he concluded with a knowing wink tell him i said to go easy on you and you may get away for less thank you mister cheatham i seem to be forever in your debt and you shall square every penny of it before we let you get off this ship sir cheatham japed i shall go calculate the reckoning once alone railsford leaned back in his chair and flung a leg over the arm and studied lewrie closely you know this is a fine moment for me to see you with a commission and for you to be promoted to commander with desperate as yours alan countered ah twont last railsford grimaced the war may end soon and i may not be confirmed before it does desperate shall pay off in another year no matter what happens and i shall most likely go back to being a halfpay lieutenant liable for stoppages on commanders pay but there is a power of prizemoney to soften the blow sir alan grinned and war enough still to get you made post aye theres that god willing if we pitch into the frogs and dagoes sharp enough and i intend to do just that damme its fine to think of you with a commission though i remember when it happened to me up and out of a ship id served in for three years into a new one full of strangers god i missed hercules for months i dont know this lilycrop is it god help the poor man with a name like that but i tell you truly alan hell be getting a good officer you do me too much honor sir alan confessed im proud as hot punch but scared to death at the moment and i feel like such a little fraud and sooner or later someones going to find me out sir tis only natural to be nervous about all the added responsibility railsford said comfortingly leaning forward on his desk and youll no longer have patrons in your new ship to protect you god knows you have been more in need of protection than most but it was worth it i think youve turned out main well with nothing to be ashamed of thank you sir thankee kindly alan replied choking up at the thought of being adrift from the cosseting he had gotten well one bad part about this navy of ours is that when you make great friends they get transferred to the other side of the world and one never sees them again while the dross keep showing up one commission after another railsford harrumphed stifling his own emotions another thing is that as the bard said parting is such sweet sorrow best do it short and direct and have done theres a power of errands you must run before reporting to this shrike so let us say our farewells now and let you get on about your business but keep in touch drop us a letter now and again who knows at this rate of advancement i could be coming to you for a favor someday when im still a longintooth lieutenant and youre a high and mighty postcaptain they stood and shook hands almost equals now for the first time and railsford did him the grace to walk him to the door by the way i meant to ask you something lieutenant kenyon wasnt exactly enthralled with giving you suitable recommendations do you know of any reason why he should have been loath to sponsor you he said he didnt want to lose you but he acted deuced odd about it damme thats the trouble with such a diedinthewool rogue like me being around decent people like railsford and cheatham alan thought sooner or later their ways rub off and keep you from doing the sensible thing he could square kenyons yards by mentioning his sexual preferences what he had seen that night in kingston and end up ruining the mans career removing him as a threat to him forever but he rationalized he was out and away from him and would probably never cross his hawse again in this life shrike would be his escape and if he did good duty in her no one could ever threaten his standing in the navy not with the record he had posted so far so he relented he mentioned that mister claghorne had committed suicide after he gained his commission and command of old parrot sir but other than that i can think of no animosity alan said with a straight face oh poor fellow railsford sighed still some people are made to handle the solitude of command and some go under no this poor claghorne was not your problem and as i remember you saying once kenyon was down with yellow jack at the time he most like blames himself for not being able to give the benighted soul leadership at such a stressful moment which broke his spirit well off with you you rogue make a name for yourself in this shrike and well see you a postcaptain yet chapter thank god for looking glasses for vain cockahoops like me lt alan lewrie rn thought to himself with a smugness matched by the smile that greeted him in the hall mirror of the old lamb tavern as he entered the cocked hat which had adorned his head nigh on for nearly two and a half years had lost its plainness with the addition of the wide vertical gold strip of lace held by a gold fouledanchor button under which a stiff little bow of black silk riband stuck up above the rim of the brim in a commission officers dogs vane black neck cloth over the stock and the longer tailed naval blue coat with its low standcollar trimmed at the edge in white the pristine new broad white turnback lapels that ran from collarbone to his waist also adorned with gold buttons bearing the fouled anchor device of his service he reached up a hand to remove the cocked hat and could not help but admire his sleeve dressed with a wide white cuff a widely spaced row of three large gold cuff buttons damme but i make a finelooking officer he preened ere fer the commission party sir one of the taverns daisykickers asked wipping his alestained hands on the universal blue publicans apron take yer at sir yes thankee yes i am guest of honor actually alan said sneaking one last look in the mirror to see if his light brown hair was in place the black silk riband tied properly around his now long and seamanly queue of hair at the back of his collar he could not help winking one bluegrey eye at himself as the servant took his hat away for safekeeping right iss way sir the servant beckoned leading him from the common rooms to an upper private suite overlooking a cool patio alan shot his lace to show the proper amount of ruffles on his wrists tugged the waistcoat down and entered huzzah the occupants raised a cheer some already standing atop the long dining table marcus aurelius was right lt keith ashburn now fifth officer of the fiftygunned th rate squadron flagship glatton japed from his perch atop a chair seat as he waved a bottle of champagne and a glass in the air how ridiculous and what a stranger he is he quoted who is surprised at anything which happens in life wet the bugger down somebody jemmy shirke a former shipmate aboard ariadne alans first ship suggested shirke was still a midshipman now about eighteen or nineteen by alans recollections only the fact that he was a passed midshipman who had yet to find a suitable opening allowed him to be away from his ship wine was sloshed in his general direction soaking his shirt and fine new coatthankfully alan had had the money from his hidden cache of guineas to purchase four a glass was shoved into his hand and quickly filled with champagne the only other officer present was lt william mayhew who alan had worked for briefly when that poor young fellow had served adm sir onsley matthews as flaglieutenant mayhew had come ashore with ashburn get down from that chair keith youre making me dizzy alan jested stepping up to shake hands with him after nearly a year of separation never did have a head for heights sames the day i ran you up the mast for the first time keith hooted jumping down with easy grace goddamn my eyes you of all people a commission officer i thought pretty much the same of you at the time alan replied mister mayhew is he worth a tinkers damn yet oh for gods sake call me billy will you alan the gingerhaired permanently sunburned young man snapped impatiently no hes no more use than the duckfucker never will be good to lay eyes on you again that it is alan and congratulations on passing the board im told not one in five passed and not one in ten got an immediate commission lucky bastard you are ill tell you and we had to be at sea when it happened mores my luck jemmy shirke complained he had passed the previous board but wasnt in port when the blessings were handed out this time you know all good things come from the flag ashburn stated and that was pretty much true promotion came more rapidly for those fortunate officers in a commodores or an admirals wardroom than it did for twoapenny lieutenants in lesser ships no matter how good their records and the same could be said for lieutenants vacancies dropping from heaven to midshipmen who were more favorably placed and endowed with the proper connections those who had got aye damnit i do jemmy shirke grumbled and alan wondered why ashburn had suggested inviting him if he was still the same surly practicaljoking lout he had been in ariadne they had been messmates but never true friends not like he and keith had been time had not seemed to have changed him much either last i saw of you dear jemmy alan said hauling a chair out from the table to take a pew you were still lashed up like a fished course yard pumping away like a stoat on some darkhaired wench god must have been july of what did they assign you once you healed after ariadne was condemned he meant to be pleasant to the fellowafter all he was paying part of the reckoning for this party and the broken arm didnt slow you down much as i remember keith stuck in told you to get me a gentle one and id take my fences same as anybody jemmy mellowed no once my flipper was healed i went into the admiral rooke shes a hired brig o war duration only but shes not bad theyve made me an acting masters mate no marines just the captain first officer master and two midshipmen only eighty or so in the whole crew thats grand for you jemmy alan enthused for him youre learning scads more than most like i did when i went into parrot with mister kenyon and i was an acting masters mate not too long ago too promotion may come faster in the bigger ships shirke said with returning pride after his brief sulk but you cant beat service in a small ship for making a real seaman of you only thing is some of us rise faster than others itll come alan assured him not sure who shirke was needling him or ashburn and mayhew so what ship are you getting mayhew asked shrike alan said grinning twelvegunned brig o war my stars youre to be a first officer right out of the starting gates mayhew goggled that was news to alan he had believed a brig o war would be big enough for a first and second lieutenant jesus he said to himself i hadnt thought about that theyre going to find out what a total fraud i really am still railsford must have known what it meant as did the admirals secretary who made the appointment railsford had said that hed prosper and told him to his face that this new captain would be getting a good officer not all good things come from the flag im thinking alan told them with a lazy drawl and a grin that he didnt quite feel he looked at shirke who appeared to have been kicked in the guts by the news and at ashburn who was not exactly overjoyed either his appointment had come from barfleur admiral hoods flagship while keith ashburn for all his connections his familys money and interestlifeblood of a successful careerleft him a junior officer in a th rate ship no matter that he had been commissioned a yearandahalf longer it hinted at highflown connections back home with admiralty with hood else why did not a more senior and deserving man not get the appointment even if it was in a small brig below the rate now what had we planned for this celebration alan asked in the dumbstruck silence i must own im famished a page taken from your favorite book alan keith said regaining his composure thats why we are having it here at the lamb in falmouth harbor stead of over the ridge in english harbor less chance that a naval watch will break things up and a better run of whore over here god bless you keith you read my mind i havent had a good ride since charleston last august and damnall blood and thunder in between rakes progress for us tonight eh there was a knock at the door that must be the mutton billy mayhew hoped aloud as he rose to answer it sure enough the bareback riders had arrived more glasses were called for and more wine while they were introduced there was hespera most mother abbesses ran to the same classical bent as ashburn when it came to naming their stockintrade with grecoroman sobriquets a slim and lanky young blonde of about seventeen with straight hair there was an older woman of about thirty rather hardfaced but blessed with a promising bodyshe went by pandorawho appeared to be the bosuns mate in charge of the distaff party there was a girl with hair so red it had to be hennaed short and talkative as soon as she got through the doorelectra she insisted she be called and there was dolly alan took a sudden like for dolly if only because she probably was using her own name for varietys sake she appeared to be about twentyfive just a few years older than alan and she was beautiful rather than merely pretty and stood out from the rest like a peacock in a barnyard a high clear brow high cheekbones and a sum almost thin face that tapered to a firm little chin a slim straight nose cleverly shaped and a cupids bow of a mouth that showed her upper teeth in repose and widened in a hesitant smile to show pure healthy white and she had the most peculiar dark green eyes and hair the hue of polished mahogany and just as lustrous and full she was also much better dressed than the others not just in splendorany whore could buy splendor from a ragpickers barrow or a used dress shop and these hadshe wore a dress less gaudy than the others almost respectable enough to take out on the town with fewer flounces and fripperies one at first glance might take her for a proper young woman or a wife you done us proud tonight keith mayhew commented yes keith usually has the taste of a philistine alan said gentlemen choose your partners ashburn ordained loftily as our guest of honor let alan have first pick oo shall ave this un then alan chuckled mimicking the love call of the lower deck when they paired off with their temporary wives whenever a ship was put out of discipline and the doxies came aboard the blonde looked promising but her straight hair reminded him too much of caroline chiswick from wilmington the others were the usual runofthemill whores one could have any day of the weekhe had only one clear choice mistress dolly if you would be so kind as to grace my side during supper alan asked bowing in conge deep enough for a duchess and taking her hand if you wish sir she replied in a voice so soft and meek he almost had to ask her to repeat herself so shes one of those thatll play the virgin is she he thought this could be interesting sport shirke suggested after picking hespera the blonde oh lets sup first alan said and dolly relaxed from a sudden stiffness at his side as he led her to the winetable take a pew my dear god knows what were eating tonight but itll not be short commons i hope you brought a bounteous appetite i did indeed sir she replied taking a glass of champagne oh haint never ad bubbly wine afore hespera giggled loud when she took a sip of wine across the table hit tickles me nose thats not all well tickle before the nights through ill wager billy mayhew promised his choice which made them all roar with laughter the supper was more than palatable there was a poached local fish the servitors called grouper firm as lobster and just as succulent served with a melted butter and lime sauce that had been preceded by a green salad and oxtail soup the fish was followed by some small wild fowl then a domestic goose then a smoking joint of beef which was not as stringy and lean as most island cattle and with it all there was hot and crusty bread small potatoes roasted and boiled native chick peas and broad beans young carrots in butter and parsley washed down of course with several bottles of hock with the fish and fowl captured or smuggled burgundy with the beef and more champagne when things got slow between courses for those with a sweet tooth a servant wheeled in a huge raisin and citrusfruit duff soaked so long in brandy it was a threat to sobriety of itself and that was followed once the cloth was removed by a fairly fresh cheese apples extrafine sweet biscuit and port or brandy drinking games ashbum announced climbing back onto his chair and striking a pose like a ships figurehead electra name me a ships mast i dont know nothin bout ships the girl pouted wrong answer drink a full bumper in punishment drink drink drink he shouted and they took up the chorus while the girl tipped her wine glass back and poured the stuff down like water and gave her a great cheer when she showed heeltaps and nothing left and they pounded their approval on the table and stamped their feet as loud as a thirtytwopounder gun being trundled across a wooden deck alan sing us a song keith shouted a good dirty one i couldnt carry a tune in a bucket keith alan complained look this is all very well for you but i have to report to my ship early tomorrow cleareyed and somewhat sober if i know whats good for me wrong answer drink keith ordered and alan remembered once again what he had forgotten in long absence keith ashburn was the sort of takecharge bastard who had to have control over everything wine was slopped into his glass from longrange and some of it got onto dollys gown she halfrose to complain then took her napkin and tried to sponge it out quickly while alan stood and to the thump of fists and feet and the encouraging shouted chorus tipped his wine up and drained it displaying it was empty by balancing it upside down on his head song song mayhew called girls sing us a song serenade us before we strum and serenade you ha ha during the dinner alan had learned that dolly was until three months before the proper if somewhat youngish wife of an officer of the infantry named capt roger fenton he had left her with no debts when he was carried off by a fever soon after their arrival in the islands but he had left her no money either and so far there had been no word in answer to her tearful letters back to england to his last living relatives she did not have the money to pay for a passage back home and was no matter how she might try to economize quickly running out of money and faced penury in the near future heart of oak are our ships heart of oak are our men no no thats not the way it starts shirke corrected hespera after she tried to sing would there be some of that sparkling wine left please doily asked alan her voice almost lost in the sudden din come cheer up my lads tis to glory we steer to add something more to this wonderful year to honor we call you not press you like slaves for who are so free as the sons of the waves what

contest to see whos the best pandora you have a huge set o catsheads hop up here and and show us your carvings the older pandora was helped up onto the table allowed keith to undo her buttons and shucked her sackgown down to her ankles and bared her breasts to the room kneeling on one end of the table and bracing herself with the tall back of a chair to lean forward like a ships figurehead candles were fetched to that end of the room so the men could judge better marvelous keith said ill give her points for size at any rate bit lowslung though not a bit of it mayhew said kneeling on the floor and looking straight up at them in awe easier to get to whilst doing the blanket hornpipe like hie swivel guns alan trot your piece out next she looks promising shirke crowed nice swellings there under her bodice alan turned to her and she shook her head in the negative rather forcefully the first sign of any strong reaction she had shown all night fresh tears streaked her lovely face if youd rather not alan said putting an arm around her thank you she almost shuddered id really the mistress said it would be a nice supper and id really like to go if i may please this is so alan come on try hespera he said over his shoulder she looks like better pickings he led her to the dark end of the room and sat her down on a chair youve not been long at this trade have you dolly tell me true ive heard enough whores lies before to know she turned away from him and began to sob as quietly as she could and he knelt down to put an arm around her once more d dont call me a whore she wept well what would you call it when you show up at a private party for four men and four women alan asked i dont know she muttered in a little girls timbre i was happy to submit to my husbands desires as a p proper wife i thought it would be no in more unpleasant than that but this is low and common alan softened pulling her head over to rest on his shoulder and she submitted easily though one of her hands took hold of his coat lapel and wrenched it into a knot from the strength of her humiliation as she trembled and wept on his coat huzzah for hespera shirke hooted ill name my next ship for you if youll pose for the woodcarver mdear marvelous young poonts you have alan you must come and see theyre like two in one round little darlins with little pink domes atop em for dugs and another little mound of nipple atop that would you believe mm tasty too areolae shirke ashburn informed him at the other end of the room mm youre right most delectable in form and succulence from the latin you know juvenal loved em as do i bettern oysters ere wot bout mine then electra complained slinging her garments to the four winds thort yew wuz sweet hon me me chuck hell with it mayhew shouted alls strip fer a boardin action lets get you out of here alan said damned if he was going to board any woman in public for someone elses amusement and damned if he was going to get anything from dolly under these circumstances oh thank you thank you she uttered brokenly as he lifted her to her feet he led her toward the door stopping to pick up his hanger and clip it to his belt frog on his left hip ought to have some music with this shirke said he went to the door clad only in a loose shirt and shouted down the stairs at the top of his voice a quarterdeck voice that could carry forward in at least half a gale of wind any fiddlers down there hoy we want music up here cant strum without it shake a leg shake a leg wakey wakey lash up and stow stir up your dead arses you farmers the girls were shrieking with laughter as they were pursued in mock chase about the room all of them now totally nude and the males shedding what little they had left upon their persons as they ran and made the floor shudder then there was another wooden sort of thunder the sound of many heavy feet pounding their way up the stairs shirke your musicians are here alan said grabbing dollys hand and running for the only other door to the room bloody good shirke said breaking off and opening the door to face an obese and very outraged magistrate his bailiff and a pack of old gammers from the watch the charlies shirke screamed and slammed the door in their faces all hands prepare to repel boarders alan wasnt prepared to stay and take the consequences he led dolly into a small bedchamber from which there seemed to be no other mode of escape unless they wanted to consider shinnying down a drainpipe from the narrow window to the courtyard below damn he hissed in the darkness he felt along the wall with his free hand until he came upon a small door set into the wall facing the hallway about three feet square it was the closet for the chamberpots so that servants could pick them up from the hallway and empty them without disturbing the lodgers it had not been used so it was empty alan took the two tin pots to the door to the dining room and slung them onto the table youll need these i think he said slamming the door again through there quickly dolly oh god she quailed weakly oh for gods sake follow me then he crawled through saw that the coast was for the moment clear and stepped out into the hall almost dragging the young woman in his wake they straightened their clothing in the small mirror of a hall table at the bend of the corridor and he then quickly led her away from the noise damn he hissed again there was no outside entrance from this hallway they would have to go back the other way which meant running into the disturbance which by now was beginning to sound like a fullsized melee look wipe your tears dolly and look serene or were taken for fair ill try she promised taking a deep steadying breath and groping in her small bag for a handkerchief there do i look calm enough you look lovely alan told her knowing it would buck up her spirits and it did and damme if she dont he thought they advanced on the mob in the hall old men with cudgels from the watch a huge bailiff the size of a plowhorse the magistrate several tavern servants and many patrons who were yelling for either peace and quiet or more drinks shouts could be heard in favor of lynching the riotous heathens in the dining room or the magistrate and his churls or both excuse us excuse us if you please alan said with a fixed smile as he led dolly through the press leaning back as the door was finally booted open and the party responded with a shower of crockery glassware a chamberpot and several gobbets of raisin duff will you let a lady pass please theres a good fellow the charlies from the watch were not having it all their own way they could not use their cudgels and were knotted in the door like a beer bung even with the bailiffs huge shoulder applied to shove them in by force alan put his own shoulder to the back of one old man and pushed and the charlies finally gained the bulwarks but it was a bad mistake for drunken whores and revelers could fight when cornered better than the poorly paid dodderers once on the firstfloor level alan fetched his own hat and led dolly into the street oy aint you one o them a servant cried out as they began to walk away yes you is hoy the watch eres another o the bastards my dear fellow i dont know what youre talking about alan countered but heres a guinea on my reckoning and please inform your cook that it was a splendid supper thankee very much the servant bent over to pick up the guinea from the mud and alan booted him in the face which sent him sprawling out cold cant be too careful you know he said smiling at dolly now lets walk in that direction as quick as damnit but what about your friends back there she asked showing her first signs of amusement all night what will happen to them with friends like that who needs enemies alan shrugged to the devil with em hurry her lodgings were in english harbor so they took a coach over the ridge and alan paid the driver to carry a note to his own inn to his man cony telling him not to wait up but to come fetch him at first light dollys room was in a ratty cheap inn halfway up the hill overlooking the harbor there was one small window a set of sprung chairs and a small round table under it a wardrobe which contained only a pair of dresses and a morning bedgown two large chests one of which she used for a table for her toilet with a tiny mirror propped up on it and a high narrow curtained bedstead and nightstand i must apologize for this she said modestly as she lit the one foul candle on the table below the window when captain fenton was still alive we had a set of rooms in a better lodging house i tried to keep them for a while but they were simply too dear this is all i can afford for now though mistress olivett tells me i may stay in her establishment for very little thats the mother abbess you started working for alan asked removing his coat yes she is dolh replied calm enough about it and how long have you been working for her only a fortnight dolly sighed it hasnt been so bad not until tonight at least i go with the others to call upon gentlemen who wish companionship oh god i suppose i shant get my money for tonight after all a whole crown ive lost and ive nothing left youre getting only a crown out of the guinea we were charged for your services alan gaped what a gyp a guinea she gasped and i thought you were japing me when you said that earlier oh how cruel she is when she knows my need ill give you a guinea and its all yours dolly alan promised her the nights still young he pulled out his watch and took a peek at the facebarely gone nine lets get into bed an expression of disagreement appeared on her features for a moment then she sighed and acquiesced and turned away to undo her gown alan shucked his clothing quickly and flung himself onto the lumpy mattress she came to him after carefully hanging up her gown in the wardrobe she turned her back and he unlaced her stays for her then she sat on the edge of the bed and undid the silk ribands that held her kneelength silk stockings up and she folded them as though they were precious gems he watched her slim back while she worked and admired the venus dimples of her lower back she reached up and took the pins from her hair letting it fall thick and lustrous down her back almost to her waist could we lay under the sheet please alan she asked in her meek little voice again i know its a rather warm night but if you wish dear he said gently finding himself in thrall at the sight of a woman undressing for him and feeling unwilling sympathy for her she was too nice a woman to be forced to prostitute herself far above the regular girls who entered the trade and he felt for her she slid under the sheet with him and lay stiff as a board by his side as he slid over to her he put an arm behind her head and drew her to him so that they lay facing each other and he ran his free hand up and down her ribs and her hip reluctantly she put an arm over him as well this is what i liked best with the captain she whispered and the catch in her voice told him she was about to cry again the being close in the night when he had that part was sometimes almost enjoyable but im sorry she almost sprang from the bed but he restrained her and took her in both arms to let her weep on his bare chest thinking himself such a bloody fool what was he like alan asked minutes later after she had quieted he was much older in his forties she sighed such a kind good man so patient with my frailties and my ignorance im afraid i wasnt much of a catch for him no dowry no lands or rents his family called him a fool to his face a foolish coltstooth to take a younger wife with no prospects and your own family they passed over i was earning my way as a housekeeper in woolwich when the dear captain came to visit my people not a month later we were married and at sea on the way here to antigua and six months after that he died of the fever ah well at least we had almost a year of peaceful existence together before he kissed her cheek and felt the cool dampness of smudged tears he kissed her neck and it was a nice neck long and graceful with so many interesting hollows to explore as were her shoulders and collarbones firm yet yielding apulse with young life say my name alan she whispered dolly he obeyed dearest dolly poor lovely little dolly her arms went about him then and she allowed herself to be rolled over on her back their lips met and no longer merely acquiescent she returned his kiss warming to him and beginning to breathe heavier to stir her arms her hands and her body against his he explored her from brow to knees with his fingertips with his lips and tongue and she began to writhe and moan to whimper and chuckle as he tickled or enfired her by turns all through it he praised her praised her beauty talked to her gently as one would approach a wary puppy or colt and she responded with stronger moans and delighted sighs of impending bliss he kissed his way from her knees up both smooth firm young thighs and over her muff teasing and nipping until she was panting and grasping for him and she opened her thighs wider as he slid up to nuzzle her breasts such fine young breasts with large oval aureoles and taut young nipples that cried out for suckling a moments dispassionate reach for the sheepgut condom on the nightstand and then he was pressing against her netherlips and she arched her back and lifted her hips to press back and he was sliding down that endless tunnel that led to the seat of heaven itself and she cried out like a virgin on her wedding night though she writhed and clung to him like a limpet matching his every movement alan say my name please alan say my name she panted with her mouth against his neck ah yes ah i never knew dolly yes its good so good youre such a good girl such a yes he could feel nothing but belly and breasts perhaps her fingers digging into his shoulders and their groins hear nothing but her cries of pleasure and the quick washdeck pumping noise of lovemaking until she shouted and kept on shouting in an utter transport of joy not long after his own forgehot release dolly yes lovely dolly he muttered soft against her neck as he lay spent on elbows and weak knees over her alan my alan dearest she giggled back trembling still and showering him with smilewidened kisses if lovemaking could always be this way she said much later after their third bout after they had sent down for some wine to cool them my dear girl its supposed to be alan snickered pleased as punch with himself leastways ive always found it so if it could be i could almost bear the shame of being a whore until i hear from rogers relatives of course and get the money to go home she sighed think they like you that much alan asked not meaning to tease her no she replied sitting up to hug her knees with the soggy sheet falling to her waist oh alan ive written and written and theres never a word back from them nothing on the packet ships for me i almost despair sometimes that ill be bound to this life for all time she lay her head on her knees hiding her face in her hair wait a minute alan said propping himself up in the bed on a pile of thick pillows he only died three months ago you say hell its three months by ship back home say here to bermuda to pick up a favorable slant from the highs then on to new york from there and for reply the packet would sail down to portugal and then run west to dominica first they wouldnt even have gotten a word about your poor rogers demise yet and itll most like be another three or four months before you can even expect any kind of answer and i must endure more of this cruelty she gasped oh i cannot bear it i shall have to enter that womans dreadful house after all its the only place that will take me theres housekeeping still alan suggested quite a few households here on antigua would hire a young widow whos experienced at caring for children or such like its not as if you had debts she fell back to lay her head on his stomach and hug him do you think i have not tried alan they have slaves here not hired servants and if hired paid less than a dogs dinner here comes the sly little hand on my pursestrings alan said to himself yet she stayed silent hugging him like a child in her parents lap alright ill say it for her and get it over with damn fool i could loan you a little to tide you over dolly ill not hear of it alan lewrie she replied looking up at his face in the gloom if i needs must i can deal with the humiliation of this shameful trade for a short space and there are still things to sell of my possessions thank you but the answer is no i must own that i am only a weak stupid woman but i can guess what you may think of me if you do loan me money id like you to think better of me than that youre serious he gaped in astonishment that i am she agreed after this delightful experience with you i would not do anything to cheapen our memories of each other id rather starve first oh how masterful you were and how kind to me to take me out of that place rather than shame me by making me behave as those others ive been such a fool to think that taking money for men to pleasure themselves is possible even for a little time you have opened my eyes to how low and base i would have become had you not saved me i shall treasure you forever for that and for this she teased with a shy smile and reached down under the sheet to touch his belly and lions mane another man may wish you to be his and his alone have you heard of mistresses dolly alan asked sounding her out to see if she still rang true that it was not a whores lie yet it would be gentler and safer would it not she asked but i can think of only one gentleman that id care to keep house for another light brush of her fingers over his groin what about your husbands things then have you sold any of that yet i have his chest here but alan i could not bear to part with all that i have left of that gentle wonderful man she objected sadly to auction him off to the highest bidder all that represents whats left of him its too horrid to contemplate lets see what there is alan said sliding out of bed which chest was his the one with the mirror atop she told him and wrapped the top sheet about her as he put on his longtailed shirt they knelt and she unlocked his chest with a key lifted the lid with all the reverence of a parson opening the breadbox of a sunday and he helped her pull out the top tray which was full of papers and correspondence there wasnt much really hats and uniforms of the infantry unit he belonged to breeches and stockings a high pair of boots more suited to a dragoon or horse artillery unit a cheap watch and the mans sword one of middling quality twenty twentyfive guineas for the sword alan said with a heavy sigh the boots might go for five and the watch for ten the chain and fob are worth more maybe one hundred pounds all told but alan thats one hundred pounds more than i have now she said with a childlike burst of hope though i do hate to part with his sword and watch i mean a mans honor his twenty pounds at the least is twenty pounds he wont be needing a sword where hes gone and theres no son to inherit alan said with a harsh rasp he sorted through the papers in the top tray while dolly fetched their wine glasses and topped them up bringing a second candle alan had ordered to better light his perusings at least he didnt leave you any bills from the mess or from his tailors alan jested did you contact his fellow officers what did they say theyd do for you what any man would pay for dolly frowned they thought him a little silly i think and he wasnt exactly that popular with his fellow officers i dont know why but i always got that feeling when we were around them some jealousy some argument or something goddamn alan exclaimed after he had folded out a large sheet of paper all hung with ribands and wax seals youve not talked to them at all i was afraid theyd sneer at me alan she whispered not while you hold his commission document they wouldnt what is that she said with all innocence my dear dolly he began rocked back on his heels by her naivety you know that officers in the british army buy their commissions umhumm and do you know that they pay a lot of money for the privilege of never doing a decent days labor again keep the bloody sword hang the watch in the window for pigeons to peck on heres your real money i meant to have it framed as a memento but i couldnt afford to yet she said staring at him goggleeyed with building wonder why dear lord is every woman i meet and hop into bed with as feeble in the brains as cold boiled mutton he wondered to himself with a shake of his head and a reflective grin it costs an ensign in a good regiment three hundred pounds to buy a commission a lieutenancy goes for about five hundred and i have it on good authority that a captaincy is worth nigh on a thousand pounds dolly as dear rogers nearest living relative the one hes most like willed everything to you now own it dyou see girl its like a smallholding its yours to sell she stared at him as if he wasnt quite getting through to her for money oh alan she shrieked and flung herself on him bearing him over on his back on the cold bare boards to straddle him and chortle with glee while she rained kisses and squeezed until he thought he might see stars im saved im saved you saved me you dear man you wonderful lovely man how can i ever repay you dearest alan well if you put it that way he laughed heartily with her i can go home to england i dont have to be anyones mistress or anyones whore oh out of my darkest night god has shown me the way to security how can i ever thank you im just glad i could do something i wont have to drudge as someones domestic back home i can live well if i watch my pennies and im not a spendthrift i know how to economize and manage i did well enough on rogers pay and the pinmoney he allowed me i made a good home for him and i can make a good home for myself orshe calmedi could make a good home for you yes i could alan i could stay here on antigua take a tidy set of rooms nothing grand no need for servants well maybe a maid to help me clean im used to cleaning for myself alan and she would not have to be a livein just a dayservant whats that six pounds a year and a dress and shoes oh would it not be grand alan you would come in from your ship and we could be together again hmm he considered hard shes a wonderful gallop no question about that and it wouldnt cost me tuppence how many men can boast of free mistresses even if she does stray or take in someone while im at sea its nothing more than im used to already had i bought her id worry about that anyway dolly my dearest loveliest girl ill be gone for months on end id love to see you again but it would be so cruelly lonely for you best you go home to england much as i could wish and if i just happened to be here alan dearest would we be able to share things theres no one else in your life of course we could dolly and no theres no one else oh you have made me the happiest woman tonight in all ways my wonderful alan i had not hoped to aspire to so much joy in my life ever again i shall love and cherish you while i have you and you shall know how much joy youve given me by how much i give myself to you like now say youre not so tired dear alan can we do that again could we please my love ii thou wilt soon die and thou art not yet simple nor free from perturbations nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things nor kindly disposed towards all nor dost thou yet place wisdom only in acting justly meditations iv marcus aurelius chapter his vouchers and records were under his arm and in order in a sailcloth bundle he had traded off his midshipmans rigs sold that now decidedly shoddy dirk that had once gleamed with gold and had his new uniforms in his sea chest there had been a need to dip into his hidden cache of guineas to pay for his new finery to equip himself with the luxury of a personal telescope cases of wine fresh cabin stores such as cheese and jam and he had spent money on his man conys rig as well new shoes and buckles pinchbeck but serviceable a new tarred hat short blue jacket with brass buttons and slop trousers he had not gotten much sleep in the end between the party that had turned into a drunken brawl his escape his passionate night with dolly which had lasted until dawn and then a hectic round of chores he was just about done in up and out on a crust of bread and a single cup of tea to move her to his old lodgings which were a bit more expensive but much nicer and more refined a quick meeting with his shore agent to deal with her affairs with her husbands regiment a gift of twenty pounds to get her settled and tide her over until she could sell roger fentons commission and lastly a quiet word with the agent to tell him to advance her no more than absolutely necessary if she could not sell it at least he decided gaining his first easy breath of the day in the hired boat he did not have a debilitating hangover her sendoff while the coach waited in the street to take him to the docks had damned near killed him and had he partaken as heavily as ashburn and the others the night before she damned well might have then and there das de shrike sah the black boatman told him as he sculled his small bumboat across the still harbor at first light around them the watchbells chimed from over thirty vessels as the morning watch ended and the forenoon began alan consulted his pocket watch and grunted in satisfaction that he would report aboard his new ship just a few minutes after the last stroke of eight in the morning shrike he could see as they got close was foreign in origin probably a prize she sported two masts crossed with squaresail yards but on her after mainmast he could espy a brailedup sail on the lowest yard the crojack which on the threemasters he had served was usually bare on a brig though they would need that main course for more speed for there would be only the forecourse forward which might be winded if the ship sailed in a stern or quarter wind her spanker boom and gaff were also much larger than anything he had seen before and were fixed to an upright spar doubled to the mainmast which officially made her a snow instead of a brig possibly an alteration any captain could make in the rig of his ship without upsetting higher authorities as long as it did not cost the local dockyard too much in government funds or supplies shrikes jibboom and bowsprit were different also steeved at a much less acute angle to the deck which would give her larger headsls and with the big spanker more windward ability damme but shes a shabby old bitch he was forced to admit to cony the hull was dark almost black but like an old coat showing a rusty brown tinge from years of exposure to weather and gallons of paint and unseed oil the gunwale stripe might at one time have been buff but had faded to a scabbed and blistered dingy offwhite and where one expected to see gilt paint around the beakhead entry port and transom carvings white lead had been applied in lieu of a prosperous captains gold her masts though and her running and standing rigging were in excellent shape bespeaking a captain poor in pelf not care shrike the butcher bird alan commented to cony as he spotted the figurehead and pointed it out the birds wings were fanned back as part of the upper beakhead rail supports clawed feet extended in the moment of seizure of prey and the hooked bill open to reveal a red tongue it too needed a paint job to restore the white grey and brown tones of the real bird seen nough of em at ome sir cony grinned in remembrance of his forestrunning days in gloucestershire spikes their kills ta thorn bushes mayhap well be aspikin some frogs an dagoes the same sir well see ahoy the boat came a call from shrikes entry port aye aye cony bawled back at them showing the requisite number of fingers to alert their new ships sideparty to the proper show of respect to be presented the bumboat chunked against the ships side and the native bargee and cony held her fast to the chains while alan squared himself away and took hold of the manropes which were hung oldstyle from the entry port without being strung through the boarding ladder battens it wasnt much of a climb though nothing as tall as a frigates sides and he made it easily without tangling his hanger between his legs or otherwise embarrassing himself the bosuns pipes began to squeal and the marines slapped their muskets to present arms as his head came up over the deck edge and he was about to congratulate himself on arriving with the proper amount of dignity it was at that moment that an impressively large ginger ramcat with pale gold eyes of a most evil cast accosted him at the lip of the entry port the cat took one look at him bottled up arched his back laid back his ears and uttered a loud trilling growl of challenge fuck you too alan gasped almost startled from his grip on the manropes shoo scat the cat took a swipe at him then ran off forward with a howl there to take guard upon the bulwarks and wash himself furiously as he thought up a way to get even lieutenant lewrie come aboard to join alan said once he was safely on his feet on the upper deck there was very little gangway overlooking the waist just high enough above the upper deck to clear the guns ahm fukes the bosun sir a male gorilla in kings coat told him knuckling his rather prominent brow ridge from which sprouted a solid thicket of white eyebrows

asked as rossyngton led him below to the cabins under the quarterdeck rossyngton hid his smirk well not sure of what sort his new first lieutenant was they keep you awake at night expiring with loud thuds sir ah alan managed to say fighting manfully to keep a straight and sober face as was proper to a ships officer rossyngton looked to be the product of a good family a manly get of about seventeen or so years and someone with whom lewrie would have felt at home in shared outlook and by the devilish glint in rossyngtons blue eyes he would have been a mirthful companion were circumstances different the marine sentry at the cabin doors announced him loudly with a smart crash of his musket butt and a voice bade lewrie enter well he aint noah theres a blessing alan thought as he beheld his new master and commander lieutenant lilycrop had to be the oldest junior officer that alan had ever laid eyes on and he had seen some beauties in his time he was near sixty with a face as withered as an illused work glove a pugnosed applecheeked father christmas whose chest and belly had merged into a massive appliance round as iron shot he wore his own hair instead of a wig and that hair was curly and cottonwhite but clubbed back into a seamans queue that even plaited reached down to his middle back lost in the mass of wrinkles about his eyes two bright orbs of brown could now and then be glimpsed lieutenant lewrie sir come aboard to join sir he said producing his ornate commission document which warned nor you nor any of you may fail as you will answer the contrary at your peril his orders from the flag to come aboard and his pay and certificates well sit you down young sir lilycrop growled in a voice gone stentorian and hoarse from a lifetime of barking orders mind the kitty alan halted his descent into the chair and looked down to see a black cat stretched out in the seat tail lazily curling and uncurling like a short commissioning pendant not knowing what to do and never being terribly fond of cats anyway he gently shoved it out of the chair so it could hop down on its own with a small meow of disappointment thats henrietta oh shes a shy un she is but shell take to you soon enough lilycrop said beaming at the black cat dropping into babytalk as he addressed her directly henrietta takes time to make up her mind about people yes she does dont you sweetlin now samson herelilycrop changed tone to introduce alan to a blackandwhiteandgrey particolored ramcat which had jumped up onto his desk to be stroked and picked upnow samson hes a standoffish young lout wont have truck with none but me dysee theres a good boy goddamme somebody in the flagship must have it in for me in the worst way alan sighed to himself ive seen saner people eat bugs in bedlam was there some back i didnt piss down right some grudge getting paid back on me did they mix me up with somebody with two heads god rot em i thought id go the least senior officer into a real ship not this ark lets see what hes made of this youngun of ours samson while lilycrop bent over to peruse his records alan took the time to look about the cabin and it was spartan in the extreme paint the color of old cheese coated the walls and interior partitions the result of mixing what was left over from various lots the deck was covered by sailcloth painted in blackandwhite squares and plain sailcloth made up the curtains over the stern windows but there was no embroidered coverlet over the hanging bedbox no padded cushions on the transom settee the desk the dining table the chairs were all harshly simple and dull as utilitarian as a washhand stand there was no wine cabinet present and alan suffered another qualm as he considered that his new captain was one of those evangelizing teetotalers the sword that hung on the pegs on the wall next to a shabby grogram watch coat was a heavy older straight sword more suitable for an infantry officer in a highland regiment evidently lieutenant lilycrop did not have two farthings to rub together other than naval pay and that none too good for a lieutenant in command of a small ship below the rate come to think on it mines low enough at two shillings six pence a day alan grimaced what does he get four or five at best now that his eyes had adjusted to the gloom of the cabins he could see that there were more cats present a lot more cats of every color and constitution some old and grizzled from fights and amours some spry and young and at least four kittens being nursed by their mother on the captains berth and there was a barely perceptibleodor ah youve done a lot in a little over two years service lilycrop finally commented laying down the documents but not much more practical experience than a halfcooked midshipman aye sir sorry if i do not please but i shall endeavor to do so as we progress together alan said on guard at once but making keen noises a fledglin just outa the nest nay more a chick fresh from the shell lilycrop maundered my last first officer oh now there was a tarryhanded young cock twas sorry i was to lose him but we do what we can with what were given an if the flag says youre to be first lieutenant into shrike then growl i may but agree i must damme i aint that bad alan thought sourly and if he dont like the cut of my jib cant he toss me back for someone else to catch aye sir he replied noncommittal well sir lilycrop left his sulks and got suddenly and alarmingly businesslike shrike is dutchbuilt took by my last ship off st eustatius a year ago shes eighty foot on the range of the deck ninetyeight foot from taffrail to bowsprit an youll note shes beamy like most dutchiestwentyseven foot abeam barely ten foot deep in the hold of two hundred and ten tons burthen she wasnt a fast sailer til i had her jibboom an sprit steeved lower an larger foresls cut we added the horse an the short trysl mizzen to the mainmast to make her more weatherly so shes a snow now tho still rated as a brigrigged sloop started out a tradin brig made of good hamburg oak she dont work much in heavy seas dont need much pumpin out an bein just a quimhair under tenfoot draught an her quickwork flattern any english shipwrightd loft her up she can go places another shipd dread to go youll find her a fiddlers bitch closehauled but shell weather and head reach on any fuckin frigate that ever swum an off the wind longs you keep her quartered an not both sheets aft shell run to loord like a starvin whore but i warn ye now take your eyes off her to play with yourself just a second an shell scare hell out of you if you let her have her head flat down wind weve had her surf up her own bowwave in a halfgale an that with the main course brailed up and if you let her get away shell broach on you fastern you can say damn my eyes aint my fault i see sir alan marveled at the change that had come over lieutenant lilycrop as he got on professional matters weve two little fourpounders on the focsle all shell take for end weight and only twelve sixpounders for the main battery and two of those shifted aft into my quarters to get her stern trimmed down so the fuckin rudderll bite so shes not so crank so shell tack right smart now she looks en flute cause there were two more guns aft once but they wuz bronze trash id have no truck with so i had em put ashore two gunports right forward on the weather deckre empty too to lift her bows proper damned yankees tryin to make a sixteengunned privateer out o her silly fools yankee doodles ya know the jonathons the rebels lilycrop explained as he used the nickname with which alan was not familiar aha alan nodded pierced for sweeps along the gangways above the gun deck too youll find em damned handy for workin outa harbor or off a lee but with so little quickwork youd best not try em when its too windy or shell get away from you under bare poles ever use sweeps no sir alan had to admit well shit lilycrop grumbled sorry sir you were saying like most ships commissioned from prizes on foreign stations shrike has her share of nohopers lilycrop frowned most of her warrants are a bit spavined but with lots of practical experience my crew was as scrofulous a lot as ive ever seen even after my former captain let me have ten prime hands from old bonaventure the usual surly and slackjawed louts youd expect with moren average her number of island blacks and half of those probably runaway slaves in the first place but weve pulled together and ill touch em up sharp when needed im not a tartar when it comes to plyin the cat but i by godll flay a man raw when he needs it not like some of these goddamn psalmsingin hedgepriests in disguise you see clutterin up quarterdecks these days i dont splice the mainbrace nor cosset the people less i see a choir of angels to larboard announcing the apocalypse youre not a hedgepriest are you now lewrie hell no sir alan grinned ow henrietta had made up her mind that his leg encased in brand new silk stocking was a scratching post ah shes takin to you good girl lilycrop said softly laying his head to one side in admiration of his cat let her have a little lap to make friends with you go on pick her up shell purr like a snare drum now you aint a tartar either are you no sir alan said gingerly lifting the cat from his side to sit in his lap where henrietta began to lay down her head and rub to mark him scattering a handful of black fur on his snowywhite breeches firm but fair was the motto i was taught sir good for you then laddie lilycrop nodded agreeably now as to the people caldwell is a sour little shitsack but a good master a bit of a hymnsinger and in another life hed turn evangel on us so dont plan on getting much joy out of him in the wardroom walsham well hes a tailors dummy god help him but what can you expect from marines his sergeant is good though but deaf as a country magistrate master gunner mister cox is a sharpun and fukes is a good bosun but were thin in mates mister lewyss the surgeon is competent but a horrid drinker bein welsh and if i hear that damned harp and his quavery fuckin voice lollopin out those mournful dirges in the mess past eight bells o the second dog ill kick your young arse so you can kick his mister henry biggs the purser is the biggest weasel ive ever come across and thats sayin somethin after fifty year at sea man and boy youll watch him like a hawk and if you discover how he prospers youll be the first midshipmenre just about what youd expect one stupid as cowpats and tother too clever for his own good that would be rossyngton the clever one sir alan said as henrietta draped herself over his chest like a warm blanket and began to vibrate and snore her paws kneading his shirt front with sharp little claws youre smart as paint lewrie tother mister edgar is not too long off the dung wagon and i spect if it was rainin claret hed have a colander to catch it in and hed drop that clumsy young bastard stepped on pitts tail tother day who sir the ginger torn lives forrard weve met sir alan stated worst disposition in a cat ive ever seen lilycrop confessed know why i named him pitt hey no sir because i absolutely despise the bastard lilycrop boomed with a short bark of laughter at his own wit rapacious sir most rapacious mouser ive ever seen got the soul of a masteratarms though come to think of it those are good traits in a prime minister too with so many cats aboard i should think shrike would not be plagued with rodents like other ships sir their tribe stand no chance of prosperin lilycrop boasted then what do the midshipmen eat sir alan asked ha ha youre a wag sir lilycrop boomed again i can tell well get on if theres a brain hidden behind all that dandyprattery well id expect youd like to get settled into your cabin and get all squared away youll find my order book and all that bum fodder to look over and then i expect youll go over the ship and make your acquaintances see what we have to work with god help us thank you sir got any questions see me on the sly lilycrop commanded cant let the people or the warrants think youre slackwitted or not experienced enough would you like a kitten um not right now sir youre not one of those people who cant abide the little darlins are you lewie lilycrop looked at him sternly oh no sir alan assured him quickly its just that none of my other ships ran to pets and i do want to find my feet first well keep it in mind weve four newuns ready for weanin in a week or so thatll be all lewrie aye aye sir alan replied standing up and trying to disentangle henrietta from her deathgrip on his shirt she finally scaled his back scratching him on the nape on her way down to the chair where she reensconced herself and began to wash lilycrop turned to stare at a large shallow wooden box by the quartergallery and bawled for his steward gooch aye sir a wizened little mouse of a man asked popping out of the captains pantry by the chartroom cat shit gooch aye aye sir right away sir ive always believed it alan told himself as he pored over the captains order book of set instructions in his small cabin not one captain on the face of this earth is dealing with a healthy mind theyre all daft as bats this lilycrop makes treghues look sane as a banking house what did i do to deserve this who did i fuck who did i not fuck the officers wardroom was not in the extreme stern in shrike but aft of the mainmast and ahead of stores rooms as a singledeck ship she had to cram all her holds and stores onto one deck along with all her personnel accommodations there was a solid deck under the focsle broken aft of the galley into a capacious hold to allow her to stay at sea for up to three months seamen were berthed above the stores kegs and barrels on a temporary messdeck flooring swung in hammocks with the last two rows furthest aft reserved for the marine complement aft of the marines there was room for the officers and senior warrants with the main after hatch leading down just before the deal partitions that screened it off from the marines the captain was kept in his rather spartan splendor in what was called a hanging cabin under the highly steeved quarterdeck which had a break much like a threefoothigh poop deck near the taffrail to give him standing headroom this cut the wardroom off from all sunlight even though it was above the waterline but the only openings to the outside were gunports that were kept tightly sealed unless the ship cleared for action alans cabin was right aft on the larboard side hard up against the after bread room spirit store and fish room which added to the miasma of cat droppings and the usual human odors if he thought that promotion to lieutenant would get him any more splendor of his own he was sadly mistaken the cabin was six feet wide which left room for a washhand stand and his sea chest about six feet six inches long to accommodate a fixed berth raised up high enough to give him some storage underneath near the door at the foot of the bed there was a tiny portable writing desk a threetiered bookshelf already filled with the accumulated reading of an entire commission and a stool to sit on while he wrote letters or conducted ships business across from his cabin the surgeon dr lewyss was housed the next two cabins were for the sailing master to larboard and the purser to starboard forward of those the cabins got smaller to make walking space around the fixed dining table and the hatchway to the orlop stores walsham the marine officer the captains clerk fukes the bosun cox the gunner and mr pebble the enfeebled carpenter had those cabins the spare cabin that completed the starboard tier was wardroom stores and the captains servant and the wardroom servant swung their hammocks in there above the personal food and drink for the officers and warrants the many cats may have cut down on the usual rat population but the ship teemed with cockroaches small ones admittedly since the cats would chase anything large enough to entertain them the only blessing for the crew who normally had only twentyeight inches in which to sling a fourteeninchwide hammock was that the ship was not at her fullrated complement of one hundred and ten people but was six hands short in seamen and four in servants and that the marine party which would not normally be aboard so small a brig was only sixteen privates two corporals a sergeant and walsham being rated a fourteengunned ship in official records could be a blessing alan lay propped up on his bunk reading the surgeon was stoking up his harp and singing some welsh song of unrequited misery accompanied by someone on a flute who was as mournful a specter as the doctor alan didnt think he would enjoy wardroom life if that was the best entertainment they had to offer besides lieutenant railsford had warned him to stay aloof hard as it would be on his congenial and garrulous nature eager as he was for companionship and no matter how old the others were in the wardroom he was senior to them and could only damage his credibility and authority if he was to join in their simple pleasures he was the captains voice in all things the one who would brook no dissatisfaction with a captains decisions or allow anyone to carp or cavil no wonder old lieutenant swift in ariadne was such a dry stick alan sighed wondering if he was up to all the demands that would be made on his abilities getting lost in the knowledge that he was pretty much in charge of all the various punishments books logs charts pay vouchers rating certificates prize certificates damned few of those he noted grimly quarterbills watch bills and professional records of the entire crew it really would have been much nicer to have been second officer in a slightly larger frigate than desperate even the fifth or sixth lieutenant in a ship of the line where he could hide and enjoy the joyous spirit of a drunken officers mess without having his young arse on the line at all hours the paper work was as usual putting his mind into full yawn and he wasnt through half of it once more he felt as if a terrible mistake had been made by a clumsy or inattentive clerk in the flagship putting such a pompous little fraud as himself into such responsibility no matter what railsford had said he felt like a total sham only waiting for the awful moment of truth when he would be exposed to the world supper the servant called from beyond the door he tossed the paper work to the foot of his bunk and shrugged into his coat to join the others cony was there helping out in serving and the two midshipmen had come up from their small dungeon in the after orlop where they usually berthed with the surgeons mate masters mate and other junior warrants rossyngton looked presentable but alan had a chance to get a good look at mr edgar and he was a perfect example of pimplyfaced perplexity all elbows and huge feet a uniform that appeared to be wearing him instead of the other way around and that none too clean he was introduced to biggs the only senior warrant he had not met on his first rounds of the ship and saw why the captain considered him a weasel the purser was a slovenly man of middle height who gave an impression of being much shorter and rounder due to his furtive posture and constantly shifting eyes and hands i wouldnt sport a bottle for any one of these bastards if i saw them parching in hell he thought glumly as senior in the mess may i propose a toast to our new arrival caldwell the sailing master intoned somberly senior my eyes damn yer blood mister lewyss snapped dont let your doglatin go to your head lewyss caldwell cautioned im not much of a drinkin man but tis the spirit of the occasion since i am seated at the head of the table lets have done with talk of who is senior mister caldwell alan quipped and i thank you for your sentiments but i would prefer if you give me first opportunity to propose a toast instead to shrike aye to shrike they mumbled a little abashed that alan had too pointedly reminded them of just who was senior in the mess young as he was supper wasnt too bad really there was an island pepperpot soup seasoned with every variety of pepper known to man and flavored with shredded bits of fish roast kid and fresh bread instead of the usual hard biscuit along with a wine that could only have been fermented from vinegar cat droppings and bilge scrapings my word thats terrible alan sputtered after his first sip mister biggs do you think this wine failed to travel well or was it dead before boarding nothing wrong with this wine young sir biggs stated as if he was addressing one of the midshipmen tis s not claret but suitable for navy issue from ashore sames every other ship in harbor the wine stinks mister biggs alan said with as much severity as he could summon and you shall address me as sir without the added modifier of young it tastes to me as if it had been diluted with water scrubbing vinegar and a dollop of poor french brandy to give it a disguising character do you concur with that mister lewyss youre a medical mansee what your nose tells you ratafia for sure sir lewyss said after dipping his long nose into his glass and pointedly making sure that he addressed the first lieutenant correctly as to the water it is not the usual kegged water from the holds but it is a thin wine that cannot be disputed sir how many gallons of this do we have aboard mister biggs um of this particular lot that is biggs got shifty yes of this particular lot alan went on why i believe there was thirty tengallon barricoes or so biggs replied in a much more humble tone of voice almost wringing his hands with his eyes shifting from one side of his plate to the other unable to match glances with the others at the table got a good price on the lot but not so much as to make me suspicious of the sellers goods sir tomorrow morning following breakfast you the masters mate and the bosun shall hoist all of those barricoes out and taste them to determine their suitability mister fukes may i trust your palate in judging good wine or bad oh ah kin tell good wine sir the gorilla beamed spreading his mouth so wide it looked like a hawse hole perhaps a medical opinion as well sir lewyss volunteered thank you for your generous offer mister lewyss yes you may consider yourself one of the judges now if its all bad mind i want it condemned and returned to the seller i shall inform the captain of unsuitable stores i assume the hands are issued this poor excuse for black strap as well mister biggs well thatll never do turn it in and youd best let mister lewyss and the bosun taste whatever you find in replacement i trust this shall not upset your books too much it would be a bloody disaster biggs probably had not paid three shillings a gallon for the stuff though the ships books would show a larger sum of that alan was sure after being mister cheathams pupil in desperate long enough to learn how many fiddles an unscrupulous pusser could work biggs would make no money on this exchange cony would you be so good as to go into my personal stores alan bade his servant i took the precaution of providing myself with a small fivegallon keg of captured bordeaux and in place of this lot i would be happy to offer it to assuage our thirsts this evening at least its not a really fine vintage but more palatable than this biggs was the only one who did not cheer alans munificence but he did put away a fair share of it when it arrived for decanting among eleven of them it went fast but there was opportunity to send ashore on the morrow for replacement so alan didnt think it a bad trade at all he had stuck a baulk in biggss spokes put him on guard that he would be closely scrutinized from then on and in so doing to one of their number most despised as most pursers were had won a slight bit of grudging respect from the other members of his mess for such sagacity in one so young after supper though after he had stifled lewyss and his infernal harp and walshams bloody flute there were still ships books to study he was the only one to keep a lamp burning after the pm lights out listening to the others fart in their sleep belch groan and snore prodigiously listening to the ship as she creaked now and then and the sound of the harbor watch on the deck over his head the chime of the bells as time progressedand several slanging matches between cats who had decided on animosity during their nocturnal turns of the deck there wasnt much in the punishment book the log of defaulters and how many strokes they had received for their sins at least not in the last few months ships crews usually settled down after a while even the worst collections of cutthroats cutpurses and footpads once they got used to a master and his ways there were no entries for less than two dozen lashes except in the case of boyservants and the midshipmen who got caned bent over a gun with a more gentle rope starter but there were also several entries for three dozen four dozen mostly for fighting or drunkenness or sleeping on watch and some rare insubordination a captain could not impose more than two dozen lashes with the cat by admiralty regulations but alan had also learned long before that no one at the admiralty would even open one eye from a long snooze to hear of a captain assigning more captains were much like god once at sea on their own and their judgement was mostly trusted unless they were patently proven to be one of gods own lunaticks likewise the log it was boring in the extreme capable of being read by flipping through the pages almost without looking for the ship had seemed to cruise on her own without seeing a damned thing or taking part in any action since her commissioning there was a convoy or two some messages run north to the bahamas or west to jamaica and suspicious sail seen but never followed up aggressively and once they disappeared below the horizon lost to mind not a penny of prizemoney alan sighed thinking of how much he had made legally and illegally in desperate and even in parrot lilycrop must be the most contented man with naval pay in the whole world how longs he been in the navy anyway fifty years did he say man and boy joined ateight say and probably thirty thirtyfive years a lieutenant with the war almost lost in the americas this is the only command hell ever hope to have most like but then why not be ambitious and make the most of it if he stayed in the navy all those years in hopes of advancement why not parley this little brig into a twentygun sloop of war commanders rank even a jump to postrank all it takes is one bloody victorious action god knows look at that idiot treghues is he afraid of getting her rigging cut up and untidy god help us would it scare his precious cats more like it is he afraid of losing her that must be it he decided congratulating himself on what a slyboots he was to figure this out so early at the end of this commission in two years or the end of the war which might come at any time lilycrop would go onto the beach with a small pension carried on admiralty records still as a halfpay lieutenant unless he did something to blot his copy book a commission was for life unless one resigned it or was caught in some terrible error in judgement a man close to even so little financial security would not err either in commission or omission he would not jump either way and end his days snug as houses but if the war ends soon theres only so much time left for me to do something alan fretted to himself damme its happening i am taking me seriously but im first lieutenant of a brig owar and if we come across a foe i could goad him into action now that i am commissioned why not make the most of it while theres still a war on too weary to read any longer he blew out his lantern a new pewter one with muscovy glass panels he had purchased the day before and stretched out to sleep until cony came to call him at the end of the middle watch at am so he could supervise the morning cleaning it took him a while to drop off though william pitt had run across another ramcat in his nighttime perambulations and they had a protracted melee that went from the taffrail to the focsle and back and damned if he didnt think the harborwatch wasnt betting on them and egging them on we shall be gettin underway tomorrow on the ebbin tide the captain had told him and alan had sweated blood trying to determine if shrike was in all respects ready for sea the duties of a first officer were galling in the extreme taking nothing for granted forcing the warrants to swear to his face that they had all they needed and if not then why didnt they say something earlier which had prompted another flurry of activity to complete stores until he could go aft and inform lilycrop and samson and henrietta and mopsy and hodge and the so far unnamed kittens et al that yes shrike was indeed ready to go to sea then there had been another utter frenzy for lieutenant lewrie to see to everything that could be seen to were the braces lifts topsl halyards tacks sheets coiled down and ready for running were there enough belays were the lower booms swung in and crutched the logline hourglasses and heaving lines had to be brought up the yards had to be got up for the tgallants and royals and the stunsls ready for deployment chafing gear had to be renewed on yard slings and quarters on anything that could rub and chafe aloft had old mister pebble sounded the pumpwells checked the scupper flaps hawse bucklers fitted the gunports with splashboards etc were the boats secured and the yards squared and all the safety equipment laid out for the hands were the guns securely bowsed down with tompions in had the quartermaster put the helm hardover a couple of times to see if the tillerrope ran freely were the catting and fishtackles rove and the main capstan and jeer capstan overhauled if one little thing went awry it was the first lieutenants fault if everything went well then it was the captains credit alan was trembling like an aspen in a high wind by the time he had finished his lastminute checks and his hands were best off in his pockets where they would not betray his nervousness ready for sea mister lewrie lilycrop asked lazily as he came on the quarterdeck he had one of the kittens in his hands aye aye sir ready for sea alan stammered already reduced to a shuddering wreck shouldnt be too bad at slack water just afore the ebb lieutenant lilycrop surmised sniffing the slight breeze very well then you may proceed sir me alan gaped staring at him slackjawed and trying to think of the proper commands yes you sir bosun pipe all hands stations for getting under way god it was a madhouse on that single deck crowded already with guns and their assorted tackle with all the running rigging in flaked heaps the topsl halyard men already snarling at the focsle captain and his crew for walking space the hands around the capstans and the nippermen ready with the messenger capstans ready some kind soul shouted back or alan would have never thought of it b bring to the messenger three and a half turns of the lighter line were wound about the capstan and the nippermen seized the lighter messenger line to the thicker cable thank bloody christ somebody knows what theyre doing for it sure aint me he thought as he saw men manning the bars dropping them into the pigeonholes securing the droppins and breasting to the bars fleet the messenger and two men on each capstan plied their middlemallets to force the turns of the messenger up the drum of the capstan to make room for the turns to come as they heaved in bloody hell makes me wish id paid more attention to these things before thought alan heave around he shouted trying to keep his voice from breaking the pawls clanked slowly as the men walked about the drums of the capstans chests pressing against the bars with their hands gripping the wood from below thumbs turned outward to avoid injury at long stays came a wail from the focsle heave chearly alan encouraged them as the cable came in at a much steeper angle from the bottom short stays id not forget the dry nippers for the heavy heave lilycrop said at his elbow suddenly as he held up the kitten to observe so much activity aint it a show littlun do you wish to set sail at short stays sir alan asked i leave it to you mister lewrie proceed god rot and damn the man alan thought ready to weep dry nippers ready for the heavy heave surge ho up an down sir heave and pawl suddenly the men at the capstan bars leaned forward and the pawls began to clank faster and faster the anchor had broken free of the bottom and was on its way up and the ship was under way under bare poles in the light wind in english harbor and just as suddenly alan lewrie realized that it was an incredibly crowded english harbor there was an armed transport big as a bloody island astern not one cable off toward which they were slowly drifting an anchored line of seventyfours to starboard and a line of warping posts to larboard upon which some newly repaired rd rate lineofbattle ship was making her way toward the outer roads and shrike was in the way of her towing boats hee hee lilycrop laughed softly as he read the angry hoist from the postcaptain whose way had been interposed hes not happy with us i can tell you mister lewrie anchors awash heave and awash then cats twoblocked well the cat vast heaving alan ordered bosun make sail topmen aloft it was really comfortable being a midshipman even being a masters mate alan thought in despair as that armed transport loomed even larger as they made a slow sternboard down onto her youll not fuck up my transom paint will you mister lewrie lilycrop asked as if he were out strolling piccadilly or st jamess park ill try not to by god sir loose foresails head sheets to starboard lead out topsl sheets and halyards ready aloft lay out and loose shrike obstinately refused to turn still making her slow sternboard and the loosed fore topsl went flat aback giving her even more impetus to ram that damned armed transport spare hands to starboard lilycrop whispered sagely run out numberone gun to starboard having no better idea in mind alan repeated the command and he was amazed that the bows slowly inclined right as men and marines and an artillery piece canted her deck slightly in the same direction let fall aloft hands to the braces dont forget the bloody anchor mind lilycrop whispered once more allowing the kitten to climb on his shoulder and tenuously balance man the cat and haul taut theyve done that lilycrop advised rig the fish quartermaster hows her helm ard up ta larboard zurr no bite nah ere she coom zurr sheet home and hoist away topsls lay aft to the braces port head starboard main port crojack the anchor lilycrop prompted and we dont have a crojack man the fish haul taut alan had a chance to glance around and his heart leaped into his mouth and he chilled all over they had succeeded in getting her sternboard stopped the bows around but she was close enough to the transport to make out features of the people on her rails as shrike began to go ahead slowly walk away with the fish brace up the head sheets ease the helm quartermaster lay us to windward of those anchored seventyfours aye zurr well the fish sir belay ring up the anchor unrig the fish thank god alan could only gasp and that to himself as he dug out a handkerchief to mop himself down the ship was now under way clear of that transport away from that frustrated postcaptain well up to windward from the anchored ships of the line the mess on the deck was being flaked down the yards were braced up the head sheets and spanker were trimmed up and the bower was secured forward but the ordeal was only beginning for the exit from english harbor to the outer roads and the open sea was a tortuous doglegged channel framed by high hills and that meant capricious winds that could veer from one beam to another at a seconds notice id not like to get a nasty letter from his excellency admiral hood cause you forgot passin honors to the flag mister lewrie the captain said oh god was the last thing alan remembered he said the gun and flag salutes to hood to comdr sir george sinclair the forts by the outer roads the trip down the roads and out to sea getting the courses on her selecting a passage northabout to antiguas lee for the bahamas it all passed in an unreal fog that he could never recall even in later years and every time he thought of it his skin crawled he turned the watch over to the sailing master mister caldwell and went below to sponge himself down with a bucket of seawater and to don dry clothing his previous garments wringing wet with perspiration passin the word fer the first lieutenant oh god here comes the axe alan thought with a heavy sigh he went aft to the captains cabins lieutenant lilycrop was looking comfortable in old and patched slop trousers rolled up to the knees a loose shirt without stock and at the moment no stockings or shoes either sit ye down mister lewrie sip o somethirf black strap miss taylor got some right nice cider all fizzy an tangy cider sir alan said grateful for lilycrops obvious show of good cheer maybe i wont get a cobbing he thought hopefully ah good gooch cider for lieutenant lewrie and smallbeer for me thatll be all gooch he added as the drinks were put out on the desk they waited while gooch finished his puttering and departed the cabins lilycrop picked up his mug of beer and took a sip alan tasted his cider they sat and sipped and looked at each other for what felt like about a full watchglass lilycrop belched loudly to break the silence well now this mornin gettin under way he said softly that wasdammethat was entertainin sir im sorry sir i know i must have made a total fool of myself alan confessed burning with sudden shame twas a shambles i dont think shambles really does it justice pon my soul i dont lilycrop told him sadly but with a trace of a wry grin as if he truly did find some cruel amusement in alans discomfiture i thought i had the ship ready to weigh sir but i never had a thought youd trust me to take her out the first time and i wasnt ready alan tried by way of explanation she was ready to weigh ill give you that lilycrop agreed but your choice of timin and the way you parroted the commands like youd read em out of a book thout understandin a word you were sayin it was the first time i was ever allowed to weigh anchor and take a ship out sir alan said trying to defend himself god help me then whats the navy thinkin of to send me a newly so unprepared lilycrop spat that wry grin now gone as for givin you the deck how am i to find out what sort of sailor you are if i dont test your abilities why the hell are you wearin the coat of a commission officer if you have to be warned to be ready for any eventuality you should know to be prepared i dont know sir alan said in a hoarse whisper you come from money no sir not really got relatives to give you interest an place no sir but you made masters mate an then lieutenant in a little over two years lilycrop carped on petulantly done some brave things by your record been in some fights brought up like a hothouse rose on blood an thunder and not proper shiphandlin i know theres a war on but even so id not like to think that a panel of hardnosed postcaptains would pass a total fool an then shove you into such a responsible position thout they saw somethin in you worth promotion one would hope they knew what they were doing sir alan said hanging onto that scrap of legitimacy youre not somebodys favorite protege are you um i exchange letters with sir onsley matthews sir and lord and lady cantner but no one of note locally so if i tossed you back for the fish to play with nobodyd have my head for it would they now lilycrop demanded no sir alan had to admit his eyes stinging at the thought of being turned out of his first posting as a commission officer within a week as an incompetent damme he thought i dont love the bloody navy any more today than i did a month ago but ill be damned to hell if ill suffer that humiliation at least god let me leave this shitten mess with my credit intact with my pride still attached if it is your intention to ask for a replacement sir i shall understand but damme alan could not go on without breaking down as the sick shame of it overwhelmed him and his stomach fermented well i have no intention of doin so at present lilycrop told him he belched once more drained his beer and padded in his bare feet to the pantry where he fetched out a squat leathercovered bottle of brandy youve been prizemaster in that frigate your captain took prizemaster in another ship last year and you managed that well enough as the records say quite resourcefully youve stood in charge of a quarterdeck as masters mate there is that sir lilycrop sipped from the neck of the brandy bottle as he paced about his day cabin pausing to pet the odd cat he peered into alans mug of cider and topped off what little was left with a liberal potation of brandy then sat down behind his desk once more feet up on the top i come up from powdermonkey lilycrop informed him then boy servant midshipman and masters mate spent ten years a passed midshipman an only made lieutenant after pondichery under pocock in an that was more due the death rate in india beyond navy pay ive not got the means to even burn good candles stead of rush dips i should despise your fortunate young arse sir aye sir alan nodded looking down and sniffing the brandy fumes unable to face the man but fifty years in the fleet has taught me one thing boy the navy dont let politics interfere when it comes to promotin fools or gettin rid of em the rest of our society is trash spendin and gettin schemin and backstabbin but by god sir the navy is one of the few institutions the anglosaxon race ever produced that kept its hawse clear of most of that cause if we go under someday an put the titled gentlemen back in charge with the real sailors on the orlop then england is gonna end up some frog kings playground aye sir so ill trust the examinin board for now an allow as how they know what they saw in you youll stay my first officer until you either improve or you prove that youre a fraud and a sham and ill have you out of my ship before you can say jackketch thank you sir alan almost gushed in sudden relief now for starters youll not dash about gettin in what little hair the warrants have left tryin to tell em their jobs they neverd even have their warrants if they hadnt proved themselves already and id have booted em back on the beach if they were frauds too aye sir ill not but yes i mean as first officer i have to know if theyre ready or how may i present the ship to you as a going concern i was taught to check up sir all you have to do is ask or order not go below seein to every little piddlin detail like you did yesterday hell boy therere as many ways to run a ship as there are captains and most of em work we may look pinchbeck but were set up bristolfashion and nobody can fault our little ship nor any man in her so you do like i say from now on and trust your warrants and mates you give em trust they learn to trust you course it never hurts once you got your course steady to find em out in some little somethin to prove youre on the hop stir up one division a week at divisions or an exercise an theyll not let you down when it comes to the major stuff i see sir and god help me ill trust you long as you dont go off and do somethin damnfool lunatick with my ship as for this mornin ill say no more about it were at sea now and youve already proved you can handle that lilycrop relented my order book tells you when i should be called on deck an youll have noted already that i want to be summoned anytime we have to reef make sail or alter course so you arent totally on your own bottom not yet anyway aye sir good now ill be wantin you to shake this crew of buggers up for me lewrie weve spent three weeks in port an had four days outa discipline with the doxies aboard an thats bad for em theyve gone stale on quim an drink whats more the ships most likely full of shore bugs an i cant abide a lousy ship just got rid of most of the fleas an i dont want the cats to go through another bout of all that scratchin an nibblin aye sir alan replied much more forcefully now that he knew he had been given a second chance he even ventured to take a sip of his ciderand and savor the bite of the brandy smoke and scour in the day watch today sir thats my lad lilycrop nodded with a bright smile an in the mornin watch tomorrow start bringin em to heel an brightenin em up sail drill well need to go closehauled to make our eastin for new providence so we can practice tackin til clear decks n up spirits gun drill in the afternoon sir alan suggested so i may discover how good your gunners are exactly youll find cox is a capable shitsack but inclined to be a little lazy live firin if youve a mind theres a keg or two of powder from the bottom tier thats suspect i wouldnt mind expendin though we might find some island on passage to serve for a target an get more practical use from the firin ill leave the rest up to you as to what drill an when might throw in a night fire drill after lights out we havent done that in a month take one thing at a time mind lilycrop warned wagging a finger at him dont overfinesse an end up confusin em nor confusin yourself i wont sir alan swore i suppose i need the practice as much as the crew does aye you do an im hopeful if you may admit it so chearly lilycrop rejoined what watches you down for middle and the forenoon sir alternating the dogwatches alan told him it was an easy schedule except for having to stay up and awake from midnight to am on the middle watch for he could nap in the first or second dogwatch perhaps snooze away a little of the afternoon after drills while supposedly overlooking ships books and get about five hours sleep in the evening before having to take over the deck at midnight a watch in which almost nothing ever happened in fair weather no youre the first lieutenant run the drills in the forenoon an let caldwell or webster the masters mate have that watch lilycrop ordained easily his eyes crinkling in seeming amusement once dinner then drills again in the day watch you put yourself down for the evenin watch an the mornin those were tuckwells you can sleep midnight to am an caulk a bit during the dogs everythin bein peaceable aye sir alan nodded full of outward agreement but fuming at the loss of sleep he would suffer between watchstanding and running exercises thatll be all for now young sir lilycrop told him picking up henrietta the black cat as she meowed at his side for attention let us pray you find your feet in the next few weeks then we may look back on your performance this mornin an laugh about it together it did have its mirthsome moments indeed it did hee hee once lewrie had left his cabins lieutenant lilycrop allowed himself a soft chuckle of congratulations and lifted the cat up to his face to nuzzle whiskers with her now did i put the fear of god into that upstart whelp or did i not puss he aint worth a tinkers damn right now ill tell you truly maybe hes got the makins maybe not what do you think will he do sweetlin ill promise you this by the time i get through with him hell be a sight better or you an the kitties can feed on his tripes would you like that henrietta would and licked her small chops with a pink tongue on the quarterdeck alan lewrie felt as if he had already been eviscerated for his tripes he looked at the dour little sailing master and his minions who sidled down to the leeward side out of his way and whispered among themselves most likely it was conventional ships business they were discussing but at the moment he was sure they were rehashing his shambles in secret glee god how much worse a showing could i have made or is such a thing possible he scoured himself well i didnt sink us theres a hopeful thought what were they thinking of to put me here or is shrike such a collection of nohopers that they thought id fit right in much as he disliked the deprivations of naval life cared not a whit for most of the drudgery the lack of sleep and the excruciatingly demanding level of skill necessary to merely survive in the fleet there was in his nature a stubborn streak the more he replayed the cobbing he had received the angrier he got with lilycrop for being so amused and then with himself for providing the older man with such a pitiful show of seamanly competence and the worst thing was that he knew he wasnt all that bad the navy had beaten competence into him dragged him kicking and screaming and complaining from former disdain into knowledge of his profession maybe he was in way over his depth at the moment but at least he had been given a second chance if only because there could be no ready replacement available until they got to new providence or back to antigua and god knew when that would be if there had been a ready escape he might gladly have chucked the whole thing right then and there but since there wasnt he could try to satisfy the eccentric old man back aft his pride was on the line along with all the good credit he had made for his name how can i go back to london after the war a failure even at this he wondered railsfords right its a gentlemanly calling for such as me ive no head for trade for law or parliament not enough money to live an idle life no one to sponsor me if i blow the gaff as a sea officer right then ill take the proverbial round turn an two halfhitches and ill stop that catloving sonofabitch from sneering ill go back home a halfpay lieutenant former first officer and hold my head up against any of those lazy bucks i knew before damme if i wont but laugh about this later i sincerely fucking doubt it chapter chapter shrike saw nothing of interest for the next two months other than islands and those only in passing after a trip to new providence they patrolled the extreme edge of the hunting grounds split between the leeward islands squadron and the bahamas squadron north of the mona passage beating to windward far out to sea above the danish virgins snooping north of puerto rico given the reputed volume of smuggling going on the number of privateers on the prowl and the threat of spanish or french warships they should have seen something but the sea remained achingly empty from one distant landfall to the next and they never went close enough inshore to see anything more using islands only as convenient proofs of the accuracy of their navigation during this time alan couldnt have cared less if a spanish treasure galleon had come right aboard and begged to be looted and that galleon replete with a traveling viceroys brothel the initial shame and humiliation still gnawed at him try as he did to put it behind him and concentrate on the job at hand and the job often threatened to swamp him after those two months he was sure that he was the most despised man aboard the brig of war he had run his drills and gotten his breath back and riled the gunner and his mates in the process even if he knew artillery as well as they cox and his minions didnt like being drilled so often with so many livefirings at floating kegs or empty coops it fouled the guns it made work to clean to sew up new cartridge bags to shift powder kegs out of the hold he had forced them to sway out the swivels and drill with them which created more work shrike had been loafing along for months with no real effort put to her warlike nature much like alans first ship ariadne had been and the gunnery department resisted his wishes to spruce up fukes the bosun glared daggers at him worrying if he was going to order stunsls rigged out topmasts struck or merely work the ship from one point of sail to the other at a moments notice but he reassured himself lilycrop had told him to smarten the people up and showed no signs that he disagreed with alans timing or choice of drills during those two months they went through several half or full gales nothing like the terror of autumnal hurricanes but scary enough to pucker alans fundaments as he stood on deck watch after watch with no chance to go below frightened that each helm command or action on his part would put them under in the twinkling of an eye shrike did not help for she truly was a bitch pitching about like a woodchip in the heavy seas rolling on her beam ends since she was so light and had so little below the waterline unlike his previous ships and lilycrop had been accurate in his description of how she would almost run away with them in brisk winds unless they watched her helm or kept too much sail up too long god help him even the weather seemed to conspire against him order masts struck too soon and the threatening squall lines of early afternoon would blow out and the sky would be painted with lovely and pacific sunsets trust that it would do so again the next time the horizon gloomed up and they would be ankle deep in rain and foam breaking over her rails as they fought to reef down until it blew over and through it all there was lilycrop damn his blood eyeing alans efforts with that maddening little smile his eyes atwinkle and another kitten being strolled about the decks sometimes that tiny hee hee could be heard from the skylight or the companionway lilycrop didnt spend much time talking to him and when he did it was the same sort of needling he had gotten after his disaster in leaving english harbor oh there was some pithy bits slung in now and again as admonitions to not do something like this or that depending on which exercise or evolution they had been forced into but nary a word of praise even the faintest sort even when alan had the time to realize that he had done something close to right and frankly he was getting damned tired of lilycrops attitude it got to the point that when the captain was on the deck watching lewrie perform alan tensed up so much he could barely keep his victuals down and his mind would go blank under that amused stare to utter the right commands was a daily victory over his unsteady nerves they were over halfway through their supplies another two weeks of patrol and they would have to go back to antigua to resupply and alan had absolutely no idea if he would be retained or chucked out for incompetence alan was sure lilycrop would wait until the last moment after they dropped anchor to tell him he was out and the uncertainty was enough to make him want to scream finally on a fine day while the hands were enjoying their rum ration he stirred up his courage and accosted lilycrop on the quarterdeck perversely wanting to know his fate though dreading it dine with me tonight then lilycrop said ending his stroll about the deck and going below still wearing that enigmatic twinkle aye sir alan replied trying to sound cheerful for the invitation the first of its kind since he had come aboard probably tell me with the port so i can weep in private he quailed sadly but he showed up halfway through the second dogwatch turned out in his best kit and let the marine sentry announce him and pass him aft into the great cabin to hear his fate ah right on time i see lilycrop beamed at him waving him to a chair gooch get the first lieutenant a glass of whatever strikes his fancy lilycrop had tricked himself out in his best uniform as well and the white coat lapels shirt waistcoat and breeches gleamed in the candle and lantern light dressed for my execution alan cringed to himself alan got a glass of poor black straplilycrops purse did not run to claret or bordeauxlilycrop was already slurping away at a mug of brandy and from the harsh reek of the fumes that alan could smell all the way across the cabin it was no better than captured french ratafia the raw stuff they issued their wretched sailors were havin a joint of pork tonight mister lewrie lilycrop told him genially one of the shoats escaped the manger and took his death dive down the forrud hatchway thought pigsd survive a fall such as that tis kitties that land on their feet aint it samson but i dont tell you nothin you dont already know do i mister lewrie no sir alan agreed having seen the accident and having heard the uproarious cheer from the hands when it was known that the pig had succumbed and would be fresh supper for all there was a rumor on the rounds that the pig had been pushed and how he had escaped the foredeck manger was still a mystery perhaps it was pitt killed him sir lewrie japed hoping he could cajole lilycrop into leniency wouldnt put it past the young bugger indeed i would not lilycrop laughed heartily at alans small attempt at humor a clever little paw on the latch peg a scratch on the arse some judicious herdin hell get his share same as the others i do believe that cats are smarter than most people give em credit gooch how long now not half a glass sir gooch answered from the pantry by the small dining alcove the table had already been set with a somewhat clean cloth widebottomed bottles to anchor it down after it had been dampened to cling to the wood and plates and utensils already laid out shrike was on an easy point under reduced sail so they would not have to fight the table for each morsel that reached their mouths she wasnt heeled over ten degrees from upright and her motion was easy tonight cooling sunset breezes blew down the open skylight and through the quartergallery windows they chatted ships business for a few minutes interrupted often by the antics of the various cats or kittens that shared the captains quarters until gooch announced that supper was ready there was a soup of indeterminate ancestry most likely portable soup reconstituted from its boileddry essence the biscuits were the usual weevily lumber that took much rapping to startle out the occupants and some soaking in the soup so they could be chewed but the leg of young pork arrived to save the day crackling with fat and running with juices their bodies craved after weeks of saltmeat boiled to ruin in the steeptubs there was pease pudding too and a small loaf of fresh bread they sliced thin as toast so it would last something the cook had whipped up for the captain alone the sweetlins gettin theirs too gooch lilycrop demanded um aye sir gooch tried to say through a mouthful of pork from the pantry taking his pleasure with some slices that had been intended for the platoon of felines who were crowding around his feet and yowling for their tucker damn yer blood gooch stop stuffin yer ugly phyz an feed those cats their rightful share before i come in there an hurt you lilycrop bellowed turning to wink at lewrie as though it was a huge joke theyll be cracklins enough for the likes of you later aye sir gooch sighed there were still cats enough who jumped up on the table to take what they thought was their rightful share who refused to stay shooed and between gentle remonstrances to their gluttony and his reminiscing about his career lilycrop carried the conversation while alan guarded his plate with both elbows and nodded or grunted in agreement all during supper then the dishes were removed the table cloth snatched away and the cheese and port set out lilycrop poured himself a liberal measure and passed the decanter down then patted his thinning hair and looked at alan carefully as he poured his own glass now young sir lilycrop said after they had both lowered the levels in their glasses here it is alan sighed going stone cold inside tomorrow we shall alter course weve been out over two months an need to put into port for fresh supplies lilycrop said aye sir alan nodded nose deep in his glass again do it at first light just after standin down from dawn quartersno sense waitin for sun sights we know pretty well where we are an no hazards this far offshore aye sir ill see to it alan replied steeling himself for the blow sir i suppose well i have been doing a lot better in the last few weeks whatever you decide i am grateful i had the chance to be a first officer if only for a little while whats this you resignin if you think that best sir alan whispered god he thought lilycrop dont just want to chuck me he wants me out of the navy altogether dont know why youd want to do a thing like that lilycrop told him cocking his head to one side thought you wanted to get on in the navy cant do it if you cash in your chips on your first commission is it youre unhappy in shrike i thought you wanted me to sir alan stammered now why would i want a thing like that because im bloody awful you are lilycrop gaped couldnt tell it by me but the way youve treated me the past two months i never knew how i stood with you sir and alan fumbled feeling relief flush him like a quick rainshower and the beginnings of an anger that lilycrop would string him along in this manner damme sir youve had a good laugh at my every effort and ive been on tenterhooks all this time waiting to let my guard slip and make some mistake and he could not go on his tongue dangerously close to letting go something that could be construed as insolence or insubordination as much as he wanted to rant and slap the old bugger silly want your mammys teat to cosset you lilycrop scowled as he topped up his glass again want me to pat you on the back an tell you how marvelous you are damme youre a commission sea officer theres no room for your bloody feelins theres the ship her people an the navy that comes first before makin you feel good i alan started to say before clamping his mutinous trap shut once more you started on the wrong foot but that didnt last a day lilycrop continued i told you id say no more about it and i havent sides tisnt my nature to go around praisin somebody to the skies you do your duty an thats all i expect of any man if you do your duty proper you know it an you can pat yourself on the back if youve a mind sides you learned didnt you i i think so sir alan said realizing it was true found your feet got a firm grip on the hands found out how to run shrike to my satisfaction what more would you be wantin lilycrop shrugged more port aye sir but how can youmost people respond to some sign of encouragement sir they have to hear that they did something right now and then just as they need to be told they did something the wrong way if they make a muck of things alan floundered lifes an unfair portion aint it mister lewrie lilycrop chuckled slicing himself a morsel of cheese which he plumped down on a thin slice of the remaining bread in lieu of extrafine biscuit i told you once i dont splice the mainbrace without i see the angel gabriel close abeam now what would you adone if id said youre doin splendid laddie when you werent gone all smug an satisfied before you had it down pat i gave you instruction let you find your own way an youve come around to be a man id trust with this ship mind you i had my doubts when you first came aboard um good cheese so youll not ask for a replacement sir oh hell no youll do lilycrop grinned through a mouthful of cheese and bread well im damned alan exhaled heavily leaning back in his chair no youve turned more competent an youve gotten the ship smartened up right clever im satisfied lilycrop sniffed even if every hand hates my guts sir alan said smiling feeling he was ready to burst into hysterical laughter at his redemption oh give em no mind they always hate the first officer an dont you go tryin to be their bosom friend either lilycrop told him wagging a finger down the length of the table at him they despise you they tolerate me and beside you an your faultfindin an carpin im a fuckin saint in comparison you didnt come aboard to be popular you came aboard to be efficient in runnin my ship for me youre not a heavy flogger nor are you a handwringin hedgepriest firm but fair you said your motto was remember young sir aye sir i do youre not halfseasover are you mister lewrie no sir alan assured him of his relative sobriety then wipe that lunatick smile off your face and tip up your glass gooch trot out another bottle of this poor excuse for port im safe alan rejoiced inside as the servant puttered about and drew the cork from a fresh bottle im safe in my place hell not chuck me ill do he says that must mean im not at all bad even if he did halfkill me now can i keep this pace up dont i ever get a chance to relax ruefully he decided that he probably would not that was lilycrops sort of navy where one labored long and hard with not one whit of praise or encouragement ready at all times to care for the ship first last and always with little chance for letting ones guard down now sir lilycrop sighed after he had sampled the new bottle and sent gooch off for his own supper i get the feelin you may disagree with me bout how to train men maybe were we talkin of raw landsmen i might soften my methods but tis the way i was brought up you see when youve a ship of your own to run you may employ your own methods and i give you joy of em but ive never seen a sailor yet who was worth a coldmutton fart for bein cossetted like he was still in leadin strings you just have to make em get on with the work trust your mates and warrants to pound em into line and see they dont get brutalized nor pushed too fast nor do you want em dandled on daddys knee and told what good lads they are when they aint it varies with the man some say sir whats sauce for the goose isnt sauce for gander all the time sir alan replied laid back at complete ease for the first time in two months his breeches tight about his middle after a splendid repast and his head light with wine fumes but you never have time to train em one man at a time some neverll do no matter what you do with em lilycrop frowned samson leaped up on the table and arched his hindquarters into the air as lilycrop stroked his back ive seen boys come aboard so starryeyed for bein at sea youd have thought theyd seen jesus in the riggin some made it some didnt raw landsmen midshipmen pressed men we make sailors of em all if we can or kill some of em in the process when the shot starts to fly you dont have time to make allowances for a weaklin you got to have men you can count on take yourself me sir alan asked back on his guard again you have brains mister lewrie you can learn even if you have to get hurt in the process now young mister edgar hes been in the fleet four years and god help the poor young ass hell never make a sea officer thout somebody on high parts the waters to let him cross over i had to depend on you right from the start no way you can have a first officer you have to spoonfeed so you got your feelins hurt an had yourself a weep now an again well this is a hard service an im damned if ill go to my grave seein the ones that come after me have it easy an soft a mewlin pack of children too weak an whiny to serve our navy when it needs tarryhanded men this has been the absolute worst two months i have ever spent in the navy sir alan confessed as the wine crept up on him and twenty years from now youll know you learned somethin lilycrop nodded in agreement all good humor gone from his face as he spoke with absolute conviction by god sir youll be grateful someday you had it this hard cause the worst times laterll feel like a stroll in vauxhall gardens not that im through with you sir oh i said youll do but youve still a way to go everybody does dont go smug and satisfied on me well youve the evenin watch lilycrop snorted busying himself with samson up on his chest i exchanged with webster sir so ill have the morning heeltaps then and ill let you go to your rest lilycrop said lifting his glass and draining it goodnight sir thank you for supper and for everything goodnight to you as well mister lewrie alan left the cabin and went out on the quarterdeck where the night winds soughed and sang in the rigging bringing a touch of cool dampness to what had been a warm day shrike loafed along speared by the trough of a waxing moon and the tropic skies were a blue as deep as his officers coat littered with stars that burned clear and cold he stopped at the wheel long enough to check the binnacle for a peek at the course and the dead reckoning of the days run on the traverse board scanned aloft at the set of the sails to see if they needed adjusting and exchanged a few words with the watch then he took himself forward along the larboard gangway until he was up on the focsle where the spray sluiced and showered now and again as the ships bow rose and fell so gently ill do he thought smiling in the darkness by god that old bastard all the worry and fear ive suffered all the humiliation and all he says is youll do well maybe i shall at that the leeward islands fleet was in when shrike sailed into english harbor and so shrike had to take a mooring in the outer roads for the inner harbor was full for which alan sincerely thanked god he got the ship up into the wind and anchored without having to shorttack up that narrow channel through a city of warships there were a few ships he had not seen before including a huge threedecked st rate and he was so intent on them that he realized he had gotten shrike safely in without his usual qualms after that supper with lilycrop and his grudging acceptance lewrie was amazed at how much easier things had gone for him how much more assured of his abilities he felt a threedecker sir alan said do you think admiral rodney has come back maybe theyre ready to try another pass with this de grasse look more closely lilycrop suggested passing him the telescope and uttering one of his semistifled titters of amusement my god alan exclaimed as the name on the stern placque leapt into focus ville de paris think they have met lilycrop barked rubbing his round nose in delight now would you be so good as to have my boat brought round to the entry port so i may go aboard the flag and report aye sir immediately fukes they had met indeed on april and the french fleet had been scattered to the four winds some running back to martinique some for cape francois or havana five lineofbattle ships had been taken at the battle of the saintes including ville de paris and de grasse was now a british prisoner admiral rodney had returned shortly after shrike had left on her patrol had taken hood and his ships down to st lucia and had dogged the french bases until they sailed much like mr clerks tactics treatise had suggested rodney had broken the order of the french line when a godsent shift of wind had taken the french aback and forced them to luff up helpless while the british squadron still had wind to spare from de grasse and his captured officers it was learned that the french and spanish from havana were to have linked up and invaded the island of jamaica in a joint expedition now that was foiled for all the siege artillery had been taken at the saintes in the ships now lying in english harbor as prizes never before had a st rate ship of the line of any nation been taken in battle never had an admiral other than rodney taken a french a dutch and a spanish admiral prisoner in his last three actions there was some carping that breaking the french line was an accident not planned there were rumblings that rodney could have taken a dozen two dozen prizes if he had released his line in general chase still it was a magnificent victory strengthening englands hand after such a long drought and for lewrie the parties ashore were heaven dolly fenton was still there in his lodgings having sold her late husbands commission to another officer for twelve hundred pounds and she had waited for him instead of going home she did live frugally as his shore agent could attest and she was so full of love and passion for him it was all he could do to crawl to the boat landing each morning when lilycrop allowed him to sleep out of the ship and damned if she didnt make a snug and pleasant little home for him such a nice little abode that he invited lieutenant lilycrop to dine with them one night and dolly captivated the man from the first sight of her they dined her aboard shrike in the captains quarters asking the senior people from the wardroom in as guests and she felt so honored she almost wept in the boat back to shore the best night was sir admiral hoods levee for vice admiral pauljoseph comte de grasse and alan squired her to that in a new gown and his gift of a gold necklace and earrings he had made her that day she floated on air she laughed shyly and she trembled with joy to be on his arm and to be ogled by all the other officers and their wives at the levee she even captivated admiral de grasse in the receiving line it was a fairly quick trot down the receiving line among officers more senior to him but it was worth it the frog was huge well over six feet tall it was reputed he had lifted the tall rebel general washington off his feet and hugged him calling him mon petit general round as a beef cask and weighed over twenty stone with a round chubby face and tiny pursed almost porcine lips lieutenant alan lewrie of the shrike brig and miss dolly fenton the officer to his side said as he passed them on lewrie was at yorktown and the battle of the chesapeake he escaped after the surrender milord alan said nice to meet you at long last dolly vot a pretty name ma cher de grasse said kissing dollys hand and showing no signs of letting go vee dance later hein vee sing songs of eternal joy most beautiful of english beauties lewrie of the oh the hell with it alan sighed might as well bugger off lewrie the officer who had introduced them said be sure to get her hand back when you leave and dolly was so entranced by meeting such a celebrity by the music and wine and dancing and the interest shown in her that by the time they got back to his lodgings it was all alan could do to keep a shirt on before they got out of the hired coach damme for a fool he thought late that night as she lay by his side exhausted at last by their frenzied lovemaking if i aint coming to enjoy this maybe a bit too much damme if id ever marry her not with lucy beauman out there but this could be pleasant enough for the meantime only problem is dolly needs a man to cling to and the way she wants to cling is the permanent anchorage im way too young for that aint i yes yes i am im sure of it and not a week later they were sent orders to prepare for sea once more lieutenant lilycrop came back aboard from barfleur with a thick packet of orders under his arm canvaswrapped and bound up with official ribbons and sealed and from the way he carried them they had been weighted with grape shot to speed their descent into the netherdepths if shrike were accosted by a foe despatches for kingston lilycrop told lewrie after he had stowed them away in a locker in his transom settee hood and rodneyll be on their way west after us just in case the dons and what frogs escaped still have plans for jamaica well crack on all the sail she can fly and ill be wantin to warn you again bout how shrike can get away from you in a stiff blow to loord aye sir alan replied sail on the next tide yes are we ready to put to sea aye sir alan said proud that he had the ship ready in all respects in between the riotous celebrations ashore by the way the flagcaptain informs me a terrible mistake was made two month ago mister lewrie lilycrop went on tossing off his heavy coat kicking off his tight shoes and picking up a cat to stroke seems a midshipman assistin a flaglieutenantwhich is like a blind man helpin a cripple cross a busy roadsent a lieutenant lyles a man of no little experience into the amphion frigate and sent you here as my first upset their little wardroom order with no end of shit i see sir so i am to exchange with this lieutenant lyles not a bit of it told em i preferred you now we were used to each others ways lilycrop growled busying himself with a bottle of wine if they got their books wrong its no fault of mine i told em if lyles got the wet end of the stick its their problem thank you sir alan beamed puffing up at the compliment didnt think an ambitious young fella like yourself would care to be third officer in a thirtysix when you could be first even in a little brig like shrike i do prefer it sir alan replied realizing it was true even if being third officer in a th rate would be easier on his constitution thought youd say that lilycrop smiled his eyes gleaming gooch come open this damned bottle im dry as dust thats why i said you wished to stay in shrike i dont misrepresent you do i sir no sir alan grinned back good now go stir up the warrants an tell em were gettin underway at slack water tonight and mister lewrie do try an not be as amusin when we sail this time eh aye sir oh got the extra barrel o sand for the kitties clean sand from low tide sir nothing from further up the beach good no reason to bring sandfleas aboard thats all you can go think ill sport a nip for you drink your own damned claret aye sir alan replied then broke off his exit um excuse me sir but did the flag say how long we would be at jamaica got calls to make there mister lewrie a few sir alan grinned well you keep it to yourself but were bein transferred to the jamaica squadron lilycrop sighed as gooch got the offending bottle open and poured him a liberal measure and no tales out of school for you either gooch damn yer eyes aye sir gooch replied a bit insulted as lilycrop treated the whole affair as a joke most cabin servants from the wardroom or captains quarters could trade information on the sly for favor with their shipmates no matter how secret a matter was it was uncanny how quickly everyone on the mess decks could hear all about it within seconds of the officers pity about mistress fenton lilycrop said well off with you mister lewrie im sure you have duties and go ashore if you think it best alan took himself out on deck exulting in this stroke of good luck he would be allowed a shore visit at kingston surely to see lucy beauman the perfectly lovely and perfectly rich lucy beauman finally he could pay court to her whenever the ship put back into kingston every eight weeks or so if their last cruise was anything to go by it was all very well to have made lieutenant have a decent rate of pay and the annuity from his grandmother but alan knew his tastes and how expensive they could be a gentleman with any pretensions to the good life back home needed three hundred pounds a year or he couldnt begin to exist lucys parents were rich as croesus and were not adverse to a match now that hed made something of himself they could not deny their beautiful little girl anything she wanted and from the tone of her last letters lucy beauman most especially desired one lt alan lewrie she would bring a settlement back home in england most likely of enough land to set themselves up as property owners ones who rented land to others instead of the other way around there would be a house in london too fashionably close to st jamess whitehall or the strand and in between smashing bed furniture in exuberant lovemaking they could attend drums routs levees and suppers go to the theaters and the amusements of the worlds greatest city with the money to live the heady life among the titled and the elite by god but dont life just surprise the hell out of me sometimes alan breathed in anticipation four parts of it beshit and then fortune drops a whole slew of guineas in your lap oh shit there was dolly trusting adoring dolly god how could he bear to part from her yet it had to be he wouldnt be coming back to antigua anytime in the near future and wonderful as she was she was he had discovered twentyseven older than he was that was fine for the ego fine for the libido but not for a longterm relationship lucy was only eighteen while lucy would not even hit her full beauty for several years dolly could look forward to only a few more years of superb loveliness before she began to fade and lose her freshest bloom and unfortunately she wasnt all that wealthy but shes the sort that stays lovely for years and years he argued we could no best we break it off now damnit all best for her really best she goes back to england and finds a man closer to her own age someone wholl want to marry and make her happy a man of substance to add to her husbands commission money shit he thought listen to me worrying about what a woman feels whod o thought a rogue like med ever worry about that oh this is going to be devilish hard i really am fond of the silly little mort yes i really am fuck it lets get it over with quick bosun bring a boat round for me he shouted chapter shrike thumped away bravely as she fired her salute to adml sir joshua rowleys flag ran down her red ensign and trotted out the white rounded up under topsls and spanker and let the anchor go in as polished a performance as any ship of the line three years in active commission which brought a grunt of satisfaction from lieutenant lilycrop and a large whoosh of relief from lt alan lewrie almost before the hook was on the bottom inside the palisades of kingston harbor the gig was alongside the entry port the coxswain and his oarsmen turned out in the best uniforms they possessed or could borrow from the pursers stores and lilycrop was safely into his boat and on his way to the flagship harbor gaskets on the yards mister fukes alan ordered aye sir fukes rumbled n could i be aborryin a boat ta row about nsee to squarin away the yards sir while we set kedges my pleasure mister fukes it would be a long row to get ashore alan noted but lilycrop had insisted that they anchor far out from the main anchorage far off shore so the night miasmas that brought fever could not reach them so they could still have a seabreeze at night to keep the number of insects down it would also reduce the thoughts of desertion among the hands none of whom were strong enough swimmers to reach that tantalizing shore rig the awnings now alan said itll get a lot hotter this afternoon there was still work to do rowing out kedge anchors to hold the ship without swinging all about the compass on her bower rode and fouling another ship tidying up aloft coiling the miles of sheets and halyards clews and buntlines down into neatly flaked piles or hung on the bitts and pinrails then boats would have to go ashore for fresh water and firewood and every department had needs which the purser would have to refer to the captain hoping to keep the expense down in some cases and seeking a way to make extra money in others biggs was already rubbing his dry hands together expense ledgers under his arms and eyeing the shore with an expression that could only be described as avidly expectant but for now alan could relax the ship was at anchor and nothing short of fire or hurricane could disturb her which meant he could lower his guard from active trepidation to wary ease the life of a first officer was onerous when one considered all the things that could go wrong but tentatively he was beginning to admit to himself that he could cope most of the time at least tedious some matters were but no longer a reason for a dry mouth exacting some chores might be but no longer a cause for shaky limbs when alan had time to think of this change and those times were damned rare he supposed it had come about after the supper with lieutenant lilycrop being told that he was passably acceptable had removed the greatest part of the fears he had suffered allowing him enough personal breathing room to grow into the job instead of staggering from one possible disaster to the next with the feeling that he was about five steps behind the acceptable pace witness their last passage from antigua to kingston which had gone past in six days of mostly tranquility giving alan time to savor sunrises and sunsets the joy of sailing over an inspiritingly benign ocean with winds enough for a glutton under a sky of wedgewood blue he had even begun to enjoy the banter in the wardroom though he could not join in as joyously as was his usual wont when japes liquor and high spirits were aflying lilycrop was not fussy about uniform dress when shrike was out of sight of the fleet so alan had served his watches and supervised the unending drills in old breeches and a shirt loose to the waist minus stock coat or stockings and a woven sennet hat to ward off the sun lilycrop believed a large towel was clothing enough on some days for his own august personage wrapped about his rotund body like some roman senators toga and a pair of native sandals the crew had gone about in rolled up slop trousers belt and headscarves like so many bloody buccaneers except for divisions and the rare turnto to witness punishment in the forenoons now they were all chafing in full clothing and the flesh that had been exposed to the sun was itching under the requisite layers of uniform no matter how red indiancopper they had become with long service in tropic waters bumboats comin alongside sir tell em to sheer off until the captain returns alan snarled and tell no the masteratarms knows to keep drink from being passed inboard alan said grinning at himself at least hed better william pitt came sauntering aft along the larboard bulwarks to take a perch by the main chains and sharpen his claws on a shroud deadeye the cat ignored alan until he strolled to the railing to peer down into the bumboats which were offering their usual gewgaws small bottles of rum flowers cheap shirts parrots and caged birds pocket watches and shoe buckles most likely stolen and the women who helped scull the boats when alan got close enough william pitt had no more patience he bottled up once more spat and hissed then took off forward in a ginger streak uttering a low trilling growl i hate that damned cat alan growled ah he hates you too sir caldwell the sailing master told him with a wry grin polishing his square little spectacles but then theres not a soul aboard ive ever seen him warm up to not even the captain if he werent such a deuced clever mouser hed have been over the side a year ago and good riddance to bad rubbish not a halfbad idea to trade the little bastard for a bird or something alan laughed their captain returned about an hour later and by the expression on lilycrops face as he heaved his bulk through the entry port and the way he took his salute so testily he obviously had not had a good time aboard the flagship mister lewrie attend me sir lilycrop snarled aye aye sir alan replied wondering what he had done to earn this new enmity had the more dubious parts of his repute made their way as far west as jamaica once aft though he was pleased to discover he was not the reason this time at least for lilycrops ill humor poxy womanhanded little bastard lilycrop barked slinging his hat toward the hanging bedbox cats scattered to the four winds insufferable arselicker the shoes followed caroming off bulkheads and decorating the sickly paint with streaks of blacking the shirt stock nearly made it out the transom sashwindows gooch sir alan asked standing well back from this barrage of attire not a morsel of welcome sir not a morsel lilycrop gloomed oh aye ive grown accustomed to small portions of hospitality in my years but gooch come open this damned bottle before i crack it over your empty head aye sir the servant bobbled id not expect to be dined in sir lilycrop went on almost tearing the buttons from his waistcoat as he removed it and slung it in the general direction of the pegs thats for postcaptains an the titled fools but nary a drop of comfort was i offered sir not one drop for a newly arrived master an commander most inhospitable sir alan commented as gooch got the hock open and deftly stripped lilycrop of his heavy old sword as he raved about the cabins drinking from the neck dye know mister lewrie were the first vessel in with word of the saintes and their salvation from the frogs and the dons lilycrop raved on while they couldnt stir their arses up an put half a dozen sail o the line to sea to save their souls a battle ye say truly sir defeated de grasse did they capital doins but more important who dye like in the governors cup races pahh perhaps the flagcaptain was drunk sir an maybe hes an addlepated lightfooted silkkerchiefed sodomite fool lilycrop roared he flung himself down on the transom settee but calmed enough to accept a mug from gooch who had been weaving a circumspect course to avoid his captains wrath then this dandyprat had the gall to look down his nose an wonder what rodney was thinkin of to transfer little shrike to sir joshua bloody rowley an billy graves fuckin damn flag my dear sir he says to me i know not to what avail a brig o so little worth shall answer but given enough time we shall discover her uses perhaps in the guarding of the harbor entrance or the coast an revenues goddamn them graves sir alan started from the chesapeake the same a viceadmiral servin under rowley if you can imagine what a comedown that is for him lilycrop wheezed humor alan shrugged philosophically approaching to within throwing distance as lilycrop poured half the bottle of hock into his mug and began to sip perhaps they still perceive a danger and thought themselves more in need of ships of the line or a brace of larger frigates to add to their strength what bloody danger rodneyn hood put paid to those frogs off the saintes scattered their fleet hell to huttersfield took the ships loaded with the siege artillery jamaicas safe as houses now yes sir but where did those other ships escape to the ones we didnt take alan pondered up to cape francois or havana there are still ten spanish sail of the line in the indies and the dagoes were to provide troops for the expedition whos to say they might try yet sir strictly a spanish adventure with help from one of de grasses junior admirals and what ships hes collected after the saintes when you consider that they might look upon rodney offering them one small brig of war as an affront perhaps theres bad blood between sir joshua and sir george and you the intermediary between their animosity goddamme but youre a political animal lewrie lilycrop spat aye sir but its a learned habit society runs on rumors and grudges alan grinned now on solid ground for all his seafaring skill and his tarryhanded knowledge lilycrop was a child when it came to the ways of english society childishly proud of his lack of familiarity with the backalley routes to success money and place in contrast alan had cut his milkteeth on the practice raised as he was in the shadow of the mighty the titled and the wealthy lilycrop wanted his navy to be immune to what he thought was unfair and scheming but the navy was a microcosm of the society which it protected and its officers came from families who had to play the game to get ahead until the society changed the navy would reward those who knew how to grease the wheels with unctuous words in a sudden flash of insight alan saw the reason why lilycrop had named the ginger cat william pitt he had been a champion from the commoners but on retirement he had accepted the kings gift of title as lord chatham and all the perquisites of the wealthy tories against whom pitt had dueled betraying lilycrops simple faith in ordinary men rising by their own abilities no bloody wonder he was a lieutenant all this time alan thought a bit sadly the wheel that squeals the loudest never gets the grease he rubs everyone the wrong waygod help him hes even proud of it damn society lilycrop groaned lifting his beak from the mug but he had calmed himself think you though we were too small an offerin im sure of it sir perhaps admiral rodney offered larger ships or drakes small division of lineofbattle ships for later in the despatches we carried but we dont know that nor should we have lilycrop nodded firmly so i was the bearer of bad tidins the one the roman emperors used to kill uriah smugly bearin his death warrant from david to place him in the thickest fightin so uriahs wife would be a widow for davids pleasure um something like that sir he shrugged at a loss nothin moren id expect after fifty years in the navy man and boy watchin lilycrop squirmed as he realized he could not expose himself or his lifelong grudges to anyone much less to an officer from that very background that seemed to spawn the successful while he soldiered on without seeming rewards stores complete sir ah aye sir alan replied caught off guard by the sudden shift of topic or that is they soon shall be sir the purser is ashore and should be returning soon once were replenished be so good as to hoist easy discipline so the doxies can come aboard then lilycrop directed wearily the handsve shaped up mainwell the last two months theyve earned a few rewards mister lewyss to check for poxn fleas mind aye sir fars i know we could tupn sup out here til we sink at our moorins for all this admiral cares shore leave tickets for the senior warrants first junior warrants second leave tickets for those hands deservin afterward aye sir um aye i mind youve calls to make lilycrop said frowning ill take a turn ashore myself but my needsre simple youve earned your chance for a wench and a bottle as well young sir thank you sir but then you dont wish shore leave lilycrop teased not at all sir of course i want shore leave its another matter sir about shrike about the admiral sir spout away sit you down an have some hock then the cabin cats had sensed that the rant was over and emerged from their hiding places tails flicking for attention samson and henrietta and mopsy and hodge and the kittens made for lilycrop and this show of affection mollified him most wondrously who says were useless sir alan began every poxed motherson of a gun in the flag damn their eyes you once said shrike could go inshore where a frigate or sloop of war would fear to go sir alan schemed on now i see no ships in harbor capable of that small ships ketchesn cuttersn such theyre possibly out on patrol lilycrop waved off as gooch brought another mug to the desk and poured lewrie some of the wine could the spanish have some siege artillery of their own sir oh aye lilycrop agreed every fuckin fort on cubar hispaniolas full of heavy guns poor localmilled powder maybe old stone shot though be a bitch to dismount and build field carriages but they could improvise a siegetrain from them if they were of a mind sir and the easiest way to transport them would be by sea along the coasts would it not aye theyd kill a thousand bullocks haulin em on what pass for roads in the islands lilycrop perked up exactly sir alan pressed but what sort of ships would be available to carry siege guns to cape francois or havana how many ships of worth do they have in the indies theyd risk in coastal waters not that many i grant too strong to be taken by a small ketch or cutter sir but just the presence of a well set up brig of war could run them back into harbor theyd think themselves safe from a frigate close inshore but we are pretty fast sir and we can go into less than three fathoms to chase them down damme but youre a nacky littlen mister lewrie lilycrop marveled i misjudged your wit an for that i apologize aye shrike could stir em up like the wrath of god if he cautioned if we were allowed im sure this admiral rowley has his own favorite corsairs bought in some shallowdraught vessels as tenders to the flagship to line his pockets with prizemoney already well swing at our anchors til next epiphany waitin for the call to glory a respectful letter to the flag suggesting suitable employment for us could take the trick sir alan smiled prizemoney for us and the admiral a reduction in the bottoms available to the dagoes some repute for us and if there is some grudge between parker and rodney we could mollify it rowley needs to be seen doing something to save jamaica doesnt he rodneyll have all the glory at the victory celebrations and now youre off in fictional speculatin lilycrop scoffed we know no such thing still beats waiting for employment at the admirals pleasure sir hmm lilycrop stroked his chin now shaved of the usual crop of bristly white for his appearance aboard the flagshipusually he only laid steel to whiskers once a week for sunday divisions alan took a sip of wine while lilycrop pondered the matter he could see the battle going on between the need for recognition and some small bit of fame before the war ended and his hopes of future service in the navy with it and the desire to safeguard what little he had the want of prizemoney for retirement and the risk to his ship and the loss of what grudging respect he had won if he failed too deep for me lewrie lilycrop scowled finally it smacks too much o schemin for place to suit me an what sort of fool may i look to go clamorin for action when theres others more senior or deservin in the navy youll learn to take what comes as your portion an not go wheedlin for a chance to shine sir they do wish us to be ambitious sir alan allowed with a shrug thinking he had disappointed his captain by being too forward in our actions yes once given a charge lilycrop cautioned but not in advancin our careers thout earnin the right to do so well it was just a thought sir alan sighed but it would gall me terribly to think we had to sit out the rest of the war with no opportunity to do something useful did i mean that alan wondered even as he uttered it it was the proper sentiment a fireeating young officer was expected to display and he thought he had said it rather well so well in fact that alan felt a hard kernel of truth in it he sometimes thought it was his curse that he could sit outside himself and judge his performance on the stage of life like a disgruntled theatergoer waiting for a chance to get rid of the rotten fruit carried in with him ready to jeer and heckle a poor reading or cheer when a scene was carried off well it would make little difference if shrike did spend the rest of the war at her moorings or off on boresomely empty patrols he had fulfilled his present ambitions a small measure of fame for cool bravery a commission some prizemoney and now his post as a first officer even in a small ship he had seen the razoredge of terror often enough to know how mortal he was and like any sensible person could give war a great big miss the next time to save his own skin if shrike did stay in kingston harbor for some time he could get ashore to court lucy beauman and make a firm pact with her about their future together and from the tone of her latest letters that would be best before her circle of swains and admirers monopolized her to his detriment so why am i urging the captain to get us active employment he asked himself when anyone with any sense would want to stay out of danger and go courting one of the most beautiful young women of the age its daft but this navy stuff must be getting to me it made him squirm to face it but he was indeed through no fault or wish of his own a sea officer of the king he was getting rather good at it and it was an honorable profession not just the guinea stamp admitting him to the society of other gentlemen but now a small yet burgeoning source of pride in his abilities god knew he had had few reasons for pride before it was demanding dangerous but it was his there was no reward on earth for meekness so why should he be content to stand on the sidelines crying well played sir to some other ambitious young bugger with better connections when there was a chance for advancement there were prizes to take money to be made further fame to be won which would ease his passage toto what postcaptain he scoffed at his speculations admirals rank a bloody knighthood the peerage why not make the most of it while i may lewrie what a hopeful little fool you are but then again why the hell not we could sweep the seas so clean we could come back like that dutchman tromp with a broom at his mast truck just goes to show why one shouldnt encourage people like me once they got a taste of something damme if they dont aspire to the whole thing lieutenant alan lewrie of the shrike brig the majordomo announced over the sound of the lawn party to which announcement very few people took notice being too intent on their pleasures the sun was low in the sky and the tropical day had lost most of its heat to a sea breeze that swayed the paper lanterns in the trees toyed with the wigs of the revelers and ruffled the intricate flounces of the womens gowns string music something by purcell alan decided after cocking an educated ear waxed and ebbed depending on the wind or the thickness of the throng in front of the musicians in the gazebo to his right he stood at the base of the brick steps that led down from the tiled and sheltered back terrace of the house surveying the crowd and searching for lucy beauman her parents town house which was no town house at all but a second mansion large enough for a titled lord was aflutter with bunting and naval ensigns in celebration for admiral rodneys victory at the battle of the saintes there was enough red white and blue material to make commissioning pendants and ensigns for every ship in the active inventory of the fleet as he had come through the central hall alan had seen a dining table decorated with a line of pastry and confection rd rates candied sails abillow and marzipan guns belching angelhair powder smoke a card table as a centerpiece amid the buffet items with winged victory bearing a trident and flag roaring lions at her feet with a gilt helmet overlaid with the laurel wreath corona of triumph damme but the beaumans know how to spend their money dont they he muttered happy they had the pelf with which to entertain their burst of patriotic emotions wonder they didnt just gild the whole damned house there must have been over two hundred guests the luminaries of jamaica prominent officials or highranking navy and army officers and leading citizens with the government title place or sufficient money and lands to be included men strolled languidly in silk and satin suitings women glided and tittered and fanned themselves showing off their most stunning gowns and jewels somewhere in that mob lucy could be found and alan felt his pulse quicken at the thought of seeing her again he looked for the densest clutch of young men lucy would be sure to be in the center of them flirting madly if alan knew his average young tit the wind picked up briefly and a gust played with the tail of his long uniform coat a black servant in clothofsilver and silk livery offered him a tray that bore delicate flutes of champagne trying to balance the tray and keep his freshpowdered white tiewig from scudding somewhere off to leeward at the same time it would rain soon alan knew a heavy tropical downpour fit to run all these revelers indoors but not a threatening storm if there had been any ominous signs to the weather lilycrop would have pulled his pugnose and not allowed him ashore invitation or not but lilycrop had had his own run ashore and had come back aboard in the earlyearlies breeches half buttoned with what appeared to be rouge or paste on the fly and most cordially in the barrel so he could not deny his first lieutenant his chance alan took a sip of champagneit was a suspiciously good vintage from france a nation with which they were at war and he smiled wryly as he imagined what underhanded practice had brought the wine to this occasion he stepped out into the crowd bowing slightly to people now and again if he caught their eyes or they took notice of him a cordial smile plastered on his phyz aha he thought hearing a small shriek of laughter from the left near a span of sidetables loaded down with delicacies and drink young lewrie a voice boomed interrupting his progress in that direction alan turned to see mister beauman if anything his host and hopefully prospective fatherinlaw had gotten even stouter and his taste in clothing had not improved much it had been a sweltering spring day and still felt clammy despite the cooling breeze from so much rain due soon but he was tricked out in a massive older wig awash in sidecurls down past his ears which gave off puffs of flour every time the wind came up his coat and breeches were white satin and he wore a sleeved older style waistcoat of pale yellow silk heavily embroidered with vines and flowers how he kept from melting away alan could not ascertain mister beauman sir alan replied as though he was the very person for whom he had been searching how grand to see you once more may i express my heartfelt thanks for your kind invitation dont ye look a sight sir beauman whooped bless my eyes a commission officer give ye joy me lad and to you sir heard yed made lieutenant hard service in virginia damn all frogs beauman rumbled on snatching another glass of claret from a passing tray still skinned the bastards hey indeed we did sir alan agreed saved jamaica beauman pronounced between slurps took part in it did ye grand sight and all that no sir shrike was up north patrolling between the bahamas and the virgins when oh too bad beauman interrupted not your fault i expect alan wondered once more if the man had ever completed a full sentence instead of lopping them down to the pith the beaumans except for their dear lucy were country types shootin huntin doglovin tenant tramplin slavebashin squires with more money than ton and alan felt a twinge at the thought of having to spend more than a day in their presence if he were fortunate enough to wed their daughter he vowed hed live in london and let them pursue their own amusements preferably as far away as possible as long as possible had it not been for their money hed have sneered at them for being such a pack of countryharrys and chawbacons come meet the missus lewrie beauman ordered turning his back and leading off through his guests and alan had no choice but to take station on beaumans ample sternquarters and follow so this is young mister lewrie of which weve heard so much mrs beauman exclaimed after they had exchanged greetings mrs beauman was the source of lucys beauty alan saw fair and petite a bit gone to plumpness but still a fine figure of a woman in spite of her age her choice of attire was much better than her husbands as well though a bit oldfashioned hugh the eldest son was a younger replica of the father hardhanded and hardeyed as he finally met the upstart suitor for his sisters hand the welcome from him was a chary one the younger son resembled lucy in his short stature and fair complexion a bit of a dandyprat in grey and maroon shotsilk coat and breeches exaggerated sleeve cuffs and coat tails and blue leather shoes with red heels trimmed in gold alan lewrie haw haw he offered aint you the fortunate buck escapin yorktown and all what cut his way out beauman sr boasted through fire and steel my youngest boy ledyard lewrie delighted alan replied offering his hand yre servant sir haw haw ledyard rejoined inanely there was a middle daughter named floss bearer of the worst traits from the fathers side of the union illfavored and swarthy but her husband seemed happy enough perhaps mollified by her fathers gold master hugh beauman was married as well to a rather goodlooking young piece who evidently had realized it was impossible to get a word in edgewise in such a family and had stopped trying anne gave him a sympathetic shrug and a bit of a wink that in other circumstances would have had alan scheming for a space of time alone with her there followed some rather uncomfortable minutes of chitchat with alan the unwitting victim for not knowing any of the people or events they referred to a common fault in people full of themselves and alan should have known about that from monopolizing past conversations but it was a wrench to be on the receiving end there was no chance to break away and go searching for lucy the prime object of his trip ashore think itll rain mistress anne asked him as the tops of the trees began to sway and the sky turned gloomier i would not doubt it at all maam alan replied then we must see to getting the sideboards indoors before it begins and i see you are out of wine sir she offered ah yes i am alan noted may i escort you maam i would be deeply obliged sir alan bowed his way out of the family circle and offered his arm to walk the fetching anne beauman towards the buffets daunting aint they she smirked once they were out of earshot daunting is a good description maam alan smiled back and i doubt youd care to spend the rest of the evening with them when mistress lucy is the reason for your visit anne rejoined i had hoped alan agreed waving the servant with the askew wig over to service them with a tray of wine he traded their glasses in for two fresh flutes of champagne and offered her one we have heard much of you mister lewrie anne continued from lucys description and from your lettersthose portions which lucy thought relevant to relate to usi would have expected someone much older more weathered as my captain says maam ive only been in the navy little more than a dogwatch dueling for lucys honor saving a ship and her distinguished passengers escaping yorktown anne raised an eyebrow in appreciation you have led an active life and now you wish to enamor yourself to the beaumans damn the bitch alan thought i didnt come here to be mocked by some parvenu lucy and i developed a great fondness for each other last year on antigua maam her father allows me to call but as for dont call me maam mister lewrie anne assured him with a touch of her hand on his sleeve i am anne and you are alan with luck we shall be related so why not start out on your best foot a bit of advice thank you dont take them seriously if you do they will infuriate you beyond all reason anne frowned hugh is a good enough man the best of the lot in many ways but in better circles they can appear a bit crude a little too rustic and earthy it is hardly my place to judge yet anne im sure lucy has many admirers and as for my hopeswell we shall see how romantic anne gushed with just a tinge of sarcasm to hang the larger issues and let love dictate your desires you are a paragon alan always pay attention to the family daughters turn out remarkably like their mothers and sons become their fathers in most instances you sound disappointed alan said cocking his head to one side to study her more closely yes there was definitely a comehither glint to her beauty long dark hair and dark eyes skin more olive or tinted by the sun than was fashionable a wide mouth high cheeks and a face that tapered to perfection spoiled only by a few smallpox scars but altogether a damned handsome woman near his age walk with me she insisted i shall lead you to your lucy my pleasure island society as you may know is not what one would choose if given the choice of a paris salon or a london drum anne told him her hand resting maddeningly on his left sleeve her fingers prying at the broadcloth gently there is a difference between hiring servants and owning them outright it makes for a callousness wield the whip often enough and flayed flesh becomes commonplace the same goes for emotions for souls and the civilizing influence of literature of music and manners is only a thin veneer thinner here in the islands than at home i stand warned that they are all brutes and ogres alan quipped they have their charms even so anne replied with a small shrug and they are hardly that bad i apologize for being gloomy and you are not from the islands originally i take it no my father was secretary to the governorgeneral and we came out here in before the war she told him the lure of sugar planting got him and we stayed hugh and i have been married for four years now we have two fine children i am quite content the hell you are alan thought thats about as broad a hint as ive heard in six months shes bored beyond tears as i hope to be anne alan told her ah heres your lucy anne said pointing out a group of young men in high finery almost eclipsing the figure of a young girl with blonde hair such a darling girl amen to that alan agreed heartily lucy anne called look whos here lucy peeked from the crowd gave a small gasp fanned herself and stepped through to rush to his side god almighty he thought as he took her in how could she have gotten prettier lucy beaumans bright aquamarine eyes lit up her lips parted in a fond smile showing her perfect little white teeth gloved hands touched his arms there was a whiff of some maddening scent as they stood gazing at each other he noted her highpiled hair so delectably honeyblonde the perfection of her neck her shoulders the white and pink and maroon gown she wore daringly off the shoulders the proud swell of her breasts against the gown even more bountiful than formerly he took in how petite and lovely her figure was how round and inviting her arms were lucy he breathed all other sights gone from his ken oh you are here she sighed like to faint her lips trembling i shall die of happiness surely much as he wanted to crush her to him he had to stand back and hold hands with her his own hands trembling with emotion money be damned she was so beautiful so much more beautiful than he even remembered that he would have carried her off that moment if she didnt have two hapennies to rub together you look so grand as a lieutenant she admired the uniform suits you so well and your gown is delightful alan complimented in return but no gown could hold a candle to your beauty lucy you are such a rogue alan she gushed blushing prettily but mightily pleased that he took the time to notice oh i have missed you so much and i you you must come and meet father she told him i already have i would have been at your side long before but i was intercepted father mother hugh ledyard floss oh good then and you have met anne as well yes she is such a dear oh i fear i am neglecting the other guests the gentlemen who damn their blood i say alan growled alan she whispered pretending to be shocked with a glance over her shoulder in the general direction of her miffed admirers i havent seen you in almost a year alan insisted leading her further away from the disgruntled pack of suitors towards the back of the garden where there looked to be a bit more privacy why would i wish to make acquaintance of your other worshipers you are so forward she protested but not very much forgive my eagerness but it has been a long time of course i forgive you alan and you would never do anything to cause undue comment she acquiesced matching him stride for stride oh do tell me everything your last letter said you had left that ship desperate and had made lieutenant and you were in a new vessel the name escapes me shrike a brig owar i am first officer you captain your own ship she gaped already uh no he had to admit the captain is a lieutenant lilycrop but i am next in command his first officer you see oh but that is marvelous for you she beamed now you are no longer a midshipman and you have an annuity and your grandmothers inheritance oh alan i could never have dreamed things would turn out this way dad can have no objections now and do they pay you id hardly do it for fun now would i alan teased they reached a wall of lush tropical plantings heavy with flowers and thick with bouquet there was a narrow path that led under and through the thicket and alan grinned at her as he cocked his head in that direction lucy met his eyes and grinned mischievously in reply they were just about to step through for some real seclusion when the rain that had been threatening began to spatter on the lawn and the leaves oh my gown lucy wailed she stood up on tiptoe to kiss him briefly on the lips then tugged him into a dash for the house as the rest of the guests ran for cover as well and the servants gathered up what they could before the storm ruined furniture and tablecloths they made it to the porch where lucy bewailed the state of her dress and her hair sure she had been disfigured by the raindrops and from the sound of it was sure the condition was permanent i must go change she told him as he mopped his hair and face with a pocket kerchief i hope my maid may be able to salvage it hardly spotted alan pointed out as the rain gusted and blew in on the porch swirling in the late afternoon light on the yard and the steps and railings itll be fine just like a man to think so she snorted back tossing her head as though her hair was still down in a more casual style now you entertain yourself for a few minutes while i go change into something dry but do not be too entertained there are quite a few other young women here and i should not like to see you being too charming you have nothing to fear lucy i swear he told her with all innocence she smiled once more looked about to see if anyone was watching and pecked him on the cheek he kissed her hand and she blushed again before darting off calling for her maidservant damme what a lovely little minx he crowed in silent congratulation at his good fortune just to know her and to know that she was so fond of him aint she fine just lord shes so perfect so beddable and admirers be damned shes as good as mine this time therell be nothing to tear us apart and if she dont fetch five thousand pounds for her portion im a turk in a turban there was a lot of fetching of towels a lot of shaking of powdered wigs that left a slurry of wet flour on the terrace tiles as the other guests tended to their ruined finery though no one looked particularly wet to alans viewpoint let em stand on a quarterdeck with me in a gale of wind and ill give em wet he thought with a touch of contempt for lubberly civilians lucy beaumans conception of a few minutes was obviously not everyones the time passed slowly forcing him to check his pocket watch to see how long she was taking to change alan occupied himself with a couple more glasses of champagne mister lewrie a familiar throaty voice spun him about ah alan managed to say mrs hillwood i am so gratified you recall me the older woman said she was still lovely in her lanky fashion a bit less smoothcomplexioned than he remembered from nearly two years before when they had met at a supperdance at sir richard slades he had gone to her house the next day after debauching himself to the wee hours with whatever the little chickabiddys name had been it had been that sort of a party and mrs hillwood had damned near killed him with kindness if it hadnt been for her penchant for neat gin which had put out her lights and let him dress and escape she might have put him under for good how delighted to see you once more mrs hillwood he told her you are looking marvelous as always you are too kind young sir but what is this you have made lieutenant still in that despatch boat no maam i left parrot soon after docking at antigua and how is that young scamp we knew she simpered laying heavy stress on knew since she had known both thad purnell and alan lewrie in successive evenings thomas no thaddeus i regret that i must inform you that thad puraell passed over to the yellow jack on that same voyage maam oh how terrible she frowned dropping her teasing air he was a dear friend of yours so young too that seems to be the way of the world maam alan agreed somberly once you sailed i never heard from you again mrs hillwood went on i am sure so much of note has happened to you you must let me entertain you perhaps come for tea and tell me all about what you have been doing since last we had the pleasure of each others company damned if she hadnt been one hell of a bareback rider bony about the hips or not chickenchested or not alan remembered it had been two months since he had even gotten a whiff of womankind and he would not be doing much more with lucy than holding hands and sighing a lot he realized memories sprang up like how predatory she looked with her face beaming a wicked smile up from his groin as they lay in bed and she coaxed him into just one more bout the noises she made as she rode st george on his member and stirred her hips and belly like an island woman grinding corn nothing would give me greater pleasure he told her and she grinned in delight curving up those talented lips in repose her face with an unfortunately hawkish nose her only mar could appear fierce but a smile restored the great beauty she had once possessed i am certain it would mister lewrie she cooed softly as she toyed with her fan using it to touch him on the cheek by his faint scar and you must tell me all about that your address the shrike brig you mind where i live she asked not quite how forgetful of you i trust i shall not have to write it down more than this once i am certain you shant alan grinned at the meaning of that threat and his groin got tight just thinking about it and mister hillwood is still inland i trust beingagricultural as far as i know she sighed his particular passions require greater secrecy than mine ah alan lucy said as she reemerged from the house in a new gown of creamy pale yellow satin with gold bows and trim her hair had been let down and brushed dry as well a few minutes hey alan teased half a dogwatch more like lucy beauman i believe you know mrs hillwood we have not had the pleasure though the name is familiar to me lucy replied looking somewhat vexed how delighted to make your acquaintance mrs hillwood and i yours dear my what a lovely gown you are fortunate not to have gotten it wet in the rain showers mrs hillwood cooed i had to change lucy frowned would that i could my dear or at least sponge this down i would be happy to offer you the use of my chambers did you bring your maid with you lucy suggested you are too kind think nothing of it maam i would be only too happy to give you my every assistance lucy purred she clapped her hands quite briskly tyche she called without looking and her black maidservant came on the run to attend her lucy gave her instructions to allow mrs hillwood the use of her toilet and for tyche to help her rearrange her habiliment mrs hillwood headed off for the stairs and lucy glared at him as he said his goodbyes alan how could you she demanded in a soft voice but one tinged with a certain menace how could i what lucy alan asked wondering if he looked half as innocent as he was trying to look mrs hillwood is really the most despicable woman lucy told him with some heat i say woman rather than lady despite her airs and her pretensions well how was i to know that lucy alan shot back i met her once before near on two years ago at one of sir richard slades suppers my god it gets worse and worse lucy spat the most infamous i cannot find the strength to name the mans sinful predilictions no proper lady could and what were you doing in such a place and just where did this termagant mort come from alan wondered amazed at the change from the sweet and gentle and cooing lovely girl he thought he had known and desired my captain in parrot knew him from school and i and another midshipman were invited to join him for supper alan shrugged it off and were you not scandalized by all the goingson i saw none alan tried to scoff we had a feed the like of which i had not seen since london and the victuals held more interest after a year of navy issue id have dined with the devil himself if he set a good table he chuckled if you sup with the devil as you say i trust you used a long spoon lucy fumed now look here lucy alan attempted to bluff it out when he saw that dumb innocence would not suit she came up to me and introduced herself all i know of her was she was several chairs down from me at table nearly two years ago ive probably gone into the same chophouse as notorious murderers back in london but that dont make me guilty of murder how could you think such a thing as for this unnamed prediliction of sir richards well i know nothing of that either you use me rather ill i think oh alan im sorry she mellowed suddenly allowing him to offer an arm to lead her toward the buffet tables what must you think of me to accuse you of encouraging such a woman it is only that i have missed you so much and i come back down to find you in the clutches of a trull whose reputation is no better than it should be what a welcome ive given you please forgive me but i was suddenly so jealous i could hardly utter a civil word to her or to you jealous is it he coaxed gently i shall own to it she whispered leaning close as they went to a sideboard and began to pick at the delicacies to load on their plates after months of only letters from you i could not let anyone steal one precious minute of our time perhaps the tales about mrs hillwood arent whole cloth but you can understand why i was so uncharitable about her come to think of it she smiled poking him in the ribs with her fork you were not so charitable to those other young fellows i was with damn their blood did you say and their eyes and kidneys and anything else they have they can spare alan assured her so you were jealous too admit it she prodded i own to it too he muttered so others could not hear you dont know half of what ive been through since antigua with only your letters for comfort and those months apart as soon as i decyphered em he qualified to himself for lucy was what one could charitably describe as an inventive speller with a quick darting penmanship that started out in neat round horribly misspelled words and when she got to the exciting bits went mystifying as the scratches on stonehenge and you must tell me everything darling alan she begged was it really so terrible it was pretty rough he allowed modestly there are some things youd best never know some of the things that happened during the siege and during our escape are unsuitable for a lady to hear and i wrote of silly social things while you were being racked by shot and shell she sighed how could i have been so cruel or thoughtless yet i wrote you often you did not get them well the mails never caught up with the fleet before we left new york and then we were stuck in the chesapeake alan told her the frogs and the rebels werent about to trot out the penny post for us there were dozens of letters to you i never could post myself some the rebels captured i suppose you mean those uncouth quarrelsome people have read my letters conversations with her take the strangest bloody twists and turns he sighed to himself and had to cosset her out of her pet but for the rest of the evening during the strolling about in the suffocatingly hot rooms the dancing and the card games and a brief tour of the sideterrace for some air where they could indulge their need to hold each other and kiss passionately he managed to keep her happy and positively glowing as he paid his respects to the family they treated him as almost one of the family though nothing concrete had been settled but that was sure to come in time all in all except for walking back to the docks with an erection he could have doubled for a belaying pin it was a good run ashore and there was always betty hillwood and her invitation to tea chapter there were a lot of teas in the next week or so once more alan was thankful that in harbor officers stood no fixed watches and once what few duties were done for the day could absent themselves to their own amusements if i spend the rest of my career doing this i shant cry alan thought smugly as he lay back on the soft mattress panting for air in the close tropical heat the linens clung to them crinkled with perspiration and he fanned them with a corner of the sheet you insatiable beast betty hillwood uttered with a gasp for air herself pour us something cool alan dear whilst i try to recover my senses he hopped off the bed and filled their wine glasses with lemonadeshe was a lot more fun if he kept her out of reach of the gin or at least cut down on her consumption during the early hours of their trysts he stood over her and offered her a glass enjoying the slim form still beaded with mutual perspiration and her incredibly soft skin reddened in all the most interesting places by having his body pressed so close to hers over forty or not she was more woman than most men could stand and live to talk about the pot calls the kettle black love he told her as she took a sip now whos insatiable damn my eyes youre even more impressive than i first remembered she said shifting to sit up on one elbow and pile pillows behind her head she gave a delightful groan when she said it before you were a randy boy for all your eagerness clumsy was i he chuckled climbing back into bed and laying against the footboard pillar so their legs entwined no my chuck just exuberant she crooned plying her toes around his groin playfully a years hard service has made you even more a man to suit my taste harder leaner the most impressive and satisfying fuck ive known once out of polite society and her clothing betty hillwood had always had the mouth of a farriersergeant perhaps it was the gin that loosened her tongue and her inhibitions if she truly had any she demanded pleasure as her due since she would not get it from her husband who preferred to live inland on one of his plantations and bugger the field hands and the houseboys there was no longer any coy pretense of seduction between them no more teasing conversation or tea to be poured no guests to shoo off so he could return after he had made a proper goodbye so they could play innocent for society he came to her after a morning or afternoon with lucy and her parents sometimes came to her direct from the ship and the black servant let him in and then took her leave betty hillwood met him in morning gown or her bedclothing under which she tantalizingly wore nothing they would have a drink no more than one while she let her clothing fall open and they would be grappling with each other within a quarterhour making it to the bedroom at the back of her cool apartments most of the time but not alwaysthere was a good assortment of settees and chairs to roger on an escritoire of just the right height to support her small buttocks and a marbletopped breakfast table by a shuttered window that made a cool change if the day was too hot every visit was a revelation a learning experience in just how many ways two people could give each other pleasure and alan lewrie was all for educationlook how much the navy had taught him already it beat whores all hollow in his estimation didnt cost him more than fiddlers paycompliments and wineand took the rapacious edge off his manners with lucy beauman whom he would have ravished by this time if he had not had another outlet for his frustrations being around and tantalisingly near such a delectable young girl with no chance to grapple would have killed lesser men by this time one could hardly be considered a respectable suitor to conjoin with such a fine and wealthy family if he spent all his time goggling at lucys breasts or fondling her on the sly not that they hadnt played lovers in daring and heartbreakingly brief moments of privacy the common wisdom said that too much spending of ones vital fluids in fornication made a young man spineless and weakhis breath shallow his eyes watery and his general condition little better than a victim of consumptionbut alan was of the opinion that too little spending made one so full of humors that one would explode if restrained from the sport too long either that or begin to squirt semen from ones ears if too much spending led to pathetic lunacy then so be it he could drool and cackle with the best of them sooner or later i have something for you my chuck betty whispered once she had gotten her wind back she slunk out of bed brushing her body the length of his kissing him openmouthed then skipped coquettishly out of reach and down the narrow hall to the parlor as he grabbed at her she returned with a small package and held it out to him then busied herself at the bedroom winetable to pour herself a drink while he undid the ribbon and opened it it was a watchchain a particularly fine one with rectangular links of small and cunning workmanship depended from it was a braided band on which rested a small fob of silver and gold damascene worked in a fouled anchor over crossed cannon it was beautiful more to the fact a wellmade chain from an expert craftsman could cost more than a watch did gods teeth he exclaimed in delight the silver and gold chain the dark blue ribbon and the silver and gold fob were magnificent and he told her so whatever possessed you to do me so much honor youre truly pleased she asked flinging her arms around him and drawing her delightful body the full length of his and flabbergasted he admitted its so damned grand how may i ever thank you for it by doing what earned it in the first place my chuck she nibbled on his ear reaching down with one hand to dandle his member against her belly you have given me so much pleasure and so much delight i had to reward my darling lad ah theres a stirring of gratitude methinks shall i be rudely speared for my pains to please methinks milady is right alan growled seizing her buttocks and hauling her in closer pitiful tearful beseechings have no avail she whispered as she steered them backward toward the bed once more even offers of gold cannot soften the heart of a barbarian bent on rapine damme here she goes with another of her bloody fantasies he thought more than willing to oblige but tiring of her ripe imaginings in which he had to play so many parts a tender senators wife with hunnish blades at her childrens throats tender white skin assaulted so wickedly by callused hands and brutal urges ah she urged playing at fending him off no please rome lies open at your feet spare me this i beg you you lay open to me alan grunted trying to be rudely germanic no please she cried but not too loudly they mockfought and she fell face down across the mattress and alan knew his duty he flung himself down on her forced her legs apart and entered her dogfashion gripping her hips and lifting them up off the sheets and she panted and pretended to weep until the virtuous roman senators wife was overcome with pleasures she had never experienced on the bridal couch and the game had its usual ending betty groaned and sobbed rolled her hips and thrust to meet him as he knelt between her thighs tore at the bedlinens with her nails until she shivered and cried out in ecstasy gasping for air once more and dropped away limp oh god but youre a bloody stallion dear alan she sighed in a swoon so long and thick and hard and he rolled her over and she chuckled as he lay down between her legs which flopped aside in exhaustion alan she protested as he raised her knees and slid back into her hot wetness i am spent truly hermann ist gut ja hermann not through he grunted as he began to plunge at her again for his own satisfaction which she finally shared all protests aside and she clawed at his back and shoulders and uttered a thin keening cry until they lay still once more they finally rose and sponged down with a bucket of cool water left standing by the shuttered bedroom windows snacked on some cold tongue and chilled hock for him some blue ruin for her in a large glass they lay down together to nuzzle and purr until the urge came on them again would we could do this always she said softly i have to sail eventually alan whispered back or at least i hope we do this idleness isnt doing the crew much good to where oh up around cuba or the florida straits maybe over to the windward passage and how long would you be gone dear near on three months if we dont take prizes to sustain us he reckoned half asleep back in two weeks if we take enough ships to deplete the hands for prizecrews wish we couldi could use the money you are short of cash well not short really i was thinking of after the war when ill go back to england london wouldnt have gotten any cheaper ive enough now for my needs what with naval pay and my remittance he shrugged and snuggled closer enough as long as i stay at sea three months out of four that is perhaps i can help she told him rolling over to look down on him i have money of my own and as long as my dear husband may indulge his pleasures in discretion and i play the proper wife he allows me to spend as i will he has bags of money perhaps the only endearing side to him she concluded sourly here now alan replied warning her off as he got an inkling of a change in their relationship beyond the physical as long as you pleasure me to utter ruin i could support any desire you have she promised you would be at sea part of the time but once back in port you could lodge ashore with me no more visiting and having to skulk away but what would that do to your good name in society he protested sitting up and fluffing up the many pillows to sit upright this is not my only residence dearest alan she chuckled rising to get herself some more gin by this time she was a trifle unsteady on her feet and he was sure it was the drink that had given her courage enough to make her proposition i have property of my own mostly rentals i cannot count on my husband to play me fair should he have the good grace to die there are children to consider but over the years i have provided for my own security now i could lease you a lovely flat i own this building entire would you prefer a suite here or would you like a set of rooms with a harbor view closer to the piers you tell me and i shall move my things next door to you we shall be no more than friendly neighbors should anyone remark on our companionship of course the rooms would cost you nothing and i could furnish them to your taste and put it down to my fondness for you and the way you bull me all over the lot the fob and chain are only a token of what i could offer the young man who so eagerly tops me so well and often her smile was positively vulpine though she meant it to be seductive the hawkish nose had a lot to do with it whew alan wheezed thats a damned handsome offer from a handsome piece of woman i might add then you will seems a waste when id get ashore so seldom he stalled gaining time to think this over and people would talk anyway aye people would she allowed breezily people already do no matter what one does in society rumors are more interesting than truth dont ye know and the naughtier the better theres not one woman on this accursed island who hasnt been whispered about only half of them with good cause only fools marry for love unless they both have wealth and security of their own or know how to pile it up as i have that victory celebration at the beaumans i know more than two dozen women there who already have their own pleasurable arrangements with other men and their husbands have theirs as well god dont admit youre truly an innocent no one in their right minds has ever called me innocent alan laughed the only important thing about our wretched english society is to be discreet and one may do anything one wants betty hillwood said with a sneer and if one has money then no one will even utter one peep of remonstrance you wont hear sermons preached against anyone like me as long as i give to the alms box and pay the poors rate on time one only gets exposed when one goes broke or gets too careless alan finished for her taking a sip of wine from an offered glass exactly though i hardly have to tell you that alan dearest youre discreet in your visits to me i trust completely he assured her the last thing he needed was for anyone to know that he was courting lucy beauman and rogering betty hillwood at the same time who knows you may even wish to return to england with me eh after the war when the seas are safe ill go back to london where i may live in a proper style betty prophesied downing her gin and pouring another you shall be on halfpay by then and as you say london will not have gotten any cheaper my husband can stay here and rot for all i care hes probably peppered to his eyebrows with the pox by now anyway you would have servants fine clothes anything your heart could ask and you would have me and i could have you every night and day we could live together or apart but only a bit apart i would want you to spear me and split me until i scream for sheer joy now what do you say fool alan thought trying to plaster his most disarming smile on his face as he pondered this new development she may be a good ride but im damned if i want a steady diet of hillwood mutton and im not so povertystricken i need to be supported tis flatterin ill grant but shes a little long in the tooth for more than a few hours you must know betty that ive been up to the beauman place quite often he temporized trying to be honest without hurting her feelings their daughter lucy and i well nothings been said one way or the other but eventually i would wish to settle down and wed somebody wouldnt i and where would that leave you i mean he added with a sudden burst of inspiration it takes an act of parliament to get a divorce and your husband could maybe stand going his own way but no man wants to be known as an outright cuckold why risk his anger and your reputation going for more than we have now hes been cuckold since betty declared exasperated with his sudden cold feet not ill grant by anyone that could even approach your talent at it dearest and as for the beaumans that pack of chawbacons for all their airs theyve not been long off the haywagon with the manners of stablehands oh theyre rich ill allow and you see security with that little chit do you well let me tell you shes not been pining away for you to sail back into her life no party is complete without her and her pack of admirers just slavering for a grope at her and shes not exactly been shy at being groped at ill wager now hold on alan grunted not wanting to hear anything bad about lucy he was indeed fond of her money aside and the last time mrs hillwood had given him the dirt on someone lieutenant kenyon for instance one of his grandest illusions had been shattered he would hear no smear on lucys character you may dislike the whole family and frankly they are a bit rough around the edges ill admit but thats no reason to slander her oh poor dear alan betty muttered cynically do you think youre the only buck pawing the ground shes walked on shes young beautiful and ungodly rich into the bargain but could she ever give you half the pleasure ive given you just this day or would she most likely be so shy and inexperienced a jaded rogue like you would scare the breath out of her though where she gets her purity is beyond me what do you mean damnit peace my love i speak of the beaumans of course father off with a girl he keeps in one of my apartments i might add really alan blurted sitting back on his heels at some really lively gossip hugh the eldest son betty smirked swaying her hips seductively as she came back to the bed and stretched out near him hes right fond of fancies he is fancies alan stated hed heard the term before back in the carolinas with the chiswick family but hadnt known what it meant very pale very elegantlooking samboes houseservant quality half white or almost white youve seen them around town she chuckled swinging her glass back and forth without spilling a drop hugh cant get enough of them over on portland bight where they have one of their sugar plantations hugh keeps a stable of them not in the house except when anne and the children are in town though i believe mrs beauman is the only one that doesnt know about her own menfolk but i could be wrong but then many women suffer in silence for the sake of the children or their security unlike me well stap me alan said amazed at the ways of the world though he should have known better by then the whole damned family mrs beauman no betty sighed she really is a sweet thing but not too observant of most goingson anne hughs wife well i think shes aware of it but as long as she doesnt have to be enceinte over and over i doubt she minds that much no woman wishes to have a child a year and never have another hope of anything else until her womb shrivels there was the most delicious doings two years ago my dear betty snuggled closer to impart her intimate information do tell alan replied leaning closer during the slave revolt all the womenfolk came into kingston for safety while the men were off with the militia and the troops betty snickered in glee and there was this one glorious young officer from the garrison a captain who took a particular fancy for the handsome anne beauman as far as decorum allowed they were inseparable and did you rent him rooms too alan mocked no but it was powerful wondrous how often anne had to go out to shop and never found anything worth buying and how often young captain mclntyre was away from his quarters a friend of mine mrs howard the frumpy one you met well servants may come and go with no notice and she set her maid to watch and it appears that captain mclntyre would enter certain lodgings every day and soon after the lovely anne beauman would enter those same lodgings and stay for three or four hours at a stretch then they would leave separately she first and him about a quarterhour later so what happened ah the estimable young captain was carried off by the yellow fever after he went back into the field and mistress anne was seen no more about kingston for about a year off to portland bight no matter that the slaves were still in revolt twas said hugh came back in a furious choler and dragged her off damme thats amazing id have never thought her capable when disappointed or crossed anyone is capable alan dear she told him condescendingly not only capable but eager and willing to do almost anything to get their own back he succeeded in getting the subject changed to one she liked a whole lot better which did not require words avoiding any more speculation on her offer as well and once she took on a larger cargo of holland gin than was good for her trim he could leave her snoring it off he sponged down once more dressed and headed out and the servant girl slipped back in the door as he slipped out still as silent as the sphinx down the steps to the courtyard with its fountain fish pond and flower beds off which all the lodgings opened then out the double iron gate to the bright street which shimmered in heat he stood there a moment almost sneezing at the change from a fairly cool thickwalled building to the sharp warmth of late afternoon im going to break this off he decided good as betty hillwood wanted to be to him and as wanton a ride as she was her proposition was nothing he wanted to be part of while he did not consider himself one of gods innocents betty hillwood could make him feel like a gawking choirboy with her sour jaded outlook on the world and he wasnt sure he was ready to share her state of mind i mean damme pleasures fine but my god he groused as he began to stroll off trying to stick to the shadows where the sun did not strike with such ferocity ive never heard a good word pass her lips bout anyone or anything have i he had just finished four straight hours with a woman who would fulfill his every desire and he should have been skipping and laughing with delight at his good fortune she had given him a chain and fob worth an easy fifty or sixty guineas but he had little joy from it im not one for the bluedevils he muttered pondering his moodiness must be her the sour bitch no wonder her husband took off for the backcountry if thats the sort of thing he had to hear all the time well thankee for the gift and thankee for all the quim betty dear but thats the last time i sport with you or give ear to your poison besides he assured himself looking for a cause for joy wasnt he handsome and pleasing enough to have a younger and prettier wench if the humors took him again didnt lucy beauman go faint at the sight of him he had bigger fish to fry and betty hillwood was a possible embarrassment if word got out about their affair she would be nice to look back on but that was all he headed for the grapes the cheery red brick inn and public house at the foot of the docks and the landing stage for a last cool mug of ale or beer before taking a bumboat out to shrike the heat was killing and all his pleasurable exertions had left him loosehipped and a trifle weak in the knees so when hearing the clatter of a coach coming down the road from behind him he gladly shifted over towards the nearest wall into a patch of shade and leaned on the wall to take a breather he turned to see if the coach would miss him in the narrow lane and was amazed to see that the light open twohorse carriage bore mrs anne beauman and her maid he lifted his hat and gave a bow as they neared and the carriage squeaked to a stop rocking on its leather suspension straps mistress beauman a good day to you maam mister lewrie she beamed back at him looking fetching in a white and paleblue gown and a wide straw hat that echoed her colors are you forced to walk in this oppressive heat sir shanks ponies maam for journeys too short for a coach alan laughed lightly in reply so formal alan she admonished and just two days ago it was anne get you in and we shall deliver you to your destination my undying thanks anne alan said as the footman got down from the rear postillion folded down the iron step and opened the low door for him alan settled into the rearfacing forward seat next to a large wrapped bundle i am only going to the docks anne if that is not too large an imposition on your time none at all she replied reaching over to touch his knee with her large laced fan as the coachee whipped up you come ashore though without paying court to our dear lucy how remiss of you she teased i only had the few hours today alan replied reddening slightly then i shall not tell her i saw you or she would feel slighted no matter the reason anne chuckled going back to fanning herself with one backward glance she got her black maid to adjust the large parasol over her head so the sun would not strike her and ruin her complexion now why alan speculated in appraisal would hugh beauman want to dally with one of his fancies when he could sport with this one any night in bright sunlight anne beauman appeared even more exotic than before her hair and complexion dark making alan wonder if she were the offspring of some island racial mix herself possibly some spanish blood or sprung from those black irish sired by the survivors of the armada there had been damned few black island women that had tempted him and he could not think why anyone would spurn the charms of such a handsome woman for those of some slave in the backcountry even if the slave was close to european but then why was he fond of chambermaids and willing widows he asked himself perhaps it was an acquired taste not much wind today alan observed as the coach clattered on its way towards the center of town i wonder youre out yourself housekeeping errands im afraid she replied with a brief frown my newest gown in that bundle next to you was spotted with soup and no one seems to be able to get it out i was hoping my dressmaker could run up a new panel so i could wear it sunday and what brings you ashore oh just some shopping only poor shops up the way you came anne pointed out you must have been in search of a bargain and a little sightseeing just to get off the ship for a few hours see some new faces and did you see anyone interesting any new sights anne rejoined mildly amused as though she knew what he had been doing and with whom not much up that way you are right alan replied flushing with heat under his clothes at her probing might i offer you some reward for saving me from a long hot walk a cool drink perhaps there is no need to reward me alan though i must admit something cool would feel welcome i had no idea it was this hot anne said plying the fan more energetically where would you have in mind well theres the grapes he suggested unable to think up anyplace else on short noticehe had not been ashore in kingston often enough to know all its establishments hmm she frowned a sailors haunt i fear not quite genteel is it i thought it was rather nice alan shrugged a bit too many navy officers and merchant captains trading factors and such there are few places a lady may go away from home ah she brightened there is however a small public house near my dressmakers baltasars the emigй frenchman who is the proprietor styles it as a restaurant quite the latest thing in paris he says no lodgings just food and drink can you imagine the hard part is imagining how the man turns a profit alan said grinning chophouses and publichouses were usually close by bagnios had rooms to let for private dining and discreet sport with dinner companions or could trot out a chambermaid or a prostitute for their patrons without that sideline he could not see how money could be made not in a harbor town at any rate if you do not mind me seeing to my errand first anne asked as though eager to try the place if i do not delay you from returning to your ship at the proper time he was forced to walk her into the dressmakers shop where several island ladies of social note were taking rest from the days warmth gossiping and killing time while fabrics and laces were considered the latest points of style were admired or denigrated and the small staff bustled about to fetch out requests alan felt like a total fool standing by the door with his hat under his arm feeling the cool gaze of the women they glanced at him scowling a bit at the effrontery of a man to invade their sanctuary from husbands shot glances at anne and then shifted to gaze most significantly at each other damn all this feminine truck alan fumed trying to look patient calm and innocent though he felt as examined as if he had gone in naked as the day he was born the restaurant a few doors down was almost empty thank god but not a bad sort of place screened from the street by a high brick wall and an iron gate with a second false wall behind the gate for discretion the small front garden was sheltered from the sun by thin slats of wood in an overhead screen supported by trellises all adrip with vines or hung with flowers in hanging baskets there was another fountain to cool the air a series of french doors at the back of the garden terrace led into the main dining room and kitchens and more doors and windows overlooked the harbor from a back terrace with the same sort of screen overhead except for a small brass plaque on the iron gate alan would have never known it was there he had walked by it before and thought it a residence they were seated at a small table near the back terrace where the shadows were deepest and the thick walls of the building the stone floor and the light harbor wind gave the impression of coolness the proprietor a frog dandyprat who appeared lighter in his pumps than most tripped over and bowed deeply and elegantly making the usual gilt and beshit flowery words of salutation to what were probably the only new customers he had seen in a long afternoon and he was disappointed that they did not wish to sample his solid fare but only wanted drinks he did however serve them a treat he told them was known in the spanish indies as sangria a fruit juice and hock concoction made to a recipe he had received in havana during his service to the court of the captaingeneral himself its quite delicious anne said after taking a sip and most refreshing i have been told that too much acid fruit is bad in a hot climate but i never saw the sense of it hmm not bad alan had to agree must keep it on ice its almost cold or in a hanging ceramic jar anne told him everyone in the islands learns that if what the spanish call an olla is hung in shade where there is a chance of wind water or whatever it seems to cool on its own one may see beads of water on the outside and it feels cold to the touch quite remarkable really hmm one could do that aboard ship below decks and god knows out at sea wed have bags of wind your shipmates would think you quite ingenious alan anne promised well i hope you were not bored by the sights of our poor city today or by having to escort me to the dressmakers oh not at all he assured her you looked as if you would strangle back there she teased well they did make me feel dawkish alan had to admit easing back in his chair all those ladies eyeing me like i had the kings evil and at you i hope my presence gave them nothing to talk about he almost bit his cheek in alarm when he realized he wasnt to know about her alleged past dalliance and his comment made it sound as if he did i mean he qualified they looked like an idle lot people like that usually misconstrue the most innocent event and turn it into a subject for gossip bored to tears with their own miserable lives i expect yes i suppose they could anne looked at him directly over the rim of her glass but since there is nothing between us but the hope of you becoming a member of our family what harm well none i suppose he shrugged and hunched back forward over the rim of the table trying to look innocent once more are you as worldly as you sound then does our lucy have cause to worry she asked softly with a grin at his discomfort now you are teasing me he said ive seen gossipmongers in action before though and i would hate to do anything that would jeopardize the beauman family name or do anything to hurt my chances either then you shall be making a formal proposal for lucys hand perhaps i should tell her i saw you after all and how you poured out your heart to me about your fondest desires anne smiled now you really are teasing me he protested ill own to that she laughed are you that eager for her id not come traipsing by two or three times a week if i was merely entertaining myself anne let me try to explain he began trying to form the words carefully so he would not be misunderstood at first on antigua i thought lucy was the most beautiful girl i had ever seen and the sweetest but at the time she was only a girl my admirals niece i had no idea if i had a future in the navy much less what would happen to me when the war ended i had a small annuity from my father but no hopes for anything else lately though there is a larger annuity from my grandmother and an inheritance mostly her personal goods and paraphernalia and ive prizemoney coming due when i go on halfpay so i can now offer something other than creampot love never even thought i could really court lucy and be taken seriously before though we were allowed to correspond i dont know what will satisfy the beaumans but i am willing to try my hand even if the war isnt over yet maybe my timing is bad but we may sail soon and god knows when shrike puts back into kingston allow me to play the devils advocate for you anne offered if you do not mind me prying what is your estate near on twentyfive hundred pounds in prizemoney he said adding in his hoard of stolen guineas twice that in inheritance and two hundred pounds a year not a stick of land or rents though but godamercy anne laughed throwing back her head even if a girl brought nothing but her linens youre a prime catch alan for half a tick id be interested myself were i not already settled dont say tempting things like that he thought quickly so i do stand a chance alan asked ive not been too abrupt so far have i do they doubt my feelings for her or think me too poor to pay serious court to her well i would say you stand as good a chance as any more so than most of the local lads anne told him i know they were concerned when they brought lucy back from antigua that you had no lands or inheritance yet you had fought a duel for her honor and uncle onsley and auntie maude spoke well of you both professionally and for your personal qualities thank god for that compared to some of the island boys of good family though her prospects would be better with one of them anne cautioned you must know there are many whove squired her you compare more polished more refined a gentleman to them educations and manners in the indies cant match a homeraised young man but yes alan almost groaned at that qualifying but in sympathy for his cause perhaps or to calm his fears she laid a cool hand on his wrist and let it linger you must know that her parents are just as interested in a suitor who brings profitable connections plantations new opportunities for trade money to put into ships and cargoes or places to raise new capital tis a curse of our society that even now after years of seeing the wretched results of marriage formed on pecuniary interests instead of worry about a young womans eventual happiness parents still follow their own desires they may say they are looking out for lucys happiness and security and certainly i am sure they shall when the time comes but you must know the beaumans she pressed a slight sadness coming to her voice and her huge dark eyes it is just as easy to find contentment and a good life with a man more endowed with the means to security to them that may mean someone of their own station even someone older and more settled in his affairs as you should well know i see alan nodded betty hillwood had not put him in the most jovial mood he had ever experienced and he wasnt exactly cherrymerry at this new information either its changing back in england you know as long as the suitor has stability they seem to let the daughters have more free will would that was always so anne exclaimed sharp enough to make the nodding frog proprietor glance up briefly and she took hold of his wrist instead of merely resting her hand on it wedding for love all other things being equal surely causes no more distress than marriages without it and gives more reasons for sweet contentment later she seemed to speak from painful personal experience but alan was cautious enough to keep his rebellious trap shut and finally she said seeming to wilt back into her chair and removing her hand to toy with the stem of her wineglass there is your age and lucys they believe neither of you is old enough to know your own minds yet bloody hell alan spat softly too crestfallen to guard his choice of words was he truly wasting his time courting lucy and would be denied the joy of her company forever potential wealth be damned he suddenly felt the need of someone sweet and young and unspoiled someone even naive and in love with the world instead of trulls like betty hillwood and their weary cynicism and when pray do they think we should be old enough to know our own minds alan asked sourly and please them into the bargain its a rare girl who weds before her midtwenties even here anne told him gently with enough wealth that may not answer but id think even the most ardent swain from the best familyd have to content himself with a wait of at least three more years till lucys twentyone whew and father beauman has been talking of retirement lately anne went on of going back to england and leaving the family business to hugh with floss husband to help him theyre thinking that lucy and ledyard would benefit from a couple of years in london society to put some ton on their manners and give them a better future oh bloody alan sighed could you wait that long alan id hoped not to he growled i mean god knows what could happen in the meantime half a world away even if the war ends and i pay off at home you might meet someone more pleasing to your nature in that time alan anne said lucy could meet someone else and i know how much the thought of that causes you pain but perhaps it is not meant to be no matter how fond we desire something or someone there is always a just reason that we do not attain our wishes we must trust that things may turn out for the best though the pangs of our heart blind us to admitting the truth of it you know anne alan scoffed every time ive ever heard that line of reasoning its been from someone who already had what they wanted like telling the poor that eating regulars a bother when you get right down to it he was surprised that anne chuckled with amusement at his statement and after a moment he had to smile in spite of his feelings of doom and gloom it was presumptuous of me to preach at you ill own anne said with a smile it was the way you said it that tickled me you must know i meant no cruelty at your disappointment oh i know he said patting the back of her hand without thinking and was surprised for a second time when she did not draw back from his touch at least i can still laugh i think im sure weve both heard what other people thinks best for us off in some future well find something or someone better than what we wish now but lord its a wrench twill make a better man of ya me lad she laughed once more at the pompous tone which he had meant to mock his fathers pronouncements you sound like my own father anne confessed still not trying to disengage his touch you not so much younger than i and i can assure you it wasnt so long ago i suffered these selfsame pangs in the name of love and heard the same platitudes that is comfort coming from you anyway anne though i must admit that what i yearned for and what i have now are close to the same sort of pleasurable contentment she finally said and slowly drew her hand back to her lap its just that i dont believe ive ever been in love like this before anne alan went on fiddling with his own glass and topping up their drinks from the sweaty pitcher of wine come to think on it im not sure ive ever been in love at all so jaded so young she shook her head in mock sadness i ran with a rather woolly crowd back in london love was just a game one played to learn how to do it at parties we were more interested in the baser aspects and if we fell in love then it happened two or three times a week and then the navys terribly down on it dear me perhaps i should warn the family after all i wish it was women who could treat love so casually and prosper ive become a much more responsible person since joining the navy mind alan pointed out with a grin oh sailors always do turn saintly do they not then tell me pray if you are so reformed why would you associate with betty hillwood ah eh those were her lodgings i saw you leaving or do you know another party in that building anne asked not quite sternly but not exactly amused either that would not endear you to the beaumans should they learn of it not from me alan surely but perhaps you should consider reform if you wish lucys hand good christ shes got me by the short and curlies he thought wildly had she led him on with all the handholding to see if he was going to rise to her bait had the beaumans put her on him to smoke him out and had he blown the gaff to the bloody horizon when in doubt lie like blazes he decided i made her acquaintance a year ago alan replied trying to toss it off lightly and she was at your fatherinlaws party she invited me to tea with the hint that some shore lodgings could be obtained cheaply between voyages but she really is the most vindictive person i ever did see and damme but i was the only guest at what i thought was to be a tea frankly she more than hinted at some fondness she said shed developed for me not my sort really i heard more scandal in half an hour than id heard in london in a month it sounds innocent enough anne commented with a skeptical cast to her features i have already admitted to you that im no calfshead in relations with the ladies but i doubt a bosuns mated be that desperate he told her with what he hoped was a disarming grin of rough honesty if i would have consort to answer brute nature id do better than mrs hillwood surely excuse me if i distress you with my choice of words anne but id like you to understand me plain i am not shocked alan she said finally shaking her head you would have to speak much plainer to rival anything ive heard in what passes for genteel conversation in the indies i must tell you i was pained to recognize you leaving her gate i would not like to think that your talk of true love and your eagerness to pay court to lucy was a fraud based on mercenary designs on the beauman guineas this mort reads me like an open book he thought as you said yourself one must always consider the family as well as the young lady alan said scooting his chair up closer to the table for more intimacy for his confession i have no lands no rents and id be a fool to think lucy and i could live on moonbeams but with lucys portion and my inheritance the land could come and i cant deny that the thought of what is necessary to keep her in her proper station hasnt crossed my mind i dont want to sound harsh but reality has a way of being harsh id not even persist if i had no hopes of providing for her and you mustnt doubt the depth of feeling i hold for lucy i love her dearly as well anne relented so you must see my concern that she isnt fooled and her heart broken by someone who cares more for her dowry than her feelings no i dont doubt your affection for her and im sure she has high regard for you as well though it will be years before she may realize i just dont want to see her hurt thats all alan nor would i wish to see you hurt so you are saying i should not aspire to too much too soon alan asked frankly puzzled by her statement and her sad look or is there something else i should know a serious rival just that you should learn to be patient anne said with an expression that was close to misery and their hands found each other again in unspoken sympathy and this time her fingers wrapped around his firmly and dont close yourself off from all the other young ladies you may encounter in the time you have to wait i dont say you should behave without license but you have time to be sure of your feelings and your desires before committing yourself once wed its not a thing one may change if one makes a mistake one has to make the best of it even if its sometimes unpleasant he gave her fingers a squeeze in commiseration and she responded with a firm grip on his im sorry you didnt get what you wanted or what you thought youd have anne what she snapped almost jerking free of him certainly not you sounded so bitter before i thought you spoke from experience he told her softly she was trying to tell him something and he didnt know quite what she meant a warning that he was wasting his time with lucy for some unknown reason and telling him to spare himself some future pain that he would never be truly considered for lucys hand whatever it was he was grateful to her for trying to express herself and he felt a flash of sympathy for her married to hugh beauman who had not been her true choice it seemed if he read her hints correctly and then she had found comfort with that captain mclntyre or so mrs hillwood said had she been ready to run off and leave hugh beauman for him before he died she was a proper lady not given to aimless amours for the sake of amusement or quick gratification a woman with two children to think about and a place in society she would lose she must have been deeply in love he decided not bitter alan she finally said after a long silence i am content im sorry if i gave you a wrong impression i thank you for your kind intentions but they arent necessary though i think more of you now for saying what you did theres more to you than i first thought the girl who gets you shall be lucky if she knows how to keep you interested the right girl wouldnt have much trouble if i let my heart rule instead of my brain too much pondering is bad for you and too little dear sir is just as bad she grinned quickly now im sure your captain has need of your talents and i must be on my way home and when next i see lucy i shall praise you to the skies if you are certain in your affections praise away alan laughed and rose to dig into his coin purse for the reckoning with such an ally how could i worry if you will keep me current with what the beaumans think of me i shall she promised and should you wish to discuss the progress of your suit with someone who truly likes you you have but to drop me a note and i shall make time for you feel free to call on me at any time should you have need he walked her out to her carriage and handed her in it was only after he was ensconced in the grapes near the cold fireplace with a pint mug of beer at his lips that he thought again about what implications anne beauman had left unsaid surely lucy was daft about him but what had she meant by describing lucys feelings as only high regard anne had warned him off betty hillwood but had left the barn door wide open should he find someone else to dally with as long as his intentions were sure had practically shoved him into sampling what the wide world had to offer before he made his final choice and gave up his freedom oh surely not alan thought she couldnt be suggesting that she and i lewrie youre cuntstruck if they smile at you you want to put the leg over right thenit dont signify they want you best put that thought out of your lustmaddened little mind lets not try to bull every bit of mutton in the entire christian world besides being related to lucy annes a real lady no matter how unhappy her marriage is if ladies were willing alan lewrie would be the first in line to alleviate their unhappiness he had almost cut his milkteeth on the ones who cast about for comfort and pleasure but to work at seducing a properly respectable woman who had no mutual wish to initiate an affair had always struck him as a caddish deceit damnit all he thought ive some scruples dont i hell maybe i really do after all why ruin a ladys reputation and get an angry husband chasing me with pistol or sword when theres battalions of em trailing their colors just waiting for a rake like me to give em the eye not anneshes not one to give anyone a tumble or two and then walk away nor is lucy bless her right ive had my fun for now lets do up our breeches and keep em done up lewrie lad no more betty hillwood no thoughts of anne concentrate on lucy the decision made him feel more grown up more in control of his urges and his choices in life though he doubted he would remain a celibate but that was a different matter and as he finished his beer he could congratulate himself that he was finally becoming an adult with a clearer idea of what he wanted in life chapter jesus christ he breathed as he read the note again more to the point notes one from lucy i noe nott wat cusstoms are in yur circels back home in london but imagin howe distressed i was to lern from a sorse who shal remane nameless that a yung man i thought werthy of my love coud make sutch shameless and lood advanses to my own estima vertuus sisterinlaw anne i never herd the like of howe yu carreed on with her in publick to yur everlasting shame and the ruenashun of her good name mine eys are nowe opend to wat sort of corinthian yu reely are and i must say it braks my hart to think i wuns consi thought we wood one day be congoy mareed there was much more in the same vein some of it indecipherable of course suitably tearstained but the meat of the missive was that she never wanted to see or hear from him again and would be sorry when brother hugh put him in the cold ground for dallying with his wife but i didnt do anything alan ranted in the semiprivacy of his cabin god almighty for the first time in my life im almost innocent to make matters worse there was also a note from hugh beauman advising alan that if he did not relish dying on the point of his sword he should make himself available as soon as possible to explain himself and the report of his conduct towards a happily married woman of distinction mr beauman sr had put in his own postscript denying him any more welcome at his home or any further contact with any member of his family until the matter had been cleared up one way or another and ive been so bloody good lately he thought sadly as he let that collection of epistolary misery fall to the bunk from almost nerveless fingers he had stayed aboard ship for the last week with no more trips to betty hillwoods and had answered her written invitations with pleas of duty he had gone up to lucys and played the virtuous young swain listening to lucy and floss butcher music on last years harpsichord which the tropic damp and the termites had soured even before their untalented fingers got hold of it he had drunk innumerable gallons of tea and simpered politely at the social chinwagging he had acted properly respectful to everyone that called especially anne beauman when she and her husband had been there too damn damn damn he moaned now what do i do he needed to think hard and the stuffy cabin below decks was not conducive to logic he threw on his coat and hat and stepped out into the wardroom where several of the others were lazing about summat troublin ye mister lewrie sir caldwell asked him with a sly smile as he looked up from one of his charts he was updating and walsham the marine lieutenant gave him a halfhidden smirk nothing particularly mister caldwell nothing a fellow of so much dash may not solve walsham said with a titter damn your eyes sir alan spat how come you by that nothing sir walsham sobered or tried to only that i hear youve cut a dashing figure ashore lately some poor girl with a jackinthebox well twenty guineasll take care of it id tread wary walsham alan snarled leaning over the table to face him you might be slandering someone dear to me with your feeble japes and ill not stand for it before walsham could reraise his fallen jaw alan spun about and trotted up the accommodation ladder to the gun deck then up to the gangways where he could pace furiously william pitt hissed at him as he stamped around the focsle belfry get out of my sight you worthless little hairball alan roared and pitt laid back his ears shrank away and ran forward while the crew on watch sprang to whatever duties they were performing lazily a moment before mister lewrie sir the quartermasters mate asked keeping back just in case the first lieutenant exploded at him for interrupting what he barked stomping to a stop is note come haboard fer ya sir the man whispered in terror of his possible wrath offering another one of those damned letters bloody hell another one alan growled snatching it from him and raising a finger to the brim of his cocked hat in rough salute so the man could shrink away this one was from betty hillwood thats right pile it on why dont you alan thought casting his eyes towards heaven my god things could not possibly get much worse could they wonder what the old mort wants after opening it alan discovered that yes indeed things could get worse a small whimper of pain escaped him as he read it you must come ashore and meet me or suffer such dire consequences as you may not imagine to your reputation and your hopes for surviving the troubles you are in if you do not confront me by sundown today i shall be forced to tell all sufferin shit he hissed now what whats all this about alan demanded after he had gotten his captains leave to absent himself and had gone to bettys lodgings youve been a fool alan dear betty hillwood told him with a cool air for once she was properly dressed fit for genteel company and had the tea service on the breakfast table for them oh ill grant you that he fumed declining her offer of tea and heading for the sideboard for a glass of wine but i did nothing with anne beauman it was totally innocent i was not speaking of any troubles you are in with the beauman family betty frowned i am talking of the trouble you are in with me look betty mrs hillwood he fumbled we had a lot of pleasure but you beg off seeing me yet you continue to court that simpering fool that mere chit of a girl lucy beauman she intoned icily anne beauman saw me leaving your apartments thats why i didnt come back alan exclaimed she threatened to tell the beaumans out of concern for her younger sisterinlaw you refused my offer of companionship and support alan no matter the circumstances she drilled home archly no one spurns me alan no one surely you see that its impossible alan stated aghast at her attitude and i was kept aboard by duties the navy dont let me come and go as i please ah but the navy allows you time enough ashore to woo your little lucy does it not so dont lie about having no time for me it wont answer but anne will tell the beaumans about us yes she will if she has any sense betty chuckled what better way to dispel the gossip that you squired her about town and practically pawed her at the frenchmans but i didnt damn you he snapped oh i am sure you did nothing so crude betty laughed thats not your style dear boy but what people bruit about as truth and what is real are totally foreign to each other our boresome little circle has a juicy new scandal to twitter about and im sure theyll work it to death before theyre through i can explain everything he insisted feeling cornered but game and i cant believe anne would throw me to the wolves it isnt her style either in some ways you are so innocent she cooed but either way you are finished with the beaumans no more hopes of a profitable match with that simple young tit even if you could explain everything my god youre jealous he burst out in sudden understanding did you have anything to do with this rumor getting started not i alan you did that yourself you and anne with more common sense and discretion you would not have gone into the shop with her mrs hillwood explained one does not appear so publicly with a married woman you should have gone on to the restaurant and waited for her or found a more private place to do your talking perhaps gone for a carriage ride which would have appeared unremarkable youre jealous of lucy arent you he reiterated not at all she replied lazily i would never have denied you such a hopeless pursuit as long as we could continue our pleasurable couplings with proper discretion of course you must have known it was hopeless from the start impressive you may be but your purse isnt deep enough to suit the beaumans idea of a suitable mate for their daughter id suspect them of starting the rumor the hell they would alan ranted it hurts them just as much as it does me far easier on everybody to make you and me public for all i know we probably already are betty informed him breezily now do sit down and have some tea with me and then we shall go to my chamber for something more fun good god ive got a daddy and a husband sharpening their swords for a crack at me and you want to get diddled he complained it will come out alright alan sit down just as easily as one rumor can get started i and my friends can start another that you did nothing while i cannot get you back into the good graces of the beauman family i can save you from further harm she patted the settee beside her you would not have anne beauman suffer because you did not take my advice would you and how may i whisper what you need to do if you do not sit down here and let me get on with it sorry but i intend to go see hugh beauman and mister beauman and get this straightened out right now while i have shore leave he replied heatedly setting down his glass and tugging his waistcoat straight and do you also intend to continue refusing me she asked i dont see how it would be possible he told her and yes i did consider your kind offer im really flattered and grateful you find me that attractive mrs hillwood but i must decline i must be my own man dye see i am sorry you feel that way alan and so shall you be very sorry indeed she frowned setting down her cup i shall give you one chance to reconsider after i have told you something else to help you make up your mind and what pray could that be he snapped eager to be away and a trifle afraid of what she might come up with you cannot force people to shower their affections as you said we are probably an item of gossip alan but as long as we maintain a certain decorum theres no problem everyone knows about my marriage and what two estranged people do two people with money and high position is their own business so he sneered getting impatient to leave but if a ceitain upstart young naval officer who has already caused a storm of comment by his brash lust she narrated with relish was to write a note to a lady of breeding and position another lady at the same time expressing how much he would like to couple with that lady in graphic detail and language even uncultured men would flinch from then how much more trouble do you think he could get into what the hell are you talking about last year before you sailed away to glory you left me a note alan do you remember it she smiled in victory oh christ yes he did remember it she had finally gone off into gininduced slumber and he had left her a letter on her pillow thanking her for bedding him and hoping to repeat the experience the next time he was in port and to match her own lusty vocabulary he had phrased the contents in pure bosuns mate billingsgate of good wellknown english words of mostly four letters in reference to her body his body what was done with them and certain favorite variations in technique or novelty he would like to perform again let me get this straight if i walk out of here without giving you what amounts to permanent possession of my prick youll hold that note over my head exactly you silly bitch what would people say about you if it got to be common knowledge youd be cutting your own throat go ahead i might remind you its undated alan if i say i received it just yesterday then it has nothing to say about my reputation but everything to say about yours you wouldnt and while my poor husband couldnt care less if i open myself to every man and boy in kingston he could not ignore such an insult to the honor of his wife she went on remorselessly with a pleased smile at her cleverness discreet fucking is no fucking at all but importunate addresses from a scandalridden corinthian such as you would be more than he could stand it would be a killing offense while i may play the shocked matron it may even appear that i spurned you and you wrote that note in desperate want of me to convince me to bed you in that instance my repute could work for me while i have been known to succumb to charming gentlemen i most certainly do not have to entertain foulmouthed guttersnipes you really dont care what i say do you alan muttered in shaky awe of just how low she could go if i give in you force me to stay with you and destroy my chances with lucy beauman if i refuse i still am denied lucy and you get your revenge either way its not that you want me so much as you dont want me to dismiss you before youre ready i see your game you dont want to be jilted for somebody younger and prettier my god do you really think youd make me perform like a trained terrier roll over boy good boy heres a treat cockstand boy big un so what is your answer sir stay and survive this contretemps she demanded evenly or go and be destroyed utterly either way you may forget any arrangement with lucy beauman i do not mean to ruin you and as you may remember i can be forgiving and sweet to you face facts and stay alan dear and i shall treat this as just a little domestic argument that occurs between lovers either way as you put it im looking at a duel hugh beauman or your sodomite of a husband alan sighed all to assure yourself of some energetic sex to salve your pride would you deny me my pride she laughed thinking her victory complete as she watched him vacillate almost deflate with resignation stay with me and answer my desires and youll be safe from further scandal and i shall reward you with all the fondness of a satisfied lover i shall dote on your every whim and spare you the necessity of a duel if you fear such he was indeed halfway to giving in to her will of taking the most logical and safest course reminding himself that she was an impressive and pleasurable ride it wasnt as if he would have to get reenthused about mounting her even with a gun to his head he had blown away any hopes of marrying lucy beauman now or in the future so what was the difference yet in his weakest moment she struck sparks on the flinty core of his stubborness with her comment that questioned his courage by god no one did that and lived to tell of it damn you to hell for that he spat you cant buy me like a joint of beef and you cant threaten me bring your husband on and ill chop him to flinders if he wants to blaze ill put a pistol ball right through him if that makes you a deliriously happy widow into the bargain then be damned to you you shall regret this she rasped her face paling i thought you were a young man of my own tastes grown beyond the petty strictures of our hypocritical society but i now see youre just another common sort a secret hymnsinger with no courage to live his own life better that than a draggled whore who has to hire men to top her he grinned finished his wine and flung the glass across the room to shatter on the stuccoed wall damme have i ruined the set a pity aint it bye love on his way to hugh beaumans town house he bought a light guttapercha cane little thicker than his index finger when the servant announced him anne came running out into the front hall hugh is not here alan and you should not be she warned where is he then alan asked i have things to discuss with him he went to father beaumans oh surely you wont fight him hes ready to kill you do anything but fight him when he asks tell him this you took the risk to your repute to warn me off betty hillwood do you understand alan told her you knew you would have sent me a letter but you saw me in town and took the risk there is nothing between us and you touched my hand once he would not believe me she almost wailed sure that blood would be spilled before the day was out blame it all on betty hillwood remember that she started the rumor her or her friends to get even with me he will not speak to me so how may i tell him anything because of captain mclntyre alan asked how oh god ill not see you hurt any more anne he promised ive most like lost any chance with lucy but ill get you out of this remember what i said lieutenant alan lewrie sirs the butler announced and alan stalked past him to confront hugh beauman and his father both of whom looked shocked that he would even dare show his face to them but after they got over their shock their angry expressions prophecied a hanging there sir alan said flinging the guttapercha walking stick to the parqueted floor at hugh beaumans feet if you feel the need to use that on me feel free should you wish it occur in the main plaza we may go there and i shall be completely at your disposal i shall not defend myself his boldness disarmed them as he thought it might allowing him to present his case before they dredged their thoughts back into order mister beauman master hugh i have been a complete callow fool and i humbly beg your forgiveness for any taint of scandal that might have touched your family but i assure you as gods my witness mistress anne beauman is completely blameless if you will indulge me um yes little privacy what beauman sr stammered waving his hand towards a small parlor or study off the main hall once the doors were shut alan took the offensive once more i would take a public whipping to settle this if that is what it takes he repeated you squired my wife about the town sir hugh began working up his anger once more now that they were in private you were seen fondling her sir what manner of man would expose a proper lady to that dragging her into a publichouse sir because i needed warning sir and she took the risk to her reputation to repair a greater risk to the beauman family reputation you should be thanking her as i do warnin the older man scoffed about what about betty hillwood sir alan replied thats what i was a fool about i was visiting her to work off the humors of the blood ah mr beauman coughed i see you an at clicket eh like foxes sir alan admitted with a worldly smile better her than a publichouse whoreless chance of the pox there was a chance they would understand the beaumans were an earthy lot from what he had heard of them they could empathize being in the company of such a beautiful young lady as your lucy raised my humors to the boiling point and i thought it best to release that tension sirs and if my suit was to be a long oneand you note i use the past tense sirs since my foolish behavior has raised such a tempest i doubt you could entertain my hopes furtheri feared the frustration would cause me to do something untoward damme youre a bold un mr beauman gaped you sport with another woman to avoid rapin my daughter if your bloody humors get outa hand and i suppose you think we should be thankin ya it was the longest and most complete sentence mr beauman had ever uttered and it stopped alan cold in his tracks for a moment what man faced with a long courtship of a sweet and proper young lady could do otherwise sir and retain his sanity alan asked them in your own courting days mister beauman was there no release for you did not the long delay of hoped for satisfaction drive you to distraction well there was a tavern wenchr two the older man began to maunder father thats not the bloody point hes ruined annes good name and i want satisfaction hugh barked bringing them back to the meat of the matter but mrs hillwood is the point sir alan doggedly went on who do you think started the rumor in the first place her and her friend mrs howard sending their servants to peep and pry and report back with gossip to liven their lives or give them an advantage i met anne as i was leaving mrs hillwoods she would have warned me off with a letter but she took the risk to accost me then and there i rode in her carriage down to the dressmakers and went inside with her i stood by the door feeling like a damned fool to even be in the place not a word not a gesture of anything improper occurred sir we then went for something cool to drink to revive her as she was wilting in the heat and to find a place where she could impart her timely warning that i should best stop visiting the woman not only for the good of the beauman family name but for mine own to stress how important it was as she spoke of her fondness for lucy and the beauman family she touched my wrist once and as i poured out my own problem with mrs hillwood i admit to taking her hand and beseeching her what to do about the mess i had made that is all that passed between us master hugh i did not think that an establishment so seemingly refined as the frenchmans what you may call it a restaurant would be looked upon as a public place back in london it has become the custom that ladies may frequent eating establishments as long as they do not contain rooms to let all the quality do so and i didnt know it was any different here on jamaica when in doubt trot out the aristocracy as an example he told himself no one wants to appear out of the latest fashion you swear on your honor hugh beauman demanded unready to relent for a gentleman to say it is to swear to its truth sir alan shot back a little highhanded at the slight of his honor though he sometimes doubted if he truly had any to slight or get huffy about if you demand more then i swear on my honor as an english gentleman and as a commission sea officer that events happened as i said what problem with betty mrs hillwood sir the older man asked thank bloody christ for you alan though gratefully the lady became a bother mister beauman she took a greater fancy to me than i thought was good she gave me this chain and fob and promised more of the same if i became her kept man and topped her regular when i told her no she vowed to get even no matter who got hurt if not by this rumor she spread about me and anne then by another means a letter i was foolish enough to write her what sort o letter mr beauman asked fetching out a squat brandy decanter and beginning to pour himself a drink a rather risquй no i dont think risquй does it justice pornographic would be more like sir alan confessed putting on his best shameface and hoping they would eat this up like plum duff she dictated it i wrote it as a game you see between bouts ah in her bed sir aha with her belly for a writing desk sir alan finished with a shrug of the truly sheepishly guilty a gesture he had practically taken patent on in his school days gods teeth mr beauman sr exclaimed settling down into a chair with a look of perplexity creasing his heavy features with her belly on her belly sir well stap me dont see how it can be done damme if i can course i never tried writin down there its a rather firm belly sir alan commented aye thatd help i suppose the man nodded beginning to grin slightly at the mental picture father for gods sake hugh exploded whatever the reasons no matter how innocent they were people have taken a tarbrush to our familys good name and reputation our social standing start some gossip of your own sir alan suggested damn you sir hugh beauman snarled well decide whats best for this family not you youve done enough and i would be willing to do anything to assist you sir what sort o rumor the father asked slopping back a large swig of brandy and waving the bottle at them in invitation which alan agreed to readily he was dry as dust from nerves and three men drinking together and consorting on how to solve something were not three men who would be trying to stick sharp objects into each other it was mrs hillwoods pride and vanity that brought this about when i rejected her offer alan said taking a pew on the corner of a desk with glass in hand though hugh beauman was still averse to showing him any leniency she didnt want me paying any attention to lucy i think the woman was jealous of anyone younger or prettier not so much that she was truly in love with me but she disliked losing dye see and i dont think she cares much for the beauman family in general if you can believe the things she told me trying to destroy my respect for the lot of you terrible things best left unsaid like what sir hugh required speak out she called you ignorant chawbacons and countryharrys people with more money than style shed have me believe theres not a christian among you a one to be trusted she blackened every name in the family with some backstairs scandal you hugh anne ross husband even lucy she intimated all your morals were nonexistent goddamn the bitch the father roared she said all that not in one session sir but over the course of time the beauman men looked righteously outraged but a little queasy as well they knew their own sins well enough and knew that betty hillwood was probably privy to most of them show me claws would ya hedgewhore mr beauman ranted ill give ya claws right back blacken me children will ya ill hurt ya where it hurts the most by damn if i dont in her pride sir alan prompted feeling safe now from physical harm she wouldnt like people in her circle to know that she had a lover spurn her or that she had to buy his affections and then threaten so much to get him back no matter who got hurt it may not matter to anyone about mistress anneanyone would have done for her purpose to try and ruin me dye see clearing annes good name is only incidental too its not to me damn your blood hugh barked if the gossip sounds like an attempt to clear mistress anne it will fail sir alan told him familiar enough with what stuck in the mind in all the scandals he had chuckled over back in london it will ring false but if enough shit flies and sticks to betty hillwood anne becomes an innocent victim in contrast a month from now theyll still be chewing on la hillwoods bones and if they ever think of my part in the affair or mistress annes it will be favorable if the affair is handled properly of course aye t would kill her soul the crafty old witch beauman sr chortled with a cruel grin of anticipated pleasure at bettys demise in society why wed skin her alive my god youre too clever by half hugh marveled disgusted alan didnt know quite how to answer that so he kept silent for once people with brains were usually mistrusted when they showed off perhaps its best this happened after all if only to spare us a soninlaw so scheming father hugh added smiling slightly in some form of satisfaction that he wasnt going to be related to anyone as smarmy as alan lewrie you must know that you have totally ruined your hopes of eventual marriage with lucy no matter how this comes out i do realize that sir alan nodded suddenly sobered and i must say it is the greatest regret of my life and hopefully shall be from this moment on i truly love her you see the frank admission shut them all up for a long moment broken only by the sounds of brandy being slurped as they all looked away and communed with their own thoughts abashed by such a personal revelation usually left unspoken by english gentlemen who would be the last men on the face of the earth to confess their love for anything other than horses dogs or some institution larger than themselves if there is some way you could convey to lucy my regrets as to how this came about and how i feel about her alan whispered going for the brandy decanter unbidden and to mistress anne my regrets as well that she had to involve herself at such a risk and my undying thanks tell her would they relent he wondered with a final tug of hope was there some way he could still see lucy in future once this was all blown over he had spoken the truth mostly and he had couched events in such a way that he did not appear a total rakehell a young and foolish buck but not a complete wastrel aye ill tell her mr beauman intoned sadly twasnt all your fault though ya did show bad judgement like hugh says fer the best mayhap few years from now who knows good lesson fer ya what aye sir alan replied with a sad shudder of his own well id best be going then father hugh said as alan finished his drink and picked up his hat from a side table if we mean to save our good name we cannot send mr lewrie away in shame hey at least escort him to the docks make a show of being fond of him a public show otherwise it still looks like we have a reason to duel him or whip him hugh went on distaste curling his mouth at his own words not that hes welcome here in future but best for anne aye best for us mr beauman concurred they rode in an open carriage to outward appearances a dumb show of three gentlemen of like minds cracking japes and laughing together in public before the startled eyes of the quality who had business about the town they dined at the frenchmans shared some wine and saw alan into a boat out to his ship waving goodbye chearly with bonhomie plastered on their phyzes like a painted chorus seeing off a hero in some drama but it was very final sort of goodbye alan gained the deck took his salute and went aft where the captain was lazing about under the quarterdeck awnings slung in a net hammock of island manufacture with one of the halfgrown kittens in his lap come aboard to join have you mister lewrie lilycrop asked with a droll expression as he walked up and saluted him sir weve seen so little of you lilycrop teased as he dandled a blackandwhite tomkitten wasnt sure if youd jumped ship or been transferred sorry sir but there were some personal problems ashore woman trouble i heard finished is it finished sir yes woman trouble a devilish power of em a dayr two of pushin does for most of us you know lilycrop smirked no need to make a meal of the doxies saves you from angry daddies an husbands too aye sir i shall remember that from now on god knows theyre mostly only good for one thing an you may rent that lilycrop went on give em guineas enough an theyll be fond of you for as long as you want then take your leave before they turn boresome theyve no conversation worth mentionin so why go all cuntstruck by some mort wholl most like put horns on you the minute youre out of sight surely not all women sir alan sighed about as deep into the blue devils as a young man could be over a girl aye there may be a gem somewhere but the likes of me never could afford em or run in the right circles to find em no loss at this stage of the game so youre back with us for a while the delights of kingston have lost their luster i take it aye sir i could use a few months at sea god help me i never thought id say this but is there any way we could sail sir i stay out of trouble at sea mostly alan groaned with a heartfelt ache of desire to escape into duty to lose his crushed hopes in a long spell of seamanship and possible action well top up your wine cellars mister lewrie lilycrop said with a bright smile rolling out of his hammock and handing lewrie the kitten as he adjusted his uniform admiral sir bloody joshua rowley remembered were in his bloody squadron after all had you been around and had an ear cocked like a real first officer youdve heard of it before we have orders to head for cuba to harry coastal shippin let us go aft and ill show you the orders then you can indulge another form of lust on our good kings enemies thank bloody christ sir dont forget to have the purser obtain a barrel of dried meat for the kitties and youll not forget the beach sand hey aye aye sir iii chapter dicantur mea rura ferum mare nauta caveto rura quibus diras indiximus impia vota let my lands be called the savage sea beware o sailor of lands whereon we have pronounced our curses unholy prayers dirae virgil chapter they spotted her at first light rounding cabo cruz a fine ketch of what looked to be about eighty tons burthen lilycrop thought she was on passage from santiago de cuba to cienfuegos and had taken the pass outside the chain of islets and reefs of the gulf of guacanayabo a safer voyage most of the time but for this instance she was a little ahead of them too far out to sea to scurry inshore for safety a little too far west to turn back for santiago de cuba and with shrikes shallow draft even shoal water would offer no safety from them hands to the braces mister lewrie lilycrop snapped give us a point closer to the wind and well headreach the bitch aye aye sir hands to the braces ready to haul taut grunting and straining near to rupturing themselves the hands flung themselves on the braces to angle the yards of the squaresails the set of the foreandaft staysls jibs and spanker to work the ship as close to the wind as she would bear to race as close inshore of the enemy vessel as they could denying her the chance to round up or tack once north of cabo cruz to shelter helm down a point quartermaster lilycrop demanded mister caldwell what say your charts deep water all the way sir caldwell finally announced just before lilycrop turned on him with this wind outa the eastnoreast neither us or herll make it into shoal water unless she tacks sir alan cautioned and if the bitch tacks well be gunnel to gunnel with her before she can say madre de dios the captain laughed shrike was indeed the butcher bird rapaciously hungry and her prey displayed on thorns was spanish coastal shipping there were so many ships so little time and lilycrop seemed determined to make the most of any opportunity very unlike the first image alan had formed of him and his ambitions now the ships log read like an adventure novel of ships pursued ships taken as prize or ships burned to the waterline to deny the enemy their use admittedly the number burned greatly exceeded the number sent off in the general direction of jamaica but that was not their fault the roads inland on cuba on the west coast of spanish florida were abysmal and everything went by sea mostly in small locally built luggers cutters ketches and schooners with only a rare brig snow or hermaphrodite brig making an appearance alan had expected a cruise with little excitement but one lovely sunset evening they had come across a merchant schooner off cayo blancos on the north coast a small ship headed for havana and lilycrop had run her down before full dark she hadnt been much but the captain had acted as if she were an annual treasure galleon and the ease of the capture had fired his thirst for more if his orders were to harry coastal shipping then harry them lilycrop would but suddenly following orders could be profitable there were no despatches to run no schedule to keep and lilycrop slowly had discovered the joys of an independent roving commission for the first time in his long career of being held in check as a junior officer in their first cruise of four months extending their time at sea by living off their prizes supplies they had taken four decent ships and burned nearly a score more small traders fishing boats anything afloat no matter how lowly had fallen victim to their guns and the crews allowed to row ashore as their livelihoods burned like signal fusees like alans first piratical cruise aboard desperate the only limiting factor was warm bodies to work the ship once enough men were told off as prize crews and sent away shrike had to return to port it had happened once before and now only two months into their second cruise it was about to happen again if the ketch proved worthwhile alan already had a revised watch and quarter bill in his coat pocket for just this eventuality and his only concern at the moment was just how many extra hands the ketch would take from him hes crackin on more sail damn his blood lilycrop noted dont think itll do him much good sir alan commented eyeing the enemy through his new telescope hes hoisting his staysls thatll push him down off the wind more than if hed stayed with the forenaft sails and push his bows down maybe a foot thatll slow him down minutes passed as the spanish ketch now trying to emulate some sort of squarerigger held her slight advantage though shrike was making better way to windward were makin too much heel sir lilycrop spat impatient to be upon their prize not good with a flat run keel run out the starboard battery sir alan suggested immediately and id take a reef in our main topsl were canceling out the lift on the bows from the fore course and topsl make it so mister lewrie lilycrop nodded in agreement bosun and mast captain lay up and trice out first reef in the main topsl mister cox run out the starboard battery alan roared through his brass speaking trumpet and he could not help feeling pleased with himself when they anchored at kingston the first time in early may he was still uncomfortable and daunted by his lack of experience but now by middecember such decisions had begun to come naturally to him based on a growing wealth of knowledge about seamanship and how shrike reacted in particular lilycrop occasionally pinned his ears back for overreaching to keep him humble to remind him he did not yet know it all but those admonitions were rarer once adjusted properly shrike settled down on her keel a few more degrees and made the most of her longer hull form the spanish ketch grew in size bringing all her hull up over the horizon as the gulf of guacanayabo opened out before them try as she might she did not have the sail power or the length of hull to make enough speed to escape ahoy the deck thar came a call from the lookout aloft sail three points off the starboard bow rossyngton get aloft and spy him out alan barked and the well turned out midshipman paused for a moment as he considered how dirty his white waistcoat slop trousers and shirt were going to get from the tar and slush of the standing rigging today goddamn you lilycrop howled rossyngton was off like a shot pausing only long enough to take a telescope with him as he scampered up the shrouds to the top and almost shinnied up to the crosstrees guarda costa sloop sir rossyngton finally shouted down onemaster must have been on patrol out of manzanillo sir alan said hanging from the shrouds himself for a better view with his heavy glass he could see a small ship as rossyngton described a singlemasted sloop or cutter with a large foreandaft gaffrigged sail and one squarerigged topsl above that and a long jibboom and bowsprit that anchored three huge jibs even in the protected bay she was hard at work off the wind pitching noticeably fifty sixty foot or so lilycrop speculated leaning on the starboard quarterdeck bulwarks by lewries feet with his own telescope maybe two heavy guns forrud nine or twelvepounders and little fourpounder trash abeam thats why shes pitchin like that shell interpose our course sir to save that ketch damned if she will lilycrop chuckled mister lewrie beat to quarters well take her on first then have our prize shrike did not run to a richer captains private band replete with fifes and drums her single young black drummer rattled his sticks first in a long roll then broke into a jerky cadenced beating of his own invention that sounded like a west indies religious rite or revel shell try to fight us like a galley mister lewrie lilycrop informed him once the ship was rigged for battle with all unnecessary items stowed below and his precious cats ensconced with gooch in the bread rooms keep her bows aimed at us to let her heavier bow guns bear we could fall off the wind sir alan suggested scanning the tactical setup and trying to solve the puzzle of three ships each on its own separate course and proceeding at different speeds weve room enough to windward of the chase now no shed still get within range or chase after us and damme if i want my stern shot out lilycrop replied stand on as we are and give her broadsides close aboard mister cox ill want three shots every two minutes at your hottest practice doubleshotted mind aye aye sir on this course the chasell get inshore near santa cruz del sur captain caldwell told them waving a folded up chart at them theres a battery there im told about forty miles before wed be in their range though sir the bitchll never make it lilycrop said confidently and before a halfhour glass could be turned the spanish guarda costa sloop was within range of random shot and her heavy bow chasers barked together one shot moaned overhead and forward of the bows to raise a large feather of spray to leeward the other ball smacked into the sea abeam of shrike but about a quartercable short and skipped once but did not reach her hell go about now or well leave him behind lilycrop said shrike was racing nornorwest with the sloop to her right side about a mile east of her and about half a mile ahead bound on a course roughly westsouwest she did not have the speed to pass in front to rake shrike so she would have to turn soon on a parallel course and bring her guns to action down her larboard side shes leaving it a bit late if she is alan observed as more minutes passed the sloops heavy focsle guns spoke again this time raising splashes much closer though once more without harm her bows were pitching too much for proper aim even as the range shortened it was a beautiful day for it alan noted with pleasure unable to believe that the small sloop could be much of a menace the sea was sparkling blue and green azure near the eastern shore and the hills around the small port of niquero and the mountains of the sierra maestras were a vivid luscious green after the last heavy rains of the hurricane season sweeping fluffy trails of cloud above them in a perfect blue sky there lilycrop pointed as the sloop finally foreshortened in a turn as she came almost abeam of shrikes jib boom not half a mile away now mister cox skin the bitch aye aye sir cox agreed joyfully as you bear fire the small fourpounder chase gun yapped like a terrier then the more substantial explosions of the sixpounders of the starboard battery pounded out caught in the act of wearing ship controlling that huge foreandaft mainsl and those oversized jibs the broadside shook her like a sharks first bite as ball after ball hammered into her the sloop seemed to tremble then swung about quickly almost pivoting on her bows as her mast the topsl yard and the mainsl gaff came down in a cloud of wreckage and the uncontrolled jibs billowed out to drag her bows back downwind for a second she had heeled like a capsize thats one way to gybe a ship caldwell exulted bit rough on the inventory though lilycrop chuckled in appreciation well done mister cox hit her again they passed her at long musketshot about one hundred yards as the sloop was tugged down to them bows on and iron roundshot tore her to lace flinging light scantlings into the air in a cloud ripping her bow and focsle open luff up and hit her one last time sir alan asked excited at how much damage they were doing shes a dead un lilycrop scowled lets get on to our prize if weve a mind we might come back for her later shes not goin anywhere but downwind and out to sea away from rescue mister cox stand easy bout another hour to catch yon ketch mister caldwell lilycrop surmised with a practiced eye hour and a bit sir caldwell agreed secure from quarters issue the rum and a cold dinner they did catch the ketch nearly one hour later prowling up to her starboard side with the advantage of the windgauge one ball from the larboard battery settled the matter splashing close abeam to ricochet into her upperworks and shatter a bulwark raising a concerted howl of terror the ketch lowered her colors and rounded up into the wind quickly while the howling continued jesus whats all that noise alan wondered aloud as one of the boats was led around from being towed astern to the entry port i suspect yon dago is a slaver mister lewrie lilycrop said sadly were upwind where we cant smell her but keep a tight hold on your dinner once you get inboard now away the boardin party before they change their feeble minds the winds were freshening and the sea heaved a little more briskly as alan sat down on a thwart in the cutter the captains coxn got the boats crew working at the oars and within moments they were butting against the side of the ketch and alan was scrambling up the mizzen chains to swing over the low rail glad to have pulled it off without getting soaked or drowned jesus he gagged once he was firmly on his feet and the men from the boarding party were following him up onto the ketchs decks it stank like an abattoir brassy with corruption almost sweet like decomposing manflesh mingled with the odor of excrement and stale sweat of foul bilges and rot most ships smelled to a certain extent but he had never aboard a prize or a wellfound royal navy ship even after a desperate battle smelled the like and his stomach roiled in protest an officer walked up to him a sullen brute in rumpled and soiled breeches and shirt legs exposed by lack of shoes or stockings he began to rattle off a rapid burst of spanish which was definitely one of the worlds languages that alan lacked and alan waved him off trying to shut him up you the captain he asked when the man took a breath capitano si the man swept off a battered cocked hat small enough to fit a child dripping though it was with gold lace and feathers and introduced himself with a deep congй capitano manuel antonio lopez capitano de las nuestra seсora de compostela lewrie alan said bluffly as an englishman should shrike he added pointing back toward his ship royal navy your sword sir all the man had to offer was a cutlass stuck into a sash which alan passed on to his man cony there was one passenger a man of much more worth by his clothing he was tall and slim partly indian in his features but adorned with a stiff waxed mustache he too offered his sword this one a slim smallsword awash in pearls and silver wire damascened with gold around the hilt and guard he was elegant a dandyprat in the height of spanish fashion seсor i must talk to your captain he began in passable english it shall be of great value to him and what brings you aboard this voyage sir alan asked fanning his face to push away the stinks she carries my cargo senor slaves si seсor fifty prime blacks bought in santo domingo alan took a look about the deck the ketch and he could not even begin to remember her name much less pronounce it would have been a wellfound vessel if she received a thorough cleaning the rigging was thin as a pursers charity but that could be set right there were only four carriage guns bronze or brass threepoundersno value there most of her armament he noted with surprise consisted of swivels and bellmouthed fowling pieces aimed down at her hatches and waist evidently to control the slaves should they get loose i must speak to your captain sir you are lewrie lieutenant allow me to introduce myself senor i am don alonzo victorio garcia de zaza y turbide the man rushed through a formal introduction i assure you teniente it shall be most pleasing to your captain if i am allowed to speak to him pleasing how alan asked getting rapidly fed up with the overelegant posturing of this stiffnecked hidalgo to his profit senor the man beamed back with a sly smile i think a wellfound ketch and fifty prime blacks for resale in kingston is profit enough dont you alan smirked i do not care about the blacks seсior the world is full of slaves don miguel sneered nor do i much care about this little ship but if i go to kingston then i am prisoner si and there is no profit for me in that i ask as a gentleman as a knight of spain to be set ashore i can pay well seсior in gold he added by all means don thingummy talk to my captain im sure hell simply adore talking to you alan laughed cony alan sent the aristocrat the ships captain and her small crew over to shrike for safekeeping while he and the rest of the boarding party sorted the freed lines out and got a way on the ketch headed out to sea with shrike following in her wake he had half a dozen hands half a dozen marines and a bosuns mate plus his man cony to keep order aboard once he got his people apportioned at duty stations he led the rest to search the ship godamercy sir cony gasped as they opened the hatch gratings crammed in between bales and crates of cargo were fifty slaves naked as the day they were born chained together with ankle shackles into two rows on either side of the hold their wrists also bound by cuffs and lighter chain they were squatting or lying in their own filth that did not drain off into the bilges they glared up at him angrily some begging for water with cupping motions by their mouths some rubbing their bellies for food and miming the motions of eating godamercy sir cony said again hits devilish the way them dagoes treat people we oughter feed em sir give em water an some air taint christian ta do otherwise sir well they dont look exactly glad to see us cony course they aint sir cony burst out i spect they thinks were dagoes too mister lewrie corporal sir fetch em up one coffle at a time use those swivels and such if they get out of hand cony break out a butt of water and see if theres some food about alan relented the slaves were fresh from dahomey or some other port on the ivory coast for they cringed away from their liberators just as they had from their captors they drank the water ate the cold mush and stale bread as if it was manna from heaven but stayed in a tight clutch of flesh away from the muskets of the marines and sailors who kept an eye on them easy bantering from sympathetic english humors did nothing to reassure them even if they could have understood the words murray take charge of the deck alan told the bosuns mate and went below to search the captains quarters and those of the distinguished passenger who was by now getting his ears roasted by lieutenant lilycrop for trying to bribe a royal navy officer he gathered up all the papers he could find not able to read a word of them hoping lilycrop or one of the warrants had some spanish for later scanning the captains quarters were spartan in the extreme not from the usual sailors suspicion of anyone given to too many airs and comforts as was rife in the royal navy but from poverty he assumed even the captains wine cabinet could offer nothing better than a locally grown wine of dubious palate and some fearsome rum after one sip he spat the mouthful on the canvas covered deck and put the bottle back in the rack don thingummys cabins though were a different matter some attempt had been made to pack away valuables for all the chests and trunks had been locked and alan was just about to search for a lever with which to pry the first of the locks and hasps off when the sound of gunfire erupted from the deck forcing him to sprint back topsides what the hell happened he demanded sword in hand thisun went fort corprls musket sir murray panted from excitement or sudden exertion they wuz beginnin t smilen all sir an then when we wuz gonna put em below once agin thisn jumped us one of the slaves lay stretched out and dead on the planks bleeding like a spilled wine keg another keened and rocked with agony after being shot in the shoulder the others tried to draw back from the casualties to the full extent of their leg chains christ what a muckup alan sighed sheathing his sword pop him over the side then corporal can you get the shackles undone and see if anything can be done for the one wounded aye aye sir i saw some keys in the captains quarters try there and i also saw some rum he might feel like a drop fetch that too cony knelt down next to the wounded slave and tried to staunch the flow of blood from the purpleplum entry wound which was not bleeding all that badly he gently pushed him down and rolled him a little so he could see the back where the ball had exited high up shot clean through sir cony said with a grin no ball in im ta fester theres a blessin easy now bucko lay easy rums acomin cure for damn near everthin youll be alright the corporal came back with a huge ring of keys and fiddled at the shackles until he found one that unlocked the dead man from the coffle he then knelt at the feet of the wounded slave and undid his ankle shackles stap me sir cony wailed in disappointment es dead dead of that alan asked bewildered as the next man guns is magic sir murray the bosuns mate said softly ifn e wuz island born an used ta usn ed a lived but direck from is tribe not three month ifn yer shot yer killed so e believed e wuz dead an thats that jesus they believe that aye sir ask andrews sir e were a slavey murray insisted andrews was one of their west indian hands signed aboard as a volunteer an almost whiteskinned negro like one of hugh beaumans favored bedpartners alan turned to look at him and andrews shrank away after glaring at murray with alarm alan thought there was more to his sudden fear so he crossed the deck to stand beside him and speak softly is it true they die so easily andrews aye sah dey blieve a witch can put a curse on em an dey lays down an dies of it first dey see o white men dey learn about guns sometimes dey die o just bein shot at sah just feel da bullet go pas an lay down an die andrews informed him poor bastard aye sah poor bastard all of em you were a slave no sah mista murray got it wrong sah ah werent no slave youre a freeborn volunteer but you must have talked with slaves to know what you know alan pointed out freeborn volunteer sah andrews insisted but not a sailor eh before i worked wit my father sah fishin sometimes were you indeed alan thought skeptical of andrews claims the man had written his name instead of making his mark when he signed aboard alan had offered the book to him himself if he was not a runaway servant then alan was a turk in a turban he was a well setup young fellow near an inch taller than alans five feet nine his skin the color of creamed coffee and his eyes clear instead of clouded a former houseservant run off for his own reasons alan wondered whatever his background was he wanted to keep it quiet well youre the navys now andrews whether you were a prince of dahomey or a runaway slave alan said softly so the others would not hear and andrews eyes pinched a bit at the last dont worry over it prime hands are hard enough to findwell not be letting you go so easily aye sir andrews replied letting out a pentup breath and relaxing a little mister murray aye sir andrews tells me he may be able to calm the slaves down a bit place him and cony in charge of tending to them if you please aye sir andrews gave him a short grin as he went below to talk some gibberish language to the slaves to calm their fears between him and cony whose simple farmraised gentleness and caring were already evident alan was sure that he had made the right decision mister murray sir the bosuns mate said coming to his side near the tiller how did you know about what black slaves believe alan began its so incredible to me that people should die simply because they were shot at he was barely hurt that ball went in clean maybe broke a bone and exited high at the top of the shoulder served in the indies a lot sir murray told him seen lots o slaves turn up their toes fer a lot less sir i am grateful for your knowledge mister murray never hurts to pick up a little lore from here and there does it alan cajoled nossir hit sure dont an thankee fer sayin so sir murray almost preened at having gained favorable comment from his first officer well with cony and andrews tending to them theyll go quiet from now on oh about andrews do you know if he was a former slave well nossir but hits been my experience at mosta the west indian ands is sir murray said with a wink at the ageold practice good sailor is he nary a topman sir but ell do fer most duties an good in a fight wif a cutlass sir then we wouldnt want to get him into trouble by announcing hes a former slave people might think hes a runaway whether he is or not and he might be tempted to run and with nigh on a third of the hands west indians it might stir up resentments alan suggested aye sir least said soonest mended thank you mister murray thatll do i think shrike put back in to kingston a few days later preceded by her prizes the trading ketch nuestra seсora de compostela and the guarda costa sloop san ildefonso which they had run across on their way seaward from the coast of cuba she had barely been repaired enough to hoist a jurymast with her main boom serving as a vertical spar and a tattered topsl employed as a lugsail she had fallen without a shot being fired all resistance blown out of her earlier in the day it made a proud sight the small convoy of three ships rounding morant point threading the port royal passage past the forts on the palisades and into the harbor with the ensign flying over the white and gold flags of spain as soon as all three ships had dropped anchor and begun to brail up their sails lieutenant lilycrop took a boat over to the flagship strutting like a peacock at his success alan was left to deal with the officials from the prize court and the dockyard superintendent about repairs the slaves from the trading ketch were removed to be auctioned off at some time in the future and they would fetch a good price since the island of jamaica was badly in need of prime slaves to support a wartime economy and the supply from africa had been cut to a trickle by spanish and french privateers after the recent slave revolt unaffected slaves were doubly welcome admittedly alan suffered some qualms at seeing them led off still in their original chains he had not known any slaves in his former life in londonthere they were more of a novelty or an affectation of the very rich employed as houseservants and bodyservants with the mannerisms and voices of failed etonians who had to work to keep body and soul together there were a few slaves in the carolinas he had met the hayley sisters maid sookie who had nearly been the death of him after he and the chiswick brothers had escaped yorktown caroline chiswicks mammy who was cook nurse housekeeper and more a family friend than a slave and the west indian hands and ships boys who were mostly goodnatured cheeky runts or diligent workers as good as any volunteer signed aboard back in england taint right sir cony commented once more coming to the rail by his side as the huge harbor barge bearing the slaves got underway from shrikes gunwales ironically being rowed by hired freeborn blacks no its not right poor bastards alan agreed in a mutter they get took from their omes back in africa clapped inta irons an shipped cross the seas an them that live gets sold like dray orses cony lamented worked ta death sir whipped ta death and not a christian and raised for em and we capture them from the dagoes so we can sell them for a good knockdown price alan went on by damn i love prizemoney good as the next man but i dont know as how ill feel right taking money for them the ketch yes and all her fittings and cargo but not them thats the truth it is sir an youre a fine christian for asayin it sir cony spat i been talkin ta andrews sir an e says nigh on two hundred men and womenre crammed in front ta back an kept below for months on the middle passage tis a good voyage iff en only a quarter of em die an contrary windsll end up akillin alf youd think with all the talents mankind has at his disposal thered be someone working on a machine to harvest sugar cane instead of causing so much misery as if life isnt misery enough already god wouldnt that be grand sir cony beamed an ill lay ya odds itll be an englishman what does invent it sir britonsll never be no mans slave so why elp make other people ourn in the months during the siege of yorktown in their escape and ever since cony had become first his hammockman in the midshipmens mess and later his personal servant it was only natural that alan would become familiar with the young man it was no longer an officercommon seaman relationship nor was it strictly an employerservant relationship either cony had little education no philosophical practice but a strong sense of justice and decency and had learned that in most instances lewrie was willing to give his opinions a fair hearing which had encouraged the lad to speak out when he felt something strongly enough perhaps it was because they had shared misery together or the familiarity had come from alan having so few people he could relate to on a professional basis his circle was limited to the captain and the other officers in the wardroom and he had to be standoffish with those or suffer a loss of respect decorum demanded he stay aloof and it was only with lilycrop that he could let down his hair him and cony though he had yet to ask cony for an opinion or advicethat would be going too far he thought one could be seen warts and all by a servant of long standing which was probably why people changed them so often he thought but an english gentleman was drilled from the cradle to not get too close to the help and never allow his dignity to slip before the servants a few warts were allowed then but if cony really knew him for the rakehell he was he was sure cony would lose his awe of him in short order what else did andrews say alan asked still intrigued by the man well sir e said back on the plantations they beat em for almost anythin cony went on now that he was bid to speak further rice an beans some truck they grow in their own time maybe an now an agin some saltmeat most likely condemned naval stores that alan stuck in aye sir an new clothes but once a year after everthin elses rotted off em cony sighed treat em like beasts sir an th way they abuse the women sir is somethin shameful ya know sir i can expect the practice o the frogs an dagoes theys just cruel ta the bone with orses an dogs an people but sometime tis ard ta see britons adoin it here in the islands or in the colonies remember them escaped slaves what elped us build an man the battery at yorktown like whipped puppies they were sir grateful for what little we could share with em come away ta us ta escape their masters poor old things wonder what the rebels did with em after cornwallis surrendered same as today most like alan scowled them they didnt flog or hang for an example same they do with a runaway apprentice hey thats differnt sir cony insisted a prentice made is own choice o master made is contrack an give is bondword nobody asked those poor buggers an a arsh master deserves his prentices runnin longs they dont steal nothin when they go damme cony you sound like one of those leveling rebels nossir cony defended himself they wanta give everbody the unlettered an the poor the franchise dont they an fer all their ightone talk o freedom they still keep slaves ta toil for em sir seems ta me iffen they mean all that guff an dont do away with slavery they wont ave much of a country they may o been english once sir but livin so wild an rough musta addled em an i couldnt old with em now well it didnt affect the chiswicks alan said theyre still our sort oh aye them chiswick lads ad their earts in the right place fer king george an all sir even if they were so fearsome and youll pardon me fer sayin so sir but young mistress chiswick was fair took with you sir she was a real lady cony blushed at his own daring and certain people of my acquaintance arent alan frowned not my place ta say sir beg pardon meant no disrespeck the hell you didnt you slyboots alan laughed even if his servant had come too close for comfort off with you now and keep an eye on andrews for me will you aye sir that i will es a pretty good feller an e was grateful ya didnt pay eed ta what mister murray said about im sir so you think he ran from some slaver too cony aye sir i thinks e did cony almost whispered not from the fields mebbe a ouse servantr such ya know sir e can read and write now aint that a wonder e never goes ashore cept hits a workin party maybe es afeard o bein took back well hell not be you can tell him that for me alan vowed aye sir cony replied looking mightily pleased once the main bustle was over and the shore authorities took charge of their prizes shrike stayed at her anchor stowing fresh provisions with lewrie keeping a wary weather eye cocked on henry biggs the purser for any peculiarities in goods or bookkeeping lilycrop strutted about pleased as punch with himself for taking so many prizes and burning so many more their captured don thingummy had related that shrike was becoming feared from one end of the coast of cuba to the other and adml sir joshua rowley who took an eighth share of any prize his squadron captured had made a pretty penny from lilycrops newfound zeal so he was most pleased with his junior officer which meant that lilycrop was pleased with the world and with his first lieutenant alan however did not know just how far that pleasure extended until one afternoon after shrike had completed provisioning and placed the ship out of discipline so the whores and wives could come aboard alan had been primping for a run ashore even if he was persona non grata with the beaumans and mrs hillwood who was reported to have gone inland to her husbands plantations to ride out the scandal that had redounded to her total discredit in society there had to be a company of willing mutton ashore to choose from passin the word fer the first ltent came a call from the upper deck and alan uttered a soft curse at the interruption of his planned pleasures he tossed his freshwashed sheepgut condom back into his sea chest and slammed the lid in frustration damme its been two months he sulked on his way topside capn warnts ya aft sir the messenger told him thank you alan shrugged he was turned out in his best uniform and was grateful for the awnings rigged over the quarterdeck so he would not sweat his best clothes clammy but it would be hot and close in lilycrops great cabin you wished to see me sir alan asked once he had been admitted yes mister lewrie sit ye down you know where the wine is by now fetch yourself a glass alan poured himself some hock which gooch had been cooling in the bilges shoved a cat out of his usual chair and glared at the rest as if daring them to climb up on him and leave a quarterpound of hair on his fresh breeches you had plans to go ashore this evenin i see lilycrop said noting how well he was turned out aye i did sir but if theres any service i may do you oh god but you look such a choirboy when you do that lilycrop chuckled youd rather be stuffed into some willin wench than do me a service an well you know it more to the point so do i by now aye sir alan admitted allowing himself a small smile cant say as you didnt earn your fun mister lewrie the captain went on leaning back in his chair with both feet on his desk and a cat crouching on either leg fact is though you may have to delay any hopes of fuckin yourself halfblind at least for this night ive been bade dine aboard the flag along with my first officer with admiral rowley sir alan asked perking up at the news one may assume so seems weve been active little bodies all but winnin the war singlehanded or such lilycrop hooted in glee and it dont hurt our cause weve lined the admirals purse with prizemoney neither six month ago he didnt know who the bloody hell we were and i expect hed like to show a little appreciation to us now you can pass up a crack at the whores for a night for that cant you lewrie oh aye sir alan preened excited at being known personally to the flag lead me to it and im told he sets a good table too you have my word on that lilycrop replied for he had dined aboard the flag once before fine things can happen yet even if this war of ours seems to be peterin out time enough for a lieutenant master and commander to be made post perhaps sir alan hinted ill not hold my breath on that mind lilycrop shrugged but alan knew the hope was there nevertheless just wanted to catch you before you went ashore have my gig ready at seven bells of the firstdog and since youre dressed to kill already ill not have to tell you to do so thatll be all mister lewrie aye sir chapter chapter amazing how quiet we are alan thought to himself as he sipped his soup in the admirals cabins aboard the flagship it was a small supper party and not one prone to much conversation lieutenant lilycrop was head down and almost grim with determination not to make an ass of himself and as long as he was silent his first lieutenant should keep his own mouth shut if he knew what was good for him adml sir joshua rowley presided at the head of the table a man of some girth and seniority next to him on his right was a lieutenant colonel peacock commanding one of the regiments that garrisoned the island of jamaica resplendent in polished metal gorget scarlet waist sash and red regimentals to the admirals left sat a civilian in a bottlegreen silk suiting a mr cowell the next pair of diners were on the right a captain eccles of lieutenant colonel peacocks regiment at least to lewries eyes their regimental buttonhole trim matched across the table from eccles was another civilian named to them as a mr mcgilliveray a young man in his midtwenties or so from the poor quality of his snuffcolored suiting of dittomatching coat waistcoat and breechesalan assumed that he was cowells secretary or something menial then came lewrie on the admirals left and lieutenant lilycrop across from him on the right there had been a place laid for the admirals flagcaptain at the foot of the table but he had not been able to attend at the last moment there had been some conversation of the dullest and blandest sort when they arrived and the admiral traded gossip at the head of the table with his more distinguished guests which did not extend to the people below the salt from cowells comments alan gathered that he was not long from london turning to mcgilliveray his dining companion on his right alan said i take it youre out from home recently not in about a year sorry the man replied with almost a guttural slurring of his words which led alan to wonder if he was drunk as a lord already ah im from london you see alan went on thought you might know something entertaining about things there oh london mcgilliveray brightened slightly but only slightly yes six months ago about the same sort of thing as usual crowded prices too high much too noisy my dear fellow thats exactly what i like about london alan said with a small laugh no i meant some new scandal or something i dont follow society mcgilliveray sniffed prim as any scottish deacon which put paid to any more hopes of conversation from that source damned odd sort alan thought trying to find a niche for the man in his mind he was dressed almost poor and had an excruciatingly bad tailor but carried himself without deference to cowell with a name like mcgilliveray alan expected him to be a scot but if he was he was a scotdago for the man was almost coppery red in complexion with the blackest hair alan ever did see parted in the center and drawn back into a long almost seamanly queue that reached down to the middle of his back his face was broad and his nose was hooked as a hawk broad as it was to match those high cheekbones alan turned away as the soup was removed and a smoking joint of mutton made its appearance on the table liveried servants passed behind the diners with small boiled potatoes and peas lilycrop rose and hacked at the joint to carve the diners their choice as a meal alan could not fault it the mutton was followed by boiled lobsters and freshdredged crabs with the bordeaux replaced with bottles of cooled hock before the hock was removed it went well with the small game birds and claret replaced the hock to be served with the roast beef without which an english meal would not be complete to sweeten the palate slices of tropical fruit were served then the cheese and biscuit the water glasses were removed and servants topped up their glasses with claret admiral rowley cocked a weather eye at lewrie as the most junior officer at table alan knew his duty he rose to his feet and raised his glass my lord gentlemen the king he said as they rose the king they chorused lieutenant colonel peacock almost smashing his skull open on an overhead deck beam and whispering god bless him obviously peacock was from one of those regiments that were allowed that nicety by their sovereign in times past they sat back down and the tablecloth was whisked away and the last of the claret drunk while the port was set out for them along with a large silver bowl of nuts to join the cheese and biscuit should nature have her way with your digestion i urge you to attend to your needs now gentlemen so we shall have no interruptions admiral rowley said more in the way of an order it took about ten minutes before everyone had voided whatever irked them and were back at table rowley sent the servants away rather pointedly gentlemen i trust you have enjoyed what bounty i was able to offer rowley began once their odd assemblage were the only people in the huge dining alcove of the great cabins now let us turn our heads to business lieutenant lilycrop lewrie mister cowell is a representative of his majestys government sorry you were kept in the dark and the dinner conversation did not sparkle but certain precautions had to be taken so that word of our meeting did not get round to the wrong people mister cowell sir if you would be so kind as to explain your purpose cowell was one of those people who thought better on his feet or felt he had to pace when he orated like a member of parliament gentlemen i am sure you are aware as i this war is lost he began rather dramatically not the one against our classic enemies the french spanish or dutch but the war in the colonies our last armies gone except for the new york and charleston garrisons lord shelbume in charge now that lord rockingham has died and our ambassadors treating at versailles the official end could come soon perhaps on the next packet from england just what i needed alan thought glumly wondering if he could crack a nut to snack on during cowells harangue a bloody sermon he settled for a sip of port this is not to say that england shall curl up like a worm in hot ashes and shrivel away sirs cowell said giving them a slight grin of encouragement to which everyone grunted their here heres much like a backbencher vicar of bray in the commons reports from india suggest we hold the upper hand against the french fleet at long last have subdued the rebellious sultans and look to evict the french from pondichery once and for all cowell went on should never have given it back after the last war lilycrop growled slicing himself a morsel of a rather fresh stilton i quite agree lieutenant cowell said looking anything but pleased to be interrupted and here in the west indies the sugar islands are safe since de grasses fleet has been scattered we hold the old french canadian colonies and the maritime approaches to the americas st kitts shall come back at the treaty table i assure you no the governments biggest worry right now is what the rebels mean to do with their new lands and how france or spain may profit thereby the frogs might try buying territory you mean alan said almost without thinking or more like thinking aloud cowell swiveled a glance in his direction obviously unused to being interrupted so often by people below his station in life and alan was glad he had spoken we took a french ship last year loaded with artillery and draft horses and whatnot she also carried more than seventy thousand pounds to be used for bribes or gifts to influential members of the rebels congress or whatever they call it alan went on i refer more to awards of territory to recompense the french and spanish for their assistance and material support sir cowell huffed and the others looked at alan as though he had broken wind at tablesuch was simply not done lieutenant colonel peacock glared as though alan were one of his junior officers hed be in irons that instant we shall not give them one acre sir but what the rebels may do is open to question and a formal military expedition to express our displeasure at any reward of territory is simply not in the cards what we may do informally though is another matter entirely cowell said with a sly grin and there are methods by which the french and spanish who are already out untold riches and in financial difficulty by their support of this unlawful rebellion may be discomfited and confounded in those territories they already possess souring their appetites for more cowell turned to stare at alan expecting him to open his mug and make some comment but alan had learned his lesson and gave him a beatific smile of encouragement one of his best eagerbutinnocent expressions which made lilycrop cough into his fist to hide a smile pipes gentlemen admiral rowley offered obviously fidgeting for the soothing fumes of tobacco he rose and fetched out his own tub of tobacco a largemouthed stone crock aromatic with virginia leaf and then chose a clay churchwarden pipe from the ample selection contained in a plushlined box large enough for a brace of dueling pistols not for me thankee milord alan said to his offer best to learn how mcgilliveray told him it shall come in handy soon well if you insist alan shrugged and took one of the pipes as the crock made its way down the table along with the port he stuffed crumbled leaf into the bowl got a light with a paper spill from an overhead silver lantern and fired the pipe up damned silly practice he thought after almost coughing his lungs up from then on he merely rolled the smoke around in his mouth not trying to inhale as the others did slightly sickened by the taste and the sharpness of the hot smoke on his palate which until then had been doing just fine with supper and wine to savor a blend sir joshua cowell smirked pacing about the cabins and puffing away like a house fire quite pleasant quite just a touch of turkey sir to give the virginia some character admiral rowley nodded pleased at cowells opinion of his blend from latakia i believe taken from a prize last month usually its more suited to snuff material but it does give the blend some fire yes it does have bite under the mellow cowell agreed now as to how we may foment confusion to our foes gentlemen let us take a look at the spanish situation in the americas if you may allow me to refer to this map he produced a large map big as an ocean chart and spread it out on the polished mahoghany dining table anchoring the corners with glasses and bowls we shall most likely lose east or british florida at the peace conference cowell pointed out spanish forces have evicted us from our last bastion at st augustine and from the mouth of the st johns river god give them joy of it sir joshua shivered a pestilential place from my experience as you see just before the war the southernmost colonies of florida and georgia were just beginning to draw colonists cowell lectured using the long stem of his churchwarden pipe as a pointer note the topography of the virginias and the carolinas separated from the interior by the appalachians all the way down to here where they end in georgia from whence a great coastal plain stretches all the way to the great river of the mississippi and probably beyond the new rebel nation has not crossed over these mountains yet though they probably shall in future to the north the iroquois nations still favorable to british interests and dependent on us for trade goods they shall give our rebels pause should they attempt colonizing westward bankrupt the devils to maintain a standin army against the northern indians lieutenant colonel peacock barked with amusement let em see what the cost of their folly is with the french evicted from canada we can maintain good relations with and ministries to the northern indians as a check to any rebel plans for expansion to the north and west cowell said with a firm nod or two and we propose to do the same with the southern indians the admiral added puffing away contentedly that is exactly our plan sirs cowell went on quickly now there will be rebel influence in the south unfortunately charleston was the center for trade inland for many years that citys merchant adventurers extended far to the west and south and we may expect no less in future a trade i wish to point out that shall no longer be british where the border shall be drawn we have no idea but spain rules the rest of the coast west florida and all fortunately for us they rule pretty much in name only their normal methods of conquest such as they employed in new granada and new spain were not followed on the mainland small church settlements a few troops to keep order but few european settlers and no encomienda system to exploit the downtrodden indians in slavery on large estates and fiefs the land does not support the colonies for that reason and the spanish are losing money on the bargain though the soil inland past the coastal marshes is quite fertile one of the reasons they have not moved inland is the southern indians the entire region swarms with various tribes some of them powerful enough to give anyone pause and none of them willing to have anyone settle among thembritish spanish or rebel they are or could be a potent counterpoise to any further settlement west of georgia properly armed and trained with european arms these indians could provide us with a drain on the new rebel economy a force that could limit any westward expansion and a means to bankrupt the spanish treasury making the spanish think twice about keeping the region in short a southern iroquois league we want to establish good relations with the southern indians the admiral summed up shifting in his chair with impatience at cowells plodding oratory we wish to give the spanish fits over their possessions in the south making them more amenable to our retaking the region at the peace negotiations and we want to nail down the western border of the colonies in the meanwhile so we may exploit this great and fertile coastal plain instead of the jonathons the frogs or the dons look at the possibilities great rivers pouring down from the interior here at the mouth of the mississippi of the mobile this bay at pensacola even here at tampa bay they could be important naval bases in time of war why should the dons have emor the jonathons and for the nonce with strength enough we could bleed both the rebel and the spanish treasuries trying to keep large forces on the frontier cowell finished with a dramatic sigh and sank down into his chair as though exhausted by the effort of being so clever and erudite catch em in a nutcracker lieutenant colonel peacock said chearly waving a real nutcracker at them canada and a new british florida with the rebels squeezed to death between ha ha to prove his point he crunched a walnut to nibble on the only problem being sir joshua frowned that at present we have no entrйe with the dons in possession of the coast ah but a most weak and porous possession sir joshua cowell chuckled a few guarda costa luggers little better than fishing smacks perhaps one full regiment supported by native levies of doubtful worth had we the troops and the inclination we would have swept the area clean years ago but for washington and our priorities further north that is where you two gentlemen come in us i see lilycrop pondered slurping some port cant get there without the navy ey cowell laughed so what is it exactly you want us to do milord lilycrop asked of his admiral your brig o war shrike is shallowdrafted you can get close inshore in what two fathom of water shell draw about ten foot proper laden milord even better the bays are shallow along this coast even at high tide and the passes into the sound through the barrier islands are of a piece with the bahamas or the coast of cuba which you gentlemen have done such a thorough job of ravaging lately sir joshua rowley told them in addition you took a spanish guarda costa sloop on your last cruise of a type not very much unlike anything the spanish would expect to see along the coast false flag false uniforms for your officers shrike was originally a trading brig so her presence under spanish colors would be unremarkable we propose that you disguising yourselves as a don packetbrig and escort go inshore drop off a party who shall make their way inland to treat with the indians and if the negotiations go well deliver to the indians a quantity of arms suitable to their needs along with such gifts as may tempt them to side with our interests how far inland milord lilycrop asked looking a trifle dubious and how long are we to linger off this coast mister mcgilliveray cowell asked the tribe we wish to talk with are the lower creeks sirs mcgilliveray said swiveling about to look at lewrie and lilycrop he stood and swung the large map about so the military representatives could see it better in the peninsula of florida the people are pretty much shattered timucua ocale several other tribes mostly reduced by spanish or british weapons or disease or rum west of the peninsula pretty much the same for the apalachee but to the north there are muskogean peoples whom the colonists call upper creeks and lower creeks there are also seminolee creek relatives who speak muskogean theyre fairly powerful on their own their influence shall be most helpful to me inland you sir lilycrop asked mister cowell and i are your passengers sir mcgilliveray said with a small grin do you land us here sir at apalachee bay east of the ochlockonee river there are marshes and mangrove swamps for cover so we may take the guarda costa sloop upriver to where it joins the larger apalachicola behind any coastal patrols two days on the water perhaps forty miles then we pick up horses from the seminolee and march two days overland to the large lake formed by the chatahooch river or if the sloop will not serve perhaps a pair of ships boats with sails and how long to negotiate sir lieutenant colonel peacock asked two more days if all the important mikkos are available mcgilliveray speculated it might be a week if they had to be summoned they will be cautious so it might take a total of two weeks altogether before they make up their minds including the trek inland then say a third week to get representatives from the creeks at the mouth of the river here to pick up the arms or pick up our shore party should we fail to convince them damme hide a ship in the marshes for three weeks lilycrop almost exploded turning a cherry hue more like hide two ships shrike at the mouth of the river and the sloop way up here assumin the damned thing may get that far which is a rather large assumption aint it and just what forces do the dons have around this apalachee bay i ask you what about these coastal indians they goin to sit on their duffs and just let us set up housekeepin or are they goin to run off and sell us up to the bloody dons one would think you had no bottom for the adventure sir lieutenant colonel peacock countered grumpily perhaps another officer i think what my captain means sirs is that no one could sail in and play merry andrew with no knowledge alan stuck in as lilycrop turned scarlet at the slur to his courage and what is shrike to do in the time the guarda costa sloop is upriver lay at anchor and trust a local patrol doesnt happen along pray some local informer doesnt tell the spanish were there it sounds as if shrike should lurk offshore say ten or fifteen leagues out in the gulf and never close the coast at all let the sloop go inshore alone then if all goes well shrike could meet her at some prearranged rendezvous i assume however that shrike would carry the main cargo of arms and trade goods and must at some time come inshore to deliver or do you plan to take everything along in san ildefonso mister cowell it would cut down our time in danger on the coast if the sloop bore the complete cargo sir cowell said and how much is to be transported sir alan pressed there are eight hundred refurbished muskets with all equipage eight hundred infantry hangers and bayonets plus forty thousand cartouches cowell stated as though reading a manifest and powder and ball equivalent to another forty thousand rounds and we have trade goods tomahawks knives bolts of cloth cooking pots shirts and castoff tunics the usual merchant truck the tribes desire the most about four tons altogether mcgilliveray said a very light load the sloop could handle it easily could it not aye a thirtysixfoot barge could do it easy lilycrop agreed then another two weeks to get the stuff inland and get our party back alan wondered aloud glancing at lilycrop no the creeks have horses and mules mcgilliverary told him and they have their own canoes you know they could take it all on their own once we get them to agree to the bargain once they show up and we unload for them the sloop could be gone what about these apal whatyoucallems then alan asked do we have to hide from them as well would they be hostile i know for a fact that we have no worries about the apalachee mcgilliveray smiled they are too weak on their own theyre allies of the seminolee and the creeks mostly out of fear of what will happen if they cross them i shall explain the situation and i doubt if anyone remaining with the boats at the mouth of the river will have any worries they have no reason to love the spanish either with some trade goods presented to their chiefs theyll probably fall all over themselves to help us as long as the crew that stays behind does not offend them thats a rather big if is it not alan laughed i mean i never heard of anyone who could trust an indian they follow their own lights and be damned to everyone else dont they we trust the indians mister lewrie cowell sniffed we trust mister mcgilliveray this is his plan know a lot about them do you alan cocked an eyebrow at the young man to his right dear me i should have told you mister lewrie i am one mcgilliveray smirked ah alan managed to say mostly because it could be done with his mouth hanging open my mother is muskogee my father scot one of those merchants out of charleston mcgilliveray explained with my mothers people i am called white turtle of the wind clan the most powerful clan in any tribe or settlement my grandfather on mothers side is mikko where we are going and my cousins are influential the apalachee and seminolee know me so we shall be safe from harm from them i shall try to explain all the particulars you should know on the voyage and how many crew may you need captain admiral rowley inquired to smooth over alans gaffe nine men plus cook and officer milord along with captain eccles here and a dozen men from my regiment as guards with the sloop and with the party upriver peacock added pardon me colonel but would those be troops of the line or light infantry alan asked once he had regathered his abashed wits why do you ask sir what do you know of soldiers i was at yorktown sir and this affair strikes me as calling for rifles or skirmishers not line troops i dealt with a loyalist volunteer regiment and their light company armed with fergusons sir rifles bah peacock spat with some heat bunch of damned irregulars no discipline dependable as chimney smoke if you run into trouble up there youll thank your lucky stars for some steady men of the line who can overawe these savages men who can fire two shots a minute in volley such as captain eccles may select pardon me sir but in my limited experience with land fighting id rather fire four shots a minute with a ferguson breechloader from ambush than stand and deliver by volley alan retorted with a smile one of the reasons we chose shrike youll remember is that her first officer does have landfighting experience colonel admiral rowley interjected before peacock could explode like a howitzer shell with a very short fuse plus her shallow draft and the record she had made for herself as a fighting ship under her gallant captain lieutenant lilycrop and since shrikes officers shall be responsible for getting our expedition ashore and upriver safely it does seem reasonable to allow them to make suggestions now from their experience damme that sounds devilish promising alan thought with delight at the admirals praise singled out for hazardous duty cause i made a name for myself wont that look good in the london papers he shared a quick glance with lilycrop who was beaming and nodding his head as he digested the fine assessment the admiral had made of his recent record looking pleased as a pig in shit no red coats mcgilliveray said in caution your men should wear buff or green anyway have some linen hunting shirts run up and i quite agree with lieutenant lewrie about the type of men to go ashore it would be best if we could procure irregulars people with some woodscraft more than one british general has come to grief tramping about the backcountry with line troops colonel well that lets out walsham and his marines lilycrop said and if this mission is to be secreti do take it to be secret heythen why advertise our presence by wearin uniform at all a good point sir cowell spoke up feeling left out on all the martial planning mister mcgilliveray i doubt they could pass at close muster as natives but clothes do make the man do they not ha ha a most sensible suggestion honored sir said mcgilliveray bowing to his mentor perhaps pack uniforms for the negotiations to appear more impressive to my people who are delighted by a fine show but on the march hunting shirts leggings and moccasins might escape notice by any spanish patrol we happen onto better to be ignored than have to fight unless its absolutely necessary you could supply troops colonel cowell almost demanded from his enthusiasm and excitement at getting to dress up like a red indian i still hope to honor your requests sir he frowned not liking his unit to be slighted so easily from a grand adventure there are no riflemen on jamaica no fergusons either well i could assign men from my regiment even so from the light company practiced as skirmishers remnants of a fusilier battalion i assure you they know their way around in the mountains and forests hereabouts milord theyre acclimated to yellow jack and the other fevers by now as well after chasing after rebellious slaves during the last revolt god cashman captain eccles whispered bitterly aghast at being left out cashman did you say admiral rowley prompted cocking an ear in eccles direction and who is that sir the captain of our light company milord peacock replied trying to keep a sober face a bit eccentric but a good man in a fight i assure you milord if this ass peacock doesnt like him then hell probably be just our sort alan thought doubt if i could have stood this catchfart eccles for moren a week without callin him out and damned if id trust one of those battalioncompany stallions to guard me out in those swamps alan took it for a given that as first officer he would be called upon to guide the little sloop inshore thats what first officers were for to risk their arses while their captains stood off and chewed their furniture with worry it was a rare captain who would give his first lieutenant command of his precious ship and go off on some deed of derringdo just to satisfy his bloodlust by the time a man had made postcaptain he mostly had bloodlust out of his system anyway and was glad to make way for a younger and more expendable man the conference lasted several more hours determining that the spanish sloop would be the only vessel to go inshore towing a single ships boat she could make her way at high tide as far as two miles up the ochlockonee river with her topmast struck the two twelvepounder guns on her focsle would be dismounted for a brace of fourpounders to ease her sailing qualities the ships boat a standard twentyfivefoot launch would step a single mast and would need only six oarsmen due to her shallow twofoot draft she would also get a couple of swivels should they run into trouble this meant that another half a dozen hands had to come along leaving half a dozen soldiers free for lookouts and protection once they left the sloop six men would stay behind under a quartermasters mate with another half a dozen soldiers shrike would never close the coast but would stand off out of sight of land and would wait two full weeks from the night the san ildefonso left her and went inshore if she did not show up within three weeks they would come into the bay and search for them shrike would not go ashore for good reason she would be carrying the bulk of the arms cowell didnt want to risk everything in one small ship the sloop would carry fifty muskets one thousand rounds of premade cartouches and musketeers equipment such as cartridge boxes fine priming powder bottles bayonets swords and baldrics enough to make a fine show along with knives pots blankets etc as samples of englands largesse there would be bolts of cloth and blankets for presents and all the usual trade goods but only enough to whet their appetites for more mcgilliveray argued against this assuring cowell that he knew best when dealing with his own people in good faith but finally relented well i think that about covers it gentlemen admiral rowley said with a yawn shrike is provisioned for a cruise already all that remains is loading the cargo bringing the troops aboard the sloop and readying her for sailing her repairs are complete and she has been provisioned as well lieutenant lewrie you had best go aboard her at first light with your selected crew mister mcgilliveray is going to take care of the disguises for the shore party have we forgotten anything mister cowell mister mcgilliveray captain if anything springs to mind between now and sailing date say two days from now send me a sealed note or better bring it yourself to my flagcaptain and i must warn you not a word of this among your men until you are at sea you know how fast rumors fly on the lower deck hey if they wonder well let out were goin to raid the cuban coast milord lilycrop chuckled almost leaning on his hand propped up from the table and looking far past his bedtime the continual supply of drink hadnt helped theyll believe that and be glad its the army goin ashore stead o them thatll explain the sloop too excellent subterfuge captain excellent well im for bed when they emerged on the quarterdeck of the nd rate flagship it was blessedly cool and a refreshing little breeze was blowing to remove the funk of the closed cabins their boat was brought round after the crew was awakened and they rowed back to shrike keeping an enigmatic silence it was only after they had gone to lilycrops cabin that they could talk freely lilycrop stripped out of his uniform and knelt to pay attention to his many cats who blinked and stretched and made much ado over him after such an uncharacteristically long absence cats et gooch aye sir gooch yawned will there be anythin sir no go back to sleep bide a moment mister lewrie aye sir wine thankee sir pour me one too whatever youre havin they sat down together at his desk leaning forward into the pool of light from a single overhead lantern that swayed softly as the hull rode the slight harbor ruffles stirred up by the gentle breeze you feel comfortable with this idea mister lewrie lilycrop asked his features heavily shadowed by the light comfortable enough sir i suppose alan shrugged its a devilish grand opportunity for us stap me if it aint if mcgilliveray knows half of what he says we should be alright once were ashore but i worry about the sloop and the men we leave behind not just about the spanish running across em but discipline while were gone take svensen the quartermaster as your senior hand lilycrop suggested that squareheaded sweded put the fear o god into artillery therell be no nonsense with him in charge and hes a right cleverun too thank you for the suggestion sir i dont like it myself lilycrop frowned looking old as methuselah this mcgilliveray or turtle or whatever he prefers to call himself come up with this tooclever idea an hes got that cowell excited as a sailor on his first whore to go offn do somethin grand an mysterious they sailed direct from portsmouth in the mail packet with all their trade goods and loped up to rowley and peacock with this plan now if the government at home is so missish about endin the war why did they agree to such a farfetched scheme i wonder you dont think theyre legitimate sir alan perked up oh dont be that large an ass lilycrop grumbled think just any fool can go aboard a flagship and dream somethin like this up on the spur of the moment no thisn has so many official wax seals on it itd float the ships bell chimed three bells half past one oclock of the middle watch and lilycrop looked weary to the bone which explained his testiness only thing that surprises me is if floridas so bloody important to us why didnt we raise the tribes long ago when we still had the east coast forts why leave it this late there is that sir alan agreed too sleepy to worry much ive seen things like this before lilycrop went on war on the cheap dreamed up by mapgazersn quillpushers safe back in london i dont know whether our mister cowell come up with this himself or if hes just a nobody wantin to make his name out of it he might be some lords errand boy and that mcgilliveray a right captain sharp too clever by half for the likes of me mayhap he knows what hes talkin about an his tame apalacheell treat us like vistin royalty and hell sit at the right hand of god once hes upriver with his people the creeks i dont like leavin the sloop upriver and well have to split our parties again when you transfer to horses you should have said something then sir oh i did enough carpin for their likes all that praise we got like were draker anson come back with flamin swords well talks cheap and so are we im the oldest lieutenant in the navy youre nobody and shrike and the sloop are expendable damned expendable you give me chills sir alan said taking a deep sip of his own mug to fortify himself but surely the admiral has already placed his favorites into larger ships than ours everything makes sense to choose shrike its a chance to do something really grand and get your name in the marine chronicle lilycrop sneered hell nary a word o thisll ever get out were goin to be as anonymous as spies no matter how it comes out oh maybe our lords commissioners of the admiralty will make a note of it in our records but ill not be made postcaptain over it and youll not go higher than you are now theres no way to refuse this duty but if there was a way id consider it all that talk of how the spanish dont patrol well remember theres troops and a shipr two at pensacola and sure to be a ship o war workin outa tampa bay spies along the coast some indian thatll run to the dagoes to raise the hue an cry sell us out for a fuckin mirror jesus weep nobody i knew ever prospered who got tied up with damn foolishness such as this you be sure to watch your back once youre ashore if you learned anythin up in the chesapeake use it take whoever you know is a woodsman an a scrapper cause youll have need of em and ill pray every day for your safety mister lewrie thank you sir that was well said and welcome alan replied with a warm feeling inside for lilycrops regard for him hard enough to break in a first officer no call to do it moren once a year pon my soul lilycrop scowled looking away at the antics of his cats on the floor ive grown used to ya dya see show us heeltaps on your glass and let us get some rest well need it chapter they are ingenious witty cunning and deceitful very faithful indeed to their own tribes but privately dishonest and mischievous to the europeans and christians their being honest and harmless to each other may be through fear of resentment and reprisalwhich is unavoidable in case of any injury alan read half aloud from a volume that mcgilliveray had recommended to him james adairs history of the american indians published in london in they are very close and retentive of their secrets never forget injuries revengeful of blood to a degree of distraction they are timorous and consequently cautious very jealous of encroachments from their christian neighbors and likewise content with freedom in every turn of fortune they are possessed of a strong comprehensive judgement can form surprisingly crafty schemes and conduct them with equal caution silence and address they admit none but distinguished warriors and beloved men into their councils well that lets me out captain cashman of the light company of the th regiment of foot laughed easily as they sat at table their second day out from kingston i quite look forward to our meeting them cowell said without his wig and with his shirt collar open he looked like a balding club waiter out on holiday they are an admirable people much abused by contact with the white man as the french philosopher rousseau said they have a natural nobility read on mister lewrie do they are slow but persevering in their undertakingssorry mister cowell but negotiations may take longer than you think if thats truecommonly temperate in eating but excessively immoderate in drinking hmm sounds like half my relatives they often transform themselves by liquor into the likeness of mad foaming bears cant take someone like that to covent garden cashman observed ah heres the best part the women in general are of a mild amiable soft disposition exceedingly modest in their behavior and very seldom noisy either in the single or married state hmm well maybe its not the best part at that adair is amusing mcgilliveray said looking up from carving his salt beef he got that part wrong at least among the muskogee oh are the women better than he said alan asked once married they are subservient to their husbands that doesnt mean they cannot nag or raise their voices frankly the older they get the more they resemble billingsgate fishmonger women very earthy mcgilliveray gave them a tight smile what were interested in my dear sir is what sort of rattle they are cashman drawled lay hands on a married muskogee any married indian woman and her male relatives will hang you up on the pole and butcher you for three days one does not even cast a covetous eye on them for fear of retribution its a blasphemy you mean we cant even bloody look at em here lewrie this is a rum duty said cashman frowning you may notice them but you cant ogle them or follow after them or try to talk to them if theyre in their monthly courses you wont see them at all mcgilliveray went on sternly lecturing as he had since he had come aboard they hide themselves away from their families and their village and anything they touch is polluted a man who looks on a woman in her courses gets downstream of one has to go through severe purification rituals to restore his spirits dont sound like they run to whores neither cashman winked at lewrie who was as tired of mcgilliverays pontifications as anyone else aboard no we dont and youre becoming tiresome captain cashman mcgilliveray said controlling his temper which alan had just read was supposed to be immoderate seriously mister mcgilliveray were going to have seamen and soldiers running about who havent had anything better than a harbor drab or a toothless camp follower since their last payday there must be some release surely the whole tribe cant live in chastity belts indian men do you know mcgilliveray said smugly for the good of the harvest the planting of the crops good fortune in hunting success in battle when someone dies thats why sexual relations are so strictured also how do you control the urge to adultery among so many people in such a small village unless the whole thing becomes some form of magic ritual he gave them a deprecating smile to show that he was human which did nothing to convince either lewrie or cashman that he hadnt been got at by baptists at least once they become warriors they do and once they wed before there is allowed a certain license among the younger women as well they can be rather enthusiastic about men before they wed well how do you tell the difference then cashman demanded and what do you do bring her a plucked chicken flip tuppence across the fire tell em to wash the mehtars daughter the what lewrie goggled sorry i was in the east indies once it was a lot easier there let me tell you cheaper too if you like nautch girls with bums and legs like farrier sergeants cashman said irrepressibly theres a lot of ceremony in village life mcgilliveray told them sipping at smallbeer which was all he would allow himself at each ceremony theres dancing in circles around a central fire and all the unmarried women sort of cluster together and show off their finery i shall point them out to you if they fancy you youll know it right off they run things long as theyre single and if indian men restrict themselves as you say they must have to make up for lost time after theyre married cashman said grinning so if shes there she isnt polluted and if she fancies a tumble shell come over and flash her poonts its a bit more subtle than that captain mcgilliveray said with a sigh of the truly longsuffering believe me youll know i should think it best if we forswore conjugal relations with the natives cowell said a bit prim it would be easiest hardly possible im afraid sir alan stated you havent seen my sailors arut or me alan qualified to himself and if the young unmarried females are so eager for it i doubt a troop of saints could hold out for long youll have your rut sir mcgilliveray snapped speaking further of pollution i adjure you and your men from making water into any body of water running water is sacred you see where some of our gods dwell you dont piss in it or spit into it or pass excreta into it no dumping of kitchen scraps anything like that you do that on dry land where it wont drain into running waters bury it well we can go have a wash cant we cashman asked oh yes in fact if you dont wash daily first thing in the morning theyll look on you strangely its our way but never get downstream of a woman its best to conform to our customs for as long as you are with my people to ease the negotiations you see with so many distinguished chiefs gathered together the slightest upset can make them leery of the whole thing and then theyll not side with us when in rome do as the romans cowell suggested now mister mcgilliveray tell them about the missionary work among the muskogean i mind you said once back in london with the bishop of chicester as i remember that only a few of your people have accepted the faith i should be delighted to hear of it sir but i believe that captain cashman and i are already due on deck alan said referring to his pocket watch musket drill you know if you gentlemen shall excuse us please stay and indulge yourselves you have but to ask of my man cony jesus bloody christ cashman sighed after they had got on deck ive about had it with that blackamoor like being lectured to by a mastiff a very unfunny mastiff at that sarnt trot the buggers out for musketry and if navy rum is too tasty for proper aimin then maybe a navy catll suit em better sir cashman was indeed as lieutenant colonel peacock had said eccentric his speech was littered with army slang east indian hindi expressions and a pungent sprinkling of profanity that would make a bosuns mate green with envy he had come aboard armed to the teeth wearing an infantrymans short brasshilted hanger instead of a smallsword four pistols stuck into his sash and a pair of converted saddle holsters a short fusil slung over one shoulder and a french musketoon over the other in a world where officers were to be fashionplates and the rankers usually clad in rags cashman looked as if he had darned his uniform together since he had bought his first set of colors and once aboard ship had doffed half of that quartermaster the keg paid out astern alan asked aye aye zir hoff a cable the blonde hulk named svensen told him full hundret faddom line zir lets get to it sarnt the men of the light company split off into skirmishing pairs at the stern rail they pulled their weapons back to halfcock bit off the twist end of their first cartouches and primed pans poured powder down the barrels wadded the waxed paper cartridges around the lead balls and rammed them home keeping the rammer free in their off hands instead of returning them to their proper place under the barrels the first rank fired raising froth around the towed keg at one hundred yards range and stepped back to start reloading while their rearrank partners stepped up to deliver their shots not in volley but within a few seconds of each other i like the fusil if i cant have a jager rifle cashman said taploading his charge and snapping the weapon up to his shoulder no one knows exactly why but a short barrel is just as accurate as a long one bam and down came the piece drawn back to halfcock on the way to loading position alan nodded as he saw that cashman had chipped the keg which halfsubmerged would be about the size of a reclining man at one hundred yards with a smoothborecashman continued to talk as he bit at his cartridge blackening his lipsits more a problem of obturation you see how snug the ball fits in the barrel tap went the fusil on the deck to settle the powder the right hand had rolled the ball and paper wad together and stuck it in the muzzle as it came up from being rapped the rammer came up like a fuglemans cane on parade and everything was shoved home snug with one firm push the rammer came out of the muzzle and spun in cashmans lefthand fingers as he brought the weapon up pulling it back to fullcock a quick breath and a second shot rang out the second in half a minute no parade ground bumf for us see cashman said even as he was making a fresh cartouche appear as if by magic just get it done three maybe four rounds a minute fast as your ferguson breechloader here alan took the fusil it was a lighter shorter musket just a little longer than a cavalrymans musketoon with a barrel of about twentyfive inches as alan loaded for himself cashman went on about it smoothbore takes a bayonet heavy enough stock to knock some poor bastard into next week but only caliber lighter ball carriers farther with a standard brown bess powder measure and if you use the waxed cartridge as a greased patch like you would in a rifled piece the bugger carries farther and straighter battalion companies with the brown bess average eighty or ninety yards for a killing shot but the fusil will go a bit farther one hundred twenty perhaps one hundred fifty yards nothing like a rifle but it only drops about ten inches in two hundred yards frankly i couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a carronade at two hundred yards alan brought up the weapon pulled it back to fullcock took aim and squeezed the trigger and was pleased to see his ball raise a splash just short of the keg load quick now the indians are breathin on you respectable kick alan said fumbling through the loading procedure and taking a lot longer than cashman or his men did lighter piece same powder charge as a regulars musket masters you poxy spastic pick up your bloody rammer man dont drop it take is name sir the sergeant offered no take his pulse see if hes dead cashman quipped and his men laughed easily after half an hour with their mouths and faces blackened by the powder they had eaten and the flash from the pans they took a short rest while the keg was paid out to one hundred fifty yards alan had finally managed to get off three shots a minute and had hit the keg twice in that period though the fusil had pummeled his shoulder almost numb he walked over to the water butt and dipped the long narrow sipper down through the small scuttle to draw out a measure your men seem to know what theyre about i must say alan commented theyre damned good aye best thing about the bloody th regiment cashman spat wiping his mouth and face clean and making a face at the taste of nitre on his lips a warraised singlebattalion unit no home depot you see peacock raised it himself tory patriot dont ya know cheap at the price too them that survived the fevers and the slave revolt campaignin theyll deactivate us if they even remember were bloody here soons the bloody treatys signed you were part of it originally hell no my light companys all thats left of a fusilier battalion got tagged onto them after most of us went under to yellow jack came off the ship four hundred seventyseven men and officers strong and two weeks later we made roughly two companies now ive barely forty left these are the best of em though it was hard to choose lieutenant colonel peacock and captain eccles seemed a little put off that i suggested light infantry or that you would be the one to go on this adventure of ours alan said smiling this was your doing cashman brightened blessings upon ye then anything to get away from those buggers what did they say that you were eccentric but a hard fighter im not their sort cashman admitted chearly thank god im amazed they reckoned me a good soldier i didnt know theyd recognize one if he crawled up and bit em on the arse beggars cant be choosers though and they needed a light company to flesh em out if they had a choice id not have been able to purchase a commission with em i was only a lieutenant with my old battalion a captaincy was a brevet promotion but if the loots good or the cards run right i might be able to purchase a real captaincy one of these days back home hell no a captaincy costs near twentyfive hundred pounds for a good regiment cashman chuckled no unless god passes a miracle ill be soldiering in cheaper places here in the fever islands back in the east indies where nobody in his right mind would want to go a regiment like thats a buyers market cost me only three hundred pounds to become an ensign when word got out we were going to madras people were changing or selling out like the hounds of hell were at their heels but if it werent for the loot id have never had enough for a lieutenancy in the fusiliers one way or another the old regimentll have to take me back soon as i get home and when the armys reduced therell be a chance to buy up thank god the navy doesnt go for purchased commissions or commands alan shivered thinking how menial he would be that instant if he had had to depend on his father spending money to get rid of him why didnt you give the fleet a try fourth son cashman shrugged and damnall inheritance for any of the others already had the future farmer a sailor and a churchman and i had a choice of clerking in ipswich or going for a soldier ever been in ipswich last time i was home i thought id freeze my prick off and that was in summer mind and suffolks pretty damned dull any time of the year i love england well as any man but theres something about the tropics if you can survive in em at least its warm and not too many churchmen breathing down your neck with their shaltnots what do you think of this mission of ours alan asked him frankly i think its a rumun cashman whispered though the sound of his fusiliers banging away at the keg would have covered his doubts from the men if we want florida back so bloody bad why not put a couple of good regiments together from the jamaica garrison and make it a proper landing oh aye take along some pretties to buy off the locals maybe form some temporary levies like east indian sepoys from what i hear these creeksd make good soldiers if somebody took the effort to train em good skirmishers and woodland fighters proper armed hell and damnation id like to have all my company with me if that wont serve were too thin on the ground to suit me bring the rest of your present regiment peacock and them cashman laughed sourly theyd get themselves butchered lessn two hundred of em anyway and not worth a tinkers damn when it comes to skirmishing turn that lot loose in the woods and theyd make so much noise and get so lost any indian in the worldd have em for his breakfast my sailors wont be much better im afraid cony and some of the party coming with us are country lads one jump ahead of the magistrate for poaching but nothing like what one needs against indians and dago troops who know the country alan confessed here you sound like youve been around before served ashore have you cashman asked at yorktown we escaped alan told him with a touch of pride with a light company of loyalists from the carolinas whew cashman whistled so how do you feel about this trip of ours im a touch leery too oh it sounded grand when they offered it to us and we couldnt say no anyway alan told him with a shrug supper with our admiral being admitted to high plans you know but my captain over there is worried and now hes got me doing it you should i dont like leaving this sloop in the swamps at the mercy of those indians alan went on what happens if mcgilliveray or white turtle or whatever cant convince them to keep their hands off while were gone from what ive read an indian thinks its his duty in life to lift from strangers whatevers not nailed down who says we have to leave things laying about to tempt them cashman replied with a twinkle in his eyes you know that once we separate from your ship yonder you and i are equally in command of this mess you of the sloop and the longboat i of the land party cowell is no soldier hes a london paperpusher with dreams of adventure and this mcgilliveray is only an advisor they cant order us to do a bloody thing what do you want to do id like to send san ildefonso off to sea under my quartermaster alan said after a long moment of thinking theres no reason to leave a large easily discoverable ship in the swamps the crew could sicken on the miasmas get overrun by the apalachees or the spanish could find her and bring force enough to take her best we go quietly on our way upriver cashman agreed were going to be dressed pretty much like indians in these hunting shirts and whatever so the dons dont know were here so whats stopping you sending this ship back to sea once were landed if secrecy is so important not a bloody thing alan realized and if i wanted to bring another squad with me so wed have a round dozen skirmishers theres no one to gainsay me either out at sea your ship wouldnt need a party of soldiers left behind what about the samples then oh we can take em upriver cant we cashman asked well this sloop does have a boat of its own a little eighteenfoot gig take five more men to run her under oars though say three minimum with two of your men aboard as guards i can find enough lads to row her you just give me one sailor to show em what to do that way i can take six more men two as guards as you said spelling each other and part of the cargo with me cowell and mcgilliveray might not like it mind alan cautioned the devil with what they like or dont like cashman said sure of himself theyre only civilians they could ruin your career and mine theres not much more they could do to ruin mine the way things are going cashman laughed how enamored are you of yours i dont want to get cashiered alan said im getting just good enough at the navy to want to keep it youll end up on the beach on halfpay soon enough anyway and this whole expedition is a pretty neckornothing thing its not like it has much hope of turning things around quickly so why are you here if you dont like it alan demanded because i might become a substantive captain out of it cashman told him and the way things are going its the only little piece of the war ive left desperate or not it beats garrison duty back on jamaica you see jesus so dont tell me you werent thinking about getting a little fame yourself out of it cashman teased him of course long as were changing things who says you have to go come now seriously if anybodyd asked me as to how wed pull this off id have stayed off the river entirely rivers are like highways in this country might as well hire a band id trade for horses with the coastal indians and go overland lay up by the day travel by night disguises or no if id helped plan this id have asked for the navy to merely get us here and come back to pick us up later just like peacock not to confer with the ones who have to do it sail off damned if i will alan spat cowell would really have my hide for funking on him and my admiral would have my hide a week later for cowardice no sir alright then we go inshore after its dark and we head upriver in the dark to get as far as we can before its light cashman schemed then mcgilliveray can turn into any old sort of indian he likes and lead us the rest of the way but without having to depend on this coastal tribe whore like as not handinglove with the dons already well have enough on our plate with the other tribes as it is damn your blood sir cowell fumed after he had been told of the new arrangements this is not what we agreed to at all damme if its not i am charged by his majestys government directly to mister cowell lieutenant lewrie and i are the senior military representatives cashman argued as the unloading went on now keep your voice down or do you wish to draw every bloody don within fifty miles to this damned inlet this way we are much more secure the sample goods still get upriver you get upriver white turtle gets upriver and we run the same bloody risks but we do it on the sly more than we would leaving the sloop behind to advert our presence ill have your hide for this see if i do not sir cowell raged but in a sibilant whisper into the tropical stillness once we are back at jamaica sir joshua shall hear of this your captain shall know of your insubordinate attitude as soon as we rendezvous with his ship and your colonel too captain cashman the exigencies of the situation sir alan said almost quoting cashman verbatim from one of their later planning sessions once the sloop had left shrikes company and made her final run of fifteen miles for the coast that afternoon based on sound military reasoning and on captain cashmans long experience with which i concur totally ill send a letter to your captain before the nights out i will cowell went on and a despatch to sir joshua if the sloop is no longer germane to our enterprise she may serve to inform your superiors of my extreme displeasure with your conduct sir do what you like sir alan replied with a genial tone mister cowell i must warn you to keep your voice down sir mcgilliveray hissed coming to their side sound carries a long way at night and you may be sure someone is watching and listening to every word you say every action we do this very minute it was hard to think of him any longer as young mister desmond mcgilliveray since he had shed his poor suitings for a snuffbrown linen shirt with the sleeves cropped off a breechclout tied about his waist with a hank of learner thong a yellow waist sash and deerskin leggings and moccasins the bare coppery flesh of his legs arms and chest revealed intricate tattoos that had been concealed by a europeans togs do you know what this impudent puppy has done sir cowell raged him and that jackanapes jumpedup guttersnipe cashman please discuss this below decks and quietly alan cautioned and let me get on with the loading if you please gentlemen mcgilliveray almost dragged cowell to the hatchway and led him below where they stumbled down the darkened ladder to the lower deck gig iss in der vater zir svensen told him vater butt biscuit box zalt meat barricoe der mast zails und oars zir good svensen andrews shall take her as coxn and the soldiers shall do the rowing get the hands started on loading her with the smaller pile of goods yonder as much as you think best if we cant get it all aboard sort out as many different kinds of things zir svensen begged unwilling to take responsibility with items unfamiliar to him then well let mister cowell or mister mcgilliveray see to that youll not keep this ship hidden here as i first told you take her out to sea as soon as were on our way meet up with shrike and tell the captain we didnt think it was safe to leave her here aye zir tank gott me neider give him this letter telling him the reasons for my decision and i expect mister cowell shall have one for you too alan said smiling i shall go below and change alan stumbled down to the hold accommodation deck of the small sloop and stripped out of his uniform as men bustled about past curtains that served as light traps from the hold where they could at least see what they were doing in carrying goods and weapons to the spar deck this is so damned daft he grumbled as he exchanged white slop trousers for an old pair of buff breeches reinforced with leather on the seat and inner thighs some cavalrymans castoffs they were much too big for him but they would serve a forestgreen linen shirt went on over those a faded blue sash about his waist outside the shirt in which he stuck a boarding axe much the size of an indians tomahawk a pair of dragoon pistols he had kept as mementos from yorktown and a short dagger then came cartouche pouch and musket implements slung over his shoulders and a baldric for a sword he eyed his hanger the lovely gills in its dark blue leather sheath with the sterling silver fittings the seashell design on the hilt and guard and the gilt pommel of a lions head it was too precious to him to traipse about before stickyfingered indians or lose along with his life if this expedition went sour with a sigh he put it down and exchanged it for one of the cheap spanish cutlasses from the ships weapons tub he went aft to his quarters in the stern and wrote a short note which he wrapped about the scabbard instructing that if he did not return it should be sent to his grandmother in devon whom he had never laid eyes on that act convinced him if nothing else did that there was more than usual danger in what they were about to do and he regretted that he had not taken the time to write a few letters there was lucy whom he had been forbidden from seeing since his disastrous actions of the months before there was his maternal grandmother who had rescued him from ignominy and poverty there was caroline chiswick now safely in the arms of her family in charleston if they had not already sailed for england by now povertystricken she might be but she had been such a sweet and lovely girl a little too tall and gawky for fashionable beauty but damned handsome nonetheless and devilish smart and delightful to converse with god help him he felt a pang for dolly fenton and wished that he were back in her bed that instant she at least had for a time loved him as well as she was able and that was damned fine he still regretted that last hour or so with her when he had to tell her he was sailing away for good and that her dreams of a little lovenest for just the two of them could not be she had wept as quietly as she could clung to him given him passionate love once more saving her real tears and squawls for total privacy she had been so sweet too so dependent yet good of heart and thank god nowhere near as dumb as lucy might as well write my fucking will while im at it he muttered suffering a premonitory chill even as he said it his insides cooled noticeably and his stomach got a touch queasy as he finished gathering up a change of clothes and a few personal items in a seabag damnit this was a bloody undertaking not like a seabattle at all which was gory enough for anyones tastes with mcgilliveray to lead them and negotiate they might be safe as houses or they could end up tortured to death screaming for death and painted savages dancing about waving their own hair and their privates at them in glee jesus im scared witless he whispered soft as he could in the privacy of his quarters the temporary luxury of untold space in the former masters cabin he had been frightened before any time he had to scale the masts before battle was joined when he had time to think about how he could be mangled the two duels he had fought in his short life the shelling at yorktown or the horrible battle they had fought with lauzuns legion and the virginia militia on guinea neck before they could escape even the first few weeks under lieutenant lilycrops pitiless eyes as he fumbled his way to competence had tied his plumbing into hot knots but nothing like this icy dread damn the navy damn king george damn everybody he spat within a touch of begging off at the last minute it was all he could do to walk to the cabin door and think about joining his party there was a knock on the door which almost loosed his bowels enter he bade from a dreadfully dry mouth cashman stepped inside clad in pretty much the same rig as alan but with the addition of a scarlet officers sash you look like deaths head on a mopstick cashman said with a quirky little cock of his brows how i look is nothing on how i feel alan grumbled then lets liquor our boots cashman suggested crossing to the former captains winecabinet he drew out a wine bottle and took a swig from the neck then handed the bottle to lewrie ah thats the ticket alan sighed incredibly foul vin rouge my last taste of civilization i hope youve remembered rum for my troops cashman asked god knows how anyone could do what were about to do sober aye rum enough for everyone for three weeks though not the usual sailors measure a sip no more its beginning to feel a touch insane about now aint it insane aint the word for it sir alan shuddered call me christopher cashman told him growl we may but go we must you know give me that bottle if youve had enough i feel the need for a generous libation to put me numb enough to get on with the business feeling daunted yourself hey bloody terrified cashman admitted easily you i was wondering if i could break a leg or something at the last minute alan grinned back at him cashman tipped him a wink either way its bloody daft the way we leap at chances for honor and glory cashman said with a belch and handed the bottle back which bottle had diminished in contents remarkably in a very short span of time personally i think its a lot of balls but thats what they pay us for this is the worst time when one steps out into the unknown once weve been shoved into motion it usually goes much better thats been my experience alan nodded what about cowell and mcgilliveray cowell sahib is still scribbling away at his objections but the turtlerajah came round at the last long as the goods get upriver he suggested the sloop would do better to handle the transfer of goods from shrike instead of having your ship come inshore with her wants you to pass the word to your captain to load her up and stand ready to meet us once we get the gora logs convinced to set out the red war pole could you possibly speak the kings english kit ah sorry not possible you see been too long away from it i can pidgin with any samboe you want from the hooghly bar to the coromandel coast i can even get along in creole with the slaveys up in the blue mountains who knows by the time were done ill master creek too well we can open another bottle alan sighed tossing the empty onto the coverlet of the hanging cot or we could get started while its still dark and quiet best go then or well never cashman tried to smile aye goddamnit amen parson lewrie chapter chapter florida pretty much aint worth a tuppeny shit alan thought moodily as they lay up ashore just a few miles short of the headwaters of the ochlockonee the past night and day had been miserable the air was still and foetid with the smells of marsh and mud the swamps aswarm with mosquitoes and biting flies biting gnats alligators and poisonous snakes were twoapenny on the banks in the water laying out for a bask on the tree limbs that overhung the banks when they were forced close ashore by a bend in the channel or snuffling about under the banks in their nests and roaring at them when disturbed they had made very good time though catching a favorable slant of wind on the first night when the river was wide enough for shorttacking inland so far they were a day ahead of schedule it was only after the sun had come up that they had been forced to row as the banks closed in and rose higher in thickly treed hammocks that blocked the breeze from the sea and the familiar tang of salt air was left behind like a lovers perfume the heat wasnt bad though the air was stiflingly wet enough and humid enough to wring perspiration from them by the bucket and it was a blessing that the leafy green waters could be drunk safely or dipped up and sluiced over tired bodies bald cypress scrub pine and yellowgreen stagnant ponds spread out on either hand under the canopy of the marshes punctuated by water reeds sharpedged grasses or jagged stumps of prodigious size bright birds the like of which the hands had never seen cried and stalked or fluttered below the canopy frogs the size of rabbits croaked at them from their resting places water bugs skittered on the deceptively calm water as it slid like treacle through the marshes now and then a hammock of higher sandy ground loomed up around a bend in the channel covered with pines thick as the hair on a cats back open to the bright sky as the result of a lightning fire or burn otter deer a host of wildlife lurked along the banks alan saw raccoons for the first time and opposums hanging by their naked tails like obscene caricatures of rats he had been almost nauseated by mcgilliverays granted comment that opposums were very good to eat though he was never one to refuse a breadroom fed miller in his midshipman daysat least the ships rats were decentsized mcgilliveray had gone totally native by then stripping off his shirt to bare more pagan tattooing wrapping a length of cloth about his head like a hindis turban as cashman styled it naked under breechclout and the leggings only covering his thighs held up by thongs from the single strap that held the breechclout in place most of the sailors had tied their kerchiefs about their heads like small fourcornered mobcaps the soldiers sported rough imitations of turbans and had taken off their shirts as well though their skins gleamed almost frogbelly pale in the fierce light and several were already regretting the exposure and patting their burns with water at least in that regard alans sailors were more fortunate since they had had months and years of continual tanning by the sun so they appeared at first glance as ruddy as any savage apalachee scout over there mcgilliveray whispered coming to lewries side i shall go speak to him is that wise cowell asked almost prostrate with exhaustion though he had not done a lick of work since plunking his posterior on a thwart the night before alan thought it comical to see how mcgilliveray had tricked cowell out in breechclout leggings moccasins and calico checkered shirt with a turban of his own like a maggot done up as a man he could not have fooled a european at a hundred yards and any indian running across him would have asked him how fast the pitch was at the new lords cricket grounds we have to let them know who we are eventually sir mcgilliveray said they saw us land tracked us upriver i had hoped we would make contact with them last night its only polite seeing as how weve crossed most of their territory already if this is the best realestate they have theyre welcome to every bloody stick of it alan griped mcgilliveray stood up and waved an arm calling out in his odd language and from where alan thought only a mosquito could live up popped a full halfdozen savages dressed in breechclouts and tattoos only bearing long cane bows and arrows mcgilliveray took off his moccasins and waded across a shallow slough of weeds and reeds to converse with them they dont look like rousseaus noble savages do they mister cowell cashman asked coming to join them as they stood idly by watching the parley look how lithe and tall they are how nobly they bear themselves sir cowell disagreed softly one does not need much clothing in such climes mankind reduced to eden without a houseful of possessions and gewgaws with no prating philosophies to occasion rancor shorn of metaphysics of confusing science they are a handsome folk youll not be able to deny all pretensions of society cast aside and relying on nature and our creator and their native wit for sustenance you may speak of barbarity of quick anger and bloodyhanded murther but has mankind in all our wisdom gone far beyond those passions for all our supposed improvements captain cashman we dont kill quite so openly and easily sir cashman replied life in all its facets is closer and more personal with them sir they are not like us but we were once much like them and still are in many ways yet the brave man slays with a sword the coward with an invitation to tea if i may paraphrase the quotation ha ha ive never been scalped at a catlapping alan quipped fucked with god yes and damned proud of it mind we are in luck mister cowell mcgilliveray told them when he returned there are seminolee a few miles ahead of us in a spring camp to fish lots of horses any spanish cashman pressed none seen this far inland in weeks some parties passed north of the swamps and crossed the rivers heading west a few days ago mcgilliveraywhite turtle grunted having seemingly given up the act of smiling for the duration a company of horse and one of foot with baggage train but they were busy driving stolen cattle they took from british colonists far off to the east according to this map there is a small stream that leads to the apalachicola river alan pointed out folding out their large chart how deep is it this one that leads west and norwest very shallow dugout canoes have trouble there their guide said after peering at the map and at lewrie another change mister lewrie weve made good time by water so far why change bets now alan replied mopping his face with a kerchief if it goes our way best we continue on north white turtle scowled pointing in that direction with a chin jutted over his shoulder this river bends easterly to the lake where the lake begins we find horses leave the boats and a guard over them damn splitting our party again cashman spat whats odds these apalachee or your relatives the seminolee would keep them safe for us for a share of the profits of course if the seminolee want something they take it he shrugged well they cant make off with anything big as a launch and a gig can they alan japed i saw something up at yorktown a set of poles lashed together from a horse so it could drag instead of carry a load we could take the rations masts oars everything on the drag behind one horse i assume well march right then we haul the boats ashore and hide them from the spanish at least then if they rip out the thwarts we may still make new ones later wrap everything else up in the sails and shroud lines which we cant easily replace you are a paragon alan cashman beamed id never have ever thought of anything like that see how fortunate we are mister cowell how well the admiralty has provided for you lets simply be on our way its stifling in these swamps cowell fluttered petulantly right you are then off we go andrews back into the boats they began to get back aboard but several of the men from the launch shrank back in fear and scrambled back ashore quick as they could theys a bloody snake mister lewrie sir one of the hands yelped well kill it and lets go no mcgilliveray shouted never kill a snake bad luck with my people wotre we sposed ter do wifem em kiss em an tuck em inna bedr somefin one of the older men muttered loud enough to hear i do it theyre poisonous mcgilliveray offered and climbed into the boat using a long club to lift the snake out and toss it over the side after greeting it in muskogean notice how his speech is getting more pidgin as we go cashman noted before they shoved off yes i had must be getting back into the mood of his people alan replied perhaps cashman whispered rubbing his nose perhaps after camping at the lake shore with the party of seminolee men they started out at first light after a dip in the water and a quick breakfast the seminolee had provided some rather good horses and had known what alan was driving at when he described a drag with some of the trade goods left behind and at least the promise that the boats would be left undisturbed there was nothing for it but to proceed once out of the swamps the land opened out into grassy meadows almost like park land where the heat was not so oppressive and the gentle winds could cool them on their march it was early january and the skies were cloudier than before promising rain with a pair of cotton stockings on rolled down to the ankle alan found moccasins rather comfortable to march in they went in a single file with soldiers and sailors gathered round the packhorses and seminolee out on the flanks and rear with a scout out ahead great warrior the raven white turtle said pointing with his chin to the head of the column the bravest man he gives call of a raven if he sees trouble to the left the wolf who howls i presume alan replied meaning to be civil to the right the owl who will hoot behind us the fox who will yelp mcgilliveray nodded in agreement the others should go all in each others moccasin prints so it only looks like one man might be a big party might be one man alone makes for safety seems safe enough now nothing is safe here you will learn but its so open alan protested shifting the sling of his fusil on his shoulder two hundred yards to the trees and the scouts hide behind tree hide in those groves lay in the grass ten warriors twenty they could be on you before you get that gun to your shoulder delightful alan shuddered look about that snake yesterday never kill a snake no never wash meat in a stream never piss in one never put out a fire with water never get downstream of a widow or upstream from a wife avoid women in their monthlies like the plague what else a great deal more lewrie mcgilliveray said but it makes sense to us women are a separate animal from man not like us at all so we have to be careful we are not defiled we know the thunder boys are the ones who create mischief in this world and people bring it on because they mixed elements that should not have been mixed in the world above everything is perfect each animal each plant and man and woman larger than us and perfect down below in the underworld monsters and witches and watercougar one of everything but evil in the right here world sometimes the perfect comes down sometimes bad comes up from below like spearfinger the old woman who kills and steals mens souls to feed on so she can live forever even when she was finally killed she did not really die the good and the bad always come back so people must always be on their guard not to defile their spirit or offend the great spirit by defilement for their own good their family and clan and their nation is that what you believe personally alan asked are you a christian or do you believe the native religion when my father took me to charleston and then to england he taught me about god and jesus but i always found it a little confusing mcgilliveray admitted even after a year at cambridge i find the old ways more comforting mister cowell and his friends tried to explain the unexplainable as he puts it but the various points of doctrine are troubling to me ah well most people have that problem most call themselves deists and let it go at that alan grinned then you do not honor your god who made you as we do to say that god exists and then continue your life your own way is to negate your belief mcgilliveray expounded others leap about and speak no known tongue shake and dance in glory they raise the bible on high and declare everyone sinners but themselves but then they go out and kill eagles for sport kill snakes sleep with their women in their courses all christians treat the earth as a dead thing to walk upon and all animals as dumb food when we kill an eagle to get its feathers for our great men it takes much prayer and we ask the eagle and the great spirit who is most in the birds and in the eagles of any race of animals on earth to forgive us for we have to do this christians would strip this land bare chop all the trees slaughter all the game far beyond what they could eat because god gave man dominion back in the cloudtime before the clans saw their signs look here he said pointing to a circle tattoo on his chest which enclosed a fourlegged equilateral cross this is the circle of the world between the sky and the underworld the four principal directions and where they meet right here now everyone of indian blood knows here is where he must live if he wants to be good following the laws laid down by the great perfect spirits he reached out and put a hand inside alans shirt hold on my good fellow alan snapped unused like any englishman at being pawed at but mcgilliveray took hold of his small juju bag strung about his neck and weighed it thoughtfully how odd i had expected to find a cross mcgilliveray said with a wary expression he let go of the bag so that alan could tuck it back into his shirt the white mans cross is offcenter there is no sense of being centered and the directions lead off to nothing which is why all white men all christians are so unhappy and want to have dominion i saw the old roods the celtic crosses of your people in the long ago which had circles around the center but the directions go beyond the circle they must have been close to the truth in those days but even so they never really knew peace we could have had a fish you know what would you make of that i wonder alan groused still resenting the manhandling then it would be a great fish that swims the worlds oceans and never knows rest mcgilliveray intoned if one cannot find peace then one will try to run everything to ones own satisfaction in the search for peace how much better are my people who live so close and snug to each other in a great family we know want but we share equally not like you who store up food and wealth from each other and let other men of your kind starve or beg if our clan or town is rich in food we all eat well if there is little we all starve together and pray that we have lived well so that the great spirits and the perfect spirits of the deer people bear people and fish people may come to our hunters and help us by giving us their lives if a man was starving back in your london and he came to your door would you send out a slice of your roast beef to him i do not think you would sir to you all is property and goods you are a christian yourself church of england and damned proud of it sir so many of your people say that but they do not really believe in their crucified son of god not in their hearts and which god do you serve with your little bag mcgilliveray asked with the smugly superior tone of anyone who thinks he is more righteous than the next its a good luck charm from a young lady of my acquaintance alan had to admit sheepishly one of her servants made it to keep me safe from drowning and such not even representative of any god then how sad what is in it do you know no i dont and whats in yours alan asked my personal medicine then please be so good as to leave mine alone in future alan spat mcgilliveray glared and trotted toward the head of the column bet the wesley brothers would love you alan muttered to himself once mcgilliveray had gotten far enough off thinking how absurd it was to be discussing theology with a cambridge man in breechclout and scarifications with his bare arse waving about in the breeze at the evening stop not half a days march from the second lake where they would find mcgilliverays tribal towns alan took a tour of his men seeing to it that they were bedded down comfortably and had a hot meal some of the seminolee had put up some birds and nailed them with their insubstantial cane arrows tipped with fish bones or tiny flints there was sofkee a hominy meal mush a soup or stew of the birds succotash of sweet corn kernels and beans and cool clear water to wash it down the men had been issued a small measure of rum liberally mixed with water to have with their meal and the seminolee had crowded round to take a taste though mcgilliveray was leery of the practice and warned all not to share more with them ere ya go mister lewrie sir cony said dishing up a bowl of sofkee with some of the gamebird stew ladled over it hit aint bad really better eatinn we got in the chesapeake sir an i got yer rum ration laid by sos the seminolee wont notice youre a wonder cony alan said sitting down crosslegged on a piece of sailcloth by a crackling small fire with the other officers mcgilliveray was at another fire with the seminolee stuffing food into his mouth with one hand and talking with the other pipes were going on all sides though it was a rough blend cowell stated well no ones turned into mad foaming bears yet from rum cashman said though i wouldnt mind much one is struck by how much progress we have made cowell said smiling while perched on a fallen log for a seat it has all fallen out pretty much as young desmond said it would the apalachee were friendly and now so too are the seminolee giving us an escort and all there is that cashman replied laughing softly and the fact that we still have our hair and our livers if one approaches people in a friendly open manner captain with something of value that they desire as a prize for good behavior what else could one expect cowell sniffed in the firelight he looked in his indian garb much like some haggard bridge troll from a nursery story we have not given offense have we no but other white men before us have and theyre not the sort to forget easily or forgive cashman commented between spoonfuls of victuals theres still the possibility that someone might be tempted to knock us off for our arms and the goods we carry and the devil with the rest of the shipment they have no concept of time of waiting for things promised when they can get half a loaf now for your information these seminolee are going with us to the creek town cowell told them to get a share of the spoils yes and to visit indians either fight or feed you if you show up on their door step some of them have second wives among the muskogee theyve sent for their mikkos to come parley and they let desmond know that his own mikkos are pretty much together at the main town ahead of us its some game they play an annual contest of some importance to them so parliaments been called to session and its cambridge fair alan offered for a jest it would appear so lieutenant lewrie cowell replied stiffly still on the outs with his naval commander i shall be glad to get there put on a decent suit and get out of these rags and spend a night under a roof no matter how exotic and exciting this journey of ours is i must own to being unused to such discomfort we did have a roof over our heads last night cashman pointed out that was about all though ill grant you the seminolee had erected a temporary fishing camp replete with structures they called chickees open platforms raised several feet off the ground and open to the night winds and any flying insects with a thatched roof to keep off the rain mcgilliveray told them sleeping so high off the ground discouraged snakes that would otherwise crawl into their bedding for warmth and made the leap too far for fleas either way either the mosquitos or the tiny biting gnats had gotten to them for they all itched and had broken out in rashes desmond tells me that as honored guests and ambassadors we shall probably be quartered in the town house cowell went on if the visiting mikkos have not already taken it their winter meeting hall im told very solid and snug much like an irish sod house i think god pity us cashman said grinning all fleas and no whiskey mcgilliveray came back from the seminolee fire circle to join them and sat down gracefully in a crosslegged position if you have finished supper you might wish to try a short parley with the seminolee with me sir their raven is not very influential but you will do great honor to sit with him and smoke a pipe or two hes gaining note as a warrior and as a great man sure to lead a chiefdom in future that sounds eminently sensible thank you desmond i shall cony and andrews came in from the dark carrying large bundles of spanish moss which they had harvested from the nearest trees to make a soft mat for bedding and mcgilliveray smiled for the first time that day i wouldnt if i were you gentlemen dont sleep on moss why alan asked having used some the night before to make a pallet there are tiny red bugs that thrive in the moss like very small lice mcgilliveray told them they can hardly be seen but they drive people mad from the itching i was wondering what gentlemens companions had gotten to us cashman said and cony and andrews dumped the stuff immediately and began to wipe their arms and chests down once we get to the town i can give you some grease to make them leave you but for tonight i am afraid you shall have to scratch he frowned did you use some last night im sorry i should have told you there is so much to know and so much of it comes naturally to me that it slipped my mind entirely we could take a dip and scrub them off i have some soap alan offered not at night mcgilliveray gasped the watercougar he paused and pouted at his own reaction its safer to avoid the water after dark you cant see the snakes until you stumble upon them what a country alan snapped exasperated and now itching fit to feel the need to scream damme i started out being terrified of being gutted and scalped and now im more scared of dropping my breeches after dark than i am of these mangy pagans he thought it is good country even so cowell said look at these fine meadows just waiting for herds to graze them think of the crops that could be raised in this rich soil forests enough to build fine homesteads it is a fine country sir mcgilliveray echoed but who is to do this farming and cattleraising our people like having wild land around them land no one uses except for hunting and fishing do not forget that one of our aims is to reach some sort of accommodation with our respective peoples the lands are just as rich to the east on the other side of apalachee bay you mean this would revert to indian land cashman asked there are swamps and rivers running north and south to the east the new american colony of georgia to the north mcgilliveray pointed out if my people and the seminolee are to be your barrier to future expansion here in the south by the rebels we must determine where the creek seminolee and others can live in peace with secure borders why cant we live together alan asked trying his hand at politics it would be good for your people would it not when has it ever been good for indians to live cheektojowl with europeans lieutenant lewrie mcgilliveray asked sadly do you but think back on the history of relations between us since the first colonists slaughter misunderstandings indians displaced from their ancestral lands by usurpers we shall never understand each other you think in terms of property to buy and sell my people own everything and nothing our ways are so different your people slave to make a living put up houses to last hundreds of years while my people do with so little and all we have is impermanent taking only what we need we are clean in our personal habits of bathing each morning but wear the same single tradegood clothing until they wear out and have no need for more just to have something to prove we are wealthy as you do i saw your sea chest aboard ship sir you carry a lifetimes worth of goods for your comfort i and any of my people could gather his lifes possessions in a single sack and feel rich well alan began but cashman shushed him with a nudge perhaps sometime in the distant future there will be good relations between us but until then it would be best if someone could say here is indian land this side of this river no whites but traders and missionaries go there here is where indians do not go we creeks and the seminolee know our borders to the north where upper creek territory starts and the upper creek know where cherokee land begins to the west of here are chickasaw choctaw natchez if white men come among us here there is nowhere for us to go if rum comes among us as trade goods we lose respect for our mikkos and mischief comes down with the thunder boys we cannot be with you and stay a people if you need us and truly want to live in peace with us you must realize this if you want us to take the arms and fight your enemies for you then you must let us live our own ways on our own lands to keep our lands and our ways we need your support and your arms your soldiers close by but what about the smaller tribes already here cashman asked the spanish and the french have already destroyed them mcgilliveray said they could move to the indian territories if they do not like living among the rebels or the british people in small groups can always find a home in another tribe easily and if there is land that you want then the upper creeks the lower creeks and the seminolee tied by trade treaties supported by british arms can make war on the smaller tribes with you the alabama biloxi kosati and some of the tribes along the coast west of here toward pensacola and the mouth of the mobile there are fewer swamps along the coast if we march together you take certain lands and we take certain lands making sure we have good borders you get what you want and we get what we want when the rebels come across the mountains as they will they will put pressure on the cherokee and the small tribes in georgia who will be forced to move onto our lands but if my people have strong allies who will march to our aid and give us weapons we can say no to them an indian kingdom cowell said having heard the argument before we join hands with sultans and rajahs in the east indies so this would give heart to the cherokee to hold onto their land to come parley with england for the same sort of help and you already help the iroquois league north of them a solid barrier all along the great river mississippi west of the mountains where the rebels live been my experience with sultans that theyd rather fight among themselves than eat cashman stated a trifle dubious then bring officers among us white officers and sergeants to lead us to teach us like the east india company raises native units mcgilliveray urged getting excited bring teachers to help us develop our own books printed in muskogean do you know just how big this continent really is captain how far it stretches to the other ocean it would take a thousand years to fill it up with people think of indian regiments who could help you take it and hold it think of future wars with the rebels and how the people east of the mountains could be defeated with our help not just as irregular scouts and raiders but as a field army like germanic and gallic auxiliaries who supplied the cavalry to imperial rome and how barbaric were the germans to the romans at the time as barbaric as we appear to your burgeoning empire now gad alan exclaimed getting dizzy at the thought of it is that what we could start wed go down in history famous as anybody it is indeed lieutenant lewrie cowell said so soberly that even in his ludicrous togs he looked as impressive as any togaed senator of old rome himself so you see why desmond and i were so worried that neither of you seemed very involved in it and have altered our carefully laid arrangements had we been told sir it would have made a difference cashman replied did you discuss this hope with lieutenant colonel peacock with alans admiral we were not able to make either of them privy to all our goals damme mister cowell we shouldve landed a regiment and come ashore with a band stead o this ragtagandbobtail i didnt even bring my regimentals with me alan left his uniform behind from now on would you please consider us in your plans stead o keepin it to yrself i give you my solemn vow that from this instant you shall be thoroughly informed and involved in our deliberations captain cowell said giving them a satisfied smile but do you see the implications of our embassy to the most powerful southern tribes not simply correcting a fiscal mistake which reduced subsidies when the war began if we had continued financial aid the creeks and seminolee would have stayed on with us instead of staying neutral and we would have had the force to retain florida and georgia come the devil himself against us god willing it is still not too late to recover this region and in the process establish a fairer more productive and peaceful relationship between all indians and all europeans throughout the americas one that shall put to shame near on two hundred and fifty years of the way we have dealt together the rebels are married to the old ways while our new colonists to a renascent british florida untainted by misconceptions of the past can adjust to the new order of things and i would not worry much about making a grand show mcgilliveray chuckled along the great lakes the th regiment wears iroquois garb as part of its fulldress regimentals captain my people have seen grand embassies before and they all led to nothing what we bring is more important than how well you dress for them as i remember i saw a painting in london just before we left a very famous soldier portrayed in part hindu garb part ragtagandbobtail as you put it he was clive of india would you gentlemen like to be known to history as famous as clive he won england a doorway to india you could win england the rest of north america chapter chapter alan had not known what to expect when they got to the indian town at best a cluster of chickees straggling along the lake shore but what greeted him was a frontier fortress across nearly a mile of bottom land thickly sprigged with new corn stalks twined with vines laden with quickening bean pods row upon raised row of plantings mixed with gourds and squash plots of other vegetables and fiber plants he had never seen cultivated before there was a huge town surrounded by a tall log palisade with watchtowers every fifty yards or so and gates cut into the walls with guardtowers alongside them mcgilliveray informed them that this chiefdom the white town held land about a mile and a half in depth into the forests from the shore of the lake and ran for over six miles east and west in pride of place mcgilliveray mounted a magnificent seminolee horse and rode at the forefront of their column with cowell at his side now turned out in a bright blue silk suit as neatly as if he were taking a stroll along the strand alan cashman and their troops followed in two columns somewhat uniform in their forest green shirts and breeches or slop trousers seminolee brought up the rear leading the pack animals yipping and curvetting their mounts to show off just like the romans cashman said as they passed through the gate into the town proper a fightin mound just behind the gate with another palisade you see bends us to the left youll note between another long mound opens up our weapons side to arrows and puts our shield side on the left where it wouldnt do any good itd take a light artillery piece to force an entry here if you could get close enough to unlimber under the fire o those towers nacky bastards just as long as we get safely out alan replied looking at all the indians who had congregated to watch their arrival goddamn kit do you see em look at all those bouncers will you not one stitch on above the waist oh jesus im in love with thatn there never let it be said you let a solemn moment cramp your style cashman drawled you conquer what you want and ill conquer what i want i doubt the royal academy would hang that sort of heroic portrait of you in ranelagh gardens besides if you keep ogling all the girls your men will get out of hand set an example cashman ordered for now at least eyes to your front alan barked over his shoulder the street they paraded was wide as any in london wider than some in paris lined with what seemed to be a definite pattern of buildings there was a fence of sorts surrounding each plot an insubstantial thing of dried vines and cane behind each fence was a twostory wood house much like a chickee with plaited mats hung from under the eaves some open and some closed a more substantial house of thickly woven cane walls daubed with mud sat in each plot along with one two or three smaller outbuildings and each plot featured a home garden of some kind but grand as it looked the place was rough on the nose they might bathe every morning alan thought but something stinks to high heaven it smells worse than london thats for sure the plots were laid out in a rectangular pattern so many of the plots to each he was forced to call them town blocks with narrower lanes leading off at right angles from the main thoroughfare up ahead was an open area and what looked like a gigantic plaza raised several feet above the towns mean elevation upon which sat a large wattle and daub structure and beyond it a collection of opensided sheds beyond that there seemed to be a war going on several hundred creek warriors were whooping and storming from one end of the plaza to the other all waving some kind of war club and flowing like waves on a beach swirling left and right in pursuit of something it had to be some ritual war alan decided by the way the clubs were raised on high and brought down on the odd head now and then the shrieks and cries surged to a positive tumult as the mob congregated around a tall central pole the mayhem was so fierce he expected to see bodies flying in the air one thing that amazed their party were the many people who looked almost white compared to the runofthemill savage not just white men and women who might have gone native while on a trading venture but a great many scarified tribespeople who sported blue or green eyes blonde hair or other signs of european origin there were also lots of people much darker than average who appeared to have been sired by blacks or a few men and women who could be nothing but black once they stacked their goods by the winter town house and had a chance to look around cowell asked mcgilliveray about this phenomenon runaway slaves sir mcgilliveray said with a smile and men from the colonies who found our way of life more agreeable than slaving for a harsh master or the army or deserters run from a kings ship alan asked possibly mr lewrie mcgilliveray laughed at ease among his favorite kind captives taken by war parties too our life is hard make no mistake of that but it is much less hard than white mans ways there are many captives who eventually prefer to stay when given the chance to escape talk to them find out for yourself every child wants to play indian but no indian child wants to play white man or go willingly to live among your people the ball game will go on for hours yet i shall go find my mothers people and tell her we are here you rest here in the shade do not raise your hand to any man or give any offense i warn you now keep your goods safe in the center of your group and dont wander too far you are safe so there is no call to brandish weapons i swear it one thing though he warned as he left dont show any liquor until you are safely housed there was nothing for it but to gather their boxes and chests together and use them for furniture they sat in the welcome shade and fanned flies some of the men might have been tired enough from their marches to sleep but the swarming activity of a whole town full of savages kept them awake and near their weapons the creeks walked by without a care in the world laughing and pointing to the white party now and then calling out what seemed to be friendly greetings some scowled at them and made threatening gestures from a distance but the white town was supposedly according to mcgilliveray a place of sanctuary and peace where grudges could not be acted out we should have waited outside the town walls until tomorrow cashman finally mumbled almost asleep why is that sir cowell asked were bein made to wait sir cashman said coolin our heels in the anteroom best they got their damned game over and been ready to receive us at once with no excuses we lose authority by being kept waitin like this devilish shabby way to treat an embassy desmond knows best surely cowell complained oh perhaps he does sir cashman grunted too sleepy to argue about it he pulled a pipe out of his pack and started cramming tobacco into it hullo an indian boy said coming up close to them while cashman got out his flint steel and tinder for a light the child was only about five or so as english in appearance as any urchin on a london street hello yourself cashman grinned and whered you spring from here before alan prompted not too terribly fond of children but willing to be friendly as long as he had to be before when before you came here tallipoosa town the boy said pointing north before you were a creek alan asked in belly the child grinned widely what is creek muskogee cashman said me muskogee the boy crowed proudly a youngish white man in breechclout and head band came over to them and spoke to the boy in muskogean he botherin you sirs not at all sir cashman smiled now puffing on his pipe i was askin him what he was before he was muskogee hes always been the man replied squatting down in their circle crosslegged fetching out a pipe of his own this one part of a tomahawk he had in his waist thong cashman shared his pouch of tobacco with him ah tis grand this is sir the genuine virginia article beats kinnickkinnick it does thankee kindly now what would be bringin a english officer into these parts an embassy to your mikkos cashman allowed grudgingly and cowell woke up enough to huff a warning to keep their business close to their chests not seen english about since fort st george went under down to pensacola in the man said having trouble with his english from long disuse and how did you know hes an officer fellow alan asked same way i knows you are sir the man beamed with good humor i was a soldier meself back fivesix year ago at mobile i run off not much you gonna do about that is there sir enjoy your honorable retirement sir cashman said laughing lazily good life among the muskogee is it bettern fair sir i was once called tom now im part of the muskrat clan me names red coat got me a muskogee wife and the boy ocourse so whats the life like red coat cashman drawled oh injun men work sir dont let nobody tell ya differnt tomred coat allowed with a shrug got to hunt fish build things now an agin keep a roof over yer heads food in yer belly help with the harvests though the wimmen tends the fields fight when tother tribes stirs up a fuss say you wouldnt be havin no rum ner whiskey would ya sir clean out of it im afraid tom cashman frowned you bringin guns an powder looks like tom observed keenly want the muskogee to do some fightin fer yas with galvez over to new orleans with nigh on four thousand men garrisons at mobile and pensacola and patrols all over these parts tis a wonder ya got this far and thats a fack they brung five thousand outa havana when they took pensacola and thats not two days march from here were devilish fellows tom cashman grunted whats odds we get put up in this long house here wouldnt hold me breath on that too many mikkos in from the tall timber seminolee too who brung ya this far had to be a injun guided ya white turtle cashman said finally after playing with his pipe to exchange glances with cowell white turtle hey hes pretty well connected must be somethin powerful important then tom speculated might get put up with the wind clan and greeneyed cat hey sure ya dont have no whiskey i could come round later on the sly like sos the bucks dont get a nose of it i palaver muskogean powerful good sir ya might find me a useful man sos ya dont make anybody mad if yer gonna stay a spell be yer interpreter an such that might be worth talking about cashman nodded slowly i cant promise anything mind winks as good as the nod sir i get yer meanin i go he knocked the dottle out of his pipe crushed it between his fingers hot and stuffed it into a small beaded pouch and stood up oh by the way sir tell yer friend in the pretty suit not ta sit on his knees like a woman they been laughin at him they has sit crosslegged like a manr hell not be welcome at the council thank you tom gday to you then insufferable person cowell sniffed shifting his seating position with a groan an admitted deserter you heard him say it with a smile on his face still he might be useful mister cowell cashman shrugged we have desmond what need do we have for him desmond cant be with us all the time sir cashman said and well not always be together as a party not if were to bathe and do all the things he suggested to ingratiate ourselves from what ive seen so far there may be more of his type about this town willing to give us a bit of advice or translation for a sip of rum or two remember what lewrie said about our men and the native women its bound to happen and desmond doesnt seem willin to help in that regard neither do i sir cowell sniffed it is not our place to be topping their women you and lewrie should issue strict orders that we are to concentrate on the task at hand and eschew their favors one thing ive learned in the army mister cowell is never be stupid enough to issue an order ive no hope of enforcin what should we do raise the crossbars and have one of lewries men fashion a cat o nine tails thatll make the indians eager to join hands in our endeavor wont it if we have to flog our men to keep em chaste when in rome do as the romans do i believe you said not too long ago sir alan stuck in and who better to steer us in the proper course than a roman sure there are a dozen former europeans from where i sit right now you can spot em for yourself if youve a mind i wouldnt mind knowing as much as we can learn from them our men will want to leave the group now and then or we piss in squads by the numbers out in the weeds best we had some willing guides i say hmm you may have a point at that cowell finally agreed they were finally ensconced late that afternoon in one of the enclosed lots not too far from the central plaza given what mcgilliveray told them was an unused winter house belonging to his mothers family the house was snug a rectangular building of wattle and daub with a roof that stuck out over the walls quite far the door was low about four feet high and the way in wound in an l to keep out cold winds it was dark and gloomy inside but for a small smokehole in the center of the roof and had it been cold enough to have need of a fire alan was sure that it would have been a reeking smoky hell there were beds around the margin of the floor space raised up off the ground about three feet to discourage insects and snakes snug enough cashman said after looking the place over we may keep our goods safe in here with just the one entrance i can see and were trapped in here if they turn ugly alan commented there is that but we could dig loopholes through the walls if we had need and the walls are thick enough to give some protection ill post a guard outside and one just inside the doorway just in case no fire in here not with all this powder would you be good enough to hang some of that sailcloth to separate our quarters from the rest alan and before its dark we might as well see to settin out a place to eat outside some firewood too that need was being taken care of though for several indian women were bustling about in the yard laying out woven cane or willowbark mats to sit upon laying a circular fire and fetching iron pots to do the cooking in some of them were rather attractive and it was all their party could do to keep their hands to themselves the whole clan seemed intent on an outdoor meal for several fires were already burning in the family compound and the village was full of drifting wood smoke as it got darker and other hutis as desmond termed them prepared their evening meal the streets beyond the insubstantial vine and cane fence palings were almost empty with only a few tribesmen wandering about on their way to supper with another group for the most part dogs and cats lay with their eyes aglow sniffing and licking their chops as meat sizzled over open coals and soups and stews bubbled and simmered it was a novelty for the troops and sailors to sit crosslegged on their mats before the fire while women did the cooking and fetching for them instead of the men doing their own kitchenwork ah mcgilliveray alan asked as he spotted a girl of more than usual comeliness who was smiling at him from across the cheery flames you were going to explain to us the difference between an unmarried muskogee woman and a married one and what the customs were these are safe enough lewrie their host announced they are my daughters oh damn any younger girl on my mothers side is my daughter to me no matter the relation and i address them that way there are no married women here except for the older ones directing things i adjure you make sure there is no question of force let things take their natural way or the offender shall regret it for what little life he has left if a man is favored there is usually no problem among the muskogee in other tribes they take a stricter view towards chastity they headed across the town for the edge of the lake before it got too dark to see and alan stripped out of his clothing to wade in chestdeep and wash the grit and sweat of the day from his body there was no soap to be had but it felt good i say mcgilliveray what are those things out there with the red eyes alan asked pointing east down the lake opposite the sunset alligators mcgilliveray replied damnably calm about it all still dunking and wringing out his long hair now you see what i mean about not going into the water at night damned if im staying out here then alan replied shivering despite the warmth of the water and the soft humid tropic eve he thrashed to the shore and swiped himself free of water with his hands you staying out there are you well youre daft if you are he turned around to reach down for his buff breeches and came face to face with an indian girl who had come down to the lake to fetch water for cooking in a ceramic pot she smiled at him he smiled at her with his breeches clutched over his groin it was a tough call as to which of the two wore less clothing she was clad in a woolly looking short skirt from waist to just above knees and her smile of course her breasts were high and firm her hair glossy ravenblack and tumbled about her face in two loose braids wrapped in deer fur exotic he thought inanely definitely exotic taking in the coltish slimness of her limbs the delicate taper of her torso to a narrow waist and the heartbreakingly lovely swell of her hips and buttocks her eyes almost swam open wider and wider as they stared at each other and her teeth gleamed pearlwhite in the gloom by god i hope youre not his bloody sister alan breathed she was as lovely a girl as he had ever seen her russet complexion so fine that even anne beauman was put to shame hey white turtle what do you say to a girl when you want to say hello mcgilliveray came out of the water and spoke to the girl who turned her head to look at him she muttered something back dropping her eyes and looking at the ground i can barely understand her cherokee a slave mcgilliveray said with a deprecatory sneer shes nothing shes damned handsome for nothing a slave war captive maybe or we traded for her from the upper muskogee or alabamas i saw her around the houses you can do better lewrie mustnt let the old school down all of a sudden mcgilliveray alan scoffed hello my dear and whats your name do you speak english what a daft question of course you dont alan he said thumping his bare chest alan you help me out will you mcgilliveray he rattled off something guttural and the girl looked down at her bare toes again and barely whispered a longer reply rabbit she is called mcgilliveray said turning to dress such as it was among her own people she was named bright mirror if i can understand her words cherokee cannot speak properly not a real language like muskogean if you want her there should be no problem she is a slave after all only loosely of the wind clan tell her i think shes lovely i think she knows that already she has to get back to help with the cooking or shell make the other women angry me alan he said stepping closer to her and thumping his chest again then he reached out and pointed at her you rabbit she said her name in muskogean gave him another bewitching smile and fetched a heavy sigh then spun around and trotted back to the town with her pot of water how old do you think she is mcgilliveray alan wondered as he began dressing at last eighteen or so more like fifteen or sixteen i should think might be careful with her cherokee women even married ones can bed with anyone they please and their husbands have to stand it such a thing is not done among muskogee any more than it is done among your people why is it that you sound remarkably like a vicar railing against pucks fair alan complained as he retied his waist sash over his shirt morals are important among my people unlike yours they made their way back to the fire circle and took their seats on the mats laid out for them alan remembering to sit properly crosslegged though it was uncomfortable to him within moments food was delivered to them there was venison enough to stuff an army hot from the spits sofkee and succotash flat rounds of cornbread piping hot from the stone baking ovens nice change from salt meats he noted wishing he had a bottle of burgundy to wash things down with cattle and pigs have no souls mcgilliveray said they were not made by the great spirits but brought from over the ocean and are not good to eat will you cease your infernal carping alan griped fed up i am only trying to point out those things that you should know to better deal with my people during our negotiations sir mcgilliveray sniffed primly most whites have an abysmal ignorance of indian society which creates exactly the sort of misunderstandings we are attempting to correct if i seem to be partial to my mothers people over what you think is your socalled superior white civilization then i own to that partiality gladly i think indian life is more caring of the individual of the earth and the gifts we may take from it we live in harmony with nature you plow it flat create your parks and gardens and call it nature a little less of it please sir cashman sighed our minds are quite overwhelmed already dont ye know give us a rest eh mcgilliveray got the hint and directed his conversation solely to mr cowell after that or to the various indians who had condescended to eat at their fire for cowells edification alan tucked into his supper with a strong appetite not without casting his gaze about to see if he could spot the cherokee girl named rabbit and he finally saw her off in the dark tending a cooking pot at another fire where the women had done their work and were now taking their own victuals she sat a little apart from the accepted creek maidens and was not included in their conversations except to be directed to fetch something now and again but when left to her own amusements he was gratified and thrilled to see how she looked up and met his gaze with a fawnlike trusting smile of welcome and when his plate looked to be empty she rose quickly and brought a platter of smoking venison to refill it kneeling down before him gracefully and playing flirtatious looks at him from beneath her downturned face by firelight she gleamed copper and when she leaned close she smelled fresh and clean and foresty was the only term he could think of looks like youve made a conquest alan cashman said giving him a nudge i certainly bloody hope so alan agreed not taking his eyes off her rabbit he whispered and gave her his best smile ah arhlan she attempted in a voice so soft he was not sure his ears werent playing tricks on him then she was gone back to her fire stifling a girlish giggle and looking over her shoulder at him after supper there were pipes to be smoked while the women gathered up the cookware alan noted that they had been served off tin or pewter with only rarely a wellcrafted native pot or dish being seen although some indians ate with their hands there were a lot of spoons and knives in evidence to dip into pots or spear a slice of meat with more wood was laid on the fire in a circular pattern spiralling outward from the center and some powdered tobacco was cast into the flames which were already redolent with cedar and pine resins the night was now fully dark and the sky was ablaze with stars above the swirling motes of sparks from the fires the air was still humid but cool and pleasant on the skin best we turn in early cowell finally said his eyelids heavy after such a repast we shall have to bathe in the morning and then attend the squareground council while all the mikkos are still here twill be a busy day for us gentlemen andrews alan called to his senior hand bed your people down aye sah come on lads you be needin anythin sir cony asked no you turn in cony aye aye sir alan sat by the fire a while longer puffing slowly on a pipe to develop the knack of doing so killing time as the others drifted away he looked over to the other fire and saw that the cherokee girl was the last one left given the task of tidying up for her betters wheres the necessary closet in these climes mcgilliveray back in the woods if you must be sure to dig a small hole and bury it when youre done and dont use just any leaves some of the plants cause painful rashes ask the girl for some dry corn husks he rose to his feet and wandered over to the other fire bent down and picked up some husks while she sat on her knees and looked up at him he walked away into the darkness at the back of the compound where it butted up against some trees and bushes a few minutes later he stumbled his way back towards the fire and she was there stepping out from between some corncribs and small storage huts in the darkness he stopped and stood very near to her and she turned sideways to the fitful light from the fire the light accentuated her wide and high cheekbones the sparkle in her brown eyes and the way her skin shone he put out a hand gently not knowing what the custom was and stroked her arm with unaccustomed shyness she stepped up to him and pressed her slim body to his looking up into his eyes from her short stature about five feet and no more those magnificent young breasts brushed his shirt driving him mad he slipped an arm about her waist and she leaned into him rubbing her loins against his with a lazy circular motion her face was close to his chest and her breath raised gooseflesh as she inhaled him and gently blew air on his skin he bent to kiss her and she leaned back unused to the custom but gave him another smile to let him know that all was still well he took her hands and she dragged him back between the corncribs out of the light where they could embrace fully and he could stroke that incredibly firm but downy body he placed his lips on her shoulder and she writhed in delight his searching hands found her breasts and lifted them rubbing his workhardened palms across her large dark nipples and they sprang erect and shivery to his touch he bent down to kiss and tongue them and she shuddered and gave a small yip of glee he showered kisses along her upper body across her nose and cheeks and brushed his lips against hers fleetingly working slowly at finally bringing their mouths together and this time she was not startled but brought her face up to his her mouth slightly open as she discovered a new thing her breath went musky and her scent of arousal wafted over his senses as he groped a hand under her loose skirt to stroke her firm young buttocks she reached away from him and fumbled with the latchpeg to one of the corncribs and drew him into the dry moldysmelling structure where they sank to the mats on the earth in between large cane baskets of kernels he kicked the door shut and undid the buttons of his breeches they rolled back and forth first one atop then the other as he fought his way out of his clothing and his hands found the way up between her slim thighs to press against her belly there was very little hair at all when his fingers found an entry to her body and it drove him even more insane with wanting her she rolled onto her back and raised her legs about his waist reaching down to touch his member and gave a gasp as her fingers wrapped around it drawing it to her belly and stroking the tip against her swollen clitoris she bit her lower lip and cried out softly as her namesake before he lost all control and forced himself against her she was incredibly moist yet almost too snug to take his first thrust and for a moment he thought it would end right there as he struggled to enter her fully he tried thinking of the exact wording of the articles of war an act for amending explaining and reducing into one act of parliament the laws relating to the government of his majestys ships vessels and forces by sea he gasped as she writhed up at him lifting her legs around his chest and spreading them wider to allow him easier entry her fingers were digging into his shoulders and she was moaning with total abandon by then whereas the several laws relating to the sea service made at different times and on different occasions have been found by experience not to be so full so clear so expedient or consistent ah jesus god almighty what a snugun you are but finally he was completely within her and forced her to lie still for a moment by putting all his weight on her to hold her down before she bucked him off after a halfminutes pause in the proceedings he began to thrust gently into her and lifted himself up to allow her to move she clung to him like a limpet grunted and puffed and met his every thrust squeezing his member like a firm handshake until finally she cried out and mewed in pleasure and he followed her into bliss except for a few times during the night when she had to run her errand to check the cooking fire and keep it smoldering they were in each others arms napping lightly now and again but mostly going at it like a pair of stoats in heat for one so young she was expert as all hell and eager to meet his every desire as he was hers they did not share a single word in common but they giggled and teased and tried to talk between their waves of passion alan finally dropped off for what seemed an hour or so and then she was nudging him rolling over on top of him and molding her maddeningly lovely body to his for warmth in the grey predawn light of a foggy morning arhlan she whispered kissing him go she exhausted her tiny vocabulary of english words and lapsed back into creek or cherokee he had no idea which rabbit he sighed wrapping his arms around her with his eyes still shut soft rabbit bunny boony she mocked soft you say soft soff like these he said brushing her deer fur braids soft soff she repeated nodding to show she understood at least the sense of what he was saying soft rabbit you soft rabbit soff rabt she parroted arhlan go she made a gesture and touched her chest see you tonight yes she gave him a smoldering kiss and knelt to wrap on her skirt he got into his clothes and staggered outside into the thick mist of a riverbottom dawn almost unable to find the winter house for a moment people were already stirring at least from the indian side of the compound while a soldier nodded on guard before the low fire of the night before morning sentry he said to alert the man before he jumped up from his nap and shot him mornin sir the man leaped to his feet like a signal rocket anyone else up nossir not yit sir a minute later while alan stood there yawning and stretching the kinks of toolittle sleep on toohard a ground mcgilliveray came out of the winter house good you are up we go to the lake and take bath wake your people if you please theyre not going to be awfully keen on it mind alan told him its barely past first sparrowfart and the waterll be cold as charity we agreed mister lewrie mcgilliveray carped like a tutor who had caught him scribbling in the margins of his books again alright alright he said leaning into the house and duckwalking through the low entrance wakey wakey lash up and stow show a leg show a leg all hands on deck after being pestered to death by heartlessly cheerful bosuns mates chanting that dreadful tune aboard ship for years it did his spirits good to finally get a chance to use it himself hmm just as good i said show a leg he thought that part was to determine when the ship was out of discipline which occupant of a hammock or pallet on the deck was a hairy male liable for duty and who was a hairless mostly female doxy or wife who could sleep in and not be tipped out or roused roughly the hands had found their own arrangements with the creek girls during the night it seemed privacy be damned it had been dark enough inside the fireless winter house to allow everyone willing to enjoy a grope on the raised cots the chance to do so and several cackling young women made their way outside leaving their men to grumble their way awake outside and down to the lake lads alan called with false cheer into the water for a dip before breakfast i know i know but the indians do it so we have to as well long as were here nobody ever died of a little less dirt lets go ah fook tindians someone groused in a whisper you already have so lets get down there and see how pretty the rest of em are with their clothes off it amazed him that sailors could get soaking wet during a turn on deck could kneel and scrub with holystones and bibles every morning and revel in the sluicing of a washdeck pump but would turn their noses up to anything that smacked of getting wet on purpose they stripped reluctantly covered their privates with a sudden surge of heavy modesty and waded into the water an inch at a time yipping and shying as the coolness crept up their bodies alan walked out wincing with chill but determined not to make a sound feeling the soft lake bottom ooze between his toes stumbling now and then on a twig or reed on his unprepared soles damn fine show though he thought taking in the view indians of every stripe and condition were splashing into the water the children yelping and making great waterspouts as they dove in men congregated to one end of the bank women much further down and the negotiating party about midway between far enough away from the females so they would not enrage a wet husband please sir kin we get out now sir one of the men said shivering with cold his arms wrapped around his chest scrub dunk and get the worst smuts off alan said staring at the dirt that was floating off the man scare the lice and fleas if nothing else get your hair wet it wont kill you aye sir the man sighed looking down at his own scum as if he expected to be drowned in three feet of water he held his nose and dropped out of sight to come up puffing and blowing a second later as if shot out of the water oh gawd he cried miserably hot breakfast waiting for us lads get dry and well eat alan came out of the water shivering like a dog he saw his girl trotting off towards the town to be the first to help with the cooking and he waved at her she stopped and waved and he blew her a kiss and she parroted his motion laughed then ran on to her neverending labors which raised a laugh out of his miserable crew at any rate gawd sir yer a ramcat sir and it didnt even cost tuppence alan boasted when in rome do as the romans do ive heard especially if they enjoy it chapter chapter the squareground where they assembled for their negotiations was a series of opensided sheds that faced inward towards each other like huge threewalled chickees elevated the usual three feet off the ground but with tiers of seats added which made them appear like the seats of a european theater the inevitable fire was burning in the center of the squaregrounds sandy expanse which had been trodden bare of weeds or growth a fire laid out in a circle that would burn from the outer spiral into the center alan could only assume that once the fire in the center burned out the talks were over for the day mcgilliveray turned up in a pale almostwhite deerskin shirt trimmed in beading and embroidery he led them to the eastern end of the council ground and sat them down on the front row of the tiered seats on the north side there he lectured thats where the warriors sit it is called the red shed the mikko and some of his second men sit on the west facing us with the principal chiefs in the center shed i thought the mikko were the chiefs alan commented no they are the chiefs principal ministers usually from one of the white clans dedicated to peace they are to run things evenly and keep order if things go badly they can be replaced without the hereditary chief being blamed politicians leaders of the commons alan speculated if you like it is an apt simile now to the south thats the sheds for the second men who brew the white drink and that is the white shed side and scattered on every side are the beloved men the beloved men are very old very wise whats the difference then desmond cowell asked second men are officers responsible to the mikko who see to the wellbeing of the tribe and of the settlement beloved men perhaps once were second men but they could have been great warriors or retired mikkos maybe members of the chiefs clan there are only a few of them held in such regard for their wisdom and good works at peace or war at any one time you see mcgilliveray said with that smug snootlifted expression of superiority that they had all come to know and love indian society is much more organized and thought out than is commonly known much like your own political systems it took a boresomely long time for things to get organized though with leaders and warriors and old codgers milling about and saying their hellos right and left delegations from other lower creek towns had to be seated and the touchy seminolee had to be given good seats finally a servant came from the south or white shed with a conch shell dripping with some hot liquid and presented it to the chiefs and mikkos on the west side crying out yahola the white drink mcgilliveray told them you must drink it so the council can be properly purified in spirit when the conch shell was refilled and brought round to them alan was repulsed by the smell of it and said so white drink mine arse its black as midnight what the hell is it liquid dung white men call it black drink it is a tea or a coffee if you will it is bitter but it must be drunk i told you now lieutenant will you please shut up and dont cause a reason to break off the talks mcgilliveray snapped lewrie you and cashman may run things military but this is my responsibility and if you cannot go along with us peaceably then you had best go back to the house now cowell uttered in a low growl mcgilliveray drank of it then cowell then cashman each keeping a grim set expression on their face at the taste the conch shell was presented to lewrie and he tipped it up cautiously damned if it didnt smell a little like coffee he allowed grudgingly it was hot and it was indeed bitter and it was all alan could do to screw up his mouth as though he had just bitten into a lime manfully done sir mcgilliveray whispered i still say it tastes like boiled turds alan whispered back i just hope i dont give way it is better if you do mcgilliveray instructed and when you vomit try to do it in a great arc far away from you you will impress them no end mine arse on a bandbox the white drink is very strong mcgilliveray whispered with evident signs of glee at alans discomfiture a physician would say that it is an excellent emetic and diuretic you will begin to sweat and you may feel the need to vomit since you are not used to it it clears the thoughts and stimulates the brain you see so that decisions are better thought out they will pass the shell all during the council oh good christ alan said as his stomach rolled over a pipe had to make the rounds after being presented to the east first then the other cardinal directions and more white drink was handed around at which point the actual negotiations began the mikko of the white town did not speak directly but passed everything through his yatika or interpreter cowell spoke for england and mcgilliveray acted as his interpreter as well voicing aloud what cowell said in a softer voice the council could have lasted hours alan didnt much care what they talked about or how long it took his guts were roiling and the vile taste of the white drink hovered just below his throat like some not so veiled threat just opening his mouth to take a puff on the pipe as it circulated was dangerous enough and the rough tobacco set his bile flowing with each puff he finally could hold it no longer sweat had been pouring off him in buckets and his clothing was soaked with it his heart thudded and his pulse raced worse than the most horrible hangover he had ever experienced gangway he finally said leaning forward in hopes the contents of his stomach didnt land in his lap and heaved there was a smatter of applause and some cheerful comments made at his production damme he gasped oh well shot sir mcgilliveray smirked id give you points for distance wish ya hadnt done that cashman grumbled through pursed lips and then it was his turn to cat like a drunken trooper they were rewarded with another of those infernal conch shells topped off with the latest batch of white drink cowell turned a delicate pale green color and sweated like a field hand soaking his elegant suit manfully trying to express his governments arguments between spasms this cant go on forever alan thought miserably eyeing the circular fire and willing it to burn faster so his agony would end oh burn damn you burn bet wed get what we wanted double quick if we could pass the port stead of this muck mercifully about three hours later the fire did burn down to the last stick of cane and the meeting broke up with the indians whooping in glee and heading for the gaming ground for another match of their favorite pastime went well cowell stated once they were back in front of their lodge sponged off and dressed in clean clothing did it by god alan sighed did you pay any attention at all sir cowell asked nothin after my first broadside im afraid he admitted well the gifts went over extremely well cowell said rubbing his hands with a satisfied grunt of pleasure at his dealings and their great warrior and his war chiefs the tustunuigi and the big warriors and all liked the idea of having lots of muskets and shot so we could get out of this dreadful place soon its not that simple i fear cowell went on desmond was correct in telling us that none of them have any love for european settlers living cheektojowl with them spanish or english the way weve treated them in the past you see if pressed theyd prefer the dons who leave them pretty much alone horrid thought isnt it if one wishes to make something of these climes with proper settlements and industry even peaceable that threatens them while those horrible spaniards who so slothfully siesta and stick to their few towns are preferable to us cruel as they have been in the past in new granada and new spain no what we offered this morning is so novel to their experience that it shall take days perhaps weeks of conferring god help us then alan sighed there is also the problem of all that we offer being anathema to some of them cowell went on relentlessly if they take arms with us let our missionaries and teachers come among them and agree to new treaty borders and all they fear they stop being creeks and become pale imitations of white men well whats wrong with that alan griped fanning himself with a broad splitcane fan the day was not that hot but the diuretic effect of the white drink still made his perspiration flow i mean given a choice of running naked through the woods like an ignorant savage or settling down and making something of myself i know which one id choose they see nothing good in our system you see cowell said with a sad shake of his head oh theyre more amenable than most indians who dont farm left to their own devices with trade goods in constant supply theyll have to become more like us eventually but remember those corn fields we saw hillrows of corn with squash and gourds and beans vining around them plows would do them no good and our way of growing corn would only exhaust the soil even of rich bottomland they have few needs for fancy clothing solid houses and such theyve taken to the mule and the musket the iron cooking pot and the pewter plate but they dont need us or our goods all that badly perhaps they may even go for wagons one day but i doubt it poor sad people cowell intoned mournfully doomed i think rum and whiskeyll be their downfall that and disease and they know it this town might as well be european the way its laid out alan countered so they dont have private property but instead hold the land in common that doesnt mean they cant do some minor adjusting to our ways to adjust is to die mister lewrie their only hope is to be so strong so unified against all comers that they can preserve their way of life taking only what is useful from our society and thatll never do theyre not unified yet nor are they strong enough militarily even with muskets and shot in plenty seems to me then that this mission of ours is a wasted effort alan said after a long silence following cowells remarks if you think theyre going to go under sooner or later they shall if they deal with the rebels solely cowell said with us as a counterpoise they have a chance to develop as a society thats what were offering beyond the immediate military alliance to retain british florida where would you draw the borders then truthfully i dont know cowell admitted that could be settled later once we get the region back and fill it with new settlers more amenable to their way of thinking and dealing but mister cowell if they dont like settlers close by them why should new colonists fare any better than the last batch alan pointed out and why should the new settlers be any fairer with them than before theyll need land and all the lands indian either that or turn indian like that fellow tom and give up on civilized ways men of good will and reason may find ways to accommodate with each other cowell concluded stubbornly his face aglow with conviction of the lightness of his purpose ah dinner i must own to having developed a devilish appetite one usually does when ones stomachs been emptied so thoroughly alan drawled sourly this is all moonshine alan told cashman later that day down by the shore of the lake it probably all is cashman agreed easily but its none of our worry we do our job of getting cowell and mcgilliveray here in one piece get the trade goods exchanged safely and thats that but what do you think of all that talk about a whole new policy of dealing with the creeks all this itll come to nothin cashman shrugged indiansll get the smelly end of the stick same as usual i even doubt well get the territory back but then nobody asks a soldier about diplomacy not even get it back best thing for all concerned is both us and the dons get kicked out cashman laughed at alans shocked expression who in his right mindd want the silly place give florida and the whole damned coast region from here to the mississippi to the indians its all bugs and flies and alligators not white mans country anyway if they want to live in it theyre moren welcome i say spain cant do anything with it least they havent shown signs of it yet we cant do anything with it either less we want to shove an army in here to hold it so much for becoming the new clive of india alan spat they had me goin there for a minute same as you i expect but once i had a chance to ponder it i realized its a forlorn hope at best cashman admitted stripping off his shirt to splash water on his face and neck to cool off no theres more profitable places just as miserable in the world we could do more with the far east india china could we get capetown away from the dutch wed be better off though i could get to like it around here if it werent for the rebels up north or so many bloody injuns down here if they were a little more civilized just a touch itd do fine for me go native alan mocked not a bit of it cashman chuckled look around here see how rich this soil is ever see cotton grown no the east indies and egypts full of it and its the coming thing now weve the waterpower looms and such back in england cashman enthused kneeling to scoop up a handful of dirt riverbottom land is the best place to grow it with long hot summers just like here id stake me out about a shires worth of land plant cotton and cut the distance from india to the mills in half bring some samboes from the east indies over to tend to it corn horses pigs cattle fruit sugar cane you name it and id farm it and while im about it id get me a regiment of sepoys from the far east to guard it no more english troops who die so fast in such a climate sikhs or mahrattas bengalis or lads from the coromandel coast theyre used to hot wet weather and sweat and one thing in their favor theyre civilized in their own fashion not like these swamprunners then youd see this land take off and flourish thats the way to become the new robert clive what about the indians then alan smiled thats their own lookout isnt it cashman replied theres plenty of streams and rivers alan said why not put your looms here then if youre going to bring over east indians do the whole manufacturing process in one place by god thats not such a bad idea alan cashman agreed look here even if the dons keep the place a man could do a lot worse than settin up in these parts cotton and flax together looms and mills dyeworks readymade beddings shirts everything right here even our own ships to transport the goods wed make thousands millions of pounds howd you like to be a landed gentleman with a fleet of merchantmen a big house grand as the bloody walpoles biggern st jamess if youve a mind sure its trade but given a choice of bein a poor gentlemanr a rich lowerclass tradesman id take rich any day bsides once youre nabob rich the gentlemenll catch your farts for you like you was royalty with a harem in the west wing alan laughed wed be so wealthy we could rotate em in platoons every month cashman hooted wouldnt take much to set up should it cotton and flax seed seedcorn from the creeks and were in business maybe only a few hindus at first just to get things started sepoysd work cheap as a private troop to guard the place god knows john company pays em little enough as it is what do ya say alan want in on it its tempting alan grinned at cashmans daydreams but were both impoverished no way we could settle here not the way things are its just as big a dream as cowells and more profitable in the long run ill do it somewhere in this world you see if i dont and when im ready ill get in touch with you and well do it damme if we shant right right every day for the rest of the week they suffered through the council meetings drank the white drink and threw up smoked pipes of kinnickkinnick until their tongues were raw and listened to the highpitched formal orations of the indian speakers as they wavered back and forth and all round the issue of whether to take up arms and help drive the spanish out of florida some wanted no dealings with white men on any terms and could not have cared less if all the colonists from louisburg to st augustine got in their ships and sailed back where they came from some wanted to take the guns and stomp on the cherokee and chickasaws there were questions about why the british didnt bring their troops and run out the rebels up north or take on the spanish themselves it was maddening that any indian of substance or reputation no matter how lunatick his ideas could get up and speak for hours raising inane irrelevancies which would have to be thrashed out completely before they got back to the main point and cowell and his officers learned chiefs and mikkos could not just decide and get on with business they had to form a consensus of all parties involved which took time to wear each other down until they were tired of arguing and gave in alans only consolation was to borrow a horse from mcgilliverays clan and go for a ride around the settlement during the afternoons or ride soft rabbit in the corncrib after supper while he could not get his tongue to work around the guttural muskogean words he did have some success in teaching her some english and showed her a few tricks he had picked up from whores he had known back in london the days she spent doing the heavy chores for her owners were galling to him and he had to own to a growing affection for her and her ways she was sweet and modest in public demeanor sweet and passionate in private with an almost insatiable lust once the crib door was kicked shut for the night since he had so little part in the creek council he napped through most of the negotiations or part of the afternoon before supper it was the only chance for shuteye that he got how she ground corn fetched and toted water and firewood skinned and dressed hides and cooked during the day and then rogered all night and awoke fresh and full of energy amazed him after a few more boresome days spent heaving for the amusement and edification of the muskogee alan finally called a halt and went hunting with his men who had been growing restless for some time english lads from the country did well enough to fill the pot and the exsoldier tom went along to teach them some woodscraft they returned with several deer one of them alans that he had hit with his fusil at seventy yards he was damned proud of his shot through thick brush and was looking forward to eating the bugger alan cashman called as they entered the yard of the huti with their kills were out of here everyone finally give up he asked i say kit come take a look at this one shot just behind the shoulder and down he went like he was poleaxed alan stepped to the side of the horse that bore his kill to point out how well he had done damn the deer man they agreed cashman insisted to what actually if we give them the muskets and all the accoutrements they go to war on our side soons we land a regimentr two but we have to land the guns and munitions first i take it and show up with a fleet from jamaica and troops but its a start and no matter how it turns out we can get back to the coast and out of this place cowells pleased as punch with himself and i suppose mcgilliveray is trumpeting the apocalypse alan said smirking one blessing was that he had had much less to do with the man since he had started hunting by day and topping by night with soft rabbit on a good day he would only see him at the morning bath and breakfast and didnt have to put up with his pontificating more than an hour well hes mighty high in council now cashman told him not that he wasnt already i dont know if theyre all that keen on all his ideas about a creek alphabet and teachers and such but they finally saw the light about their future security we may leave tomorrow thank bloody christ alan exclaimed happily another week of this and my men would have gone native on me its been all i could do to keep my troops on their toes too then lets eat this bloody deer of mine to celebrate gad yes hes a bigun aint he nice shot for a sailor weve bagged enough to feed the whole town even the way they eat hell do for our mess and well share out the rest that ought to make the muskogee turn back flips the supper was very cheery and the smell of roast meat floated from every huti cookfire mcgilliverays muskogee relations ate with the white party in the yard between the winter house and the summer all smiles and laughter and singing so different from the usual stoic silence that alan had thought was normal for indians everyone seemed hellishly pleased with their newstruck bargain of support it was towards the end of the supper that one of mcgilliverays uncles on his mothers side came forward to sit before him on the ground and offer a pipe they smoked blowing the smoke to the cardinal points and talked back and forth in muskogean for some time apart from the others ah mister lewrie this concerns you i fear mcgilliveray said after the palaver was ended eh alan asked stuffed near to bursting and sleepy what the hell have i done now i havent offended them have i nothing serious mcgilliveray grinned and if mcgilliveray found it amusing alan was sure he wasnt going to enjoy it their dislike for each other by that time was hotly mutual but it seems rabbit the cherokee slave girl no longer has need to go to the womans house the womans house alan said with a dubious look missing the drift completely surely i dont have to lecture you on what it means when a girls courses cease sir mcgilliveray beamed happily what you mean shes pregnant that is exactly what i mean sir well so what then alan asked unable to believe it youre sure this isnt a jape shes really ankled i mean do i have to marry her or something it would help if you did mcgilliveray chuckled well im blowed damme if i aint alan gasped i mean whats the difference shes just a slave right shes my uncles property you see so that makes her part of his clan and of this huti this lodge mcgilliveray said obviously enjoying every minute of it he would be insulted if you ran off and left your get marriage doesnt mean much in these circumstances but it does preserve honor if you dont he cant sell her off and he might come looking for you mcgilliverays uncle a side of beef with a round moonface and a famous chief warrior gave alan a look as menacing as any he ever did see hell be stuck with a bastardly gullion a bastards bastard but the boyll be some kind of wind clan muskogee so hell do alright or her mcgilliveray insisted but were leaving tomorrow so simple really you shot that deer today go get a chunk of it now look here mcgilliveray this did i tell you my uncles name is mankiller mcgilliveray smiled sweetly oh holy hell alan looked to cashman who was as amused as any of the others around their fire laughing behind his hand and damn their black souls but andrews cony and the other seamen from shrike were nudging each other and grinning at him openly it doesnt mean a damned thing right i mean it doesnt really count does it even if she was properly muskogee it isnt official until the green corn ceremony in late summer and could be dissolved then shell gain status especially if you buy her from mankiller and he adopts her as a daughter afterward no more slavery for her then oh alright then alan sulked burning with embarrassment at how funny everyone else seemed to think his predicament was but he rose and fetched a large chunk of the deer from the roasting spits and brought it back to the firecircle this shows youre a man who can provide meat for her mcgilliveray said shell present sofkee and corn to you to show she can provide grain from the fields and cook it for her man now before she can be married you must buy her from mankiller there was much palavering with a rant about how mankiller had gotten rabbit in the first place how he had slaughtered with the best of them and taken her from a traveling party of cherokee hunting too far south of their mountain fastness even if he was a little too far north of his usual haunts poaching on upper creek lands alans bride cost him a dragoon pistol and saddle holster with forty premade cartouches of roundshot and buckshot two of his deer hides rabbit had already dressed one of his shirts and a leather cartouche pouch with george iiis ornate brass seal on the flap alan suspected that buying the mort wasnt strictly necessary since mankiller and mcgilliveraywhite turtle both seemed to be enjoying it so much but there wasnt much he could do about it so he went along sullenly once the purchase was done mankiller got to his feet and went on another highpitched formal rant which mcgilliveray translated into short pithy phrases now and again the upshot being that he didnt know much about this young white man but he would be considered of mankillers fire which seemed a grudging sort of honor short of actually becoming indian more specifically of the muskogee wind clan since everyone creek knew that they were the best people on the face of the earth and they wouldnt adopt just any upstart as a real person until he had proved himself a superior sort of being perhaps on par with a seminolee or apalachee who at least could speak something like muskogean mankiller also grudgingly allowed that since this strange white man had bought the girl rabbit from him at such a damned good knockdown price he would allow her to remain in the wind clan and in his lodge as daughter instead of slave after the white man went back where he came from so the offspring would be raised muskogee which mankiller thought would be the best for all concerned he didnt like the way white men raised their children anyway with all that spanking and beating which broke the spirit at least the little bastards going to be spared tutors and algebra alan sighed all through these preliminaries the indian women of the clan and the huti had gathered their sisters from the other hutis to witness the ceremony through it all they had yipped and whooped with delight eager as harpies discovering a newly slain corpse to feed upon finally they brought rabbit out she had bathed and drawn her raven hair back into a single long braid adorned with beads and a few feathers other than eagle she wore a new richly embroidered and beaded deerskin skirt a little longer than her usual style with a new upper garment much like a matchcoat or bedsitting coat tied under the arms which still left her right breast free how much ritual does it take for her to get ready alan asked as she was paraded before her new sisters of the wind clan id say this was arranged a long time before i heard about it well damn their pleasures i say more to the point blessins on yours alan cashman replied sobered by how lovely the girl was and by the solemnity of the moment no matter how absurd it was if they were forcin me to wed her id think myself lucky damn shame you cant take her with you when you leave tomorrow oh for gods sake alan groaned still she was tricked out right handsome even he had to admit that and had been fawnpretty before a way was cleared and she knelt down before him on her knees her eyes swimming with tears even as she beamed at him with happiness so open and adoring it silenced even the most cynical of his crew mankiller read the rites which were simple to the extreme he offered her the platter of venison and she took a bite to accept him she offered him a bowl of sojkee and an ear of corn still in the shuck which he tasted then she was allowed to come sit beside him and link arms with him pressing her young body to his side and gazing up at him in shuddering reverence now what alan asked putting an arm around her shoulders in spite of himself thats it youre married mcgilliveray said and mankiller and the women said pretty much amen or here here which raised whoops and shouts from all present give you joy of this day lieutenant lewrie go take your bride to your new home yonder its only a summer chickee but private enough i helped built it yesterday damn your eyes mcgilliveray alan said unable to do anything other than smile as people crowded around to congratulate the happy couple go forth be fruitful and multiply cashman called with an exaggerated bow though youve a fair start on that hey it was expected that the newlyweds would retire immediately and rabbit was almost dragging him so he finally allowed himself to be led off to a new and freshsmelling chickee back towards those fatal corncribs near the rear of the family huti they climbed up onto the matcovered floor and pulled the splitcane wall mats down for privacy almost before the last mat had fallen in place rabbit was on him like a ferret dragging him to the floor taking heed of her lessons in passionate deportment from alans earlier teachings she flung her arms about his neck and showered him with kisses babbling away softly and rapidly in cherokeecreekenglish all the while tearing at his clothes ahlan she crooned besotted with love and trembling with happiness at her freedom from slavery and at her marriage you me you are mine he corrected between kisses she practically ripped his breeches open and rolled to sit astride of him she took his left hand and rubbed it over her firm belly and purred like a very contented kitten stirring her loins against him baby he said bebby you me she parroted you ahr mine ours he said tapping her stomach god help me ahrs gohemmy she said beaming with tears of joy cascading down her smooth young cheeks and splashing on her upper garment and breast alan reached up and undid the knot that held the little matchcoat together and it fell away revealing both of those delightfully springy young orbs she slid further down his belly as his hands caressed her breasts and nipples and in moments her vagina was slick and moist on his skin she slid further down reached and found his throbbing member pressganged into marriage or not she was still a damned attractive and nubile young piece he decided she steered him into her and rocked back to drive him deep inside making them both gasp at the velvety pleasure of the first stroke of insertion and it was as good as the first time they had coupled in the comcrib just as full of wonder and discovery for her perhaps it was even better for she was fulfilling her lifes role as wife and mothertobe and her inspired exertions communicated inspiration to him there was no fire for her to tend that night no more errands to run for others now she was a freedwoman so they could exhaust themselves totally and fall asleep together she cuddled to him in the crook of his arm her head on his shoulder and one downy thigh flung across his belly her breath stirring soft against his cheek and neck every movement he made was responded to with an unconscious hug some little whimper of joy she woke once briefly sated beyond measure and only kissed him repeated his name and her few words of endearment in english and sank back into sleep in his arms alan woke just before dawn as it got a little chilly and drew a red trade blanket over them he looked down at her and snuggled to her cozy warmth worn down to a nubbin and barely awake savoring the last few minutes of closeness damme for a fool but this marriage nonsense dont feel halfbad right now he muttered long as its over today he thought being a daddy though that cuts a bit rough not that ill be around to listen to the little bastard bawl so thats not so bad feels good this in his entire experience with women he had rogered mopsqueezers and country girls tumbling with them in the dark at the top of the stairs across unmade beds or rolling behind a hedge in the summers at the edge of a field all quick and furious he had lain at ease with whores between bouts of the blanket hornpipe but for the life of him as he lay there gradually coming awake he could not actually remember sleeping with a girl usually his time was governed by being furtive or the commercial nature of the transaction on off and just where the hells my hat this though this closeness and peacefulness of being in bed with a woman who wanted you as much as you wanted her who smelled so good and intimate under the blanket who snoozed away so trusting in his arms and who would respond with affection to any sign of affection on his partwell this was something else again pity i cant take her with me he decided silently though it was a forlorn wish she would not fit in anywhere he went most especially aboard shrike it isnt that i really love her that much he thought but for now shes a sweet thing a girl with a good little heart as he came more awake and listened to the sounds of the creek town beginning to stir around their chickee he was filled with an outofcharacter sadness not just because he had to leave her behind and probably never see her again there was sadness regarding the whole indian way of life too from all that mcgilliveray and cowell had said there was little hope that the creeks could retain their ancient traditions the rebels who styled themselves americans now would press against the borders the rum and whiskey and trade goods would contaminate the old ways if there was unity of purpose for now between the creeks and seminolee and the fragments of other tribes then it would not last long and they would face their future uncoordinated prey to any outside aggression even if cowell and mcgilliveray could convince the shelburne government to commit troops and money to retake florida with indian help the indians would still wither away in the face of white civilization nibbled to death instead of going out in one brave battle there was no place for them to run no lands further west that did not already have owners they could survive by imitating white ways of living but at what a price and how much suffering and degradation and this dear little girl sleeping so soundly beside him would be doomed to be a part of it one of the losing side and god help him so would the child she carriedhis child nobody had ever come back on him with a bastard and a bellyplea for support so far anyway and he began to worry about what he might do what he might be able to leave behind some legacy or something of value to improve rabbits life and the childs life against the bad times to come god what a bloody mess ive made of things he thought railing against his nature if she wasnt pregnant i could ride out of here without a backward glance i think knowing our politicians theyll not want to put out a penny more than needed which means nothing cowell dreamed up will ever be put into action rabbitll be just another victim weve lied to oh shit if this is growing up and acting like an adult then i dont care for it thank you very much he clasped his arms tighter about her and she nuzzled to him deep in sleep her soft satinysmooth flesh warm against his maddeningly sensuous and comforting he breathed deep of her aromas of hair and flesh clean womansmell and hint of sweat the faint scent of their lovemaking her exotic muskiness of burned pine and loamy earth of deer hide and cooking native greases or oils with which she had been anointed for the marriage ceremony and the foresty smell of the chickee and the green wood and mats around them ahlan she cooed coming awake as he held her too tight dear little soft rabbit he whispered back brushing her cheek with his lips feeling an almost fierce desire to protect her from all that would come ahlan mine she said drawing his face down to her hot round breasts inside the blanket stroking his head and hair and making pleased noises as he sprang into sudden overful arousal willing as any bride for another proof of love before dawn she rolled onto her back and stroked his back drawing him between her open thighs in for the penny in for the bloody pound he told her with a shaky laugh one for the road old girl ahlan mine she giggled chapter there had been a lot more room in the boats on the journey back downriver the man tomred coat had come along just to see the coast region once more and get a share of rum most likely while the creeks and seminolee went overland with packhorses and mules the men from shrike were alone with their own kind for the first time in over two weeks and it felt odd not totally alone even so mcgilliveray still dressed indian fashion was with them and cowell in his new deerskin clothing and three of mcgilliveraywhite turtles younger male kin and their traveling girls and rabbit at the last alan could not bear to leave her and she could not bear to let him ride away on a spotted seminolee horse and never be with her new husband again and against his better judgement he had let her accompany him she rode as well as he did it turned out and she and the traveling girls did all the cooking for their party delaying the day the soldiers and sailors had to fend for themselves again not that he had minded the night on the trail or the night in a seminolee chickee at the lake where they had left their boats for she had left him wheezing after their passion she had never been in a real boat before but adjusted quickly and sat aft with him at the tiller of the twentyfivefoot launch treating the whole trip like a honeymoon jaunt and full of wonder at the life in the swamps which she had never seen and when cony or andrews fetched her an egret plume or some flamingo feathers she was as delighted as any miss just given a ruby bracelet the hands treated her as deferentially as they would have a proper officers wife and she had begun to feel like a queen or a chiefs bride you talwa she exclaimed after mcgilliveray had talked to her about what alan did in the royal navy not a chief dear alan laughed my captain is chief i am his mikko tell her mcgilliveray with soft rabbit by his side he felt charitable enough to accept the whole world even mcgilliveray and his ponderous lecturing and an imathla lubotskulgi mcgilliveray informed her to her great delight a little warrior too young to be an imathla thlukulgi a big warrior chief but he has killed many foes havent you lewrie how many do you think so that i may praise you to the skies to her well ive fought two duels cut one and killed the other with swords mind not pistols at twenty paces alan bragged damme maybe a dozen more in boarding melees most impressive and god knows how many with artillery alan concluded soft rabbit was thrilled that her man was such a bloodyhanded warrior and her awe of him which was already considerable went to new heights of reverence after mcgilliveray translated that to her she says she is honored to be the wife of such a brave young man and is sure that your son shall be a manslaughtering hector as well shell make sure of it mankiller will be his father and will teach him to be a warrior mankiller hell be her husband when im gone no you misunderstand its more important to muskogee who your mothers relatives are mcgilliveray went on happy to find an opportunity to preach the husband and father is not of the mothers clan where she shall live shes wind clan now a very important clan in our way of life and mankiller and all the males are her uncles so to speak and they fill the role of the father when it comes to rearing the child you are only of their fire anhissi which means friend what clan you are doesnt matter as long as you werent wind clan marrying into your own clan is a sin shell be welltreated wont she alan pressed do you really care lewrie mcgilliveray asked almost mocking him damme yes i do care he shot back putting an arm around her which she understood more than words and she came up from her pad of blanket between the thwarts to sit at his side yes she shall be welltreated mcgilliveray finally softened after taking a long moment to consider alans fierceness on the subject she will have an honored place in my mothers huti and in the clan i suppose technically speaking she could never remarry as long as you are alive and could come back to claim her but since we both know that you shall never see her again it would best if she used your absence at the next green corn ceremony as proof that the marriage didnt take lovematches can be repented then if they arent working out even if children have already resulted being with child will make her more desirable as a wife since it proves she is fecund and able to bear children she could do right well id like to leave something for her something to help her in future what do you suggest alan asked in a soft voice and some of his concern and sadness must have communicated to rabbit for she tucked her head onto his shoulder and hugged him back eyes downcast as a sop to your conscience mcgilliveray snapped damn you to hell mcgilliveray ive had it with your bitterness at being born only halfwhite or halfmuskogee what passes between us is no matter though as long as the girl prospers and my child there ive said it he thought with sudden wonder ive claimed the brat as mine and her as my responsibility and what do you want for your child id like him to grow up english frankly with proper schooling and all theres no bloody future in growing up indian hardly possible unless our mission is successful and that after hes been raised muskogee for his first few years best let him be what hell be and let it go at that lewrie ill be staying on with the tribe though and ill see that he knows who his father was and what his legacy is i am truly sorry for you about this then give me a little help here alan demanded blankets and such for the present make her a rich little girl when she goes back to the white town her own skillets and pots and all the needles and thread you can that sort of thing any spare shirts you have maybe some sailcloth you can spare for the future i can tell her the value of money and you could leave her some small coins would be best pence and shillings so she can buy from the traders who will come could you come up with about twenty pounds in change yes i could at five pence here and a shilling there it will keep her and her babe in style for years mcgilliveray promised him good then alan said giving her another assuring hug the next noon found them at the mouth of the ochlockonee river in the long narrow inlet between the two arms of swamp and marsh that formed the hiding place for the guarda costa sloop san lldefonso it was too soon to expect the sloop to be there but they were close enough to deep water to have a good view of the ocean beyond and could spot her arrival when she appeared they made camp on the east bank though it was not much to look at given a choice their new muskogee and seminolee allies would be coming down the east bank so they had to suffer in silence the ground was halfmarshy halfsandspit strewn with seaoats and dune grasses saw grass and palmettos and cypress and pine inland to their rear it teemed with biting flies mosquitoes and gnats and but for the sea breeze would have been uninhabitable for very long they pitched leantos of cane and palmetto fronds for shelter and settled down to wait cashman sent some of his fusiliers out on picket and the young creek warriors went off to hunt silently with bows and arrows and to scout the ground while soft rabbit and the other unmarried travel girls set up their pots and gathered firewood alan and cashman went to the shore and found a place to spy out the sea by my reckonin this is the day you wanted the boat to come back for us cashman said if she makes it should have been safe as houses out there out of sight of land alan said extending his telescope and patiently scanning the horizon well red coat tom was tellin me that when they took fort st george at pensacola galvez fetched a fleet of sixtyfour ships from havana for the job sixtyfour alan scoffed theyve not ten decent sail of the line in the entire west indies damn few useful frigates either most were merchantmen ill wager you can depend on my captain to come back for us youll see two weeks three weeks is a long time to lay out there and kill time though seriously if he doesnt come what could we do cashman pressed sail off in the boats i expect i did it once before up in the chesapeake and that was with river barges never meant for the open sea i could do it again a lot better than before with the launch and the gig its a devilish long way to jamaica though aint it cashman grunted pulling off his moccasins and spreading his toes in the dry white sand what two days sail to tampa bay another two to the keys lets not go borrowing sorrow so quickly alan replied if things go that badly it might make more sense to borrow horses from the creeks and go overland to charleston if traders can do it then theres a chance we could with some help from our new allies tonights the night svensen was due back with the sloop if he doesnt make it then we might have to change our plans but id give him at least two days grace before i started worrying for real nother thing that bothers me cashman began god but youre a fountain of joy today kit notice we didnt come across any apalachee on the way back cashman droned on full of caution we gave em some muskets and truck they got the drift of what were doin here with white turtle and the seminolee with us i know theyre a shattered lot compared to the muskogee but youd think theyd come out of the woodwork and give us a cheer or two maybe try to cadge a free sip of rumr somethin hmm have you asked mcgilliveray about that alan asked now sharing a worry with the infantryman not yet but im goin to right now cashman replied never thought id be the one to say this but ill be tickled pink to see the sight of our creeks and seminolee show up with nough weapons and men id like it too alan agreed putting down his telescope after deciding that not even an errant whitecap could be mistaken for a topsail on the horizon if the sloop comes inshore tonight and anchors here in the inlet and our indian friends are not here to take delivery of the guns well be forced to wait for them with a target no patrol could miss de sloops heah mista lewrie sah andrews hissed at the front of alans leanto where he had been sleeping with soft rabbit after staying awake most of the night awaiting the arrival of san ildefonso he had barely lain his head down it seemed to sleep the morning away ill be right out alan said groping for his shirt it was the first night he had slept with her that they had not made love or even removed their clothing soft rabbit had gone to sleep without him hours before after sensing that his duty took precedence over her ahlan she coaxed as he started to leave what little scrap of privacy they had in the leanto with a blanket hung over the front got to go soft rabbit like it or not alan said he gave her a quick hug and a kiss then darted out into the dawn it was not foggy on their sandspit though fog hung thick as the spanish moss on the trees to their rear and inland by the light of a few smoldering coals in the cookfire from the night before he could see that his watch read about half past four in the morning it was false dawn and the soft breezes coming off the sea were chilly waves rolled in and broke on the beach with a soft continual hissing there was barely enough light to see where he was walking as he made his way down to the shore by the river where away he asked in a soft voice deyah sah andrews said pointing out to sea to the southwest mustah missed de river in dah dahk un come long de coast san ildefonso ghosted out of the river fog hardly a ripple of bow wave under her forefoot and her sails hanging almost slack with the last gasp of the predawn sea breeze for a moment alan was worried she might have been a real spanish guarda costa sloop but he recognized several patches on her outer jib and caught a lick of color aft on her mainsl gaffthe blue white and red of a royal navy ensign thats her alright alan breathed with relief in his voice if shes in the right hands cashman said at his elbow which made alans full bladder jolt with alarm im keepin my troops hidden til we know for sure good thinking alan replied realizing that it was never good to see what you expected to see without making some preparations to be surprised by a clever foe unfortunately theyll expect to see some of our party and me or theyll turn about and sail out of here with the land breeze when it comes up its too late to be fooling about on a hostile shore with dawn in an hour ill leave you to it then alan good luck alan opened his breeches and stepped into the sea oats to drain his bladder while he had the chance then gathering his nerves he stepped out onto the river shore in plain sight and waved his arms at the sloop hoping that cashmans fear was not real there was no answering wave that he could see so he lifted his telescope and eyed her as she came on without a sound on the still river becoming more solid with a bank of fog behind her on the western shore it looked like svensen at the tiller but that did not guarantee that a don officer might not be hidden directing svensens movements damn you kit now youve got me starting at shadows too he grumbled he had to step out and call softly ahoy the sloop he hung the glass over his shoulder and waved both arms over his head someone at the bows waved back and the sloop altered her head slightly more bowson to him in response ahoy derr svensen boomed back at last making every bird on the riverbank squawk in alarm and take wing mister lewrie ja svensen he rasped back in a harsh whisper yes its me dat you zir svensen howled as though it was blowing a full gale a bull gator began to roar somewhere off in the fog in response lieutenant lewrie yes he replied svensen not so loud aye zir dis be svensen und who be mit you zir oh for christs sake alan muttered captain cashman of the th mister cowell mister mcgilliveray svensen this is supposed to be secret you know not so loud vat zir svensen bellowed loud as the last trumpet vat ship i from zir shrike brig o war you noisy bastard alan finally yelled back at full volume now for gods sake will you shut the hell up and get your miserable arse ashore this instant the sloop swung about let go her halyards and dropped anchor once she coasted to a stop ill have the damn fools guts for garters alan promised himself as he motioned for the gig to be launched into the river within a minute he was standing on a ships deck once more among his own kind all of them beaming with relief that a hard and dangerous job was almost over zorry ltent svensen said but by damn ve been not a mile offshore all night downt coast here missed your landfall in the dark did you aye zir bout five mile itink vas dark as a cows arse it vas zir svensen said with evident relief been vorkin our vay off shoals und bars und den der vind bout vun hour ago on us she die youre here now thats the important thing alan said clapping him on the arm and forgetting his own promise to nail the ignorant bastards hide to the mainmast well done altogether tankee zir svensen expanded with pride gott der cargo ready to hoist out zir dem redskins dey gon take it zir yes theyve agreed to aid us in getting florida back they havent shown yet but theyre on their way with packhorses and mules alan explained ill get the launch over here and we may begin stacking everything on the shore yonder on the way down here they also may have picked up some canoes or dugouts from their friends the seminolee vundered vat for we gif dem muskets zir ja ve start the launch butted up alongside a few minutes later and alan was surprised that soft rabbit was in the boat she scrambled up over the rail and came to his side clad only in skirt and blanket the sight of her beauty with so much of it on view made the hands stop their labors dead until svensen gave the nearest man a kick and yelled at them to hop to it she gazed up at the mast looking around the deck and he realized that she had never seen such a powerful collection of civilized technology in her life so far beyond her experience that it might as well be some shamans magic my ship alan said tapping his chest and waving a hand about the deck possessively all mine she understood mine and looked at him as if he had suddenly stood revealed as a god from her perfect upper world come down to earth cony ere i be sir thank you for bringing ah her out to the ship my pleasure sir thought shed like ta see her sir please gather up some things for her in a pack needles and thread twine and some scrap sailcloth what blankets you can find some cooking implements too shell have to go back to her people aye sir ill take care of it sir he led her below and aft into the captains quarters which were now his again even if only for a short time as she gazed amazed and laughing at so much wealth in so small a space he loaded her up with an embroidered and painted canvas coverlet from the bedbox the sheets and the blankets the small round mirror from above the washhand stand and the handbasin too some towels half a dozen pewter plates cups and bowls and all the silverware they tied it up into small bundles that could be strapped across a horses back for her return journey to the muskogee white town there was his sea chest in the same place he had left it and he opened it to lay out more treasure for her including a suede purse containing his small change money he told her sorting out and counting the coins for her white turtle will tell you what its for traders come you give to traders oh devil take it you dont understand a word im saying ahlan she whispered setting aside her new wealth she took his hand and placed it on her stomach mine bebby you bebby she waved a hand at her bundles and gave him a smile that made him feel lightheaded indicating that she understood how much he was giving her and the child to come she raised his hand to cup one of her breasts shrugged off her blanket and smiled impishly at him theres not time for that now he said but to no avail for she turned her head to see if the door was shut lifted her skirt and stretched out on the bare strawpacked ticken mattress well just this last once he gave in as he looked down at how beautiful she was never let it be said i refused a lady he came back on deck about half an hour later just as true dawn was making itself apparent nearly a third of the cargo had been shifted and was stacked ashore covered with sailcloth to keep the damp out of the muskets and powder and still no sign of the creeks to take delivery of it soft rabbit was still flushed with the last rogering he had given her now dressed in a loose shirt that came down almost to her knees cinched in with a kerchief for a sash over her deerskin skirt alan had changed back into uniform and had returned his precious hanger to his left hip even plain as a lieutenants uniform was to her it was cloth of gold even though she thought that his cocked hat was sort of silly and laughed at him every time he adjusted it bout anudder hour vor de cargo zir svensen told him and knuckled his forehead in salute by damn dats vun pretty girl she be zir dey all vas like dat up de river most of em svensen den by damn im zorry i not go mit you zir been to der cook islands und to china vunst before de var sveetest little girls in der vorld native girls ist svensen said in

batteries loaded now zir tompions in vents covered powder be dry i reckon roundshot roundshot und grape zir didnt know vat to expect in de dark zir very good light a coil of slowmatch now just in case and tell off some hands for gunners andrews yas suh send two men ashore and start dismantling our camp bring back everything the admiraltyd miss oh and see to helping rabbit mrs lewrie gather up my gifts to her and then put them ashore aye aye sah they took the gig ashore with her gifts and piled them all in one place for later packing out by horseback cashman wandered in from his picket line out at the edge of the trees and tipped his hat to them which made rabbit giggle and point to his cocked hat she thinks theyre hilarious kit alan shrugged dont ask me why everything quiet so far so far so good he agreed ive brought my pickets in from the marshes to a close perimeter bout fifty yards out with this mist thats bout as long a shot as well get mcgilliverays warriors are further out huntin sign of their people fars i know you hear owls hootin he tells me thatll be them comin back in well damn my eyes if we didnt pull it off after all me lad tis all over but the shoutin at this point your crew see any dagoes out to sea not one sail in all that time almost uncannily easy knock on wood cashman said grinning and rapping his knuckles on the butt of his fusil he then strolled back towards the perimeter the cargo was finally offloaded completely the sloop swung about to direct its fire upriver or overhead of the camp on the sandspit to the marshes and swamps the day dragged on until it was time for dinner and the hands ceased their labors for clear decks and up spirits from a small puncheon of rum brought ashore for them rabbit and the other girls had a small fire going and were almost ready to ladle out more bowls of the eternal sofkee mixed with some dried venison they had been steeping in a pot of water there was also some saltmeat from the sloops galley and biscuit the indian girls looked up first their ears more attuned to an odd sound than the whites owls were not known to hunt so close to the coast or call anywhere in daylight thatll be the creek scouts coming back in mcgilliveray said cashmans troops were all back at the sandspit by then for the fogs had burned off or been blown away by a new days sea breeze and they were too exposed out by the edge of the marshes other than a few who stood guard from covert hides in the saw grass and palmettoes at the top of the beach they were all queuing up for their rum and tucker theyre in a damned hurry if they are cashman said going for his weapons sarnt stand to form form open skirmish order the creek warriors came out of the woods at a dead run first one who clutched his side where an arrow had pierced him and then the last two looking back over their shoulders as they ran as a rearguard for the wounded man not a full minute after they stumbled into camp a solid pack of painted and feathered warriors came loping out of the trees and across the shallow marsh apalachee mcgilliveray shouted the bastards take em under fire sor the sergeant asked cashman stand by no cashman cowell pleaded we dont know why they chased these lads they could have tried to raid the apalachee just for the fun of it they do that all the time if we fire we might destroy whatever good will weve built here no mister cowell theyre going to fight us mcgilliveray countered fire cashman ordered and the fusils cracked even as the first apalachee arrows came arcing down among them with a sizzling rush there were some shrill screams as the leading warriors were hit and knocked down and the rest checked their headlong rush and began to weave back and forth among the reeds in the marsh leaping up as targets to draw fire or dropping out of sight after they got off an arrow or a cane spear from one of their throwers they seemed to dart forward and then fall back as if frightened of their own audacity running in circles like the practice of a spanish tiercio of pistoleers on horseback alan ran to his fusil which had been leaning on the cargo and checked his priming he took aim at a warrior in a bonearmor vest and let fly as the man paused to nock an arrow the man whooped in pain as alans shot took him in the belly and the indian dropped into the marsh out of sight with a great muddy splash svensen alan called over his shoulder to the sloop not sixty yards to his rear in the river lay a gun on these bastards and shoot at the largest pack of them an arrow whickered by him with a thrumming sound and he flinched as he pulled his weapon back to halfcock and began to load rapping the butt on the nearest crate to settle the load after he had bitten off the cartouche and poured the powder in another arrow zhooped past his head and his cocked hat went sailing off somewhere aft rabbit was kneeling near him behind the crates and went to fetch it for him she came back just as he stood up and shot another running man down in midstride and as he sensibly knelt to load out of sight this time she gave a bloodthirsty smile of encouragement whooping in glee san ildefonsos aftermost larboard threepounder barked and the sound of roundshot and grape passing close overhead made them all go almost flat on the ground the roundshot cut a warrior in half leaving his legs and trunk standing and his torso and head flying off into the trees shattering against a cypress trunk when they finally hit something solid the grapeshot frothed the water in the marsh and three more indians screamed and erupted into bloody statues before they fell which took the starch out of their courage after a few more arrows were loosed at the encampment and two more warriors had been clawed down by the fusiliers at over sixty yards they made off back into the trees goddamn and rot the bastards alan raged snapping off his last shot at one apalachee who stopped by the trees and presented his bare arse to them in derision he laughed with delight to see that he had aimed a bit low and had hit the man on the inside of the thigh just a quimhair from his genitals try stuffin whats left up your arse you sorry shitsack nice shot cashman panted nigh on ninety yards damn but i like the fusil alan shouted back with pleasure now you give me my ferguson and id have taken his right nutmeg off rabbit brought him his cocked hat now decorated with a long cane arrow with a flaked stone point and three raggled feathers at the other end she pulled a metal knife from her waist and waved it in the air making motions that he should go out there and lift some hair god its just as well i cant take you with me alan told her smiling so she would know he was pleased id love to turn you loose on some people i know with that thing i should have known we couldnt trust the apalachee not with so much loot to be had mcgilliveray spat they once were a mighty people you could trust but the spanish have turned them into shabby dogs they must have been watching all this time waiting for us to get all the muskets landed and for us to pull our pickets in for all the good it did them cowell sniffed clumsily trying to reload the musket he had snatched up and fired at least once several shots boomed out from the marsh and the treeline and they ducked down once more into cover as cashman crawled up to his furthest forward marksmen the volume of fire increased damme must be a platoon of em with muskets out there cashman shouted back mark your targets and return fire and keep your bloody heads down svensen alan bawled into the treeline take your time and aim true one gun at a time reload with grape and canister as you do so aye zir a thin voice called back from the sloop barely had the mate spoken than the first gun fired and the trees rustled in shock as the deadly grapeshot thrashed at the hidden musketeers well cut em to pieces if they try to rush us again cashman said as he rolled over onto his back to reload behind a palmetto and a mound of gritty sand if they do try to rush us it might be a near thing even so alan told him ive not seven men aboard the sloop and the crew for a threepounder is three men so thats not two guns able to fire more n once a minute with a whole lot of luck theyll try to rush us once more get cut up between your fusiliers and the artillery and go sulk or something until the creeks finally stir up their bloody arses and get here damn their lazy eyes rabbit was tugging at his sleeve urgently and he turned to her she pointed upriver and growled something in her own language jesus christ shit on a biscuit alan cried the river was thick with dugout canoes the canoes crowded gunwales deep with more apalachee and white men in dirty blue uniforms ware the river kit weve been sold out to the dons alan warned svensen use the springs and heave her about he had to stand to direct the mates attention upriver and a flurry of arrows and bullets flailed the air around him as he waved and pointed sarnt six men this side of the cargo use it as a breastwork cashman snarled rest of you stand fast along this dune line mister mcgilliveray you and your warriors up here please you too mister cowell its going to be warm work here in a few minutes warm aint the fuckin word for it alan thought with a grim shudder of fear not twoscore of us against at least a company of dago troops and god knows how many apalachee oh christ you could fit our little defense line into shrikes focsle were all going to get knackered and scalped rabbit rabbit go to the ship understand me be safe there go ship swim he said talking with his arms and hands in a flurry she shook her head and snatched the dragoon pistol from his belt lets have this crate opened and thatun there cashman was ordering you men load as many muskets as you can and stack em ready for use with enough volume of fire we may blunt em yet san ildefonso cut loose finally with her starboard battery of guns which had yet to be fired roundshot and grapeshot tore the river into a forest of water fountains and two of the leading canoes were shattered into scrap lumber pitching their screaming paddlers and warriors into the river svensen had shot his bolt though with that broadside for with only seven men it would take time to reload three guns swivels svensen alan screamed dont forget the swivels cony fetch the two swivels from the boats one here facing the river one for the fusiliers to play with up on the dune line with no more cannon being fired at them from the sloop the savages in the marsh whooped into motion alan stuck his head up and saw that there were at least thirty spanish troops with them probably the ones responsible for the musket fire the boats were too far off to land close it would be the pack coming from the marsh they had to deal with first feel like a gambling man lewrie cashman asked aye but the odds are bloody horrible bring your people up here to be my second line svensen keep that lot off our backs alan shouted out to his ship which looked so damned safe and snug out there on the water where he really much preferred to be damn the cargo he thought with a sick empty feeling inside if we can fight these bastards off were out of here like a shot they met the charge with a shot from a swivel gun that had had its stand jammed down into the firm sand bayonets glinted evilly as the spanish came on to the sound of a trumpet and the apalachee howled their death songs first rank pick your targets fire a dozen shots perhaps eight men struck down lewrie fire cashman yelled take aim fire he shot one apalachee down tossed down his fusil and snatched up a brown bess from the cargo that had seen better days but the lock came back with a firm snap and when he pulled the trigger it fired and a spaniard shrieked in shock as his chest was torn open by the caliber ball yu one of the creek warriors said from beside him letting fly with an arrow from an osagewood bow each time he aimed and fired he chanted some incantation under his breath for proper aiming and a good kill then expelled yuhe was getting five arrows for every shot from alans guns and his prayers were working wonderfully the charge faltered just short of the dune line with the fusiliers rising from cover to let off their last shots and go in with the bayonet for which the apalachee were not prepared half a dozen of them died howling on the steel and then they were fading away taking the spanish with them sarnt one squad to cover the marsh rest of you fall back to the breastworks and reload that damned swivel cashman shouted they were barely in time svensen had been banging away steadily at the approaching canoes full of warriors but alan doubted if some th rate frigate in the same predicament could have made much of an impression on that flotilla of dugouts even with a dozen carriage guns the boats were within twenty yards of grounding on the muddy river bank when andrews lit off the swivel on the breastworks and stopped the progress of one boat by killing everyone in it with a canisterload of musket balls an apalachee came dashing through the shallows eager to fight and alan shot him down with his fusil the brown bess took down the second one ashore and then there was no time to reload cashmans men got off a volley and stood ready to receive with the bayonet alan drew his hanger one apalachee dashed for alan screaming loud enough to curdle lewries blood but he found the courage to step forward and meet him tempered steel blade against a wooden war club which he beat aside and glided his point into the mans throat as he drew up for a second swing he picked up the war club for his offhand to use as a mobile shield cutting the thong that bound it to the dead warriors wrist by hacking the mans hand off with his superbly sharpened blade a second man with a cane spear died with one feet of steel in his belly and a third got backhanded with the war club which shattered his skull like a melon a spaniard came against him next a man with a smallsword a smelly dog of a man with one of those infuriating mustaches and a smug look of eventual victory their blades rang in the first beat of their duel the spaniard was fast but he had a weak wrist and alan threw a flying cutover at him forcing his blade wide to keep it there he binded with the warclub and as the spaniard leaped back to disengage and regain an equal advantage alan backhanded the slightly curved cutting edge of the hanger across the mans stomach opening his belly and spilling his entrails he would have finished him off with another slash across the throat but there was another spaniard there with a musket and bayonet alan stepped forward to fight him but the dying spaniard on the ground groped at him and nailed him to the spot and the musketman came forward alan deflected the bayonet down to his left but the man got all fourteen inches of it through his thigh goddamn you he screamed in sudden pain and this time got a slash at the throat which almost took the mans head off as they both fell the bayonet twisted and turned as the gun behind it toppled from the dead mans grasp ripping alans leg into agony he saw stars and almost fainted from the indescribable pain of it a shadow loomed over him an apalachee with a warclub ready to brain him and then there was a shot and the man was toppling back into the ooze at the rivers edge rabbit was there by his side a smoking dragoon pistol in her hands crying and weeping as if he was indeed already dead she got him under the arms and he could not credit such a little girl being capable of it but she seemed to lift him and bear him back behind the breastworks and shove a loaded musket into his hands you silly bitch im bleeding like a slaughtered pig what the hell you want me to do with this for christs sake he railed there was a shot next to his ear that almost deafened him and he turned to see cony and andrews flanking him discharging muskets as fast as they could pick them up alan wobbled his weapon up over the crates and leveled it in the general direction and fired not knowing where the ball went he sank back feeling very tired and sleepy and looked down at his leg the spanish musket and bayonet had gone away which he thought was nice of somebody but there seemed to be an awful lot of blood and he was frightfully sure it was all his christ he muttered feeling his skin pop out cold sweat his ears were ringing like westminsters chimes and that was about all he could hear rabbits face loomed up in his vision as she held him to her breasts worse things to look at when youre dying i spose he thought iv chapter oceanus ponto qua continet orbem nulla tibi adversis regio sese offeret armis te manet invictus romano marte britannus teque interiecto mundi pars altera sole wherever the oceans deep encompasses the earth no land will meet thee with opposing force the briton whom roman prowess has not vanquished is reserved for thee and the other portion of the world with the suns path in between panegyricus messallae tibullus chapter alan woke up in a lot of pain as someone tried to haul him up from his prone position but damned if he wanted to move he struck out at whoever it was and several more hairy paws grabbed onto him to restrain him and still lost in a terrifying dream of being taken by savages intent on his scalping and mutilation he let out a howl of fear and pain sorry sir almost done dr lewyss told him ah alan said biting his lips trying to be stoic now that he recognized the good doctor though his chest still heaved with panic where am i aboard shrike sir in my sickbay below the forepeak the man said between snatches of humming some song to himself as he fussed with a fresh dressing on alans leg wound most amazing thing really thought sure id have to take the leg but god seems to favor you remaining a biped sir even if there was the foulest poultice applied to it when you were brought aboard some pagan muck egh when alan groaned as lewyss finally finished wrapping his thigh and allowed it to be lowered to the bunk where it ceased screaming and settled down for some longterm throbbing yesterday sir cony said from alans side where he had been assisting in his restraint got some brandy ere sir iffen ya feels up ta takin some god yes im ready alan said with some heat a drop or two of tincture of laudanum for that first lewyss suggested reaching for his case and then someone please tell me what happened at the riverbank alan ordered now that he was up in a sitting position on the short cot them apalachee an dons almost done fer us sir til them muskogee an seminolee showed up cony related offering him a squat pewter mug brimming with harsh ratafia which alan sipped from avidly thought the ones in the swamp was acomin fer us but they was runnin instead god they dont butcher halffair sir loppin off

missus lewrie got away fine sir cony assured him mister mcgilliveray took er back to is people with your gifts an all mrs lewrie doctor lewyss muttered rolling his eyes my you have been a busy lad e said to tell ya sir that shed be took good care of ed see to that she was a sweet little thing at bottom alan nodded he felt a pang of longing for her but the idea of being a husband and father made him decide that as anne beauman told him things work out for the best in the long run you do get into the oddest scrapes sir if youll pardon me for saying so dr lewyss chuckled i truly do believe you could turn up a willing tit amidst the agonies of hell itself its not everyone has your success with the ladies ha ha well that should do you for now sir tomorrow should you feel up to it and suppuration has not set in i shall have you moved to the gun deck where you may get some fresh air and some sun tis my experience people heal the faster there thank you mister lewyss id appreciate that alan said and took another deep draught of the brandy the laudanum was taking effect and the pain was lessening to a manageable level now and he felt the urge to yawn perhaps close his eyes for a nap as long as he was flat on his back with no duties to attend to for the first time in years oh cony did rabbit receive all her presents when she left yessir she did cony nodded looking as though something was on his mind but reticent by class or position to mention it something else you want to tell me cony alan prodded knowing his mans moods by then well sir i didnt want ta mention it much but cony fumbled turning red with embarrassment i know you was fond o er sir but sometimes things work out best fond of her yes cony but not about to trot her back to london with me alan admitted shed have been unhappy there probably been unhappy anywhere close to civilized well thats it sir cony said summoning up his nerve when them muskogee an seminolee was adone slaughterin an shed finished puttin some poultice on yer leg she an them other girls went out an lord sir ever man you killed she took her knife to scalped em for ya since you couldnt ears an weddin tackle an all and whoopin fit

soons we were a few mile offshore woulda took that poultice off too cept mister mcgilliveray said they was strong erbs in it thatd draw the poison out else youd mortify an die said ed seen it work before an it was devilish good medicine must have worked alan agreed after another swig of brandy aye sir that wound wasnt half as angry tday as it was when i saw ya bandaged there on the beach cony agreed heartily well let that be a lesson to us cony alan finally said smiling never trust a woman with a knife even the sweetest of em they can be handsome as hell but theyve all got a mean streak when theyre crossed specially after they become wives he chuckled wearily yessir i guess cony nodded i think ill sleep for a while cony alan said after draining the mug and licking his lips youre not harmed feeling alright aye sir right as rain cony said taking the mug from alans almost nerveless fingers as he closed his eyes you rest up sir an youll be back on yer feet an runnin this ship soonern you can say jacksauce oh god do i have to alan murmured just before dropping off well ill say goodbye to you alan cashman grunted picking up his weapons kit now swollen with new items as souvenirs from their adventure heal up and well hoist a few for old times soon i hope somewhere quiet for a change kit alan agreed hobbling to his feet and limping heavily to the rail by the entryport with his crutch that mr pebble the carpenter had made for him you sound like you dont like excitement anymore once youve got two good legs to stand on theres a world o fun to be had out there cashman laughed give me a month or so then ill be ready for some amusements alan prophecied though id like my excitement a little less neckornothing than this last little bit ill suppose youll be going back to florida when we land troops there since you know so much about the indians now maybe shrike will be involved in it well see each other then bless me alan there wont be any landing cashman frowned with cowell dead an mcgilliveray gone native theres no one to say a good word for the idea an i doubt any officer in the west indiesd spare a corporals guard in a rowboat on the plan mind you it could have worked given half a chance damme but im getting weary of seeing good men die for nothing kit alan spat after a long moment to get over his sudden surprise seems ive spent my whole time in the navy taking part in ventures doomed from the start graves in the chesapeake cornwallis at yorktown evacuating wilmington i could give you chapter and verse from now til supper and not repeat myself oh were good when it comes to the fighting but witless when it comes to the planning for them all the more reason for fellas like us to live long enough to be generals and admirals cashman barked giving out with a short bitter laugh we couldnt possibly be worse than the pack o fools we have now too used to winnin in the seven years war i guess an forgot all we learned from that one mcgilliveray was a hopeless stuffy bastard but he had the right idea ill give him that least hes enough muskets to keep the rebels from eatin his people alive for a time an tradersll sell em anythin they want longs they come up with enough pelts an hides to swap well im off back to lieutenant colonel peacock an his shitten ways all the best to you do write and let me know when you get married again and ill be there to stand up for you one more time aye ill keep in touch but i seriously doubt the marrying part alan smiled taking cashmans hand and feeling his sour depression lift for a while he knew that half of it was being so incapacitated that and the continuing pain of his wound he truly liked cashman odd a bird as he was and wished to give him a hearty send off keep out of trouble and should i get another girl in the family way youll have to stand up with me else id run for the hills farewell kit hoist a black drink for me cashman yelled from the boat after he had gotten himself and his dunnage settled and then he was gone alan waved once more and steeled himself to limp with the crutch aft to the steps to the quarterdeck wincing with each pace it would have been so easy to let the surgeons declare him unfit for duty and he could be put ashore until he was fully healed but shrike was his world and he could not bear to leave her for another ship after settling in so comfortably better the devil he knew than to be relegated to some new pack of strangers and begin the process of mixing in once more probably in a larger ship where he would have less authority as a second or third lieutenant after gaining mastery of his duties well enough to serve as a first officer he would be damned if he would give it up unless made to do so so he had risen from his cot the day they had anchored in kingston harbor and sweated and suffered to appear fit enough to stay the first step balancing on the crutch with a deathgrip on the manrope fancyserved with turks heads that served for a banister a second step and william pitt lashing his tail lazily at the top get out of my way you mangy bastard alan whispered oh for christs sake dont do that the ramcat daintily hopped down to the step he was on and wound about his bad leg making himself a moving obstacle to any further attempt to take a step william pitt was purring happy im crippled are you alan snarled getting our own back are we damn your eyes give way you sorry shitsack the cat leaped up to the next step letting him advance but repeated the performance rubbing its chin and head on his good leg this time and twining about him with tail and side like a snake need some help there mister lewrie lieutenant lilycrop asked him somebody kill this filthy beast sir thatd suit alan said sweating like a slavey for fear hed go arse over tit any second stap me but oned almost think hes startin to like you sir lilycrop marveled he came down the ladder and helped alan up to the quarterdeck if you think you can manage it id admire if you joined me in my cabins you may lean on me if youve a mind no shame in acceptin help now and again when ya need it sir thankee sir id be much obliged once ensconced in a padded chair with a glass of rhenish in his hands he felt much better though the appraising way lilycrop was looking at him was a bit disconcerting was he being sent ashore try as he had to appear hale ive given orders youre to shift your quarters for a while mister lewrie lilycrop finally said youll be comfortable enough in the chartspace yonder and all the closer to the quarterdeck with only the short ladder to manage til youre fully healed im grateful for your concern sir alan told him with a grin as his worries disappeared doctor lewyss says another couple of weeks more and ill be fit enough for light duties i thought you might be considering packing me off ashore sir oh not a bit of it lilycrop assured him with one of his round smiles were used to each others ways now and id not like to break in another first officer not that oned be forthcomin from sir joshua bloody rowley for the likes of us we didnt exactly fail sir alan pointed out if he wont reinforce the overtures we made its his fault if he lets the chance slip away hes nothin to reinforce with lilycrop told him with a sour look admiral hoods off cape francois blockadin the rest of the french west indies fleet and admiral pigot who the hell is he sir alan asked goddamn but you still havent learned to keep your ear to the ground boy lilycrop frowned pigot come out to take over from rodney last year just after the saintes an after we got transferred anyway one of de grasses junior admirals de vaudreuil or something has most of his squadron penned up at cape francois and at porto cavallo on the spanish main thats why theres to be no ships for any expedition to florida all the admirals want a last sea battle a last crack at the frogs so everything we did was a waste alan spat we werent to know that not at the time admirals change plans change lilycrop shrugged maybe after the wars over we can run traders or agents in there anyway and still achieve somethin so were just a little footnote sir alan went on getting angry maybe not even that thats the way of it lilycrop nodded reaching over to tap him on the shoulder dont take it so hard mister lewrie you did all anyone could expect of you and more from what i heard sometimes all you can do is your duty and your best just aint good enough if they go and change the plan on you dont you think even admirals get their best efforts rejected now and again course those never turn up in their memoirs or the naval chronologies rest assured rowley give us a good report and a nice pat on the arse on the way out out sir transfer back to admiral hoods flag off hispaniola were to be part of commodore afflecks group workin close inshore to keep an eye on the frogs at cape francois be good to get back to sea and have somethin straightforward to do for a change maybe get a crack at a merchantman tryin to supply the damned place i still think wed have done better going back to florida alan said shaking his head the french will never come out sir we waste our efforts blockading them and if theyre blockaded then we have a clear shot at landing the expedition but if they learned we were doin it and took ships offstation they would come out and then whered we be lilycrop countered then we keep the fleet at sea waiting for the second chance to defeat them sir alan schemed what better lure to draw them out at all look here sir ill wager you any odds that admiral hood had no idea this expedition was being considered what if we could write him and let him know of it hes senior to rowley is he not if he could thin his blockade provide enough ships to escort the expedition the french would learn of it we land our forces at apalachee bay or closer to pensacola this de vaudreuil comes out of porto cavallo and cape francois maybe the dons come out of havana pigot could come west from antigua or st lucie and rowley could sortie the jamaica squadron we assemble off the florida coast threatening havana and meet them in that last glorious battle the admirals want so much damme you dont think small when you take the effort lilycrop laughed then sobered but one thing ive learned in this navy in my time is most people wouldnt stir their arses up if you set fire to em lewrie theyre happier layin back lettin somebody else make the decisions its too much of a risk itd expose jamaica again an this time the frogs an the dons might succeed in takin it the watchword is when in doubt dont good for careers but hell on the country been guilty of it meself at times god help me no this time wed best let our superiors make the decisions they dont look kindly on lieutenants givin em advice bad for the career sir alan said evenly there you are lilycrop agreed id forget about writin any letters if i were you sides the wars so close to over it wouldnt make much difference anyway now why dont you see to as much as you feel up to so we can sail tomorrow let mister caldwell help you him an midshipman rossyngton can do your legwork for you do the lad good to get a little authority park yourself in a comfortable chair on the quarterdeck if youre of a mind aye sir i shall alan relented half of a mind to write his letter anyway he groped to his feet got his crutch going and went to the chartspace where cony had begun to lay out his kit and his chest a small fixed bedbox had been cobbled together and fitted to the partition aft of the charttable much like a settee athwartship as it was it would be more comfortable to sleep in and it was high enough to allow him easy entry and exit even with his game leg if the seas got up once they were onstation what career do i have to worry about preserving anyway he muttered to himself once he was ensconced on the mattress sitting so he could draw out a largescale chart and study the caribbean area maybe i should write that letter after all not that itd do much good i suppose alan thought that even if he did write it and hood was receptive perhaps pigot would turn out to be chary or rowley would be too cautious it would take weeks to draw a consensus locally and then they would most likely wish to send off to london for directions and that would take months more to act and fail on their own would hurt their careers no one back home in the shelburne government would care to strand a british army in the marshes where they would die like flies to alien fevers and agues not this close to the end of the war while they were negotiating a peace it would risk jamaica or antigua yet what was war but a series of calculated risks it was not an exact science subject to mathematics so that odds could be drawn from tables it was an art he had been told how often had he seen success or failure balance on the finehoned edge of a sword and how many officers would see only hazard and fail to dare while some other firebrand would see slight advantage and would go forth to sow confusion to englands foes what forces formed a hawke a rodney a general like clive he wondered there was no chapbook like clerks little book of tactics to guide a runofthemill officer to turn him into the sort who could achieve a magnificent victory most came aboard as cabinservants at eight years old or at twelve as midshipmen blessed with only rudiments of decent educations and all they learned from schoolmasters and mates was how to curse tie knots drink and be practical seamen no one tried to teach them to think and with material security tied up in first gaining ones lieutenancy then gaining a commission aboard ship on active service how much of ones very source of bread would someone be prepared to put at risk if thinking too much led to halfpay idleness and penury he was free of that thank god between his prizemoney his hoard of gold his grandmothers bequest and his later inheritance he did not have to depend on the navy to put food on his table if he was careful with his money how much worse an officer would he make than most of the ones he had met who could only stump about a deck screaming luff he was from a deeper well of knowledge and he could think when he was forced to did he really have more promise than most and was the navy a place to shine because of that god help me i think i shall alan decided ill write that letter and the devil with the consequences if the navy wont have me after that then thats their loss isnt it ill have said my piece fate however did not allow the letter to be delivered shrike sailed and for days it was as much like yachting that watery sport of the aristocracy and the idle rich as any cruise he had ever seen trie winds were bracing and fresh quartering mostly from the noreast to the soueast once leaving port royal and kingston lieutenant lilycrop was in no hurry to rejoin hoods squadron off hispaniola and the ship loafed along like every day was a ropeyarn sunday but while they had good weather a storm had blown admiral hood offstation at cape francois and with a gustfront of wind and gloomy skies from the east the fleet was blown down onto them the first week of february on its way to port royal all shrike could do was to announce her presence change flags to hoods blue ensign once more and beat her way east past the squadron of lineofbattle ships to make the best of her way to join the ships remaining on blockade there was no contact close enough to allow alans epistle to be delivered once past the fleet shrike took one last lingering look at the southern coast of cuba their old hunting grounds and then a favorable slant of wind took them up the windward passage alan finally discarded his crutch though the wound still pained him he could make his way about the decks with more ease he had to admit that the wood and canvas deck chair was comfortable an admirable invention that should be standard equipment for the aspiring but lazy sea officer such as he he was close to the wheel and the quartermasters could see the work at the guns or the gangways and could stand his watches in sublime ease for once and noon sights could be performed just as well from a sitting position as they could be standing by the sunward rail and gritting his teeth with each pitch and heave of the deck when called to walk forward or do his tours below decks he could wince manfully with edgar or rossyngton or cony to aid him and limp about searching for a convenient handhold for which he could lunge the last few feet and utter a loud whoosh of relief from the titanic effort of performing his duties secretly the wound was no longer that troubling but after a little over three years of hard service he was not going to admit to any more agility than was absolutely necessary certain he was due some ease and it was fun to portray the wounded hero stoically going about his rounds as though he were secretly suffering the agonies of the damned and making a great show of shrugging off any offers of assistance or sympathy he had finished his morning watch and had turned the deck over to caldwell and rossyngton but lingered in his deck chair with a mug of sweet tea halfdozing with the injured limb stuck out stiffly in front of him his chin rested on his breast and his cocked hat was far forward over his forehead to counter the early morning sun on this their third week of patrolling several leagues to seaward of monte cristi off the coast of hispaniola he took a sip of tea then wrote up his lieutenants journal he had gotten past the usual bumf fri mar th winds nw course nne lat n bearing at dawn isabella pt monte cristi se by e off shore leagues fresh breezes cloudy and was wondering what else he should write down and attempting to stifle a rather huge yawn when the lookout interrupted him sail ho deck thar three sail four points awrft starbd bow that brought him up with a start almost making him spill his tea and the inkwell all over his journal there was nothing to their suthard or the east but french or spanish vessels little shrike would be no match for a squadron of foes that had escaped the blockade mister rossyngton go aft an inform the captain caldwell directed you hear mister lewrie sir aye thankee mister caldwell alan said forgetting how lame he was supposed to act as he levered himself out of his chair and got to his feet to hobble only slightly to the bulwarks i have the deck now mister caldwell deck thar the lookout called again four no five sail to starbd now ard on twind onna starbd tack on passage for the bahamas perhaps alan said as caldwell joined him at the rail with his telescope alan could just barely make out three tiny slivers of whitishtan that could have been clouds on the horizon the lookouts aloft would have a better view at least one hundred feet higher above the decks one sails auled is wind sir falling down on us sir caldwell said primly sounding more annoyed than anything else to smoke us i have the deck sirs lilycrop said as he emerged from his quarters and strode to join them hands to quarters put out the galley fires an stand ready to rig out stunsls an haul our own wind to looard bosun beat to quarters alan shouted with the aid of his brass speaking trumpet mister lewrie sir once mister coxs ready with his batteries id admire we ease her a point free more northerly lilycrop ordered aye sir midshipman aloft lilycrop snapped turning to them once more before strolling to the abandoned chair and dropping into it heavily as though he had no real care in the world what was over the horizon gangly mr edgar swarmed his way to the mainmast crosstrees like a spastic spider a flag sir edgar piped moments later looks british i think yes sir blue ensign sir and a private signal might be a ruse alan speculated t ands is at quarters sir fukes reported with mr cox private signal sir edgar added in a boyish yelp shes the drake sloop brigrigged now shes flying attend me sir presumptuous bastard lilycrop snorted at the audacity of another lieutenant master and commander much like himself in command of a brig below the rate issuing preemptive orders without knowing whom he was addressing whatre the others doin standing on north sir belay mister lewrie lilycrop barked out rubbing his whitestubbled jowls bring her back to the original course we can spy out thisn if shes a frog in disguise if the others stay up to windward lay us closehauled as may be and close her within half an hour the small squadron was hullup over the horizon and the drake was within hailing distance by the private code signals for the month they could identify the other ships the albemarle frigate a th rate of twentyeight guns according to the list under the command of one horatio nelson a th rate frigate the resistance of fortyfour guns another twentyeightgunned th rate the tartar under a commander fairfax and drake under a man named dixon and bringing up the rear was a final th rate twentyeightgunned frigate that flew french colors under a british flag a recent prize ahoy there came a call from drake as she surged close ahoy drake lilycrop bellowed shrike twelvegunned brig o war lilycrop lieutenant master and commander captain nelson in albemarle is senior sir dixon shouted back his compliments to you and he directs you to fall in astern of us we are on passage for turks island the french have taken it when lilycrop asked middle of last month sir dixon yelled captain king in resistance with the dugay trouin frigate were in turks island passage four days ago they spotted two french royal ships at anchor off turks island and gave chase took la coquette here and a sloop of war captain nelson thinks we can overwhelm them if we act quickly lets be at the bastards then captain dixon lilycrop agreed loudly aye aye captain lilycrop not the bloody frogs again sir caldwell groused thought we had em bottled up proper once de grasse was defeated dont they know to stay in their kennels when english bulldogs are out on the prowl been a year since the saintes almost mister caldwell the captain said even curs get their courage back soonerr later mr lewrie stand the crew down from quarters if you please and secure then proceed with the rum ration and the noon meal then id admire to have both of you in the chartspace with me dry as old bones mostly lilycrop mused as they looked at the charts of turks island or more properly grand turk turks south caicos and salt cay an salt tells the storybout the only export they got with this slant o wind well fetch the passage sure enough if it holds miss the mouchoir bank thank the good lord caldwell said turn the corner north and east of the northeast breaker theres said to be rocks and coral heads awash south and west of there id prefer to see waves breaking before id turn or stand on as we are into the turks island passage staying clear of the apollo bank sir alan said drawing on the chart with his finger leave sand cay and salt cay to the starboard aye be safer lilycrop nodded thats up to this feller nelson hope hes a little caution in his bones know anything of him sir alan asked not much lilycrop informed him marching a brass divider over the chart slowly uncles sir maurice suckling comptroller of the whole damn navy never hurts ey funny thought jemmy king in resistance would serve as commodore to our little squadron hes got a th rate nelson only a th james king was captain cooks second lieutenant out in the pacific in resolution you know maybe even with a th rate to command hes a couple names down the seniority list no dont go playin with that sweetlin lilycrop admonished one of henriettas kittens who had jumped up for attention and had become entranced with the movement of the brass divider she was pouncing on it her short little stub of a tail wiggling in delight looks like a good anchorage here sir alan said shoving the kittens rump out of the way long enough to indicate hawks nest anchorage soueast cf the southern end of the island not much to look at from the chart though been here before lilycrop said now busy entertaining the cat nothin much but coral salt and mud only drinkin water is what they catch from a rain more reefs around it than a duchess got necklaces an pretty steepto close under the shores hawks nest or britain bay up here seem best less we just barge our way into this little harbor on the western side but i expect the frogs have a battery there i would what about fortifications sir ours i mean that theyve taken over nary a one sir lilycrop shrugged not much reason for em before since it was only the salt trade that anybodyd come for and that only in the summer months god pity the poor french possession of the place i say if they landed back in the middle of february they wouldnt have much time to build fortifications sir caldwell pointed out sand and log rubble from the town perhaps that sort of place would just soak up roundshot worth taking though sir alan said after studying the chart look at all these passes turks island passage silver bank mouchoir passage and up north the caicos and the mayaguana passages put some privateers in here and just about any ship using the windward passage from the west would have to run the gauntlet by here to get to the open sea for home nobody ever said the french were stupid aye lilycrop said a little prospectin for territory before the war ends itd be a year before the peace conference hears of it and even begins to get the place sorted out in our favor but resistance took two ships and a sloop of war and one th rate frigate cant carry many troops or land much in the way of artillery theyre cut off on this island for now without any ships to support emwhat not moren one hundred fifty or two hundred troops we can outshoot em with our three frigates and muster more men from our marines an seamen best kick em up the arse now an have done ill tell lieutenant walsham sir alan said grinning god hell love it after being stuck aboard during the florida thing full bullock kit and crossbelts for a proper show hows the leg mister lewrie the captain inquired still a mite tender sir but ill cope alan offered it really is feeling much better no ive seen you wincin try as you will to put a good face on it lilycrop replied waving off alans enthusiasm for action if we land troops from shrike i may go myself cant let the younguns have all the fun now can we mister caldwell damnit it was alans place to go as first officer and he now regretted his earlier theatrics but to act too spry on the morrow would reveal what a fine job of malingering he had been doing and he considered hed done more than his share of desperate adventuring in the last few monthswhy take another chance of being chopped up like a fillet steak if there was no reason to well if you really are intent on the venture sir he sighed trying to give the impression that he was hellishly miffed chapter their tiny flotilla arrived in britain bay off turks island before sundown just at the end of the first dogwatch the holding ground was coral and rock so getting a small bower and the best bower secure in four or five fathoms of crystalclear water was a real chore they had to row out a stream anchor as well the tartar frigate was driven off her anchorage losing an anchor in the process while captain dixon from drake rowed ashore under a flag of truce to demand the french garrison surrender the prize la coquette stayed out at sea standing on and off as the winds freshened once they could pause from their labors and consider shrike safely moored alan could see french troops ashore in their white uniforms drawn up on a summit overlooking the ships which were not over a cable to two cables length from the shimmering white beaches it looked to be alan decided after plying his glass upon them not more than the one hundred fifty to two hundred men that lieutenant lilycrop had surmised captain dixons boat came off the shore just at the end of the second dog around eight in the evening with news that the french had refused to surrender that response was thought to be pretty much a formality for the sake of their honor the prevailing view being that once a determined landing party went ashore in the morning and a few broadsides had been fired off the french would shoot back a few times and then haul down their flag in the face of overwhelming force during the night albemarle and resistance fired a few shots into the woods overlooking britain bay to keep the french awake and in a state of nerves for the morrow shrikes people sharpened their swords and bayonets the marines went about hardfaced and grim tending to their full uniforms which were only worn for battle or formal duties in port and seeing to their firelocks flints and powder the rasp of files and stones on bayonets and hangers and cutlasses made a harsh sibilant rhythm under the sounds of the fiddlers on the mess decks who went through their entire repertory of stirring airs before lights out at first light just at am they stood to ready to board their boats and set off for the shore expedition captain dixon of the drake brig would lead evidently tartar had not been able to keep good holding ground for there had been no sign of her since she had lost a second anchor and been driven off shore in the night not much to the place by daylight is there mister cox alan asked as their swarthy little master gunner strolled aft to the quarterdeck little dry on the windward end here sir true cox said in a rare moment of cheerfulness as he looked forward to some action for a change sames most islands herebouts might i borrow your glass sir alan loaned him his personal telescope and let the man look his fill of the shadowy forests above the beach where the troops would land there wasnt much to see not in dawnlight seagrape bushes poison manchineel trees sturdy but low pines and scrub trees that only gave an impression of green lushness rooted firmly in the sandy soil of a coral and limestone island no sign of a battery this end sir cox commented handing the tube back and id not make those heights over fortyfive feet above the level of the beach even if there was good shooting for us lieutenant lilycrop came on deck in his best uniform coat wearing his long straight sword at his hip with a pair of pistols stuffed into the voluminous coat pockets his face was red and raw from a celebratory shave his first of the week no stirrings from the french yet mister lewrie he asked nothing to be seen sir alan replied might be a white uniform in those trees sir cox disagreed sentries most like so far but no sign of a battery theyve had all night to prepare even so lilycrop frowned well lieutenant walsham rarin to have a crack at em are ye sir aye aye sir walsham answered sounding a lot more somber than his usual wont he was a recruiting flyer the very picture of a marine officer this morning as if dirt and lint would never dare do harm to the resplendency of his red uniform the gorget of rank at his throat flashed like the rising sun doubt well need springs on the cables lilycrop mused i spect the frigatesll cover the landin and we wont be called for much firin less they try to sweep round to flank us once were ashore if they do theyll be in plain sight of our guns over there and it aint a full two cables to that low hill roundshot and grape should do it sir alan commented id worry more bout some frog ship comin in from seaward if i were you mister lewrie the captain said turning to look at the horizon from which the sun was threatening to rise mightve been more shipsn la coquette and a sloop of war come here maybe a brace o sloops already sweepin the caicos passage up north to make some profit from this expedition of theirs you keep a wary eye out for that i shall sir alan told him an youll not muck about with my little ship while im gone will you now mister lewrie lilycrop said in a softer voice for him alone not so much a question as an order ill not sir but i cannot speak for any french battery up in those woods alan grinned back knowing by now that lilycrops blusterings were not as dire as he made them sound signal from albemarle sir midshipman edgar called were off then lilycrop said with a grin only wished wed o packed a heartier dinner ready mister walsham aye sir the marine said moving towards the gangway entry port boats are alongside to starboard sir so the french did not see any preparations alan stuck in sideparty the seamen and marines gathered to render salute to their captain as he stepped to the lip of the entryport for the first boat doffing hats and raising swords or muskets in honor as lilycrop swung out and faced inward to lower himself down the manropes and battens to the boat the entire squadron was issuing forth its landing force most of it from the two remaining frigates as they had more men to spare from much larger crews while the little brigs below the rate were perenially short of hands even on their best days by counting heads in the boats nearest him and then multiplying by the number of boats issuing forth alan could determine that they were fielding around one hundred eighty to two hundred men for the effort minus those whose duty it would be to stay on the beach and safeguard the boats they would at least equal the estimated french troops ashore and the gunfire from welldrilled fighting ships would make the critical difference pendants down sir edgar shouted cast off out oars give way together the captains coxn ordered as the signal for execution was given it took about half an hour for all boats to gather before the frigates line themselves up in some sort of order and then shove off for the silent waiting beach albemarle signals open fire sir edgar said mister cox make it hot for them alan directed the ships began to thunder out their broadsides over the heads of the rowing boats thrashing the woods above the beach and the low hills behind with iron sleet slow but steady boys cox shouted to his remaining gunnery crews and shrikes little sixpounders began to bark one at a time aiming high with quoins full out which made the deck rock and seem to sag down with each blast cox and his gunners mate walked from one end of the waist to the other as the guns fired counting out a pace which would allow the forwardmost gun to be reloaded by the time the aftermost piece had discharged so a continual hail of roundshot and grape canister would keep the french down under cover never allowing them to rise between broadsides for a musket volley a little low mister cox alan asked as he saw the trees and bushes just above the beach tremble to a welldirected shot aimll lift as the barrels get hotter sir cox said replying with a touch of petulant whine to his voice unwilling to be questioned at his science or his skill in the execution of it but alan did note that cox then sent a gunners mate to correct the elevation of number larboard gun which had been shooting too low the boats were having a lively time of it even inside the reefs that should have protected them from the worst of the offshore rollers that swept in driven by a fresh soueast trade wind they rocked bow to stern with the oarsmen slaving away to keep them moving then the first stems were grounding on the sands and captain dixon was ashore and waving back at the frigates a signal went up from albemarle ordering cease fire so their broadsides would not hurt their own landing parties cease fire mister cox alan shouted down into the waist mister biggs water butts for the gunners aye sir their weasely purser replied sounding as if he even begrudged issuing free water looks like the landing is unopposed alan said might be some french troops up in those woods but they couldnt form for volleys under our fire marines are going in sir caldwell pointed out through the glass he could see the thin red ranks form shoulder to shoulder open out in skirmish order lower their bayoneted muskets and start off for the interior being swallowed up by the thick undergrowth almost at once with the seemingly disordered packs of seamen in their mismatched shirts following from then on it was anyones guess as to what was happening inland there was no mast available for flag signals from the men ashore muskets popped sometimes a whole squad fired by volley and the rags of spent powdersmoke rose above the greenery perhaps just above where they had been fired or perhaps blown through the trees before rising it was impossible to know which side had fired or where the true positions of whoever had done the shooting were all in all it didnt sound or look like much of a battle so far just a little skirmishing and skulking very desultorily conducted cant see a damned thing from the deck sir caldwell growled aye alan agreed nothing for it then oh send the lad do sir mind your leg caldwell replied and was it perhaps alans imagination but he felt from caldwells tone that he was on to him about his earlier malingering i told the captain i was spry enough and i am sir alan shot back going to the mainmast shrouds he ascended slowly but he gained the fightingtop though instead of trusting his legs strength to go outboard on the futtock shrouds where he would have to dangle by fingers and toes like a fly he took the easier path up through the lubbershole like a marine or landsman damme if im acting he thought massaging his thigh as it complained loudly at the demands made upon it he sat down on the edge of the top facing inland legs and arms threaded through the ratlines of the topmast shrouds and rested his telescope on one of the deadeyes even from there sixty or more feet above the deck and higher than the low hills of the island he could see nothing of note the sun was up high enough to show him the small town on the western side further down the coast was there a battery there he asked himself or was that a row of houses with their blank backsides to the offshore winds for comfort mister edgar came up soon after scrambling and puffing at the exertion of ascending the shrouds properly using the futtocks and the concentration necessary to coordinate his body and mind to the task he went on up past alan to the crosstrees with the lookout saying mister caldwell sent me sir on the way up as if his clumsy arrival had set events in motion the lookout shouted not five minutes later sail ho to seaward where away alan demanded getting to his feet with a thrill of dread perhaps lilycrop had been right and a french ship had come back to check up on her new base mister cox prepare the starboard battery to engage there sir mister edgar called with excitement in his voice the ship headed for the anchorage was a brig about five miles off but she had the wind free and was making good progress perhaps a privateer or a frenchwhat did they call them corvette think you shes french sir edgar called down from his higher perch if she is well serve her like hood did de grasse at st kitts alan answered him keep an eye on her mister edgar oh i shall edgar replied as alan glanced up at him and alan winced and sucked in his breath as edgar in swiveling back to gaze seaward almost lost his seat on the slight support of the thin timbers of the crosstree platform only the lookouts quick action in grabbing the lad by the collar had saved him from a deadly tumble to the deck do have a care mister edgar remember where you are aye sir edgar said red with embarrassment and fright he put his telescope back to his eye then looked down once more one of ours sir blue ensign and a private signal flag saying what alan demanded i un edgar stammered searching his pockets for his sheaf of notes and almost overbalancing again here it is sir alan shared a look with the lookout while edgar thumbed through the papers almost losing them to the fresh winds until he found the months private signals the lookout raised his eyebrows and sighed heavily making alan grin back at him in a moment of secret amusement admiral barrington sir hired brig o war edgar announced at last lieutenant charles cunningham in command thank you mister edgar why do you not go down to the deck and inform mister cox that he shall not have to engage her for now but stand easy id feel much easier with you there sir aye sir edgar nodded and fumbled his way to a stay which he rode down to the quarterdeck bulwarks admiral barrington exchanged signals with albemarle then took course to britain bay and anchored about an hour later she was much like shrike a brig of only twelve guns and from the looks of her decks had only seventy or eighty men aboard total not much reinforcement as she did so there was more firing from inland some volleys quite substantial though they still couldnt see where they were coming from or from which side to alans ears though it sounded as if there might be more firing from higher up and inland after a while and more firing than about one hundred fifty french soldiers could make there were finally some larger puffs of smoke and louder cracks of sound that could only come from fieldpieces so the french had artillery on the island perhaps in some wellsited works to deny the landing party any further progress towards the town sure enough around ten in the morning a runner appeared on the beach and took a boat out to albemarle to report and a few minutes after that small boats made their way from the flagship to the brigs alan slung his telescope and stepped out of the top if his leg was quarrelsome this morning there was nothing wrong with his arms he rode a stay to the deck in proper seamanly fashion making sure to land on his good leg even so the shock made his game limb twinge ahoy the boat fukes called passing the bowman shouted ahoy shrike an officer in the sternsheets demanded the hands eased their stroke to loiter near her side have you an officer aboard lieutenant lewrie alan replied using a speaking trumpet lieutenant bromwich sir second into albemarlel lieutenant hinton and i are to take charge of the brigs and direct them to weigh captain dixon is checked by a strong work and requests we make a diversion with artillery opposite the town sir do you need any assistance in so doing goddamn the man alan thought cynically do they think aboard albemarle that were cripples no sir we shall weigh directly i think we may cope sir alan drawled back very well sir mister cox secure from quarters mister fukes hands to the capstans and prepare to weigh veer out on the stream anchor and heave in to short stays on the best and small bowers ill have the kedge served out for later use slip the stream cable once weve loosed topsls and buoy it well pick it up later aye aye sir fukes replied knuckling his thick brows within half an hour their evolutions were complete they got up the bow anchors and were held in check only by the smaller stream anchor off their stern the fresh winds made the ship strain down from that anchor and when they loosed topsls to put a way on her and let slip the stream cable they were underway and under complete helm control from the moment the cable was let go as smoothly as anyone could ask for which made alan grin inside at the ease of it it was only a couple of miles to a new anchorage opposite the town with the leadsman singing out four or five fathoms the whole way even though the waters were so clear they could see sharp coral below them as if they were skating over glass bring to mister svensen alan ordered at last round up into the wind and back the fore topsl ready forrard her progress checked against the wind they let go the best bower and veered out half a cable the cable thumped and shuddered a few times before they found good holding ground kedge anchor into the boat and row her out there alan said pointing aft and a little to larboard and once shes holding place springs on the cables to adjust our fire aye sir fukes nodded it felt good alan decided to have complete charge of shrike with lieutenant lilycrop off ashore there were none of the nerves he had suffered before in being asked to shift their anchorage or commit her to battle against a shore battery if battery there were some concern that he did not look ridiculous but none of the nailbiting fear of taking any action at all he had once experienced with a wry grin he was forced to believe that the navy had drummed enough competency in him at last enough to make him aspire to more opportunities for independence from someones leading strings springs is rigged sir fukes reported very well mister cox stand by to open fire drake as the flagship of their extemporized little subdivision hoisted a signal and all ships began a cannonade against the town seems a shame sir caldwell said after measuring any change from shore marks that would indicate shrike was dragging her anchors or being blown out of position what is sir alan asked offhandedly well sir looks as if the frogs has already torn the town up for building material and here we go shooting the rest of it apart it may not look like much to our lights but its their homes sir umm not for much longer at this rate alan commented as the roundshot from the light guns tore holes in walls and roofs who was it sir one of those pagan roman poets said they make a desert and call it peace caldwell mused tacitus perhaps alan answered couldnt have been virgil or caesar they were too proud of making deserts battry sir cox shouted as a wall of gunpowder erupted from shore above the town a roundshot almost big enough to see in midflight came howling over the bulwarks and passed close enough to create a little backeddy of wind damme sir that was a twentyfourpounder or im an arabee caldwell groused with unwonted vehemence shaken from his puritan demeanor for once enough to curse mark that mister cox alan asked scanning through the smoke of the broadside for sign of the guns i think so sir there or close enough as makes no diffrence the newly discovered french battery began to put shot around all the brigs as cox relaid his guns to respond alan counted the shots and tried to gauge what caliber they were mister cox lets concentrate our fire on one embrasure if you will alan shouted down to the waist that one there aye sir sixpounders there alan said about four or five of them seems about right sir caldwell replied his voice still a little shaky and at least four twentyfourpounders alan added feeling a little grim himself this is going to be warm work for three little thinsided brigs and works with fieldpieces up towards britain bay to counter captain dixons shore party more frogs on this island than a dogs got fleas more than reported at any rate they had to duck as one of those twentyfourpounders placed a roundshot close aboard close enough to raise a great waterspout that fell over the quarterdeck and wetted them down in a twinkling as it skipped overhead to fall into the sea on the disengaged side shrike was at least out of the main line of fire a little more sheltered than the drake or admiral barrington as the day wore on towards noon drake took a ball aloft which brought down the gaff of her spanker and the admiral barrington was hulled with solid thonks of iron smashing wood the artillery killed the wind that was something alan had heard mentioned before but had never witnessed for himself where before there had been fresh winds offshore that stirred up the waters of the deep passages and set the brigs to rocking like cradles now the sea was flat as a millpond and the wind had died to almost nothing the ships were wreathed in their own palls of smoke and the fort ashore could only be espied by looking for the base of the towering pillar of spent powder it didnt do much for their aim but at least it made the job of the french troops serving their larger pieces just as hard signal from drake sir edgar said at his side coughing on the sour smell of burned niters cease fire very well mister edgar mister cox cease fire alan said mister edgar my compliments to the purser and tell him its past time for dinner have him issue some cold rations and smallbeer for the hands aye aye sir a rowing boat sped down from the frigates anchored in britain bay and went aboard drake while the men were eating and curing their battleinduced thirsts after half an hour the boat came back along the anchored brigs sir captain nelson directs me bid you to weigh the midshipman in the stern yelled his voice cracking a little he was awfully young you are to return to britain bay and reembark your party very well alan replied well thats another fine mess weve made he added turning to his quarterdeck people itll take the frigates down here tomorrow to shoot that battery silent and make another landing maybe on the other side of the island now we know where the frogs is concentrated sir cox said free of his gun deck he and his gunners looked black as moors from all the grime of powder smoke on their skins alan could see the closest gun being sponged out with a watersoaked wool rammer and other hands hoisting up buckets of seawater to sluice off the muzzles and touchholes the guns were hissing as the water cooled them like sated dragons bowse em down to the portsills and secure mister cox he said mister fukes get your people ready to veer out on the bower and take up the kedge soon as the gun crews are available winds coming about a little more westerly quick as you can both of you or well end up rowing her out with the sweeps if the wind goes foul and leaves us on a lee shore the wind had swung not so noticeable during the cannonading that had deadened it now more southerly with a touch of westing sure sign of a change in the weather and that was usually a sign of worsening weather especially in the caribbean they got the kedge up heaved into short stays on the bower but could not get it to release from the bottom damme and this was going so well alan thought sadly flukes hung up on a coral head feels like sir fukes told him i can almos see er down there belay what you have mister fukes hands aloft let go the driver and jibs with a little forward way we might sail her off aye sir fukes sounded dubious and with good cause the anchor obstinately refused to let go her grip on the coral bottom and no amount of straining at the capstans was going to shift her the ship sailed up until she was almost standing directly over the anchor with the cable bartaut and if anything inclined slightly from the vertical bent back under shrikes forefoot and cutwater least thisun aint the best bower sir fukes offered after coming aft from the beakhead an them other brigs aint havin much more luckun usun drakes arready cut sir the captain will have my hide if i lose an anchor even the small bower mister fukes alan groaned thinking what a tonguelashing he would receive when lilycrop came back aboard with nowhere else to go forward shrike was now beginning to circle about her anchor and the timbers around the hawseholes were groaning alarmingly the bow was slightly down and thumping well shit alan sighed giving in to the inevitable cut the cable mister fukes aloft there loose topsis helm hard alee and hold her wind abeam if you can braces shift the braces to the larboard tack it was a sad trek back to britain bay making slow progress until they could come to anchor again and clew up the sails to allow the boats to come alongside doctor dorne and his loblolly boys from the surgery appeared ready to receive any wounded men from the shore party and alan thought to have a bosuns sling rigged from aloft to help hoist injured men aboard then their first boat was coming up to the starboard entry port and alan could look down into her rossyngton had the tiller and alan was ready to rate him for preceding the captains boat to the chains but a quick look at the second boat showed no sign of their captain either yet lilycrops old coxn was in the first boat was he dead sir rossyngton shouted up as the boat thumped into shrikes chainwales he was filthy and sweaty his hat gone somewhere its the captain sir and there was lieutenant lilycrop splayed out amidships between the oarsmen where he could not have been seen his coxn supporting his head and shoulders and another man helping hold his legs up out of the bilges he was gritting his teeth in agony and rolling his head back and forth to keep silent before his men the bosuns chair was lowered immediately and lilycrop helped into it and secured with a line about his waist gentle hands were there to ease his passage up the side to keep him from bumping against the timbers the staytackle hauled him up and over the gangway bulwarks and swung him over the waist lieutenant lilycrops right foot had been wrapped up in someones shirt for a bandage tied with smallstuff to keep it from falling off with another length of twine about his leg above the knee to control the bleeding even so his sodden wrap left a trail of blood droplets as he was lowered to the deck make haste here damn your eyes mister lewyss alan called as he gained the waist and knelt over his stricken commander calm as does it mister lewrie dr lewyss urged in a soft voice patting alan on the shoulder with a bloodgrimed hand the captain already knows hes hurt and we dont want him to take fright from all this yelling got to gentle the wounded so ye do like one would with a colt make em feel they have a chance else they take fright and go all cold and grey seen it happen and then you lose them sure as fate lewyss shouldered on past him and knelt by the injured leg as the loblolly boys were readying a carrying board and lilycrop was being freed of the bosuns sling lewyss unwrapped the bandage once he saw the wound he could not help wincing and sucking air in through his clenched teeth at the sight the captains right ankle was shattered the shoe and stocking had been removed though pieces of silk stocking still clung to the wound the foot was a winedark horror swollen beyond recognition and hanging from the ankle by only a few remaining tendons at an obscene angle lewyss spanned his hand above the ankle as though deciding just where he would start sawing to take it off and found another wound this one a bruise with a small blueblack hole in the center that oozed blood captain sir lewyss said with as much false good cheer as he could summon well get you below to the surgery and fix you right up nothing for a man to worry about tis going to be a handsome thing as the ladiesll gush over in future take a few sips on this while my lads get you below and theres more where that came from oh shut up you bloody welsh fraud lilycrop grimaced i know youre to take my foot off gimme that bottle and get on with it damn your eyes lewyss offered him a small pocket flask of rum which the captain bit the stopper from and spat out he drained it at one go hurry mister lewyss i beg you alan urged in a harsh whisper lewrie that you aye captain dont stand there lookin like a specter sir ship alright no wounded aboard lilycrop asked between waves of pain all well sir alan said close to tears we lost the small bower sir small enough price lilycrop groaned as he was rolled over onto the carrying board and lashed down doctor have you no more rum fer me damn you lets get goin get it over with for the love of god lewyss nodded to his hands and they lifted the captain up to carry him away gripping onto the loops of rope in the carrying board to maneuver his form down the steep ladders of the main hatch to the surgery aft in the cockpit itll have to come off of course sir lewyss whispered sadly i could leave him most of the calf but for that second wound theres a musket ball about a handspan above the ankle and bones sure to be broken there at least hell have half his calf and the knee of course make things much better for him when it comes time to fit him for an appliance he may walk almost naturally then youd best be about it mister lewyss alan snapped time enough sir lewyss said not to be hurried let him have some more rum first and let the numbness set in if you will excuse me sir no one else wounded mister rossyngton alan asked once the doctor had taken himself below to his sad duty no sir just the captain the midshipman reported shaken into somberness the landing was pretty much unopposed sir just some pickets to slow us down in the woods but we came up against some heavy volleys once we were over the first hill and we went to ground there sir we sent for a diversion against the town as i expect you know sir aye the french fell back to a work above the town rossyngton went on between sips of smallbeer from a large wooden piggin and they had field guns there maybe four of em sixpounders we could see seamen as well as soldiers sir hundreds of em captain dixon had just ordered us to retirenot much we could have done in the face of that workand the captain gave a little grunt sort of sir this cannon ball came rolling out of the bushes spent almost but it hit his foot and just flipped him arse over tit sir like an acrobat how he got the second wound i dont know sir signal from flag sir edgar called its captains repair on board sir damn that fool yonder alan spat and just how does he think our captain can manage that i wonder he was feeling a heavy wave of guilt if he had not been malingering acting as if he was incapable of fulfilling his duties as a whole man lieutenant lilycrop would still have a foot it was his fault that that good man a man who had treated him more than fairly was now undergoing the horror of lewyss knives saws and probes then again he rationalized it could be him on the table turning into a maimed figure of fun for the street urchins back home who would taunt mr hopkins at any person with any sort of deformity um think youd better go in the captains place sir caldwell suggested interrupting his furious musings to the flag that is hmm me yessir with the captain down wounded youre in charge for now sir caldwell repeated damme i suppose i am aint i alan nodded slowly comprehending it all alans boat ground against albemarles side by the mainchains with cony holding fast with a painter and andrews at the tiller as a temporary coxun it was with difficulty that he got up the manropes and battens to the deck he was greeted with the shrill of bosuns pipes and the sideparty due a captain which made him shrivel up with guilt once more he had not known where the other officers stood in seniority to him so he was the last aboard and once he had doffed his hat in return salute he limped over to join the others i am lieutenant osborne first into albemarle sir and you are alan lewrie first officer of shrike brig o war alan replied sir allow me to name you to the others lieutenant lewrie of shrike captain james king of resistance lieutenant charles cunningham of admiral barrington captain charles dixon of drake our second lieutenant martin hinton and our lieutenant joseph bromwich i believe you have already met earlier have you not captain nelson shall receive you in a few moments it was not exactly a pleasant social gathering they all looked devilishly grim after being checked ashore and obliged to cut and run from the heavier french battery get that ashore sir captain king asked noticing alans slight limp no sir a few weeks ago on the florida coast when we were still part of sir joshua rowleys jamaica squadron alan replied any casualties charles dixon asked of cunningham six wounded sir cunningham replied including the bosun we suffered two one of em our sailing master dixon told them all damned fortunate for all the damage we took gaff shattered rigging cut up pretty well and we have an eighteenpounder ball in the timbers thank the good lord they didnt run to heated shot and how did shrike fare sir no one aboard is hurt alan said one wounded ashore with youour captain sir lieutenant lilycrop hurt sore dixon asked hes losing his foot at this moment sir alan stated ah im damned sorry dixon sighed i tried to keep our casualties to a minimum ashore no sense making a useless demonstration against their works and getting men killed for nothing trevenen says we should have reconnoitered last night sent a boat ashore king said might have saved us the trouble oh him lieutenant cunningham sniffed im sure young jemmy will put pen to paper about this excuse me sirs but captain nelson will see you now osborne told them coining back on deck he led them aft and below to the great cabins alan stuffed his hat under his arm and waited to see what their putative commodore looked like well stap me he thought at his first sight i do believe if they made me a postcaptain tomorrow id look older than thisun captain horatio nelson was a skinny little hop o my thumb not much taller than some minnikin slim and coltish as a young whippet and a good breeze looked enough to blow him right away his light hair was long lank and unpowdered tied back in a hessian tail of such length that it rivaled lieutenant lilycrops seamanly queue his captains coat was the fulldress ironbound stiff with gold lace and of a fashion more suited to the last war with oversized pocket flaps altogether he looked like an actor in some drury lane production portraying a sea officer deliberately miscast in some parody gentlemen well met he began in a high slightly nasal voice though i fear we meet not in a victory worthy of british sea officers lieutenants bromwich and hinton inform me they were obliged to cut and abandon the cannonade on the town battery how many guns at least four or five twentyfourpounders sir cunningham said and near on five or six sixpounders by my count a substantial work and they were manned by seamen i believe very accurate gunners and captain dixon you encountered at least four more guns of at least sixpounds shot at a work blocking your advance nelson asked aye sir quite a packet to be transported by la coquette and that prize sloop now with the dugay trouin frigate nelson said playing with the stock of his shirt and how many troops did you encounter ashore sir i would estimate over two hundred men sir dixon said evenly i want to commend your sagacity sir nelson told him with a small shy smile on his long narrow face another commander would have tried to force the issue against that work and would have been repulsed with heavy casualties obviously there are a lot more men ashore than the captive french officers in la coquette told us captain king did you learn any more from them no sir king replied they said theyd escorted ships here and la coquette had given up five of her twentysix guns to form a battery i estimated that they could not have landed much more than one hundred fifty troops plus seamen gunners but to man that many guns and provide a guard force for both works and still leave at least two hundred troops free to operate against captain dixon would make how many do you think nelson asked trying not to give the impression that he might like to tear kings head off even if he did if there were other ships escorted here of which i now am informed this is damned interesting alan thought watching the young man grill the older and surprisingly senior postcaptain over the coals so postcaptains can act just as ill with each other as any pack of surely midshipmen fighting over shares of a pudding it would make over five hundred men sir alan guessed aloud my captain says theres nothing much on the other islands so grand turk is the key and they must have located all their force here and you are sir nelson asked turning to face him he didnt look pleased to be addressed and thrown off the topic lieutenant lewrie sir of the shrike brig first officer i stand in for my captain lieutenant lilycrop whos in surgery now the officer wounded ashore with me sir dixon added yes mister lewrie over five hundred men with twentyfour pounders nelson said turning to address all of them we put what about one hundred sixtyfive men up against a french regiment and a fortification with artillery heavier than any piece we have at our disposal but we may still seize the day i propose to shift the frigates opposite the town to reduce the fortification if we start now we may pound upon it all night if need be as for the brigs make a demonstration above britain bay at the far end of the island to get the field troops marching that direction then at first light we land here after taking anchor in hawks nest anchorage on the other side of the island from the town and battery they shall have to abandon the work up north and we may now concentrate our forces against theirs properly would it not be better to blockade the place for now sir captain king advised shaking his head send one of the brigs off to summon admiral hood he must be back on station by now after watering at port royal heavy guns and marines from the liners weakening the blockade of cape francois captain king the diminuitive commodore replied rejecting the suggestion with an energetic wave of his hands perhaps their expedition had that as a secondary goal no we have a chance to confound our kings enemies here and now with enough energetic action enough alacrity we may still prevail id like to point out though sir captain dixon said with a heavy look that even if we stripped every vessel present the french can still field more troops and once ashore well have no field guns to counter their battery it was dirt and they could dig guns in anywhere they wish once they see where we land they hold the upper hand when it comes to moving on interior lines whilst we are forced to sail all around the island to find another beach while nelson was digesting this view of things there was a rap on the door and nelson bade whoever it was enter with an exasperated tone to his voice the officer who entered was lieutenant osborne first officer of albemarle excuse me for interrupting sir but the winds are come more westerly and still quite fresh another hour and well be on a lee shore yes thank you for telling me mister osborne nelson answered massaging his brow with long slim fingers he used his other hand to spin the map of the island about to stare at it there is no good holding ground on the eastern side shallow reefs and shoals and then a steep drop off to truly unfathomable depths hawks nest anchorage is possible but under the guns of the battery and too far for useful fire from our pieces he gave a heavy sigh a bitter realization that even the seas and the winds conspired against him and alan felt quite sorry for him the man had rushed in hoping that he would gain a quick victory against light forces and he had been misled by the intelligence he had received the french ships taken by resistance and the other frigate had not carried the expedition they had escorted other merchantmen or transports who had equipped the place for a long defense with heavy guns now nelson would have to admit defeat and sail back to his admiral with news of his repulse better he had done what king suggested in the first place keep an eye on the island and send word immediately to bring lineofbattle ships that could shoot the battery and works to flinders land nearly a regiment of marines and reduce the garrison even the sea and winds aid the damned french nelson mused as if god had turned out to be a haymarket tout and had given him a false report on some horse on which he had bet the family estate gentlemen let us weigh anchor at once and work off this shore before we start dragging anchors in bad holding ground no sense losing a ship or another man on this miserable island and the expedition sir captain king asked as if he liked rubbing salt in wounds or had the tact of a mastiff i fear i must concur with captain dixons estimate of the situation at the last no weigh and head back for the squadron off cape francois nelson scowled turning away to look out the transom windows unable to face them in his moment of failure how is the captain alan asked once he was back aboard his ship mister lewyss thinks hell live sir caldwell told him in a soft voic left him a good stump sir didnt suffer much nor make a sound thank god for small blessings anyway mister caldwell id admire if you took over as first officer acting lieutenant your mate to rise to sailing master aye sir caldwell preened though i hate to prosper at the captains sorrow sir i must advise you sir the winds come westerly and yes get us under way soon as you can lay out the sweeps if you think they might be necessary easier than being towed out by the boats mister fukes prepare to get under way aye aye sir we still going to try something else against these frogs sir caldwell asked as the bosuns pipes shrilled for all hands on deck no alan snapped theyre too strong the captains going to lose his ship for nothing goddamnit im getting tired of this you and me too sir caldwell agreed they veered out to take up their stream anchor hauled back up to short stays on the bower and got under way the wind and waves were too much and she paid off immediately rolling her larboard rail almost under even under bare poles sweeps mister fukes like an ancient oared galley shrike extended her sweeps too few to alans eyes but they needed strength to finish hauling up the anchor by the capstan fish it in and ring it up on the catheads more hands were already aloft loosing the spanker and jibs leaving only twenty or so hands to pull at the long oars it was enough to hold her head up to the fresh breeze until the rudder could bite and the fore and aft sails could give her forward motion not trusting to squaresails until they were out beyond the reefs they shorttacked away from the lee shore employing the sweeps to get her head around on each tack and keep her driving forward no matter how slowly until the sails could fill and impart drive the leadsmen in the forechains swung their shorter sounding lines continually until they reported no bottom then when even the deepsea lead could find no bottom they hauled their wind to the south and loosed topsails and courses now out over the abyssal depths of turks island passage some of the other ships had had to use their rowboats to tow them out against the wind until they had room to pay off when loosing sails shrike had to stand off and on the coast until all vessels were safely at sea and in company together neatly done sir caldwell told him once the offduty watch had been allowed to go below and the ship was out in her proper element yes we hadnt worked with sweeps before but they did well alan replied we did a lot better than the others aye sir um ill expect we should have someone strike for masters mate how would mister rossyngton do would you think well sir hes a bit flighty for me caldwell frowned long enough in the navy i expect but my word sir hes a terror it did me a world of good to get some little responsibility as acting masters mate and it is only temporary lets give him a try aye sir um something else sir what about the captain well we cant sail for harbor for one wounded man and im sure the captain would not let us once he comes around alan replied well rejoin the squadron and see what they say if mister lewyss thinks he will recover hed probably prefer to do it aboard his own ship if we can be fitted with a false leg below the knee he should do alright no sir caldwell said throwing water on the tiny flickering embers of alans hopes theyll pack him off home whether he heals or no new commander for us looks like poor old bastard alan muttered feeling guilty all over once more about staying aboard during the landing should be me in there less a foot i think he would have gone even if youd been whole sir the sailing master told him taking off his glasses and pulling out a large pocket kerchief to polish them clean of salt spray something grand to do before the war ends to make a name for himself it was his last chance just like this nelson fellow alan nodded like my old captain in desperate to make amends for an earlier failure aye sir like that thing up in florida clear his name but damnit mister caldwell we didnt fail in florida alan protested somebody thinks we did sir and thats the same thing the older man shrugged wonder what captain nelson failed at before to make him so eager to tackle the french here who knows alan replied chapter the next morning with sand cay the last speck of land of the turks and caicos islands just under the horizon albemarle signaled shrike to close her and once close alongside ordered her to back her topsls and heave to as they wondered what the matter was a boat set out from the flagships side bearing little captain nelson he scrambled up the side and took the salute from the sideparty then advanced to where lewrie and caldwell were standing good morning sir alan said what is the matter i have come to see your gallant captain lilycrop mister lewrie nelson told him i trust he is well enough to see visitors aye sir he is alan replied if you will allow me to lead you to his quarters mister caldwell would you take the deck admiral barrington took the highest number of casualties nelson said as they walked aft it is my intention to go there later to see to their needs your captain is recovering still in much pain sir as im sure youll understand alan replied mystified that nelson was making the effort was he salving a guilty conscience that people had been hurt at his orders in a doomed adventure i saw him this morning and he was awake mostly your surgeon holds hopes for his recovery then sir nelson pressed aye sir hes very strong for his advanced age spent a lifetime at sea you know alan told him feeling the urge to put the needle in at nelsons expense this was his first command and now hell likely lose it i see nelson frowned pulling at his long nose lieutenant lilycrop swung in his hanging bedbox to the gentle motion of his ship his usually darktanned face was pale and he sweated a good deal but the surgeon had said that it was good for him to sweat out the poisons from the wound the offending limb was propped up on a pile of pillows wrapped in bast and gauze looking no more harmful than a peer suffering a bout of the gout there was a mug of rum near at hand and every cat he had ever owned had gathered in some silent sense of commiseration near the bedbox or curled up in his lap or on the pillows the captain had his eyes closed and they could hear him make soft groaning noises wincing a bit as a wave of pain intruded on his senses but he opened his eyes brightly when they were announced captain nelson has come to pay his respects sir alan said and did the duty of introducing them are you in much pain sir nelson asked taking a seat that gooch offered him well sir you get your foot shot damn near off then let a drunken welsh sheepcoper saw the damn thing off an see how it makes you feel lilycrop said uncharitably i am sorry captain lilycrop nelson replied in a soft voice totally abashed and evidently wishing he were anywhere else in the wide world at that moment since you suffer on my behalf i was wondering if there was anything i could do for you to make you more comfortable ah dont mind me captain nelson lilycrop said laying his head back on the pillows gooch come prop me up a bit thats it i went for the fun of it cant let lewrie have all the glory and hes half laid up himself with a nasty leg wound no one to blame but meself see one takes ones chances thankee for comin though tis moren id expect from most samson jumped up onto the bed ruler of the cabins and sniffed around for a place to lay close to his master making a couple of more fearful others jump down ah we smell all medicinal dont we sweetlin like some rum captain thank you no captain lilycrop ive never been much on rum or spirits nelson answered oh god please dont let lilycrop call him a hedgepriest alan thought if youre sure there is nothing i could do for you sir nelson said beginning to rise oh sit ye down sir we tried to do somethin right an if i didnt get hit when i did itd a been later tryin to take the battery had a funny feelin about the place soons i stepped ashore not your fault no sense lookin like a hanged spaniel on my account ive had fifty years in the fleet man an boy had to happen sometime in the last war with pocock thought i was a goner half a dozen times in the east indies nelson brightened where were you there was a knock on the door and midshipman edgar relayed a message from mr caldwell excuse me sir im wanted on deck alan said and excused himself by the time he had discovered the reason for his summons had tended to the matter of discipline and placed a seaman on report for fighting he fully expected nelson to come out of the cabins too but nelson did not a full halfhour passed before he emerged a gallant man sir nelson said his eyes a little moist as he came up to lewrie he has served long and honorably with little recognition or reward and now this aye sir alan agreed if only we had been successful i would not feel so badly at his loss nelson went on though he would be losing the ship soon in any event when the war ends but there would have been a chance for further employment the ship lacks a year till the end of her original commission sir alan pointed out shes a prize bought in out here he has a family nelson asked none that im aware of sir never married either to my knowledge i get the impression that there was a lady once but it didnt work out there is always a young lady with whom things did not work out nelson said with such a wistfulness that alan peered at him more closely he didnt look like the sort of swaggering young buck to take love and pleasure wherever he would find it and alan got the idea that nelson had been spurned rather recently and still suffered his only family is his cats sir alan went on theyre a great comfort to him yes there are rather a lot of them arent there would you like one sir alan grinned um actually no thank you nelson essayed a shy grin of his own well i must be getting on to admiral barrington to see their wounded did you have any others hurt no sir alan answered um one thing sir if i may be so bold as to ask is there any way you could do something for the captain id heard sometimes that senior postcaptains are promoted to rear admiral upon their retirement and i was wondering if there was anything like that could be done for him to promote a lieutenant to postcaptain even if it means the retired list they call them admirals of the yellow squadron mister lewrie nelson said with another grin usually because theyre too stupid to trust with a command and have too much interest to just cashier to make way for a more promising officer he means a great deal to you does he not mister lewrie yes sir he does i had no business being made first officer of this ship but he was patient with me and taught me everything i know alan confessed fifty years from powder monkey to captain of his own ship god knows how long a passed midshipman he deserves a better retirement than a lieutenants halfpay or a cripples pension god bless you sir that was well said and kindly meant nelson said almost fierce with passion and taking his hand to shake it firmly we do seem to treat our sailors in the shabbiest manner and then depend on them to save the country when anyone with good sense would run for the hills and tell us to get someone else to do the dirty work if you could make any sort of recommendation in his behalf sir id be forever in your debt alan offered and i shall sir nelson promised i shall speak for him to admiral hood once we rejoin the squadron he has treated me with great kindness in past though nelson added with a wry expression i do not know why he should continue to do so after this debacle we didnt know how strong they were sir still nelson said leading him to the entry port where his boat waited almost seeming to grow in size and importance as he began to enthuse i was always most pleasantly amazed over in nicaragua how a smaller force could prevail over a greater one if one went right at them conceive a bold plan carry it out with audacity bring all ones strength to bear upon one point like rodney did against de grasse and you give them pause they seem to step back to draw breath at your daring and once checked they are beatable i see sir alan nodded amazed at how energetic the slight little fellow could become to pause to question your own chances is to surrender the initiative to the foe fire that challenge to loord and then go at them nelson insisted lay your ship yardarm to yardarm with the enemy which is all that anyone can ask of a captain and trust to the pluck of english seamen to win you a victory given decent odds ill put my money on our men every time and then its victory or a place in westminster abbey either way youve upheld your honor or found glory without a break nelson shook lewries hand once more and went to the entry port doffed his hat to the crew in reply to the salute due him and alan was amazed that the hands were cheering perhaps in recognition of his solicitousness in coming to see their captain as most officers would not bother to do it was either heartfelt on nelsons part or it was the vainest piece of theatrics alan had seen away from a stage yet there was something about the man he had to admit uncanny sort aint he sir caldwell asked once they had the ship under way again that onell go places you mark my words wish hed come aboard and got the hands fired up before we tried to take turks island with a little of his enthusiasm wed have had the bloody place he is inspiriting ill grant you that mister caldwell alan replied but he kept to himself with an attitude like that the little minnikins going to get himself killed for certain if he keeps all that deathorglory stuff up and if turks island is any example of his skills at war id not want to be anywhere near him next time he feels inspired epilogue youll take care of my ship now mister lewrie lilycrop said as he was hoisted up to the bulwarks before being lowered into a rowing boat it was hard on the man to know that his career was over to know that he was losing the only command he had ever been entrusted with still in as much physical pain as lilycrop found himself alan knew that the mental pain was the greater at that moment lilycrop had insisted he would not go in his nightshirt and had gooch and his coxn dress him in his best lieutenants uniform strapped to a carrying board or not he would leave his ship with the proper dignity due a master and commander the marines had turned out in their best instead of pursers slops and the crew had taken as much care with their own appearance as they would have for sunday divisionsfaces shaved clean slop trousers and shirts shoes and stockings on their feet instead of the usual horny bare toes those that had decent tarred hats and short blue frockcoats had dug them out of their chests i shall sir until they send a man over to take command alan promised somberly though i dont know how theyll fill your shoes sir uh he reddened well that cant be too hard mister lewrie they only need to fill one these days dont they lilycrop asked the sarcasm dripping sorry sir alan murmured knowing what a gaffe he had made even as he said it what i meant was well sir theres no replacing you sir and even im capable of realizing it well thankee mister lewrie lilycrop relented stand me up there men they stood his carrying board on end so that lilycrop could look about his decks once more tears leaked from his eyes try as he did to control them manfully happens to the best of us lilycrop barked in his old manner to his crew shrikes a good little ship and youve been a good crew you do your duty sames you done for me an no captain in the fleet could ask for better he dug a kerchief from his pockets and wiped his nose now lets get it over with no sense keepin the flag wainn fetchedto write me if youve a mind mister lewrie same goes for the rest of ye let me know how you keep now an again aye i shall sir alan promised again enjoy the kitty youll find theyre a comfort lets go gnooch damn your eyes the bosuns pipes squealed a long salute the marines and officers brought up their swords and muskets and lilycrops carryig board was hoisted up with a yardtackle with his own sword strapped to his side the captain doffed the cocked hat he could not wear to his men one last time and svensen started a cheer for him the hands took off their hats and waved them over their heads yelling their hiphiphoorays then roaring a cacophony of approval which lasted until lilycrops gig had reached barfleurs side and he was hoisted to the deck of the flagship he waved his hat at them one last time and then was lost to view among the sideparty that paid him his due get a way on her sir caldwell asked once the hands had quieted and shuffled into small knots of sad mutters no were about to be visited it seems alan pointed out an officer was coming down barfleurs battens to enter the gig and a staytackle rigged to a main course yard was already hoisting out a sea chest our new commander looks like hope he likes cats sir caldwell quipped lilycrop had taken henrietta samson hodge and a few others with him along with his furnishings and chests but the bulk of the kittens and yearlings had been parceled out among the warrants and senior hands even edgar and rossyngton now shared the midshipmens mess with a brace of lean tabbies as a parting benison alan had been forced to accept a kitten one of henriettas latest brood a mostly black female of about four months age to his chagrin she was of pretty much the same disposition as her parent a little pest who showed the same partiality for his stockings and lap and deposited her fur with the same liberality on every stitch of bedding and clothing he possessed since she was like henrietta a starving whore for attention and petting he had named her belinda after his hellishly licentious halfsister who had been instrumental in forcing him into the navy the captain had been touched that he had named her after bloodkin and it was all that he could do not to strangle with secret ironic humor as he had tried to explain to lilycrop just who belinda was there was a possibility that shrike might soon make her way back to antigua perhaps dolly fenton would still be there during that terrible last parting she had said shed wait for him no matter how long he was away and maybe she had meant it dolly had liked cats would have been delighted to have one in their set of rooms while he was out at sea but at the time the last thing alan had wanted was to put up with a cat on land after being cooped up aboard a ship infested with platoons of them shed like belinda and would be delighted with such a reunion present if she was still there and still cared he found it suddenly very important that she still be on antigua unattached by god i hate him already whoever he is alan whispered irked that lilycrop would be losing out and going home a discarded cripple while this new officer from the admirals wardroom naturally would take his place he had surprised himself that when asking of captain nelson or when later writing to admiral hood himself he had not asked for the command of shrike he had only entertained that pleasing fantasy long after doing everything in his power for his former captain for once he had done something for someone else wholeheartedly with no thought of his own personal gain maybe it was his sense of guilt he thought maybe it was because lilycrop had been so kind and fair with him when anyone else would have chucked him for his incompetence whatever the reason lilycrop was the first captain in his experience that he would genuinely miss the sideparty formed up once more as the gig attained the ships side ships company muster by the entryport alan ordered off hats and salute a cocked hat appeared over the lip of the entryport a stern face emerged as the bosuns pipes began to trill the visage was not the old salt that alan expected this was a young man perhaps only a few years older than he a favorite blessed with membership in the flagships officers roster la coquette needed officers so officers with interest had gone into her the prize sloop that resistance and dugay trouin had taken needed officers and now like a gift from the gods another command slot had opened up for hood to fill with one of his protйgйs he did not look though like someone alan would prefer to serve even if he could have looked at him impartially there was a set to the mouth a squint to the eyes that bespoke a taut hand a hard disciplinarian one of those fellows with a harsh manner for all under him alan drew a heavy sigh then drew his sword to give the man his salute however the cat william pitt delivered his own version of salute first the cat drawn by the commotion had in answer to the curiosity of his tribe crossed the deck and wormed his way between the legs of the gathered marines pausing to mark a likely set of halfgaiters in passing but at the sight of a stranger he greeted him as lewrie had been greeted when he had signed aboard there was a challenging yowl of displeasure a slash of claws that caught the officer across the nose and a startled squawk of alarm from their new commander then losing his grip on the loosehung manropes and still vertical along the ships side instead of leaning slightly into a larger ships tumblehome shrike had none the new captain dropped from sight as if he had never been there a second later there was a rather loud thud in the gig and a chorus of shouts oh shit pitts killed him alan groaned sheathing his sword and dashing to the entryport how is he er es knocked isself hout cold sir the temporary coxn of the gig shouted back up e don look sa good ta me sir mister lewyss to the gangway on the double alan shouted lewyss turned up a moment later with a small medical bag and descended to the gig ill kill that cat caldwell vowed who was the new captain sir how the hell should i know mister caldwell alan complained he never got a chance to tell us somebody pass up his orders they should be in his pockets at least he said in a softer voice to the temporary first lieutenant we can determine whom weve murdered nasty sir mr lewyss informed them regaining the deck with the documents requested nasty cut on the back of his skull and sure to be concussed hes out like a light and i dont like the look of his right arm either sir i am certain he broke it id be happier with him in barfleur sir they have an excellent surgeon aboard im told dye see well until he read himself in hes not one of ours yet alan nodded in agreement and since hes in the boat and ready for transport thatd be best mister rossyngton aye sir the midshipman asked be so good as join the doctor in accompanying the captain back aboard barfleur alan directed handing rossyngton the injured officers orders my compliments to the flagcaptain and return these to him alan felt his face tightening with a grin he fought to suppress please extend our apologies to that worthy and inform him we require another master and commander for shrike we urn we seem to have broken this one um ah rossyngton replied crisply trying to keep his own visage free of the humors that tickled him aye aye sir christ i hope this whoever he was wasnt a particular favorite of the admirals alan prayed aloud once the boat was under way id hoped to get out of the navy with a whole skin theyll probably hang me in tar and chains after this wasnt your fault sir caldwell assured him dont see as how they can go blaming you for his clumsiness or pitt it was probably for the best maybe shrike didnt like the cut of his jib or something you know sir ships get souls after a while looked like a hard man to me maybe the ship knew he wouldnt do right by her or the people pitt surely didnt like the cut of his jib alan agreed might have done it for all the cats aboard sir caldwell went on some officers dont like pets of any kind and would have em over the side to drown maybe things work out for the best sir after all signal sir edgar called get under way thankee mister edgar bosun hands to the braces get the way back on her mister caldwell keep us on the larboard tack near the flag for now for the next hour shrike paced alongside the flagship as she caught up the squadron like a calf will plod alongside her mother and then came a signal for them to fetchto once more and the gig came back the doctor and midshipman rossyngton aboard but no sign of a new officer to command the ship evidently after the last wave of promotions suitably senior lieutenants in favor were thin on the ground this is for you sir rossyngton said presenting alan with a canvasbound sheaf of papers once he had gained the deck and come aft we are instructed to close with commodore afflecks flag sir the bedford admiral hood has deferred to him to choose another officer for us alan took the bundle a little irked at the smile that tugged at the corners of rossyngtons mouth mister caldwell alter course to close with bedford alan directed while turning away to break the stillwarm wax seal on the packet sufferin shit he muttered as he began to read my dear lt lewrie the vagaries of fate and the fickleness of dame fortune conspire to alter my intents good sir i had hoped to reward lt ishaell sharpe for his long and meritorious service as my th officer with command but it seems it is not to be in response to your generous heartfelt and commendable concerns anent your former captain lt lilycrops future and having had converse with capt nelson a young man whom i hold in the highest affection and admiration regarding both your cares and his view of the matter allow me to bid you allay your worries while my surgeons are not sanguine about his ability to hold a further sea commission they assure me he shall heal well enough that future service is not out of the question perhaps as a dockyard superintendent or officer of the impress service should he desire active employment i shall take lt lilycrop under my aegis and make the strongest advertment in my power to our lords commissioners of the admiralty to that effect well thank god for small favors alan smiled in relief he turned the letter over to read the rest of it regarding the vacancy in command of shrike basing my decision upon the favorable notice you have elicited in past by your gallant resourceful and honourable past service having myself formed an admiration of your abilities during the affair in the chesapeake and your plucky conduct during your escape and having had further converse with the gallant captain nelson and receiving from him an wholehearted approbation of your character i did most recently consider taking you into barfleur as th officer from which post of favour you might find an opening for advancement but after greeting your lt lilycrop and soliciting his own recommendations after lt sharpes recent misfortune i trust that command of a small brig of war shall suffice be assured that in future you should not be in any way hesitant in considering me your admiring patron or in availing yourself of any kindness i may be able to extend to you yrs sir saml hood r adml of the blue squadron jesus christ alan breathed with a shudder partly of delight partly of dumbstruck consternation im going to have to start taking all this nautical shit a lot more seriously he had always thought admiral hood a poltroon for his inexplicable behavior in hanging back at the battle of the chesapeake even the empty defensive victory at st kitts had not changed his opinion muchthey lost the island anyway hadnt they and now this the man must be more of an addlepate than i thought alan told himself his hands trembling as he scanned the second sheet of paper in the packet and saw what it represented anybody thatd give me command of a kings ship has to have his buttocks where his ears ought to be mind you i aint arguin much he looked up at the people on the quarterdeck rossyngton with his slight smile because he knew the secret first caldwell on tenterhooks to find out what it was all about and sweating that it perhaps might represent a chance for him to keep his acting lieutenancy id better do this before they change their bloody minds he thought feeling an urgency to read himself in before that new officer from bedford came aboard they still had at least a mile to go before they were close enough to hail her and a cutter from barfleur had not even reached her yet mister caldwell assemble the ships people if you would be so kind he ordered aye aye sir ships company caldwell boomed muster aft and face the quarterdeck once they were gathered wondering what this new summons was about alan folded out the sheet of vellum and scanned it so the words would not be unfamiliar and trip him up at this unbelievably fortunate moment issued aboard hms barfleur flagship to the leeward islands squadron this th day of march in the year of our lord from sir samuel hood rear admiral of the blue to lieutenant alan lewrie royal navy sir it is my wish and direction that you take upon yourself the charge and command of his majestys gunned brig of war shrike he paused and looked up feeling as if someone would shout over to them that they were just kidding but there were no signs of laughter from the handsno pulled faces or sidelong glances of aiarm they stared back at him nodding as though his superseding to command in place of a real sailorman was his due so he savored every syllable every nuance as he finished reading the document aloud shrike wasnt much too small and below the rate for a more senior officer he realized and she had been brought in as prize on a foreign station so the dream could end the day after the war ended and that blessed event could occur at any moment even if she stayed in service there was only a year left of her original three years commission but for now she was his what else should i say he wondered once he had rolled up the precious document a new captain he finally began slowly brings to his next command his own way of doing things but since shrike is my first command and since i have learned the most in how to exercise command in her from an officer we all revere as a real tarryhanded sailor i can think of no finer way to begin than to continue as if lieutenant lilycrop was still with us in spirit his order book his discipline and his strictures stay in effect they were sensible and fair and i see no reason to depart from them or any way to improve on them at present not trusting himself to utter one more word he turned to mr caldwell and nodded and caldwell dismissed the hands to their duties there was no wholehearted cheer such as lilycrop had gotten but no one was cursing and skulking either and no one was throwing loose objects at him so alan could be satisfied with his reception if only slightly disappointed that he did not receive the same affection lilycrop had evinced from them several hands were smiling broadly and they went off to their work at least somewhat cheerful ah mister caldwell alan said noticing caldwells hangdog expression at last i believe that commodore affleck is to be allowed to appoint a lieutenant into us to take my place sorry you could not keep your acting status i did mention you to the admiral when i wrote concerning the captain thats alright sir caldwell said though it didnt look alright it would have been his best and perhaps last opportunity to attain to a commission instead of a warrant and he was already approaching fifty who would you like for cabinservant sir and your coxn cony alan said without a seconds hesitation and then gave the matter of coxn some thought a third of the hands were island blacks and andrews was at least listed as a freebom volunteer he was deserving of some notice after florida andrews for my coxn aye ill make it so captain caldwell replied that has a nice ring to itcaptainl alan thought happily ill be aft for a moment alan said summon me when we near bedford he made his way aft of the wheel and the mainmast trunk to the low poop and the coachtop built into it to allow standing headroom for entry to the hanging cabin there was now a marine sentry on duty who banged his musket on the deck and brought it up to salute as alan opened the door that offered the short flight of steps below his cabins though they seemed more spacious with all of lieutenant lilycrops poor furniture gone they didnt look all that grand the blackandwhite checkered canvas on the deck was frayed and the wall paint had not improved with age he could see that this unlookedfor promotion was going to cost him to equip himself with dining space table and chairs a sideboard a wine cabinet desk and chairs and paint not to mention more lamps and silver and plates still he was now in receipt of five shillings per day instead of his earlier two shillings six pence eightyfour pounds a year for as long as it lasted figured at the miserly twentyeight days per lunar month of the parsimonious admiralty thought id shift yer dunnage sir cony said entering the cabins with loose bedding and linen under his aims alan could hear a couple of seamen struggling with his heavy sea chest oh there e be sir that damn cat cony snapped hmm alan replied coming out of his inventory of expenses oh him over the side with im sir cony asked william pitt was stretched out on his side on the bare strawfilled mattress of the hanging bedbox tail curling lazily and supremely at ease washing himself as if he had won the space for himself with his claws the kitten belinda was huddled as far away as she could get on the sill of the transom windows bottled up and sitting ready to pounce in flight between hisses she licked her lips and chops nervously for fear of what the bigger male cat would do you mangy young bastard alan said walking up to the bed think you earned the right to stay aft just cause you did for that lieutenant sharpe hey think im grateful to you or something pitt did not bristle up as he usually did when alan got anywhere near him but rolled to his stomach with his front paws stretched out looking up with his yellow eyes alan put out a tentative hand half expecting to get his fingers ripped off but was surprised that william pitt allowed him to actually touch the top of his wide battlescarred head and gently rub him between the ears well im damned sir cony whispered it didnt last long of course after a few too many rubs pitt had claws out and ready to swat shaking his head vigorously alan realized that it was probably not going to be one of those affectionate relationships between man and animal such as the young cat belinda offered more like adopting a wild beast with whom one could maintain a wary but grudging regard well maybe i should be grateful alan relented sweetling william pitt made his disgust plain by laying back his ears and assuming a most pained expression chuck im out an over the side sir cony asked no let him be for now cony theres room to spare crash went the marines musket on the deck sailin master sah he bellowed enter were about two cables off bedford now sir ready to fetchto to receive her boat caldwell reported very good mister caldwell i shall be on deck directly he followed caldwell out onto the quarterdeckhis quarterdeck where the warrants and others allowed the use of the deck headed down to leeward to leave him the captains prerogative of the windward side i suppose i can pull this off alan told himself i had a good set of teachersrailsford and lilycrop even kenyon god rot the sodomite if its peace soon how bad can it be and then i can go home with honor who knows they might even be daft enough to give me another commission or another command if im careful this could be all cruising and claret but a second after boastful musing he felt a tiny shiver of presentiment things had gone too well lately and from hard experience he knew that every time he felt the slightest bit smug and satisfied something always went disastrously wrong in his life the ancient gods had always taken umbrage with satisfied mortals had they not afterword turne quod optanti divum promittere nemo auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro turnus what none of the gods would have dared promise to your prayers see what rolling time has brought unasked aeneid ix virgil on april admiral hood whilst cruising off cape francois received intelligence that a preliminary peace had been signed at versailles in january m de bellecombe french governor of the cape sent a ship to his squadron inviting admiral hood and his royal highness prince william henry then serving as a midshipman aboard barfleur to enter the port and receive the honors due them hood declined though he did despatch the bloodhound sloop into harbor to take the salute of the french schombergs naval chronology does not tell us what thrilling deed or giventhe feeling against the french at the time what egregious screwup bloodhound had committed to give her this dubious honor british agents were quite active among the creek or muskogean indians and their relatives the seminoles as well as with the cherokee trying to inflame all the southeastern tribes to side with the crown in the rebellion to take pressure off charleston their last remaining port south of new york what the members of the expedition feared would happen to the indians did indeed occur they became more civilized after the revolution until they dressed lived and acted much like white settlers with wagons farms carriages plantations and mansions for some and even black slaves of their own and they were still dispossessed kicked off the land by armed bands and resettled in the oklahoma territory by the andrew jackson administration in one of the great unmentioned shames of american history there was a real muskogeanscots student who left his studies in charleston and went back to aid his people in one alexander mcgillivray on whom i based my character unfortunately he backed the spanish under governor galvez and kept his people out of the revolution though he hoped for much the same settlements and agreements as my fictional mcgilliveray did the problem was that no matter which horse they backed the indians would lose their bet for no one was prepared to live in harmony with them captain horatio nelsons encounter at turks island took place pretty much as described nelson was repulsed and forced to sail away with his tail between his legs this event has rarely if ever been mentioned by any of his biographers contemporary accounts such as schombergs naval chronology and beatsons naval and military memoirs give the impression that captain king of resistance was senior officer present and never mention nelson at all and nelson must not have been very proud of it for even his sketches of my life published before he died at trafalgar in failed to make note of it why captain king deputed himself to a lowerranking upstart has never been explained perhaps nelson cowed him by dint of overpowering personality and the urge for action nelson was indeed lucky he kept his commission he rushed in rashly throwing sailors and marines with no field artillery against troops and talented naval gunners with artillery and antiship batteries heavier than anything his frigates mountedthe th century equivalent of a reinforced battalion it was recorded by midshipman prince william henry that adml sir samuel hood tore a rather large strip of hide off nelsons backside in private for not reporting to the fleet first for assuming a position of acting commodore which he had no right to and finally for failing to retake the island perhaps mollified by the fact that nelson hadnt suffered any major casualties and had known when to fold his tents and quit hood didnt break his career as he had other officers who hacked him off the famous nelson luck was acting overtime the jemmy james trevenen mentioned just before the conference aboard albemarle was first officer of resistance he wrote his sister betsy later that the whole affair was a ridiculous expedition undertaken by a young man merely from the hope of seeing his name in the papers illdepicted at the first carried on without a plan afterward attempted to be carried into execution rashly and hastily abandoned for the reason that it ought not to have been undertaken at all trevenen was another of captain cooks officers from the voyages of discovery like king he was a real tarryhanded tarpaulin man of no mean skill as a seaman and navigator but was forced to work his way up through the royal navy slowly while people like nelson and alan lewrie seem to lead charmed lives of interest and quick advancement he was a bit miffed that resistance had captured two french warships off turks island which started the whole thing and no one least of all himself benefited from their capture in promotion or command and since the war ended weeks later their value in prizemoney wasnt a tenth of what it would have been earlier so one can understand his frustrations captain later admiral lord nelson never had a scintilla of luck on land he came close in nicaragua but the expedition failed due to sickness among the troops and a lack of drive on the part of the army nelson lost an eye and an arm on land or so close to it as to make no difference and he was always a little touchy when it came to criticism according to clenell wilkinsons biography nelson was vain open to flattery and liable to overreact when his actions were questioned no wonder he never mentioned the turks island defeat in his putative autobiography so there we are then through no fault of his own and by a series of fortunate flukes our young hero is now master and commander into a small brig of war but the war is over what shall his future be shall he take heed of past warnings and behave himself for a change shall he stay up to windward of nubile young ladies with wellarmed daddies eschew the charms of willing widows stay sober and industrious and make the most of his career opportunities in the navy perhaps shrike will pay off and he will finally get a chance to go home and live the sort of life hes been looking forward to or will soft rabbit and a young master lewrie pop up and just where do william pitt and belinda figure into this im afraid youll simply have to wait to find out as do i when dealing with an impetuous fellow wherever alan lewrie shows up though we all know that nothing will ever be the same
