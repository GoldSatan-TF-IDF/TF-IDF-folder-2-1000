w e b griffin the hostage flughafen schwechat vienna austria july as an american jeanpaul lorimer was always annoyed or embarrassed or both every time he arrived at viennas international airport the first thing one saw when entering the terminal was a starbucks kiosk the arrogance of americans to sell coffee in vienna with such a lurid red neon sign dr jeanpaul lorimer phda very black man of fortysix who was somewhat squat completely bald spoke in a nasal tone and wore the latest in european fashion including tiny blackframed glasses and italian loafers in which he more waddled than walkedhad written his doctoral thesis on central european history he knew there had been coffee in europe as early as dr lorimer also knew that after the siege of vienna in the fleeing turkish army left behind bags of black fodder franz georg kolschitzky a viennese who had lived in turkey recognized it as coffee kolschitzky promptly opened the first coffeehouse it offered free newspapers for his customers to read while they were drinking his coffee which he refined by straining out the grounds and adding milk and sugar it was an immediate success and coffee almost immediately became a part of cultured society in the austrohungarian empire and spread from there around the world dr lorimer waddled past the line of travelers at the kiosk shaking his head in disgust and now the americans are bringing it as if they invented it like cocacola to the world spreading american culture good god outrageous dr jeanpaul lorimer no longer thought of himself as an american for the past twentytwo years he had been a career professional employee of the united nations with the personal rank of minister for the past five his title was chief european directorate of interagency coordination it had its headquarters in paris and thus he had lived there nearly a quartercentury he had purchased an apartment several years ago on rue monsieur in the vii arrondissement and plannedwhen the time was rightto buy a little house somewhere on the cote dazur he hadnt even considered until recently ever returning to the united states to live dr lorimers blue goldstamped united nations diplomatic passport saw him waved quickly past the immigration officer on duty he got in the taxi line watched as the driver put his small takeaboard suitcase into the trunk of a mercedes got in the back and told the driver in german to take him to an address on cobenzlgasse lorimer had mixed feelings most of them bad about vienna starting with the fact that it was difficult to get here from paris by air there was no direct service one had to go to either london or brussels first to catch a plane today because he had to get here as quickly as possible hed come via london an extra hour and a half of travel time that got him here two hours earlier than going through brussels would have there was the train of course the mozart but that took forever whenever he could lorimer dispatched one of his people to deal with things in vienna it was a beautiful city of course lorimer thought of it as the capital city of a nonexistent empire but it was very expensivenot that that mattered to him anymoreand there was a certain racist ambience there was practically none of that in paris which was one of the reasons lorimer loved france generally and paris in particular he changed his line of thought from the unpleasant to the pleasant while there was nothing at all wrong with the women in paris a little variety was always pleasant you could have a buxom blond from poland or russia here in vienna and that wasnt always the case in paris jeanpaul lorimer had never married when hed been working his way up there just hadnt been the time or the money and when he reached a position where he could afford to marry there still hadnt been the time there had been a film about ten years ago in which the actor michael caine had played a senior diplomat who similarly simply didnt have the time to take a wife and had found his sexual release with topnotch hookers jeanpaul reluctantly had identified with caines character the apartment lorimer was going to was the viennese piedaterre of henri douchon a lebanese business associate henri as lorimer was of negroid ancestrywith some arab of course but a blackskinned man taller and more slenderwho also had never married and who enjoyed buxom blond women henri also liked lithe blond young menthat sort of thing was common in the middle eastbut he sensed that jeanpaul was made uncomfortable in that ambience and ran them off from the apartment when jeanpaul was in town replacing them with the buxom blond poles or whatever they both liked sometimes four or even six of them i might as well enjoy myself god only knows what will happen tomorrow there was no response to the doorbell of the apartment when jeanpaul rang it henri had not answered his phone either when jeanpaul called that morning from paris to tell him he was coming he had called from one of the directorates phonesnot hisso the call couldnt be traced to him and he hadnt left a message on the answering machine either for the same reason but he knew henri was in town because when he was not he unplugged his telephone which caused the number to ring forever without activating the answering machine jeanpaul waited exactly ninety secondstiming it with his omega chronometer as he looked back onto cobenzlgasse the cobblestone street that he knew led up the hill to the position where field marshal radetsky had his headquarters when the turks were at the gates of viennabefore putting his key in the lock there was no telling what henri might be doing and might be unwilling to immediately interrupt it was simply good manners to give him ninety seconds when he pushed the door open he could hear musicbartok jeanpaul decidedwhich suggested henri was at home henri he called cest moi jeanpaul there was no answer as he walked into the apartment there was an odor he could not immediately identify the door from the sitting room to henris bedroom was open the bed was mussed but empty jeanpaul found henri in the small office which henri somewhat vainly called the study he was sitting in the leatherupholstered highback desk chair his arms were tied to the arms with leather belts he was naked his throat had been cutcut through almost to the point of decapitation his hairy somewhat flabby chest was bloodsoaked and blood had run down from his mouth over his chin there was a bloody kitchen knife on the desk and a bloody pair of pliers jeanpaul was made uncomfortable by the sight of course but he was never anywhere close to panic or nausea or anything like that he had spent a good deal of time as he worked his way up in the united nations in places like the congo and had grown accustomed to the sight and smell of mutilated bodies he looked again at the body and at the desk and concluded that before theyd cut his throat they had torn out two fingernails and thenprobably laterhalf a dozen of his teeth the torso and upper thighs had also been slashed in many places probably with the knife i knew something like this would probably happen but not this soon i thought at the minimum we would have another two weeks or so did anyone see me come in no i gave the cabdriver the address of a house six up cobenzlgasse from this one and made sure that he saw me walking up the walk to it before he drove off is there anything incriminating in the apartment probably after what they did to him there is nothing of interest or value left and it doesnt matter anyway its time for me to go the only question seems to be whether they will be waiting for me in paris it is possible this is only a warning to me but certainly i cant operate on that assumption dr jeanpaul lorimer walked calmly out of the study reclaimed his carryon suitcase where hed left it when coming in paused thoughtfully a moment then took the key to the apartment from his pocket and laid it on the table by the door then he walked out of the apartment and onto cobenzlgasse dragging his suitcase behind him he walked down the hill to the streetcar loop and when one came got on it when the streetcar reached the vienna opera on karnter ring he got off and then boarded a streetcar that carried him to the vienna west railroad station on mariahilferstrasse he bought a ticket for a private single room on train en charging it to his united nations platinum american express card then seeing that he had enough time before the train would leave for pariss gare de lest at eight thirtyfour he walked out of the station found a coffeehouse and ordered a double coffee mit schlagobers and took a copy of the wiener kurier from the rack to read while he drank his coffee two rue monsieur paris vii france july dr jeanpaul lorimer took a last sad look around his apartment he knew he was going to miss so many of his thingsand not only the exquisite antiques he had been able to afford in recent yearsbut there was simply nothing that could be done about it he also had second thoughts about leaving nearly seven thousand euros in the safe seven thousand euros was right at eight thousand us dollars but leaving just about everythingincluding money in the safewould almost certainly confuse at least for a while anyone looking for him and it wasnt as if he would be going to shangrila without adequate financial resources spread more or less equally between the banco central the banco cofac the banco de credito and the banco hipotecario were sixteen million dollars more money than jeanpaul could have imagined having ten years before and in shangrila there was both a luxury apartment overlooking a white sand beach of the atlantic ocean and a hundred or so miles farther north in san jose an isolated twothousandhectare estancia on which cattle were being profitably raised all of the property and bank accounts were in the name of jeanpaul bertrand whose lebanese passport issued by the lebanese foreign ministry carried jeanpaul lorimers photograph and thumbprint getting the passport had cost a fortune but it was now obvious that it was money well spent jeanpaul was taking with him only two mediumsized suitcases plus the takeaboard suitcase hed had with him in vienna spread between the three was one hundred thousand us dollars in neat little packs of five thousand dollars each it was more or less concealed in shoes socks inner suit jacket pockets and so on he had already steeled himself to throwing away the cash if it developed he could not travel to shangrila without passing through a luggage inspection he also had five thousand dollarsin five packets of a thousand eachin various pockets of his suit and four passports all bearing his likeness but none of them issued by any government jeanpaul had some trouble with the two suitcases and the carryaboard until he managed to flag down a taxi but after that things went smoothly from charles de gaulle international he flew on royal air maroc as omar del danti a moroccan national to mohamed v international in casablanca two hours later he boarded as maurice leland a french national an air france flight to dakars yoff international airport in senegal still as leland at ninethirty that night he boarded the al italia flight to sao paolo brazil there he boarded a twinturboprop aircraft belonging to nordeste linhas aereas a brazilian regional airline and flew to santa maria in santa maria after calling his estancia manager he got on an enormous intercity busnicer he thought than any greyhound hed ever been on there was a television screen for each seat a cold buffet and even some rather nice if generic red wineand rode it for about two hundred miles to jaguarao a farming town straddling the braziluruguay border ricardo his estancia manager was waiting for him there with a toyota land cruiser they had a glass of a much better red a local merlot in a decent if somewhat primitive restaurant and then drove out of town which also meant into uruguay if there was some sort of passport control on either side of the border dr lorimer didnt see it two hours later the land cruiser turned off a wellmaintained gravel road and passed under a wroughtiron sign reading shangrila welcome home doctor ricardo said thank you ricardo jeanpaul said and then im going to be here for a while the fewer people who know that the better i understand doctor and i think mantoman ricardo that you will understand ill more than likely be in need of a little company tonight doctor you must be tired from your travel well lets see if you can come up with something that will rekindle my energy there are one or two maids young girls ricardo said that you may find interesting good dr lorimer said ten minutes later the land cruiser pulled up before a rambling onestory whitepainted masonry house half a dozen servants came quickly out of the house to welcome el patron home one of them a lightskinned girl who appeared to be about sixteen did indeed look interesting dr lorimer smiled at her as he walked into the house three the united states embassy avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina july j winslow masterson a very tall welldressed very black african american of fortytwo who was almost belligerently american and loathed most things french stood leaning on the frame of his office window looking at the demonstration outside mastersons office was on the second floor of the embassy building just down the hall from that of the ambassador masterson was deputy chief of mission read number two or executive officer or deputy ambassadorand at the moment was the acting minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states to the republic of argentina the ambassador juan manuel silvio was across the riverin montevideo uruguayhaving taken a more or less working lunch with michael a mcgrory the minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states to the republic of uruguay the two ambassadors or their chiefs of mission got together regularly every two weeks either in buenos aires or montevideo silvio had taken the redeye the first flight from jorge newbery airport in downtown buenos aires which departed on the twentysixminute flight to montevideo at am and he would return on the pm busquebus the highspeed catamaran ferry made the trip in just over three hours the ambassador said that much time allowed him to deal uninterrupted in the comfortable firstclass cabin with at least some of the bureaucratic papers that accumulated on his desk there were masterson guessed maybe three hundred demonstrators today banging pots and pans held back by fences and maybe fifty cops of the mounted police half of them actually on horseback the demonstrators wavedat least when they thought the tv cameras were rollingbanners protesting the international money fund the united states role therein american fiscal policy and america generally there were at least a half dozen banners displaying the likeness of ernesto che guevara the argentine adulation of guevara both surprised and annoyed masterson he admitted a grudging admiration for fidel castro who had taken a handful of men into the mountains of cuba for training then overthrown the cuban government and had been giving the finger to the worlds most powerful nation ever since but guevara was another story guevara an argentine who was a doctor had been castros medic but as far as masterson knew that was all he had ever done to successfully further the cause of communism as a revolutionary he had been a spectacular failure his attempt to communize africa had been a disaster all it had taken to see him flee the african continent with his tail between his legs was a hundredoddman covert detachmentof african american special forces soldiers and when hed moved to bolivia an even smaller covert group of green berets this one mostly made up of cubanamericans had been waiting for him not so much to frustrate his revolutionary ambitions as to make him a laughingstock all over latin america the green berets had almost succeeded for example they had almost gleefully reported that guevara had taken a detachment of his grandly named revolutionary army on an overnight training exercise promptly gotten lost in the boonies drowned four of his men trying to cross a river and taken two weeks to get back to his base barely surviving on a diet of monkeys and other small but edible jungle animals and when he got back to his base guevara found that it was under surveillance by the bolivian army a farmer had reported the revolutionary army to the bolivian government in the belief they were drug smugglers the president of bolivia however was not amused nor receptive to the idea that the best way to deal with dr guevara was to publicly humiliate him he ordered a quick summary courtmartialthe bearing of arms with the intent of overthrowing a government by force and violence being punishable by death under international lawfollowed by a quick execution and guevara became a legend instead of a joke lost in thought jack a familiar voice that of alexander b darby asked behind him darbys official title was embassy commercial attache but among the senior officersit wasnt exactly a closely guarded secret that he actually was the cias station chief masterson turned and smiled at the small plump man with a pencilline mustache my usual unkind thoughts about che guevara theyre still out there masterson nodded it looked like rain i hoped it would and they would go away no such luck you about ready at your disposal sir masterson said and started for the door masterson was bumming a ride home with darby who lived near him in the suburb of san isidro his own embassy car had been in a fender benderthe second this monthand was in the shop the boss back darby asked as they got on the elevator that would take them to the basement he should be shortly he took the busquebus masterson replied maybe he was hoping it would rain too darby said masterson chuckled if the demonstrations outside the embassy did nothing else they made getting into and out of the embassy grounds a royal pain in the ass the demonstrators sure that the tv cameras would follow them rushed to surround embassy cars beyond thumping on the roofs and shaking their fists at those inside the carthey could see only the drivers clearly the windows in the rear were heavily darkenedthey didnt do much damage but it took the mounted police some time to break their ranks so that the cars could pass and there was always the risk of running over one of them or more likely that a demonstratorwho hadnt been touchedwould suddenly start howling for the cameras loudly complaining the gringo imperialists had run over his foot with malicious intent that was an almost sure way to get on the evening news and in clarin buenos airess tabloid newspaper the elevator took them to the basement a dimly lit area against one wall of which was a line of cars most of them were the privately owned vehicles of secondary embassy personnel not senior enough to have an official embassy car and driver but ranking high enough to qualify for a parking slot in the basement there was a reserved area on the curb outside the embassy grounds for the overflow closest to the ramp leading up from the basement were parking spaces for the embassys vehicles the jeep wagoneers and such used for taxi service and for the half dozen nearly identical embassy cars these were new or nearly new bmws they were either dark blue or black and series models and they were all armored they all carried diplomat license plates there were five of these vehicles lined up as masterson and darby crossed the basement the big black li reserved for the ambassador was there and its spare and darbys car and the consul generals and ken lowerys lowery was the embassys security officer the military attaches car was gonehe had a tendency to go home earlyand mastersons was in the shop getting the right front fender replaced darbys driver who had been sitting on a folding chair at the foot of the ramp with the other drivers got up when he saw them coming and had both rear doors open for them by the time they reached darbys car one of the many reasons it wasnt much of a secret that alex darby was the cia station chief was that he had a personal embassy car none of the other attaches did all the drivers were employees of the private security service that guarded the embassy they were all supposed to be retired policemen which permitted them the right to carry a gun it wasnt much of a secret either that all of them were really in the employ of argentinas intelligence service called side which was sort of an argentine version of the cia the secret service and the fbi combined well be dropping mr masterson at his house darby announced when they were in the car go there first actually betsys going to be waiting for meis in fact probably already waiting for meat the kansas masterson said drop me there please the kansas was a widely popular restaurant on avenida libertador in a classy section of buenos aires called san isidro getting out of the embassy grounds was not simple first the security people checked the identity of the driver and then the passengers and then logged their time out on the appropriate form then for reasons masterson didnt pretend to understand the car was searched starting with the trunk and ending with the undercarriage being carefully examined using a large round mirror on a pole only then was the car permitted to approach the gate when that happened three threefootindiameter barriers were lowered into the pavement by the time that happened the lookout stationed at the gate by the demonstrators had time to summon the protestors and one of the mounted police sergeants had time to summon reinforcements two dozen of whom either ran up on foot or trotted up on horseback to force the passage of the car through the demonstrators then the double gates were opened the car left the embassy grounds and the demonstrators began to do their thing no real damage was done but the thumping on the roof of the bmw was unnerving and so were the hateful faces of some of the demonstrators only some from what masterson could see most of the demonstrators just seemed to be having a good time in a minute or so they were through the demonstrators and finding a hole in the fastmoving traffic headed for avenida libertador alex darby gestured in the general direction of the residencethe ambassadors home a huge stone mansionwhich faced on avenida libertador about five hundred yards from the embassy masterson looked and saw a pack of demonstrators running from the embassy to the residence no wonder hes taking his time getting back on the busquebus darby said if hed been at the embassy hed have had to run the gauntlet twice once to get out of the embassy and again to get in the residence a hundred yards past the residence there was no sign whatever of the howling mob at the embassy there was a large park on their right with joggers and people walking dogs and rows of elegant apartment buildings on their left until they came to the railroad bridge on the far side of the bridge they had the armys polo fields to their left and the racetrack the hipodromo on their right there was nothing going on at the polo fields but the horse fanciers were already lining up for the evenings races then there were more rows of tall apartment buildings on both sides of the street they passed under an elevated highway which meant they were passing from the city of buenos aires into the province of buenos aires the city of buenos aires masterson often thought was like the district of columbia and the province a state like maryland or virginia it looks like traffics not so bad alex said masterson leaned forward to look out the windshield they were passing a carrefour a frenchowned supermarket chain masterson who had served a tour as a junior consular officer in the paris embassy and thought he had learned something of the french refused to shop there youre right masterson said just as the driver laid heavily on the horn there came a violent push to the side of the bmw immediately followed by the sound of tearing and crushing metal the impact threw darby and masterson violently against their seat belts there came another crash this one from the rear and again they felt the painful pressure of the restraints the driver swore in rapidfire spanish jesus christ masterson exploded as he tried to sit straight in his seat you all right jack darby asked yeah i think so masterson said jesus christ again these goddamn crazy argentine drivers take it easy darby said quickly scanning the situation outside their windows with the practiced eye of a spook masterson tried to open the door it wouldnt budge well have to get out your side alex he said thats not going to be easy darby said gesturing toward the flow of traffic on the street the driver got out of the car stepped into the flow of traffic and held up his hand like a policeman masterson thought idly that the driver had probably started his career as a traffic cop a policeman ran up the driver snapped something at him and the policeman took over the job of directing traffic the driver came back to the car and darby and masterson got out masterson saw the pickup that had first struck them was backing away from them it was a fourdoor ford f pickup with a massive set of stainless steel tubes mounted in front of the radiator he thought first that the tubeswhich were common on pickup trucks to push other vehicles out of the mud on country roads were probably going to have a minor scratch or two and the bmw was probably going to need a new door and a new rear body panel then he saw the car a volkswagen golf that had hit them from the rear the right side of the windshield was shattered he went quickly to the passenger door and pulled it open a young man welldressed was sitting there looking dazed holding his fingers to his bloody forehead masterson had an unkind thought if you didnt think seat belts were for sissies you macho sonofabitch your head wouldnt have tried to go through the windshield he waved his fingers before the mans eyes the man looked at him with mingled curiosity and annoyance lets get you out of there senor masterson said in fluent spanish i think it would be better for you to lie down he saw that the driver was an attractive young womanprobably senor machos wife argentine men dont let their girlfriends drive their cars for fear it will make them look unmanlywho looked dazed but didnt seem to be hurt she was wearing her seat belt and the airbag on the steering wheel had deployed alex masterson called get this lady out of here then he pulled his cloth handkerchief from his pants pocket pressed it to the mans bleeding forehead and placed the mans right hand to hold it keep pressure on it masterson said as he helped the man out of the volkswagen and to the curb he got him to sit then asked need to lie down im all right the man said muchas gracias youre sure nothings broken the man moved his torso as if testing for broken bones and then smiled wanly alex darby led the young woman to the curb she saw the man and the bloody handkerchief sucked in her breath audibly and dropped to her knees to comfort him it was an intimate moment masterson looked away the big ford truck that had crashed into them was disappearing into the carrefour parking lot the sonofabitch is running away masterson shouted at the policeman directing traffic finally caught his attention and pointing at the pickup shouted that he was running away the policeman gestured that he understood but as he was occupied directing traffic there wasnt much that he could do goddammit to hell masterson took his cellular telephone from his inside pocket and punched an autodial number when there was no response he looked at the screen no bars i am in the only fucking place in buenos aires where theres no cellular signal darby saw the cellular in mastersons hand and asked youre calling the embassy no goddamn signal darby took his cellular out and confirmed that ill call it in with the radio he said and walked quickly to the bmw a minute later he came back lowery asked if were all right he said i told him yes hes sending an automobile club wrecker and a car itll probably take a little while for the car the demonstrators are still at it the sonofabitch who hit us took off masterson said really youre sure yes goddammit im sure take it easy jack these things happen nobodys hurt he is masterson said nodding at senor macho the cops and an ambulance will be here soon im sure betsys going to shit a brick when im late masterson said and i cant call her get on the radio and have the guard at post one call her at the kansas masterson considered that no he decided aloud shell just have to be pissed i dont want the guard calling her and telling her ive been in another wreck four restaurant kansas avenida libertador san isidro buenos aires province argentina july elizabeth betsy masterson a tall slim wellgroomed thirtysevenyearold with the sharp features and brownish black skin that made her think her ancestors had been of the watusi tribe was seated alone at the bar of kansasthe only place smoking was permitted in the elegant steakhouse she looked at her watch for the fifth time in the past ten minutes exhaled audibly had unkind thoughts about the opposite sex generally and jack her husband specifically and then signaled to the bartender for another lagarde merlot and lit another cigarette goddamn him he knows that i hate to sit at the bar alone as if im looking for a man and he said hed be here between quarter to seven and seven jacks embassy car had been in a fender bender another fender bender the second this monthand was in the shop and he had caught a ride to work and was catching a ride home with alex darby the embassys commercial attache jack had called her and asked if she could pick him up at kansas as for some reason it would be inconvenient for alex to drop him at the house the mastersons and the darbys both on their second tours in buenos aires had opted for embassy houses in san isidro rather than for apartments in palermo or belgrano their first tours had taught them there was a downside to the elegant apartments the embassy leased in the city they were of course closer to the embassy but they were noisy sometimes the elevators and the airconditioning didnt work and parking required negotiating a narrow access road to a crowded garage sometimes two floors below street level and they had communal swimming pools if they had swimming pools at all the houses the embassy leased in san isidro were nice and came with a garden a quincho outdoor barbecueand a swimming pool this was important if you had kids and the mastersons had three the schools were better in san isidro and the shopping and avenida libertador was lined with nice shops and lots of good restaurants and of course there were easyaccess garages for what the state department called privately owned vehicles the masterson pov was a dark green chrysler town amp country van with three kids all with bicycles you needed something that large but it was big and betsy didnt even like to think about trying to park what the mastersons called the bus in an underground garage in the city when she went to buenos aires to have lunch with jack or whatever she never used a garage the bus had diplomat license plates and that meant you could park anywhere you wanted you couldnt be ticketed or towed or even stopped for speeding diplomatic immunity the price for the house and the nice shops good restaurants and better schools of san isidro was the twiceaday thirtysometimes fortyfiveminute ride through the insane traffic on libertador to the embassy but jack paid that her bartenderone of four tending the oval bar islandcame up with a bottle of lagarde in one hand and a fresh glass in the other he asked with a raised eyebrow if she wanted the new glass this is fine thank you betsy said in spanish the bartender filled her glass almost to the brim i probably shouldnt have done that she thought the way they pour in here two glasses is half a bottle and with half a bottle in me im probably going to say something however well deservedto jack that ill regret later but she picked the glass up carefully and took a good swallow from it she looked up at the two enormous television screens mounted high on the wall for the bar patrons one of them showed a soccer gamewhat argentines as well as most of the world called footballand the other was tuned to a news channel there was no sound that she could hear typical argentina she thought unkindly rather than make a decision to provide the audio to one channel which would annoy the watchers of the other compromise by turning both off that way nobody should be annoyed she didnt really understand the football so she turned her attention to the news there was another demonstration at the american embassy hordes of people banging on drums and kitchen pots and waving banners including several of che guevarawhich for some reason really annoyed jackbeing held behind barriers by the mounted police thats probably why jacks late he couldnt get out of the embassy but he could have called the image of a distinguishedlooking graybearded man in a business suit standing before a microphone came on the screen betsy recognized him as the prominent businessman whose collegeaged son had been a highprofile kidnapping victim as the demands for ransom went higher and higher the kidnappers had cut off the boys fingers one by one and sent them to his father to prove he was still alive shortly after the father paid the boys bodyshot in the headwas found the father was now one of the biggest thorns in the side of the president and his administration kidnappingsometimes with the participation of the copswas big business in argentina the buenos aires herald the americanowned englishlanguage newspaper had that morning run the story of the kidnapping of a thirteenyearold girl thought to be sold into prostitution such a beautiful country with such ugly problems the image shifted to one of a secondrate american movie star being herded through a horde of fans at the ezeiza airport betsy took a healthy swallow of the merlot checked the entrance again for signs of her husband and returned her attention to the tv screen ten minutes laterwell enoughs enough to hell with him let him stand on the curb and try to flag a taxi down im sorry its not raining she laid her american express card on the bar caught the bartenders eye and pointed at the card he smiled and nodded and walked to the cash register when he laid the tab on the bar before her she saw that the two glasses of the really nice merlot and the very nice plate of mixed cheeses and crackers came to in argentine pesos or eight bucks us she felt a twinge of guilt the mastersons had lived well enough on their first tour when the peso equaled the dollar now with the dramatic devaluation of the peso they lived like kings it was indeed nice but also it was difficult to completely enjoy with so many suffering so visibly she nodded and he picked up the tab and her credit card and went back to the cash register betsy went in her purse and took out a wad of pesos and pulled a fivepeso note from it for some reason you couldnt put the tip on a credit card five pesos was about twenty percent and jack was always telling her that the argentines were grateful for ten percent but the bartender was a nice young man who always took good care of her and he probably didnt make much money five pesos was a buck sixty when the bartender came back with the american express form she signed it took the carbon laid the fivepeso note on the original and pushed it across the bar to him muchas gracias senora youre welcome betsy said in spanish she put the credit card in her wallet and then the wallet in her purse and closed it she slipped off the bar stool and walked toward the entrance this gave her a view of the kitchen intentionally on display behind a plateglass wall she was always fascinated at what in a sense was really a feeding frenzy she thought there must be twenty men in chefs whites tending a halfdozen stainless steel stoves a huge woodfired parrilla grill and other kitchen equipment all busy as hell the nosmoking dining room of the kansas was enormous and usually full the entrance foyer was crowded with people giving their names to the greetergirls to get on the getseated roster one of the greeters saw betsy coming and walked quickly to hold open the door for her betsy went out onto avenida libertador and looked up and down the street no husband she turned right on the sidewalk toward what she thought of as the parkyourself entrance to the kansas parking lot there were two entrances to the large parking area behind the restaurant the other provided valet parking betsy never used it she had decided long ago when they had first started coming to the kansas that it was really a pain in the youknowwhere the valet parkers were young kids who opened the door for you handed you a claim check and then hopped behind the wheel and took off with a squeal of tires into the parking lot where they proved their manhood by coming as close to other cars as they could without taking off a fender and then when you left you had to find the claim check and stand outside waiting for a parker to show up so you could give it to him he then took off at a run into the parking lot a couple of minutes later the bus would arrive with a squeal of tires and the parker would jump out with a big smile and a hand out for his tip it was easier and quicker to park the bus yourself and when you were finished with dinneror waiting for a husband who didnt show the simple courtesy of calling and saying he was delayed and who didnt answer his cellularall you had to do was walk into the parking lot get in the bus and drive off when shed come in today the parking lot had been nearly full and shed had to drive almost to the rear of it to find a home for the bus but no problem it wasnt that far and the lot was well lit with bright lights on tall poles on the little grassygarden islands between the rows of parked cars she was a little surprised and annoyed when she saw that the light shining down on the bus had burned out things like that happened of course but she thought she was going to have a hell of a hard time finding the keyhole in the door when she actually got to the bus it was worse some sonofabitchone of the valet parkers probablyhad parked a peugeot sedan so close to the left side of the van that there was no way she could get to the door without scraping her rear andor her boobs on either the dirty peugeot or the bus which also needed a bath she walked around to the right side of the bus and with some difficultyfor a while she thought she was going to have to light her lightermanaged to get the key in the lock and open the door she was wearing a tight skirt and the only way she was going to be able to crawl over the passenger seat and the whateveritwascalled thing between the seats to get behind the wheel was to hike the skirt up to her crotch first things first get rid of the purse then hike skirt she opened the sliding door and tossed her purse on the seat the front door suddenly slammed shut what the hell she looked to see what had happened there was a man coming toward her between the cars he had something in his hand what the hell is that a hypodermic needle she first felt arms wrap around her from behind then a hand over her mouth she started to struggle she tried to bite at the hand over her mouth as the man coming toward her sort of embraced her she felt a sting on her buttocks oh jesus chri four minutes later a dark blue bmw i with heavily darkened windows and a corps diplomatique license plate pulled out of the flow of traffic on avenida libertador and stopped at the curb it was a clearly marked no parking no stopping zone but usually as now there were two or three cars with cd tags parked there in the rear seat of the bmw jack masterson turned to alex darby now that your car has joined mine in the shop how are you going to get to work in the morning i can have one of my guys pick me up alex replied wouldnt you rather i did i was hoping youd ask eightfifteen fine you want me to send this one back here after he drops me off no betsy has the bus send this one back to the embassy he raised his voice and switched to spanish make sure the dispatcher knows i need a car at my house at eight tomorrow morning si senor the driver replied that presumes masterson said to darby that im still alive in the morning she who hates to wait is going to be highly pissed darby chuckled masterson got out of the car and halftrotted across the sidewalk to the kansas entrance he pushed his way through the crowd of people waiting to be seated and went up the shallow threestep stairs to the bar betsy was nowhere in sight either at the bar or in one of the half dozen booths shit one of the bartenders caught his eye and held up his hands in a helpless gesture jack walked to him you just missed her senor the bartender said not two minutes ago she left shit maybe i can catch her in the parking lot muchas gracias he said and then hurriedly went back through the entrance foyer and left through the door leading to the valet parking entrance if she used valet parking she might still be waiting betsy was nowhere in sight shit jack trotted into the parking lot and looked around he didnt see the bus anywhere at first and then he did in the back of the lot the interior lights were on which meant shed just gotten to the car he took off at a dead run for the bus i dont have any idea what shes doing with the door open but it means i probably can get there before she drives off sweetheart im sorry he called when he got to the bus where the hell is she there was no room to get to the drivers door and when he got to the passenger side he saw that it wasnt open just not fully closed that explained the interior lights being on where the hell is she he slid the sliding door open enough so that he could slam it shut he saw the purse on the seat oh jesus h christ he said softly he took his cellular from his shirt pocket and pushed an autodial button answer the fucking phone alex alex darby alex i think youd better come back here come to the rear of the parking lot darby heard the tone of mastersons voice jesus whats up the bus is here the door was half open betsys purse is on the backseat no betsy i dont like the looks of this on my way jack hand me the microphone and turn the speaker up alex darby said to his driver and then head back to the kansas fast si senor the driver said and took the shortwave radio microphone from where it lay on the passenger seat and handed it to darby the shortwave net provided encrypted voice communication allegedly the encryption was unbreakable very few people believed this alex keyed the mic darby to lowery almost instantly the speaker came to life yeah alex whats up i just had a call from jack masterson something very unusual is going on at the kansas on aven in san isidro lowery cut him off that kansas right his van is there and his wifes purse but no wife jack sounds very concerned ill call the san isidro cops lowery said im in belgrano ten twelve minutes out on my way thanks ken lets hope shes in the can powdering her nose lowery said see you there lowery out jack masterson scanning the parking lot and making mental notes of what and who were in the immediate area pushed another autodial button on his cellular phone post one staff sergeant taylor the marine guard on duty at the embassy said as he answered the unlisted telephone this is masterson i need to speak to ken lowery now sir mr lowery has left the embassy may i suggest you try to get him on the radio i dont have a goddamn radio you contact him and tell him to call me on my cellular tell him its an emergency yes sir five the residence avenida libertador y calle john f kennedy palermo buenos aires argentina july hola ambassador juan manuel silvio said picking up the telephone beside his armchair in the sitting room of the ambassadorial apartment on the third floor of the residence alex mr ambassador we have a problem tell me everything points to betsy masterson having been kidnapped from the parking lot of the kansas in san isidro about an hour ago for a long moment the ambassador didnt reply he was always careful with his words ken lowery is aware of this he asked finally yes sir im in kens car headed downtown from the kansas jack i talked him into going home sir my wife is on her way over there why dont you and ken come here alex silvio asked and i think it might be useful if tony santini came too i could call him anthony j santini listed in the embassy telephone directory as the assistant financial attache was in fact a secret service agent dispatched to buenos aires to as he put it look for funny money that meant both counterfeit currency and illegally acquired money being laundered ill call him sir then ill see you here in a few minutes alex thank you the ambassador said and hung up youll call who ken lowery inquired tony santini alex darby replied the ambassador wants him there too the residence or the embassy residence darby replied then added i guess he figures tony is the closest thing we have to the fbi there were no legal attachesfbi agentsat the embassy at the moment there were a half dozen across the river looking for moneylaundering operations money laundering in argentina had just about dried up after the argentine government had without warning several years before forcibly converted dollar deposits to pesos at an unfavorable rate and then sequestered the pesos international drug dealers didnt trust argentine banks any more than industry did and moved their laundering to uruguay and elsewhere darby punched an autodial button on his cellular to call santini ambassador juan manuel silvio was a tall lithe fairskinned welltailored man with an erect carriage and an aristocratic manner and when he opened the door to the ambassadorial apartment alex darby thought again that silvio looked like the models in advertisements for twelveyearold scotch or tenthousanddollar wristwatches he was a cubanamerican brought from castros cuba as a child his family had arrived in miami he said on their fortysixfoot chriscraft sportfisherman with nothing but the clothing on their backs and a large cigar humidor stuffed with his mothers jewelry and hundreddollar bills my father was one of the few who recognized castro as more than a joke he had once told darby what he didnt get quite right was how quickly castro would march into havana darby knew he wasnt boasting but the opposite silvio was proud ofand greatly admiredhis fellow cubans who had arrived in miami with nothing but the clothes on their backs and subsequently prospered he simply wanted to make it plain that it had been much easier for his family than it had been for other refugees silvio graduated from his fathers alma mater spring hill college a jesuit institution in mobile alabama with a long history of educating the children of upperclass latin americans took a law degree at harvard and then a doctorate in political science at the university of alabama he joined the state department on graduation he joked my father decided that the family owed one son to the service of the united states i am the youngest son so to my brothers delight here i am while they bask in the miami sun alex darby liked the ambassador both personally and professionally he had served in other american embassies where the ambassadorscareer state department and political appointees alikehad demonstrated an appalling lack of knowledge of geopolitics and history and had regarded the cia especially and the other embassy outsidersthe fbi and the drug enforcement administration dea and the secret service and even the military attaches who worked under the defense intelligence agency diaas dangerous nuisances who had to be kept on a very tight leash lest they disrupt the amiable ambience of diplomatic cocktail parties it was a given to ambassador silvio that communism in latin america was not dead that it posed a genuine threat to the united states that islamic fascism was present in latin america and growing stronger and posed an even greater threat to the united states and that the drug trade financed both his attitude toward and support of darby and the other outsiders made their work easier even if it did tend to annoy the real foreign service staff at the embassy the ambassador heard out darbys report of what had happened considered what he had heard for a long moment and then asked lowery and santini if either had anything to add lowery said no sir and santini shook his head the priorities as i see them the ambassador said are to get betsy back to her family and then to help jack through this any comments on that all three men shook their heads lowery said no sir again the policia federal are in on this i presume yes sir lowery said were you considering involving side alex i think side already knows whats happened sir darby replied but i can make a call or two if lets hold off on that for a while do you think side has informed the foreign ministry i think we have to assume they will sir the policia federal probably already have do you think this is politically motivated do we have any reason to suspect this is a terrorist act it may be of course darby said but weve always thought that if the ragheads were going to do anything it would be a violent act either a bomb at the embassy or here or a driveby assassination attempt on you you think it may be a runofthemill kidnapping silvio interrupted sir i dont know what to think but if i had to make a choice that seems most likely but kidnapping not only an american but one with diplomatic status that doesnt strike me as being smart it will certainly get side and the police off their a get them moving lowery said this is really going to embarrass the government mr santini you have any thoughts not many sir but my experience with what the sociologists call the criminal element has been that they often do stupid things because theyre usually stupid i wouldnt be surprised if these guys missed the diplomat tag on the car and when they learn who mrs masterson is you think they may let her go i hate to say this sir santini replied but i think its better than fiftyfifty that they wont she can identify them jesus christ lowery said another scenario santini said is that they wont care about her diplomatic status and may just demand a ransom and if paid let her go we can assume only that theyre willing to break the law not that they are going to act rationally the ambassador asked is this going to be on television tonight and on the front page of clarin in the morning very possibly darby said unless there is strong pressure from the governmentthe foreign minister or maybe the president or one of his croniesto keep it quiet that would bepressure from on highmore effective in keeping this out of the press than anything we could do wouldnt it yes it would darby said simply ill call the foreign minister right now the ambassador said before i call washington i think thats a good idea sir lowery said alex why dont you stop by jacks house tell him that everything that can be done is being done and that hes in my prayers yes sir ill call him myself just as soon as i get off the phonei may even go out therebut i understand mr ambassador darby said i dont think it needs to be said does it that i want to know of any development right away no matter what the hour six reynolds the man answering the telephone announced this is the southern cone desk ambassador silvio asked there was a more formal title of course for that section of the state department charged with diplomatic affairs in the republics of chile uruguay and argentina but southern cone fit to describe the three nations at the southern tip of south america and was commonly used yes it is who is this please my name is silvio im the ambassador in buenos aires how may i be of service mr ambassador reynolds inquired his voice sounded considerably more interested than it had been when he answered the telephone i want you to prepare a memorandum of this call for the secretary of state if she is available get it to her now i want her to have it in any event first thing in the morning is that going to pose any problems for you none at all mr ambassador we have strong reason to believe that mrs elizabeth masterson the wife of my chief of mission j winslow masterson was kidnapped at approximately eight pm buenos aires time beyond that little is known my recorder is on mr ambassador reynolds interrupted i should have told you would you like me to turn it off and erase what it has no a recording should help you prepare the memorandum yes sir it will thank you sir the federal police are aware of the situation silvio went on so it must be presumed that the minister of the interior and the foreign minister have been told however whenjust nowi attempted to telephone the foreign minister to inform him officially he was not available his office told me they will have him call me as soon as he is available but that i should not expect this to happen until tomorrow morning i interpret this to mean that he does not feel he should discuss the situation with me until he learns more about it andor discusses it with the president all of my staff concerned with intelligence and legal matters are aware of the situation their consensus with which i am in agreement is that there is not presently enough intelligence to form a reasonable opinion as to motive in other words we do not know enough at this time to think that this is or is not a terrorist act or that it is or is not an ordinary kidnapping or may have some political implications mr kenneth lowery my security chief has been directed to compile a report of what we know to this point and that will be sent to washington by satburst almost certainly within the hour i will furnish the department either by telephone or by satburst with whatever information is developed as soon as it comes to me i have spoken with ambassador mcgrory in montevideo he is presently determining if any of the fbi agents attached to his embassy have experience with kidnappings etcetera and if any of them do he will immediately send them here he paused then said i think that covers everything unless you can think of anything mr reynolds no sir mr ambassador i think you have everything in there ill get this to the secretary as soon as possible in that connection mr reynolds while i have no objection to an appropriate dissemination of what im reporting i want your memorandum of this call to go directly to the secretary you understand what im saying yes sir directly to the secretary not through channels thank you mr reynolds ambassador silvio hung up the secure telephone and picked up the one connected to the embassy switchboard he punched one of the buttons silvio here will you have a car for me at the residence immediately please and inform mr lowery that i will be going to mr mastersons home seven the breakfast room the presidential apartment the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc july let me have that business about the diplomats wife again please the president of the united states said to the deputy director of central intelligence who had just finished delivering the daily intelligence summary the ddci read again the paragraph of the dis reporting the kidnapping of mrs masterson it was essentially a condensation of the memorandum prepared by the southern cone desk officer for the secretary of state when he had finished the president asked thats all we have we have just a little more mr president not in the dis the president gestured somewhat impatiently with the fingers of his left hand that he wanted to hear it when i was at langley earlier mr president our station chief in ba called fivethirty our time sixthirty in ba i talked to him myself he said that the argentine cops were really activethe phrase he used was they had rounded up all the usual suspectsand that there had been no word from the kidnappers and that two fbi agents from the montevideo embassy had been on the first flight whats that about apparently there are no fbi agents in the ba embassy mr president theres half a dozen in montevideo what the hell is this all about ted the president asked i just dont know mr president but im sure there will be more details very soon my curiosity is in high gear the president said mine too mr president it sounds wacko frankly if youd like i can call you whenever i hear something else do that ted please yes sir will that be all mr president unless youd like another cup of coffee ill pass thank you just the same mr president thanks ted the president said the president watched as the ddci left the room and thenalmost visibly making a decision as he did sotopped off his coffee cup what the hell why not he asked aloud and picked up the telephone will you get me the secretary of state please good morning mr president dr natalie cohen answered her phone natalie you want to give me your take on that diplomats wife who got kidnapped in argentina that made the dis did it uhhuh whats going on i talked to the ambassador late last night mr president hei guess i should say theydont know very much he said kidnapping down there is a cottage industry and he hopes thats all it is i told him to call me with any developments but so far he hasnt at the risk of sounding insensitive i could understand some lunatic trying to assassinate the ambassador or this womans husband but the ambassador said just about the same thing mr president he cant understand it either ted sawyer said the cia guy down there called this morning and said the embassy in uruguay had sent a couple of fbi agents from the embassy there how come we dont have fbi agents in buenos aires that embassy is bigger than the one in uruguay right the money laundering takes place in uruguay thats where they need the fbi he also said the argentines had really mobilized their police the ambassador told me that too its embarrassing for them mr president i had an unpleasant thought just before i called you we dont pay ransom do we no sir we dont thats a presidential order goes back to nixon i think so the best we can hope forpresuming that this is just a kidnapping and not a political slash terrorist act is that once these people realize theyve kidnapped a diplomats wife and the heat is really going to be on that theyll let her go thats one possibility mr president that theyll let her go he took her meaning jesus christ natalie you think theyd im afraid thats also a possibility mr president she said what odds are you giving fiftyfifty thats for their turning her loose unharmed i would give seventythirty that the cops will catch them i told sawyer i want to be in the loop will you keep me advised yes sir of course among other things we dont need is terrorists deciding that kidnapping our diplomats wives is a good and probably easything to be doing that thought ran through my head too mr president but i dont think we can do anything beyond waiting to see what happens i just dont see what else anyone can do right now keep me in the loop please natalie thank you yes sir i will the president broke the connection with his finger i just thought what else i can do he said aloud and took his finger off the telephone switch get me the secretary of homeland security he said into the receiver to a white house operator ii one office of the secretary department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc july in the federal government the secretary is not that person who answers the telephone takes dictation makes appointments and brings the boss coffee in washington the secretary is someone as high in the bureaucracy as one can rise without being elected president and is therefore the boss in washington therefore those individuals who answer the secretarys telephone bring the coffee make appointments et cetera have titles like executive assistant the honorable matthew hall secretary of homeland security had three executive assistants the first of these was mrs maryellen kensington who was fifty grayhaired and slim she was a gs the highest grade in the career civil service she maintained halls small and unpretentious suite of offices in the old executive office building near the white house secretary hall and the president were close friends which meant that the president liked to have him around more than he did some other members of his cabinet when hall was in washington he could usually be found in his oeob office so that he was readily available to the president the second was mrs agnes forbison who was fortynine grayhaired and getting just a little chubby she was also a gs she reigned over the secretarys office staff in his formal office a suite of wellfurnished rooms in the nebraska avenue complex which is just off ward circle in the northwest of the district of columbia the complex had once belonged to the navy but it had been turned over in by an act of congress to the department of homeland security when that agency had been formed after when the red telephone on the coffee table in the secretarys private office in the complex buzzed and a red light on it flashedsignaling an incoming call from either the president himself but more than likely from one of the other members of the presidents cabinet or the directors of either the fbi or the cia or the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff or the commanderinchief of central commandmrs forbison was in the process of pouring a cup of coffee for the secretarys third executive assistant c g castillo castillo who was thirtysix a shade over six feet tall and weighed pounds was lying on the secretarys notquitelongenoughforhim red leather couch with his stockinged feet hanging over the end of it castillo looked at the red telephone saw that agnes was holding the coffeepot and reached for the telephone secretary halls line castillo speaking charley the caller said i was hoping to speak to your boss castillo sat up abruptly spilling a stack of papers onto the floor mr president the secretarys en route from chicago he should be landing at andrews in about an hour aha the infallible white house switchboard apparently is not so infallible i cant wait to tell them nice to talk to you charley thank you sir the line went dead charley as he put the phone back in its cradle exchanged i wonder what that was all about looks with agnes the phone buzzed again secretary halls line castillo speaking what i was going to ask your boss charley is if there is some good reason you cant go to buenos aires right now buenos aires what the hell is going on in argentina sir im sure the secretary would tell you that im at your disposal well ill ask him anyway but you might want to start packing ive just been told the wife of our deputy chief of mission was kidnapped early last night i want to know how and why that happened and i want to know now and i dont want to wait until whoevers in charge down there has time to write a coverhisass report getting the picture yes mr president after a moment charley realized the president had hung up agnes waited for a report he wants me to go to buenos aires charley replied obviously thinking that over it seems somebody kidnapped the deputy chief of missions wife he wants me to find out about it hes apparently laboring under the misconception that im some kind of a detective youre not bad at finding missing airplanes sherlock jesus agnes thats a big embassy they probably have ten fbi agents plus cia spooks plus drug enforcement guys not to mention the state departments own security people but the president doesnt know any of them charley and he knows you trusts you agnes said and then added but to buttress your argument theres also a heavy hitter secret service guy in buenos aires name of tony santini hes an old pal of joels the reason i know is that once a month or so he sends joel twenty twentyfive pounds of filet mignon steaks on the courier plane theyre in a box marked tissue samples maybe i can tell the boss that and get joels pal to find out what happened i really dont want to go down there what i really want to do is go to glynco georgia wherever the hell that isand see how exsergeant betty schneider is doing in secret service school i understand mr president the secretary of homeland security said into the red phone consider charley gone he laid the telephone back in the cradle and turned to castillo matthew hall was a large manhis secret service code name was big boywith a full head of hair while he usually presented the image of a dignified senior government officer with the means to employ a good tailor right now he looked a little rumpled his necktie was pulled down and his collar button open his suit needed pressing and his beard was starting to show his appearance was temporary as soon as the citation had landed at andrews air force base he had come to the nebraska complex to check on what was going on before going home an hour from now he would be freshly shaven in a crisply starched white shirt and a freshly pressed suit no go charley hall said he doesnt want it to get out that hes taking a personal interest yes sir sir what about tony santini joel isaacson asked he could probably be helpful as hell to charley you want me to give him a headsup hall had told the president that isaacsona tall slim fortyyearold very senior secret service agent who was head of halls security detail and had once been number two on the presidential detailhad said he had a good friend in buenos aires a secret service agent who could probably report on the kidnapping more quickly than castillo possibly could the president had been unimpressed santini hall asked thats your friends name isaacson nodded he and iand tomgo way way back tonys down there working funny money secret service agent tom mcguire a large redhaired irishman had also come from the presidential detail to protect hall you trust him to keep his mouth shut isaacson raised his hands in a gesture suggesting dumb question sorry joel hall said okay give him a headsup and find out how charley can quietly get in touch with him if im to do this quietly sir charley asked can i go as gossinger hall considered that a moment too before replying your call charley secretary hall had decided about six months earlier political correctness be damnedthat he needed a male assistant preferably unmarried he was constantly on the move all over the country and sometimes outside it he almost always flew on a cessna citation x the airplane belonged to the secret service which had been transferred from the treasury department to homeland security after hall almost always traveled with joel isaacson and tom mcguire they often left for where they were goingin the wee hours of the morning andor came back to washington at the same ungodly hour both mrs kensington and mrs forbison were married and not thrilled with the idea of flying on half an hours notice to say spokane washington at half past five in the morning with no hint of when theyd be coming back to feed their husbands or play with their grandchildren moving down the staff structure hall had taken maybe a dozen female administrative types with him on thirty or more trips women with job titles like senior administrative assistant while all had been initially thrilled with the prospect of personally working for the secretary none of them had kept at it for long primarily the ones who werent married had boyfriends and they all had grown accustomed to the federal governments eighttofive mondaytofriday workweek and its generous dayoff recognition of holidays hall worked a sevenday week with an exception for say christmas moreover having some female in the confines of the citation x cabin posed problems for one thing matt hall believed with entertainer ed mcmahon that alcoholespecially good scotchwas gods payment for hard work with a female in the cabin that meant he had to drink alone and he didnt like that joel isaacson and tom mcguire couldnt drink with him if a senior administrative assistantor someone of that ilkwas on the plane both were fully prepared to lay down their lives for the secretary both as a professional duty and because they had come to deeply admire hall but as a practical matter once the local security detail had loaded them on the citation and theyd gotten off the ground and were on their way home having a beltor twowith the secretary in no way reducedin their judgment and the secretarysthe protection they were sworn to provide but what they could not afford was miss whateverhername rushing home to her boyfriends pillow to regale him with tales of the secretary and his security detail sucking scotch all the way across the country while they exchanged politically incorrect and often ribald jokes when general allan naylor the central command commanderinchief had been a captain in vietnam matt hall had been one of his sergeants they had remained friends as naylor had risen in the army hierarchy and hall had become first a congressman and then governor of north carolina and then secretary of homeland security their relationship was now professional as well central command de facto if not de jure was the most important operational headquarters in the defense department it controlled special operations among many other things the president had made it clear that whatever the secretary of homeland security wanted from central command he was to have and if that violated procedure or regulations either change the procedures or regulations or work around them hall and naylor talked at least once a day on a secure communications linksometimes a half dozen times a day when world events dictatedand they met as often as that worked out at a mixed business and social meeting over drinks in the bar of the armynavy club in washington hall had confided in naylor his problem traveling with females and almost jokingly asked if naylor happened to know of some young officermale and unmarriedhe could borrow as an assistant aside from carrying your suitcase and answering your phone what else would he have to do it would help if he could type and had decent table manners anything else seriously hall asked and naylor nodded handle his booze know how to keep his mouth shut hall furnished and since this is a wish list maybe speak a foreign language or two especially spanish how about one who speaks spanish like a spaniard youve got somebody naylor nodded just back from afghanistan hes on the fivepercent list for lieutenant colonel theyve been wondering where to assign him how come you know a lowly major ive known this fellow a long time west pointer green beret about as bright as they come and i can have him naylor nodded why maybe because i like you and maybe because i think hed learn something working for you if he doesnt work out you can send him back major carlos guillermo castillo special forces had shown up at the nebraska complex three days later in uniform which displayed an impressive row of decorations and iwasthere ribbons plus a combat infantry badge and a set of senior army aviator wings the latter surprised hall as naylor hadnt mentioned that castillo was a pilot he was also surprised at his appearance he didnt look latin he was blueeyed fairskinned and hall suspected his light brown hair had once been blond hall who had a cib of his own liked what he saw major would it offend you if i called you carlos not at all sir but id prefer charley sir charley it is andso people dont start asking whos that army officer working for hallid like you to wear civvies a suit or a sports coat with a shirt and tie is that going to pose a problem no sir hall had stopped himself just in time from saying dont go out and spend a lot of money on civvies this may not work out instead he asked youre going to try to get in the boq at fort myer sir im on per diem and ive spent more than my fair share of time in boqs i thought id look for a hotel or an apartment up to you hall had said butfrankly this may not work out for either of usi wouldnt sign a lease on an apartment right away yes sir a hotel if such a thing exists try to find a reasonably priced hotel near the white houseyou might try the hotel washington i spend most of my time in the oeob which means you will too yes sir hall had risen and put out his hand welcome aboard charley you come recommended by general naylor and with that in mind and from what ive seen i think youre going to fit in very well around here get yourself settledtake your time do it right and when youre finished come to work yes sir thank you sir when hall went to his oeob office at nine the next morning castillo was there waiting for him in a gray suit black wingtip shoes a crisp white buttondown shirt and a redstriped necktie none of which hall knew had come off the racks at sears roebuck good he looks like a typical bureaucrat hall thought and then changed that assessment no like a successful capitol hill lobbyist or lawyer castillo said hed found a hotel not far from the white house and the oeob one you can afford hall asked with a smile yes sir well then if youre ready to go to work ill have mrs kensington show you how we throw away the taxpayers money three days later when hall was dictating to maryellen castillo appeared at the door and said he had a little problem whats that i need some kind of a title sir i got the feeling you didnt want the military connection so i dont say major when somebody asks me what i do here ive been saying i work in secretary halls office that makes you sound like a clerk maryellen said nobody will pay any attention to you hall smiled at her he had noticed that maryellen had liked charley from the first day okay maryellen what do you suggest executive assistant executive assistant kensington replied immediately that has a certain je ne sais quoi in the upper echelons of the washington bureaucracy but hes not an executive assistant hall had protested he is if you say so boss and whos to know by the power invested in me by myself hall said you are decreed to be my executive assistant go forth and do good work yes sir thank you sir castillo replied to hall he turned to maryellen and added et merci mille fois madame hall had picked up on that you speak french do you charley yes sir any other languages yes sir hall made a comeon gesture charley hesitated and hall added modesty does not befit an executive assistant which ones russian sir and hungarian german some arabic several others jesus christ languages come easy to me sir they dont to me hall confessed you have plans for the evening charley no sir you have a dinner jacket yes sir your bluff is called we are going to a reception at the hungarian embassy whenever i ask the ambassador a question he doesnt want to answer he forgets how to speak english getting the picture yes sir howd you learn to speak hungarian when i was a kid sir my mothers aunt who was hungarian lived with us she taught me nice for you okay charley ill have joel pick you up on his way here to get me where are you living i can meet you here sir joel will pick you up where did you find a hotel im in the mayflower sir the mayflower hall asked isnt that kind of expensive on a majors pay including per diem yes sir it is joel will pick you up just before seven hall said deciding it best not now to pursue the question of affordable housing with castillo wait for him on the street yes sir the moment castillo had closed the door hall reached for the red phone on his desk and pressed the button that would connect him over a secure line with the commanderinchief central command hey matt naylor said answering almost immediately whats up i just found out my newly appointed executive assistant major castillo has taken a room in the mayflower hows he going to pay for that would you be satisfied with no problem no well charley told me that hed taken a small apartment in the mayflower naylor said the bill will probably be paid by castillo enterprises of san antonio or maybe by the tages zeitung the what its a newspaperactually a chain of newspapers charley owns in germany you didnt tell me much about this guy did you allan you didnt ask all you wanted was somebody who would carry your suitcase and who spoke spanish thats what i gave you whats your connection with charley allan other than the usual relationship between a fourstar general and one of his five thousand majors elaine thinks of himand i do too truth to tellas the third son weve known him since he was a twelveyearold orphan you didnt mention that either you didnt ask matt naylor said what do you want to do with him send him back no hall had said presuming there is no further deep dark secret youre leaving for me to discover i think hes going to be pretty useful around here majorexecutive assistant castillo did in fact and quickly prove himself useful to the secretary of homeland security and he fit in both maryellen kensington and agnes forbison were clearly taken with him hall kindly ascribed this to maternal instincts but he confided to his wife that he suspected both had amorous fantasies about castillo hes one of those guys women are drawn to like moths to a candle i hate men to whom women are drawn like moths to a candle janice hall had said the day janice came to the office and met castillo she suggested to her husband that they have him to dinner hes probably lonely living in a hotel janice said and would really appreciate a homecooked meal i thought you hated men to whom women were drawn like moths to a candle thats not his fault and hes obviously a nice guy ask him castillo also got along from the start with joel isaacson and tom mcguire hall had worried a little about that secret service guys arent impressed with most anyone but joel and tomboth excellent judges of characterseemed to sense that special forces major c g castillo wasnt most anyone isaacson had even gone to hall and suggested that castillo be given credentials as a secret service agent he could get through airport security that way and carry a gun ill handle the credentials guys at secret service if you like what really moved castillo from being sort of a male secretary cum interpreter in whose presence it was possible to imbibe intoxicants and relate ribald stories to being a heavy hitter in halls office was a fey notion of the president of the united states in may an old boeing that had been sitting at the airport at luanda angola waiting for parts for more than a year suddenly took off without permission and disappeared no one really thought it had been stolen by terrorists and was going to be flown into some american landmark in a repeat of that had quickly become regarded as a ridiculous notion at the highest levels for one thing the aged bird didnt have the range to fly to the united statesbut no agency in what the president described as our enormous and enormously expensive intelligence community seemed to be able to learn what had happened to it the president was annoyed at a private dinner really private just the president the first lady and secretary and mrs hallthe president said that he had been talking to natalie cohenthen his national security advisor and now the secretary of stateand they had come up with an idea hall understood that they had come up with an idea meant it was the presidents idea if it had been natalies the president would have said so what had probably happened was that he had proposed the idea she had first argued against it but then had given in to the presidents logic and the idea had become their idea if she hadnt given in and he had decided to go ahead anyhow he would have claimed the idea as his own youre the only department without an inhouse intelligence operation the president had said so this will work natalie will send everybody in the intelligence community a memo saying that since this stolen airliner poses a potential threat to the homeland you are to be furnished immediately all the intelligence theyve developed about this missing airplane that will give us who knew what and when they knew it then very quietly we send somebodyjust one manto go over the scene quietly very quietly and see if he can find out why the cia for instance knew something on tuesday that the dia didnt find out until thursday or why the fbi didnt find out at all you with me yes sir mr president the question is who can we send to do this without setting off a turf war after meeting major carlos g castillo the president decided he was just the man to very quietly without setting off a turf war find out which intelligence agencies were running with the ball or had fumbled the ball or had just sat on it waiting for another agency to do the work castillo went to luanda angola where the whole thing had started and immediately ignited a turf war that had very nearly cost secretary hall his job he not only learned that the missing had been stolen by somalian terrorists who planned to crash it into the liberty bell in philadelphia but with the help of aleksandr pevsner an infamous russian arms dealer located the airplane no one else could find and then with the help of the ultrasecret gray fox unit of delta force stole the missing airplane back from the terrorists with castillo flying as copilot air commando colonel jake torine had flown the airplane from costa rica to central command headquarters at macdill air force base in florida when the president had authorized the gray fox mission he had done so fully prepared to pay the price of an outraged costa ricafor that matter the outraged membership of the united nationsfor launching a military operation without warning on a peaceful country that didnt even have an army with his imagination seeing the worlds television screens lit up with cnnsand deutsche welles and the bbcs and everybody elsesreport of the shocking unilateral american incursion of poor little costa rica with pictures of the flaming hulk of the airplane surrounded by dead costa ricans the president was understandably delighted to hear that the only loss in costa rica was a fuel truck true to its professionalism gray fox had left behind no bodiesamerican or costa ricanand no gloriously in flames and no traceable evidence that could place them ever at the scene dissuaded by general naylor from awarding torine and castillo medals for valorwhich would have necessarily entailed detailing the valorthe president settled for awarding them distinguished flying crosses for superb airmanship in extremely difficult circumstances it was colonel torines thirteenth dfc and castillos third the president also had them down to the carolina white house for a weekend there was a downside to this happy ending of course the director of central intelligence and the director of the federal bureau of investigation were unhappy with the secretary of homeland security and his goddamn executive assistant for a number of reasons the dci was of course smarting because castillo had found the missing airplane before the agency could and because castillo had been able to talk the cia station chief in angola out of cia intelligence files the director of the fbi was smarting because after the special agent in charge of the bureaus philadelphia office had reported to him his belief that the missing airplane almost certainly had been stolen by its owners a smalltime aircraft leasing company on the edge of bankruptcy so they could collect the insurance and he had reported this to the president castillo had gone to philadelphia and learned that the airplane had indeed not only been stolen but stolen by somalian terrorists whose namesas possible terroristshad been provided to the fbi by the philadelphia police some time before the fbi had told the cops that the somalians were okay just some african airline pilots in the united states for training and because when an fbi inspector had been sent to majorexecutive assistant castillo to tell him he was confident that whenever castillo heard from alex pevsner or his assistant a former fbi agent named howard kennedy again castillo would immediately notify the fbi castillo had told him not to hold his breath but since it had to be admitted by both the fbi and the cia that they had not in fact furnished to the secretary of homeland security all the material they had been directed to furnish by then national security advisor natalie cohen the directors vowed this would never happen again from this moment on homeland security would get copies of every bit of intelligence generated that had even remotely to do with homeland security and if it kept that goddamn castillo up all night reading it and if he went blind reading it so much the better when the red telephone on the coffee table buzzed charley castillo was working his way through that days intelligenceeverything that had come in since five the previous afternoongraciously furnished by the fbi and the cia he had been at this task since half past six the secretary hadnt made up his mind how to deal with the wealth of intelligencemost of it uselessthat they were getting from the fbi and the cia every day but he and charley and joel and tom were agreed that it had to be read joel isaacson saidonly half jokinglythat both directors were entirely capable of sending over hard intel that a nuclear device in a container was about to arrive in baltimore harbor sandwiched between intel about two suspiciouslooking moroccan grandmothers and an overheard and unsubstantiated rumor that the bishop of sioux falls south dakota was a crossdresser and that therefore it had to be read what would seem to be the obvious solution to the problemhall calling the directors of the cia and fbi and saying okay enough is enough stop sending the garbagealmost certainly wouldnt work it was possiblemaybe even more than likelythat the directors with straight faces would tell the secretary they had no idea what he was talking about and that would mean hall would have to go to the president he didnt want to do that he was trying to spread oil on the troubled waters not onto the smoldering fire one possible solutionwhich agnes thought the most likelywas to bring into the office two secret service agentsintraining now going through the federal law enforcement training center in glynco georgia just as soon as they were as joel put it credentialed both were experienced police officers recruited at the suggestion of secretary hall from the philadelphia police department as a result of his and castillos experience with them looking for the one had been a sergeant in the intelligence unit and the other a detective in the counterterrorism division who had worked for years undercover infiltrating muslim communities considered potentially dangerous both would be able to sort through the stacks of intel reports knowing what to look for and what was garbage but this would mean they would be working directly for the secretary instead of justhalls original idea becoming secret service agents with far more experience and knowledge than the usual rookies and being assigned to a field office somewhere agnes knew that hall was reluctant to have his own inhouse intelligence unit but she thought sooner or laterprobably sooner since while charley was sifting through the garbage he was not available to him he had not gone with hall to chicago last night because he had to read the overnight fileshe was going to have to face the facts the secretary of homeland security picked up the red handset and punched one of the buttons on the base natalie cohen good morning mademoiselle secretary hall said goddammit matt you know i dont think thats funny the secretary of state said it makes more sense than a female lawyer calling herself esquire hall went on undaunted i learned in school that madam is a married lady and an unmarried one a mademoiselle is there something on your sophomoric mind matt or are you just seeing what happens when you push the buttons on your red phone the president mizz secretary she chuckled better not good but better is sending charley to buenos aires i guess you can figure out why there was a perceptible pause before the secretary of state replied to find out who knew what and when they knew it she said just a little bitterly those had been the presidents instructions to castillo when the president had sent him off to learn what he could about the missing airliner i should have seen this coming i suppose i tried to talk him out of it you want to try a i dont think he wants me to know that hes sending charley down there and b i think the reason he didnt tell me was because he knew i would argue against it and c if i happened to mention this to him hed know i heard it from you and we both would be on the badguy list it wasnt my idea nat i know she said actually now that ive had thirty whole seconds to think about it im not nearly as livid as i was maybe charley will come up with something the ambassador down there would rather that i didnt hear you will give you what he gets absolutely thanks for the headsup matt do you know something about the ambassador that charley should i never met him i talked to him last night on the telephone and i was favorably impressed and everything i hear about him is that hes firstrate hes a cuban you might tell charley that so hell expect a cuban temper if the ambassador finds out hes snooping around down there ill do it tell charley to be careful we dont need a war with argentina the secretary of state said and hung up before hall could reply two room the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc july room which was actually what the hotel called an executive suite and consisted of a living room a large bedroom a small dining room and a second bedroom which held a desk and could be used as an officewas registered to karl w gossinger on a longterm basis the bill for the suite was sent once every two weeks by fax to the tages zeitung in fulda germany and payment was made usually the next day by wire transfer to the hotels account in the riggs national bank when he took the room herr gossinger told the hotel he would need two outside telephone lines one of these would be listed under his name and that of the tages zeitung the second which would not be listed would be a fax line he also told the hotel that mr c g castillo whom he described as an american associate would be staying in the suite whenever he was in town and the hotel should be prepared to take telephone calls accept packages and so forth for mr castillo karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger had been born out of wedlock in bad hersfeld germany to an eighteenyearold german girl and a nineteenyearold american warrant officer helicopter pilot the huey pilot had gone to vietnam shortly after their threedayandtwonight affair when jorge castillo never wrote as he had promised erika von und zu gossinger tried to put him out of her mind and when the baby was born she christened him karl wilhelm after her father and brother frau erikashe never married frau was honorific turned to the us army for help in finding the father of her only child only after she was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer karl was twelve at the time his grandfather and uncle the only known relatives had been killed in an autobahn accident some months before frau erika reasoned that any family would be better for karl than leaving him an orphan in germany even an orphan with vast family wealth largely through the efforts of thenmajor allan naylor of the th armored cavalry which was stationed on the east german border near fulda wojg jorge alejandro castillo of san antonio texas was located he was interred in san antonios national cemetery a representation of the medal of honor was chiseled into his tombstone he had died a hero in vietnam apparently without ever suspecting that when he had sown his seed it had been fertile once it was realized they were dealing with the love child of an officer whose courage had seen him posthumously awarded the nations highest recognition of valor the army shifted into high gear to make sure that everything possible would be done for the boy major naylor was rushed to san antonio to first find and then as gently as possible inform the late wojg castillos family about the boy a pragmatist naylor had considered several unpleasant possibilities one was that mr castillos parents might not be overjoyed to learn that their son had left an illegitimate child in germany at least until they heard of his coming inheritance that would put a newand possibly unpleasantlight on the subject senior army lawyers were looking into setting up a trust for the benefit of the boyand only the boy his concern proved to be without basis in fact general amory t stevens the fort sam houston commanderwho had been major naylors fathers roommate at west point and was naylors godfather quickly told him that he knew the late mr castillos parents they are fernando and alicia castillo stevens said well known in texas society as don fernando and dona alicia the don and dona business isnt only because they own much of downtown san antonio plus large chunks of land outside the city plus among others a large ranch near midland under which is the permian basin but because of something of far more importance to texans dona alicia is the great great whatever granddaughter of a fellow named manuel martinez don fernando is similarly directly descended from a fellow named guillermo de castillo manuel and guillermo both fell in noble battle beside jim bowie william travis and davy crockett at the alamo what im saying allan is that if this boy in germany needed help don fernando would quickly cut a check for whatever it would cost what im not sure about is whether heor especially dona aliciais going to be willing to take the love child of their son and a germanprobably protestantgringo into the family the castillos can give lessons in snobbery to the queen of england twentytwo hours after the late wojg castillos mother was informed very delicately that she had an illegitimate grandson dona alicia was at the door of the von und zu gossinger mansion in bad hersfeld don fernando arrived nine hours later two weeks after that the united states consulate in frankfurt am main issued a passport to carlos guillermo castillo don fernando was not without influence in washington the same dayfrau erika then in hospital having decided she didnt want her sons last memory of her to be of a painracked terminally ill woman in a druginduced stuporcarlos boarded a pan american airlines for the united states frau erika died five days later on her death as far as the government of the federal republic of germany was concerned american citizen with a new name or not karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger nativeborn son had become the last of the von und zu gossinger line at twentyone just before c g castillo graduated from west point karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger came into his german inheritance which included the tages zeitung newspaper chain two breweries vastfor germanyfarmlands and other assets a second identity as herr karl gossinger foreign correspondent of the tages zeitung had proved very useful to major c g castillo us army special forces in the past and it probably would again in argentina in his suite at the mayflower c g castillo was nearly finished with packing his luggage he had carefully packed his small guaranteedtofitinanyairplaneoverheadbin suitcaseonwheels with enough winter clothing to last three or four days when it was midsummer in washington it was midwinter in buenos aires he didnt think hed be down there longer than that all that remained was to pack his briefcase which also came with wheels and was large enough for his laptop computer this was somewhat more difficult as it required carefully separating a section of the padding from the frame inside was a tenbythirteeninch plastic folder there was a sticky surface to keep things from sliding around and the folder material itself was designed to confuse xray machines castillo carefully arranged his american passport his us army identification card c g castillos gold american express and gold visa credit cards his texas drivers license and credentials identifying him as a supervisory special agent of the us secret service on the sticky surface closed the folder and then replaced the padding he then went into the small dining area and from a small refrigerator concealed in a credenza took out a bottle of dos equis beer popped the top took a healthy swallow from the neck burped and then went into the living room where he sat down in a red leather reclinerhis not the hotelsshifted his weight so that it opened and reached for the telephone he punched in a number from memory took another sip of the dos equis and then lay back in the chair as he waited for the call to be completed the general director of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh who was also the editorinchief of one of its holdings the tages zeitung newspapers answered his private line twenty seconds later goerner wie gehts otto castillo said ach der verlorene sohn well you may think of me as the prodigal son castillo said switching to english but i like to think of myself as one of your more distinguished foreign correspondents distinguished i dont know but ill go with most expensive castillo thought of otto goerner as his oldest friend and he certainly was that otto had been at philipps university in marburg an der lahn with wilhelm von und zu gossinger karls uncle and had been with the tages zeitung since their graduation he had been around der haus im wald in bad hersfeld as uncle otto as far back as castillo could remember he remembered too the very early morning when otto had brought the news of her fathers and brothers death to his mother and how when his mother had told him they had located his fathers family and he would probably afterbe going to them in the united states he had thrown a hysterical fit demanding that he be allowed afterto live with uncle otto and how at the airport in frankfurt tears had run unashamedly down ottos cheeks when hed seen him off to the states and how he had been a friend ever since hows ol whatsername and the kids ol whatsername and your godchildren are doing very well thank you for asking to what do i owe the honor im off to buenos aires on a story and i thought id see if there was anything else you wanted me to do down there cant think of anything karl otto said goerner didnt ask what story castillo would be pursuing in argentina hes the opposite of a fool charley thought for the hundredth time and without any question knows what i do for a living but he never asks and i never tell him all he does is give me what i ask for i wont be gone long charley said probably less yeah come to think of it karl i do goerner interrupted okay shoot karl gossinger the tages zeitungs washingtonbased foreign correspondent usually had a bylined story in the paper once a week these were generally paraphrased stolenfrom the american conservative magazine there was a dual purpose first if someone checked on gossinger there was his picture beside his latest story from washington and if they looked closer the masthead said the tages zeitung was founded by hermann von und zu gossinger in using material from the american conservative moreover gave charley castillo a chance to put before german readers what some americansincluding charleythought about the germans turning their backs on america when the united states asked for their help in the iraq war editing only for grammar otto printed whatever charley sent him without comment charley didnt know or ask whether this was because otto agreed the germans had behaved badly or because the bottom line was that charley owned the newspapers the graf spee goerner said charley knew the story of the graf spee the german pocket battleship named after a world war i german hero was scuttled just outside the harbor of montevideo uruguay in to keep her from being sunk by three british cruisers waiting for her to come out her crew went to buenos aires her captain hans von langsdorff put on his dress uniform laid her battle ensign on the floor of his hotel room positioned himself so that his body would fall on it and shot himself in the temple he was buried in buenos aires the crew was interned in argentina when the war was over many of her crew declined repatriation and many of those who did return to the fatherland took one look at the destroyed remnants of the thousand year reich and went back to argentina as quickly as they could what about the graf spee charley asked a fellow named bardoa young and very rich financier from hamburghas raised the money to salvage her and turn her into a museum in montevideo i could use a humaninterest piece on the survivors if anytheyd all be in their eighties and most of them would be in argentina finding the survivorsif anyshouldnt be hard and neither would taking some pictures and writing a feature story and it would give journalist gossinger a credible excuse to be in argentina ill have a shot at it charley said anything else goerner hesitated before replying karl im a little reluctant to get into this into what i went over to marburg an der lahn a couple of weeks ago they were doing a fundraiser for the library at the university all alte marburgers were invited i overheard parts of a conversation between some of the big shots what caught my attention was a line something about der fuhrer was the first to come up with that idea ha ha youve lost me you remember that during world war two hitlerthe top nazisent a lot of money to argentina to buy themselves a sanctuary when they lost the war uhhuh these guys were talking about moving money to argentina to buy sanctuary sanctuary from what youre talking about drug money what im thinking about is iraqi oilforfood money bribes that may have wound up in the pockets of these guys jesus yeah jesus anyway ive got people looking into it here and the idea i hadprobably not a good onewas that maybe you would hear something in argentina ill keep my ears open charley said just that karl goerner said seriously if you hear something anything pass it to me but stop there you understand me thats as close as hes ever come to saying you and i know youre not really a journalist i take your point i also have people looking into the mysterious deaths of people who knew about these oilforfood bribes i take your point otto aside from that have a good steak and a bottle of wine for me and dont try to spread your pollen on more than ten or twelve of those lovely argentine senoritas didnt i tell you i have taken a vow of chastity celibacy is supposed to increase your mental powers ach gott karlchen goerner laughed keep in touch kiss my godchildren and say hello to ol whatsername my regards to fernando and your grandmother auf wiedersehen the line went dead castillo hung up shifted his weight in the chair so the back came up and then got out of it he finished the bottle of dos equis as he looked around the apartment to see if he had forgotten anything and then put on the jacket to his seersucker suit he looked at himself in the mirror i am probably going to freeze my ass off in buenos aires until i can get to the hyatt but on the other hand i wont have to go through reagan and miami international wearing a woolen sports coat three miami international airport miami florida july as castillo stood before the luggage carousel waiting for his suitcase he had very unkind thoughts about delta airlines on whose flight he had just arrived when he boarded the airplane at ronald reagan washington national he had had the suitcase in hand all of the overhead luggage bins in the firstclass section were full the firstclass section itself had not been anywhere near fullprobably because deltas dcamia firstclass fare bordered on the rapaciouswhich suggested ergo sum that the luggage in the firstclass bins had been placed there by people traveling economy class as they passed through the firstclass section en route to the rear of the aircraft im afraid youll have to check that the stewardess told him why do i suspect that all the luggage in the bins does not belong to firstclass passengers im afraid youll have to check that the stewardess repeated i dont suppose that since i thought i would have space in the firstclass bins and find that i dont you could put this in with the coats and jackets i really hate to check it im afraid youll have to check it the stewardess said firmly it would also seem to logically follow castillo thought watching the luggage carousel rotate at mia that since my suitcase was loaded if not last then close to last it would be unloaded first that obviously is not the case the suitcase finally showed up castillo pulled out the handle and dragged it from luggage recovery surprising him not at all the map in the entrance foyer showed him that aerolineas argentinas was at the other end of the airport almost in key west it was a long walk through the crowded airport which reminded him of his cousin fernando lopezs appraisal of miami international it is the united states token third world airport that reminded him jesus christ i almost forgot that he would have to call fernando andor abuela their grandmother and tell them he would not be able to come home for the weekend even if fernando flew up to pick him up he finally reached the aerolineas argentinas counter there was a long line of people in the firstclass line all of whom seemed to have extra overweight or oversize luggage there were far more such people than there were seats in the firstclass compartment of either a or a which suggested that they were economyclass passengers who had taken advantage of there being no one in the firstclass line twenty minutes later he reached the head of the line and was given permission to approach the counter by the clerk who beckoned to him with her index finger like the queen of spain summoning a footman he laid a passport issued by the german federal republic and an american express corporate credit card issued to the tages zeitung on the counter my name is gossinger he said i have an electronic ticket i believe getting through airport security wasif possiblemore harassing than usual castillo was randomly selected for close examination not only did the security people make him take his shoes off but their pawing through his luggage effectively nullified his careful packing and he was concerned about the detailed examination of his briefcase cum laptop carrier that was to come they made him turn the laptop on to prove that it indeed was not an explosive device but they didnt show much interest in the briefcase itself that was a relief herr gossinger did not want to have to explain what he was doing with c g castillos passport and secret service credentials finally they were through with him and he went to the club of the americas the first and businessclass lounge that served aerolineas argentinas and other south american airlines that did not have their own lounges he fixed himself a double scotch on the rocks then found a secluded corner and sat down he took his cellular telephone from his pocket and punched an autodial key hello and how is my favorite girl your favorite girl is wondering if youre calling to tell me youre not coming home for the weekend abuela im in the airport in miami waiting to get on a plane for buenos aires well ill give you this your excuses are out of the ordinary darling i was so looking forward abuela this wasnt my idea what are you going to do in argentina am i allowed to ask no youre not i should be back within the week buenos aires uhhuh its winter down there now you did think to pack warm clothing yes maam if its convenient carlos im almost out of brandy you know the kind ill get you a case i think youre limited to six liters ill find out be careful i talked to jeanine winters just this morning and she said kidnapping is now the cottage industry down there jeanine winters was a very old friend of dona alicia the winters family texans had been operating an enormous cattle operation in entre rios province and a vineyard in mendoza province for generations jesus has she heard about this diplomats wife did mrs winters hear about it already and tell her abuela nobodys going to kidnap me just be careful carlos is all im saying si abuela ill say a prayer for you thank you vaya con dios mi amor dona alicia said and hung up iii one aeropuerto internacional ministro pistarini de ezeiza buenos aires argentina july aerolineas argentinas proved to be much more accommodating about luggage than delta had been just as soon as castillo had stepped aboard through the main cabin door a steward had offered to take his briefcase on wheels from him i can store it with the coats sir the steward said save you from having to hoist it into the overhead bin this courtesy was followed as soon as he took his seat in the firstclass compartment of the boeing a stewardess appeared with a tray of champagne glasses he took one even though he told himself he didnt need it after the three drinks hed had in the club of the americas he hadnt needed the glass of merlot that came with the appetizers just as soon as they reached cruising altitude either but he took that and a second glass with the entreea nice little filet mignon served with roasted potatoes and the glass of brandy he had with the camembert and crackers dessert wasnt needed either when the movie came on he thought the odds were that in a couple of minutes he would doze off and sleep the sleep of the halfcrocked and more or less innocent most of the way across the southern hemisphere nothing wrong with that unless youre sitting in the left seat in the cockpit thats the only way to fly unconscious he didnt fall asleep it was a mel gibson movie gibson was playing the role of a prosperous businessman whose kid was kidnapped well lets see how he handles this maybe ill learn something castillo thought as he pushed the overhead button to summon a stewardess to order another brandy castillo thought gibson was a fine actor he had played very credibly the role of light colonel hal moore in the movie version of the book we were soldiers once and young written by moore and joe galloway castillo had read the book the story of what had happened to one of the first battalions of paratroopers who had been converted to air assaulthelicopter insertedtroops at fort benning and then followed them to vietnam where some nitwit in the first cav had inserted them in the wrong place and almost gotten them wiped out it was nonfiction and hed bought the book because hed heard that gallowaywho had been at fort benning and then gone to vietnam with the battalionhad done a good job describing the early days of army aviation and he thought it might tell him something about what the late wojg jorge alejandro castillo boy chopper jockey had gone through before he bought the farm and because he knew the light bird battalion commander galloway had written aboutmoorehad wound up with three stars there had to be a lesson in that alone hed really liked the book and had taken a chance and gone to see the movie he almost never went to war movies most of them were awful the ones that didnt make you laugh made you sick the soldiers movie had been as good as the book he thought it was just about as realistic as the movie version of black hawk down mark bowdens book on the disaster that hit the special operators in mogadishu in and he had viewed that one with the expert eye of someone whod been flying a blackhawk in somalia at the time and castillo thought that gibsons portrayal of the battalion commander was right on the money gibsons portrayal of the distressed father was very credible too gibson was being forced to make the very tough call between not paying the ransom or following the advice of the fbi and the copsand his hysterical wife the mother of the childto pay it when a stewardess gently woke him to offer orange juice castillo was more than a little annoyedif not very surprisedto realize that he had fallen asleep before gibson had made the tough call that last glass of brandy did you in now youll never know what gibson decided i wonder what he did decide what the hell would i do in his shoes jesus its only a movie but youre about to get close to a real kidnapping let this missing the end of the movie be a lesson to you charley me boy now youre working lay off the booze except maybe for a glass or two of wine breakfast was nice too grapefruit juice that tasted like freshly squeezed a mushroom omelet and hardcrusted rolls served with large pats of unsalted butter he remembered don fernandograndpasaying the only thing the argentines do well consistently is eat five minutes after a stewardess served a second cup of coffee castillo sensed that the pilot had retarded the throttles a tad and two minutes after that a steward announcedin spanish english and german which herr gossinger thought was a nice touchthat they were beginning their approach to buenos aires where the local time was fivethirty and the temperature was three degrees celsius i really am going to freeze my ass in this seersucker as the taxied up to the terminal another caught his eye it was parked on the tarmac not at one of the terminals airways the legend painted in arabic and english on its glistening white fuselage read pan arabic good ol alex pevsner told me one of the reasons he hadnt stolen that was that he didnt need an old airplane and then he had added i just bought a nearly new from an airline that went belly up in argentina i wonder if thats it probably not but you never know with pevsner castillo was the third person to get off the after a portly housewife towing a howling fiveyearoldand when he rolled his bags into the terminal he thought for a moment that he had inadvertently gone through a door that should have been locked he hadnt he was in a dutyfree store and a young womanjesus i like that long legs dark eyes and a splendid bosomhanded him a flyer announcing both that days bargains and that he could take three hundred us dollars worth of goods dutyfree into argentina in addition to what was already permitted the dutyfree store people have solved their problem of getting travelers into their emporium by making it impossible to get to immigration and customs without passing through the store theyve built it on both sides of the corridor clever but screw them i dont need anything when he got to the immigration window a large bag containing a doublebox of famous grouse scotch a halfpound bag of m ampms and two eightounce cans of cashews was hanging from the handle of the wheeled briefcase my intentions were noble i thought i would see if they had any of abuelas reserva san juan extra anejo so that i would be sure to remember to bring her some they didnt but they did have a damned good price on the famous grouse and the cashews and m ampms were certainly a hell of a lot cheaper than the tenbucksacan cashews and fivedollar oneounce packages of nuts hyatt offers in their minibars youre rationalizing again charley the truth is you have no strength of character if the dutyfreestore spending spree isnt enough proof of that note the way you lusted after the senorita passing out the flyers you promised yourself you would be faithful to your secret service traineeis that what theyre calling her maybe cadetbetty schneider even though she professes not to want to get to know you better than she does now which is to say hardly at all and absolutely not at all in the biblical sense and are you in argentina on business or pleasure senor gossinger business and pleasure whats the nature of your business im a journalist here on a story you understand that as a journalist you will have to register with the ministry of information im only going to be here for a few days just to do a story on the survivors of the graf spee the law is the law senor this guy never heard of the graf spee i certainly understand and ill register just as soon as i can probably later today that was pretty stupid inspector clouseau you didnt have to tell him you were a journalist you could have told him you were a usedcar salesman on vacation how come james bond never gets asked what hes doing when he goes through immigration customs didnt give him any trouble the customs officers pushed a button for each traveler which randomly flashed a red and a green light if it came up red your bags went through the xray machine if it came up green they waved you through castillo won the push of the button he pushed through the doors to the arrival lobby there was a stocky man holding a crudely lettered sign with gossinger on it my name is gossinger a balding short heavyset man in his forties standing next to the man with the sign put out his hand mr gossinger my name is santini mr isaacson asked me to meet you welcome to argentina castillo picked up on the mr isaacson not joel not agent and responded accordingly that was very kind of him and kind of you how do you do some of the taxi drivers here at the airport tend to take advantage of unwary visitors that happens at a lot of airports charley replied la guardia comes immediately to mind santini smiled and then said we have a remise you know what a remise is charley nodded with an honest driver santini finished then gestured toward the doors shall we go when the man with the sign got two steps ahead of him santini quickly gesturedhis index finger across his lipsfor castillo to say nothing important in the presence of the driver castillo quickly nodded his head they stood for a couple of minutes on the curb while the driver went for the car santini didnt say a word castillo feeling colder by the second in his summer suit silently hoped the driver hurried the car was a large black volkswagen with heavily tinted glass as the driver bent to put castillos luggage in the trunk castillo saw that he had a pistolit looked like a beretta mmin a belt holster santini opened the rear door and motioned for castillo to get in when he had santini slid in beside him when the driver got behind the wheel santini asked you dont speak spanish do you castillo asked with a raised eyebrow how he should reply santini just perceptibly shook his head im afraid not castillo said pity santini said mr isaacson didnt say where you would be staying the hyatt its now the four seasons formerly hyatt park they sold it i guess nobody told my travel agent castillo said you heard that antonio santini asked the four seasons si senor the volkswagen started off it was a thirtyminute drive from the airport to the hotel first down the crowded but nonetheless highspeed autopista toll road and then onto avenida julio which castillo remembered was supposed to be the widest avenue in the world as they came close to the four seasons formerly hyatt park castillo saw that it was next to the french embassy an enormous turnofthecentury mansion hed forgotten that a tophatted doorman welcomed him to the four seasons and blew a whistle which caused a bellman to appear find somewhere to park santini ordered antonio ill see that senor gossinger gets settled room in the four seasons was a small suite a comfortable sitting room and a large bedroom both facing toward the main railroad stationwhich castillo remembered was called el retiroand the docks and the river plate beyond there was something faint on the far horizon castillo wondered aloud if they were high enough so that he was looking at the shore of uruguay clear day santini replied could be why dont we go out on the balcony and have a good look why not when they were out on the small balcony santini took a small flat metal box from his pocket and ran it over the walls then over the tiny table and two chairs and finally over the floor clean he announced but it never hurts to check castillo smiled at him joel tells me theres a warrant out for you in costa rica santini said with a smile grand theft airplane joels mistaken the name on the warrant is party or parties unknown santini chuckled then asked whats going on with you here i was sent to find out about our diplomats wife who got herself kidnapped when did kidnapping start to interest special forces joel told you about that too huh to look at him you wouldnt think he talks too much your shameful secret is safe with me herr gossinger i guess you know im on loan from the army to matt hall santini nodded the president told him to send me down here to quote find out what happened and how it happened before anybody down there has time to write a coverhisass report end quote santini nodded then offered mrs elizabeth masterson nice lady wife of j winslow masterson our chief of mission nice guy she was apparently snatched from the parking lot of a restaurant called kansas nice place in san isidro which is an upscale suburb so far no communication from the kidnappers im thinking that they may have been very disappointed to find the lady has a diplomatic passport i wouldnt be surprised if they turn her loose on the other hand they may decide that a dead woman cant identify anybody you give it good odds that theyd kill her they kidnapped a kid not so long agonot a kid he was twentythree in san isidro where they grabbed mrs masterson he was the son of a rich businessman they cut off his fingers one at a time and sent them to poppa together with rising demands for ransom poppa finally paid three hundred thousand american thats roughly nine hundred thousand pesos a fortune in a poor country and shortly thereafter they found the kids body shot in the head whyd they kill him dead men tell no tales santini said mockingly hadnt you heard wouldnt that discourage other people from paying ransom when theyve got junior or the missus you pay and hope you get them back alive the only thing that may keep mrs masterson alive is if the bad guys are smart enough to realize that killing her would really turn the heat up that would embarrass the government he paused and then mimicking the sonorous tone of a condescending professor added my experience with the criminal element lamentably suggests that very few of them are mentally qualified to be able to modify their antisocial behavior and become nuclear physicists castillo chuckled i dont know why im laughing he said then asked what did you say about the kansas its a nice restaurant she was snatched from the parking lot in back of it if you want ill take you out there for lunch and you can have a looksee for yourself thank you id like that i wont know what im looking at but i have to start somewhere pardon my ignorance but why cant you just walk into the embassy and tell the security guy ken lowery nice guy what youre doing down here that would put me in the system the whole idea is for me not to be in the system nobody knows youve been sent down here not even the agency especially the agency im on their badguy list theirs and the fbis santini thoughtfully considered that but id like to know about them or is that putting you on the spot youre okay with joel thats good enough for me anyway theres not much to tell the cia station chiefhis cover so called is commercial attacheis a good guy by the name of alex darby from what ive seen hes okay theres no fbi at the embassy but they sent a couple agents over yesterday from montevideo to see if they could be useful i just barely know them typical fbi agents you thinkwhat did you say his name is darby you think darbys in tight with side andor the local cops you know what side is the argentine versions of the cia and the fbi combined in one right santini nodded then asked youve been here before yeah nobody at the embassy knows you i dont think so ive never actually been inside the place santini nodded accepting that and then answered the question i would say darbys tight with side and lowerys tight with the cops he paused and then asked whats going to happen ifwhenthey find out youre down here nosing around down here im not going to say anything but i really hope they dont it would put natalie cohen on the spot with the ambassador for not telling him she knows im down here and why you call the secretary of state by her first name no i call her maam castillo said but then added smiling but she calls me charley speaking of names joel said gossingers a beard my name is really castillo charley castillo he put out his hand santini took it tony he said and then in italian you dont look italian charley shook his head and replied in italian half german and half texan heavy on the hispanic heritage you speak good italian languages come pretty easy to me santini nodded his acceptance of this then asked how good a cover if side develops an interest in you theyll check theyre pretty good at that itll hold up gossinger who works for a german newspaper the tages zeitung is here to do a humaninterest story on the survivors of the graf spee if my editor at the tages zeitung hasnt already told the german embassy im here and said i would appreciate all courtesies he will soon santini looked at him a moment okay so you speak spanish youve been here youve got what sounds like a pretty good cover but i still dont know how you can do what youre supposed to do without going to the embassy i didnt say i wasnt going to go to the embassy charley castillos not going to the embassy youre pretty good at this undercover business playingmakebelieve you could get away with playing gossinger at the embassy why not can i make a suggestion im wide open even if they swallow you whole at the embassy as herr gossinger theyre not going to tell you anything for one thing it hasnt been in the papers or on the tube the argentines are embarrassed and they put a lid on the story were not talking about it to the americansnot the newspaper not the new york times nobody the argentines are hoping that when the bad guys find out theyve got a dips wife theyll turn her loose and the whole thing can be forgotten personally i think theyre pissing in the wind but thats where it is right now so if herr gossinger goes to the embassy and starts answering questions lowery and everybody else are going to wonder how the hell herr gossinger heard about it i hope joel told you i wasnt sent here because i was the bestqualified man all around to conduct an undercover kidnapping investigation joel said you had two skills you were one hell of a swordsman and pretty good about stealing stolen airliners back from the bad guys he didnt mention my poker playing no santini said smiling but figure that out if he told me that he would be admitting you took him joel has one flaw in his character charley said he actually thinks he can play poker he also thinks he can actually play gin santini said when we were on the presidential detail waiting we got to play a hell of a lot of gin i took a lot of his money they smiled at each other but we digress herr gossinger santini said we were talking about my little suggestion lets hear it if say santini began a fellow secret service agent just happened to be passing through buenos aires and checked in with me at the embassy and he and i just happened to bump into ken lowery and i told lowery i was just telling agent whatsisname here about mrs masterson lowery would understand thathes always making reference to we federal agents as if he were oneand would probably stumble over his tongue to tell you how hes dealing with the problem am i detecting you dont think too much of this guys ability as an investigator hes a good guy like i said but how many times do you think hes had a chance to investigate anything more serious than some dip diddling another dips wife such conduct being detrimental to the foreign service of the united states castillo chuckled then asked what would happen to you if they found out youd set this up and they probably would sooner or later maybe they would send me home in disgrace santini said and i could go back to being a real secret service agent coming down here wasnt my idea or maybe you could have told me as the presidential agent what you were doing and ordered me to keep my mouth shut consider yourself so ordered castillo said but i have to tell you the last time i did thatto a guy who had some information i neededthe dci wasnt impressed and relieved him for cause he finally wound up with a letter of commendation from the president but he had a very uncomfortable couple of days before that happened whatll happen will happen santini said how come they sent you down here i hurt myself and was placed on limited duty so they sent me down here to look for funny money howd you hurt yourself joel didnt tell you castillo shook his head if you laugh ill break both your arms santini said conversationally i fell off the vice presidents limo bumper and the trailing yukon ran over my foot i wont laugh but can i smile broadly fuck you herr gossinger santini said smiling what would another secret service agent be doing passing through argentina any one of fifty things it happens all the time at least once a month usually its a supervisory special agent bitching about my expenses crap like that the only problem i can see would be if somebody asked you to prove who you were wait one charley said less than two minutes later he handed his secret service credentials to santini hall got you these he asked when hed examined them castillo shook his head joel went to hall and got them for me these would work i think your call it looks to me like a winner castillo said thanks tony santini made a deprecating gesture the dips dont go to work until nine he said so why dont you get yourself settled and then about nine take a taxi to the embassy okay facing the embassy to the right is the gate for employees use that one the guards are argentines flash the tin at one of them and theyll escort you into the building to post one where theres a marine guard flash the tin at him tell him you want to see me i will appear and profess surprise at seeing supervisory special agent castillo and get you a visitors badge then we will arrange to bump into lowery sounds good a taxi not a remise a taxi to the embassy theres no sense in letting side know you went right from your hotel to the embassy castillo asked for an explanation with a raised eyebrow for a little background santini said the drivers of palermo remise are offduty cops that means they can carry guns thats useful theres a lot of bad guys here the problem is i suspect the offduty cops they send me are side agents if my cynicism is on the money ive worked out an unspoken agreement with side i use their remises the drivers report to side where i go and who i talk to that way they dont have to put a tail on me i just dont talk business in a remise understood castillo said but generallyunless you dont want side to know where youre goingpalermo remise is a good idea santini said and handed him a business card it never takes them much longer than ten minutes to pick you up no matter where you are they use cellulars castillo nodded thanks tony santini handed him a motorola cellular telephone and a charger again castillo asked about it with a raised eyebrow my personal cell number is auto four santini said my personalunlistednumber is five and my office is six ive got a good argentine administrative assistant daniel as far as i know hes not working for side castillo nodded his understanding you can call the states with that but its about nine dollars a second so dont spend hours chatting up your girlfriend who pays the bills for this the secret service or the embassy the secret service which means me which means i guess supervisory agent castillo you can talk to your girlfriend as long as you want to hi there betty charley castillo i was just sitting here in my hotel room in buenos aires wondering how things are going up there in georgia and thought id give you a call yeah i know they must be keeping you pretty busy there in agent school or whatever the hell they call it sorry to bother you thanks tony santini touched his arm see you a little after nine he said and walked from the balcony through the room and out the door charley took a shower the only word to describe the bathroom was sumptuous except for the ceiling everything was marble there was both a jacuzzi and a large shower stall and a heated chrome rack on one wall held enough thick towels to dry an elephant he put on what he thought of as his bureaucrats uniform a dark gray singlebreasted suit with a white buttondown shirt and a striped necktie he looked at his watch and saw that it was five minutes past eight which meant it was five minutes past seven in washington calling joel isaacson to thank him for santini would have to wait and it didnt make sense to send an email for one thing he didnt have much to say except what santini had told him maybe after he talked to the security guy at the embassy he would know more and if by twelveeleven in dche didnt know more then he would send an email saying just that nothing yet working on it best wishes sherlock holmes he reached for the telephone to call room service and then changed his mind he would have coffee in the lobby if there was nothing else to attract his attention and he thought there was a good chance there would be the only other place he knew where there were so many goodlooking women was budapesthed have a look at the buenos aires herald he thought for a moment about what to do with gossingers passport and credit cards and then put them in the padding of the laptop case it was always awkward to be found with two sets of identification he walked down the corridor to the bank of elevators and pushed the downarrow button the door opened almost immediately and he found himself looking at a slim man in his early forties with shortly cropped thinning hair he wore a light brown singlebreasted suit and a subdued necktie he would not stand out in a crowd either youre a much better actor than ive previously given you credit for being or that startled look is genuine the man said so it was pevsners at ezeiza i wonder what the hell theyre doing in buenos aires good morning howard castillo said i would say how are you howard kennedy said but i think the more important question is who are you to day today my name is castillo charley said how about you charley castillo intrepid green beret or charley castillo of the secret service it was a highspeed elevator the door opened onto the lobby as castillos mouth opened there were peoplea family husband wife and two teenaged boyswaiting to get on the elevator the latter howard castillo said as he got off the elevator kennedy waited until no one was within hearing so what brings you to gaucho land charley he asked ill tell you what im doing here if you tell me what you are over a cup of coffee ill buy i know from painful experience how little the government pays its law enforcement agents even the very good ones flattery and the offer of a free cup of coffee will get you everywhere kennedy smiled and touched castillos arm this is probably very foolish of me but im really glad to see you castillo smiled at him im not sure if im glad to see you or just overwhelmed with curiosity kennedy chuckled and led the way to the nice restaurant set for breakfast and lunch an open area furnished with low tables and leatherandchrome armchairs a waitressa stunning young woman with long legs and large dark eyesappeared almost immediately they ordered coffee and bring some pastry please kennedy added when she had gone he said very nice i envy you your bachelor status i saw the pan arabic at ezeiza charley said i wondered if it was yours my you are observant arent you it got in at an obscene hour and i came here to take a shower and a nap and then surprise surprise you were going to tell me what youre doing here we brought a load of tapestries and other decorations from riyadh for the king faisal islamic center and were going to take back two dozen polo ponies and cases of boots and saddles and other accoutrements for the game of kings so youre now a horse trader your turn charley theres a personnel problem at the embassy they sent me down to see what it really is instead of what the ambassador is saying it is castillo nodded something like that the waitress appeared with coffee and pastry that was quick kennedy said he reached for a petit four castillo said my grandfather used to say the only things the argentines do consistently well is eat kennedy chuckled you going to tell me the nature of the personnel problem at the embassy just as soon as you tell me what youre really doing here kennedy smiled at him now that i think about it i really dont give much of a damn about personnel problems in the embassy on the other hand id really like to know what youre really doing here im sure you would but youre going to have to be satisfied with that it is neither illegal nor inimical to the interests of the united states i could ask for no more castillo said and then asked you ever see that mel gibson movie where they kidnap his kid no i cant say that i have id love to know why youre asking it was the inflight movie i fell asleep in the middle and ive been wondering how it turned out i think youre serious they kidnapped his kid and he had to decide to pay the ransom which his wife and the fbi wanted him to do or not pay kennedy shook his head in a previous employment kennedy said i worked a half dozen bigdollar kidnappings bigdollar kidnappings are usually either inside jobs in which case a couple of good interrogators can usually find out who done it in a matter of hours or theyre professional jobs in which case the victim is kept alive only long enough for them to collect the ransom phrased somewhat indelicately if you pay the ransom you lose the victim and the money does that satisfy your curiosity charley what did gibson do i told you i fell asleep before that happened and now youll lie awake nights wondering about it kennedy said sarcastically and then asked how long are you going to be here charley castillo raised both hands in a who the hell knows gesture maybe we can have dinner kennedy said or drinks id like that how do i get in touch with you here i suppose you dont have a cellular or youre not going to give me the number which you show me yours and ill show you mine deal they exchanged cellular phones i know how come i have a cellular even though i just got here so where did you get yours howard maybe you didnt just arrive in the obscene hours of the morning rushed right from the plane to the cellular store did you charley howard its not nicedidnt your mommy tell youto read other peoples minds but to satisfy your curiosity i got mine from the secret service guy here the secret service takes care of its own where did you get yours i borrowed it from a friend sure kennedy looked at him and smiled but didnt respond directly he handed charleys cellular back to him id love to push the autodial buttons on that and see who answers who do you think might answer they call the fbi guys in embassies legal attaches i guess you know cross my heart and hope to die castillo responded none of the autodial buttons will call the fbi i dont even know anybody in the fbi here as a matter of fact i just learned they dont even have an fbi detachment or whatever at the embassy what about your buttons kennedy didnt reply directly to that either instead he said so whats on your agenda right now can i drop you someplace im going to the embassy its right on my way ill drop you on your way to where the king faisal islamic center its just a couple of blocks from the embassy i have a hard time picturing you touching your forehead to the floor in prayer its business charley just business isnt that the line the mafia uses just before they shoot people would that the arabs were as easy to deal with as the mafia kennedy said and stood up he took a wad of money from his pocket and dropped several bills on the table you want a ride or not a black mercedesbenz s with heavily darkened windows was waiting for kennedy when he came through the revolving door a large man who looked vaguely familiar got quickly out of the front passenger seat and opened the rear door you remember herr gossinger dont you frederic kennedy said guten morgen herr gossinger the man said without expression the last time i saw you was in vienna i pegged you as either hungarian or czech but what the hell it all used to be austria gruss gott charley said trying to sound as viennese as possible kennedy got quickly in the backseat and charley slid in after him two the united states embassy avenida colombia buenos aires argentina july as kennedys mercedes turned off avenida libertador castillo could see both the american embassy and the ambassadors residence a large vaguely europeanlooking mansion fronting on libertador a large armored blue policia federal van was parked on the street across from it but charley couldnt see any police the embassy sat a block away overlooking a park behind both a steel picket fence and a half circle of highwaydivider concrete barricades it was unquestionably american he thought somewhat unpatriotically another buildingthe embassies in london and montevideo come to mindbuilt to the pattern that should have won the architect the opposite of the pritzker prize one for designing the ugliest office buildings of the century the only thing that keeps people from confusing that drab concrete oblong with a misplaced airport warehouse is that the gray walls are perforated with neat rows of square inset windows there are probably a thousand roadside marriott or hilton motels that are betterlooking and look american why the hell couldnt they have used brick and thrown in a couple of columns made it look a little like monticello or even the white house the intensity of his reaction surprised him why am i pissed fatigue hangover being sent down here to do something i have no idea how to do maybe that okay certainly that but really its howard kennedy what the hell is he doing here its no coincidence or is it i dont knowhave no way of knowingand that disturbs me and why is he absolutely unable to believe that i have no intention of flipping him to the fbi goddammit by now he should know he can trust me which of course makes me unable to trust him the entrance is way down on the left kennedy said and it looks like theres a line of people ahead of you probably people applying for visas castillo replied theres supposed to be an employee entrance on the right just drop me anywhere along here a moment later the mercedes pulled to the curb charley saw the man in the front jump out to open the door for him he turned to kennedy and offered his hand thanks howard he said i have every confidence youre not going to tell the legal attache how you got here oh goddammit howard i told you theres no fbi here so you said fuck you howard hey charley im just pulling your chain no youre not lets try to have a drink andor dinner kennedy said yeah give me a call he got out of the mercedes and walked quickly across the street there was a gap wide enough to walk through between the wedges of the concrete barrier once through that he could see a gate with a guard shack and a revolving barrier in the steel picket fence there were three men in the guard shack wearing policestyle uniforms with embroidered patches of some security service on the sleeves what looked like smith amp wesson magnum revolvers hung in open holsters from sam browne belts he extended the leather folder holding his secret service credentials to one of the guards im here to see mr santini he said in english this gate is for embassy personnel only the security guard said more than a little arrogantly and pointed to the far side of the embassy you sonofabitch you didnt even look at my credentials an argentine rentacop is denying a secret service agent access to an american embassy no fucking way you get on that goddamn telephone and tell the marine guard that a united states secret service officer is here at the gate castillo snapped in spanish looking a little surprised at the fluent spanish as well as the tone the guard gestured for castillo to show him his credentials again another security guard picked up the telephone castillo turned his back on them that little display of anger was uncalled for what the hell is the matter with me but on the other hand i think that would have been the reaction of a bona fide secret service agent maybe not joel but tom mcguire certainly would not put up with any crap from a rentacop he saw the mercedes had not moved trying to see if im really going in are you howard no what youre trying to do is see whether i am immediately passed in which would mean im known here or whether im being subjected to this rentacop bullshit because they dont know me he smiled and waved cheerfully and the mercedes started to move if you will come with me please senor the rentacop who had been on the telephone said in english castillo turned and saw that the revolving barrier was moving he went through it and the security cop was waiting for him do you have a cellular telephone or other electronic device sir i have a cellular castillo said in spanish youll have to leave it with me sir it will be returned when you leave we will talk to the marine guard about that castillo snapped in spanish and started walking to the embassy building after a moments hesitation the security guard walked after him there were maybe fifteen people standing outside the glass entrance walls they were all smoking i doubt the youcantsmokeinausgovernmentbuilding zealots have ever wondered how much time is lost by all these people taking a smoke break whats that cost the taxpayer okay charley tantrum time is over be nice inside the lobby there was a row of chromeandleather bencheslike the seats in an airportagainst the wall portraits of the president the vice president and the secretary of state on the walls and behind a glasswalled counter a marine guarda sergeantwearing a khaki shirt dress blue trousers and a white sam browne belt may i help you sir the marine guard asked charley handed him the credentials folder which the sergeant examined carefully im here to see mr santini he has a cellular the security guard accused the sergeant picked up a telephone and punched a button sergeant volkmann at post one he said theres a mr castillo to see you sir there was a pause and then the sergeant said yes sir and looked at castillo mr santini will be right down sir the marine sergeant said please have a seat he pointed to the benches he has a cellular the security guard said again excuse me sir the marine sergeant said castillo looked at him are you armed sir the marine sergeant asked pointing to a metaldetector arch in front of the door leading inside castillo shook his head thank you sir castillo sat down on one of the benches the secretary of state unsmiling looked down at him from the wall natalie i really wish you had been able to talk the president out of sending me down here the security guard flashed castillo a dirty look as he walked out of the lobby santini came through the metal detector arch a minute later good morning sir he said putting out his hand i just learned that you were coming how are you santini castillo said as he shook the hand santini turned to the marine guard can i get supervisory special agent castillo a frequent visitor badge or am i going to have to run that through lowery sorry sir the marine said mr lowery runs a tight ship well then give him a regular visitor badge yes sir ill have to have his passport mr santini jesus christ castillo said and then smiled at the sergeant as he handed him his passport sergeant that jesus christ was directed at whoever made a dumb rule not you no problem sir the marine said with a hint of a smile he handed castillo a plastic yellow visitors pass on what looked like a dog tag chain and pushed a clipboard to him if youll sign that please sir and if youll follow me sir santini said well see if we cant straighten this out with mr lowery he the security guy castillo asked yes sir he is castillo hung the visitors badge around his neck and followed santini through the metal detector inside behind the marine guard post enclosure was a foyer in the center of it were two elevator doors one of them open santini waved castillo through it and pushed a floor button i would say that we are about to corner the security lion in his lair santini said when the door had closed and they were alone except that hes more of a pussycat the door from the thirdfloor corridor to the embassy security officers office was open kenneth w lowery he looks a hell of a lot like howard kennedywas sitting at his desk talking on the telephone when he saw santini he smiled and waved him in ill get back to you lowery said and hung up the telephone good morning tony he said say hello to supervisory secret service agent castillo santini said hes in town to complain about my expense sheet having seen your lifestyle i can see where that would be entirely possible lowery said getting up and extending his hand across his desk nice to meet you how are you castillo said what are the chances of getting mr castillo a frequent visitor badge hes going to be in and out how long are you going to be here mr castillo call me charley please castillo said as long as it takes to get santini to admit hes been robbing the service blind that shouldnt take more than a week or so could i see your credentials please and your travel orders credentials yes castillo said travel orders no you dont have travel orders lowery asked blanket castillo said lowery examined the credentials carefully i dont think ive ever met a supervisory special agent before he said making it a question how the hell do i respond to that i wasnt notified that you were coming lowery said another question not a statement thats why they call it the secret service santini said what we do is secret we dont tell anyone lowery did not find that amusing except for having a couple of chats with santini i have no business with the embassy castillo said if theres a problem with this frequent visitor badge he thinks i should have forget it he paused and added theres a number you can call to verify my bona fides on the back side of the photo id oh no no problem at all lowery said quickly can i borrow these for a moment ill have my secretary make up the badge sure castillo said lowery went through a side door and came back a moment later take just a couple of minutes shell type it out and then plasticize it i told her to make it out for two weeks that be long enough more than long enough castillo said thank you can i offer you a cup of coffee while were waiting yes thank you lowery went through the door again and returned shortly with three china mugs i know tony takes his black lowery said but theres he takes it black then whats that thirtyeightdollar item for cream and sugar santini lowery looked at him then laughed tonys been telling me about your problem castillo said what problem is that lowery asked warily the missing wife castillo said lowery flashed santini a dirty look santini rose to it come on ken its not as if mr castillo works for the new york times lowery considered that for a moment actually just before you came in i was wondering how long it will be before the times guy hears about it he paused then added what did tony tell you just that the wife of the chief of mission is missing under mysterious circumstances the husbands climbing the walls understandably lowery said she was waiting for him in a restaurant in san isidro when he got there her purse and car were there and she wasnt and you think she was kidnapped lowery hesitated before replying then asked have you got much experience with this sort of thing mr castillo a little once for example i helped snatch two iraqi generals one russian general one russian colonel and half a dozen other noniraqis from a scud site in the iraqi desert i dont think thats what you have in mind but lets see where this goes frankly i dont lowery said let me tell you what ive got and you tell me what you think sure i dont think these people were just hanging around the kansas parking lot to grab the first woman they thought looked as if someone would pay to get her back too many wellheeled folks pass through that parking lot on any given night and never a nab they were looking for mrs masterson that suggests they think the government would pay to get her back dont they know that we dont pay ransom to turn people loose jack masterson has money lowery said lots of money you dont know who he is castillo shook his head jack the stack lowery asked castillo shook his head again the basketball player that didnt ring a bell but there was a very slight tinkle oh in the fourth month of his professional basketball career lowery explained for which over a fiveyear period jack the stack was to be paid ten million dollars castillos eyebrows went up christ now i know but he was run over by a beer truck when leaving the stadium castillo said driven by a guy who had been sampling his product lowery finished he had twice as much alcohol in his blood than necessary to be considered legally under the influence and there was a settlement castillo said one hell of a settlement without even going to court jack wasnt badly injured but enough so that he would never be able to play professional ball again the brewery didnt want to go to court because not only were they going to losethey were responsible and knew it the truck driver was their agentbut there would be all sorts of the wrong kind of publicity they paid not only the ten million he would have earned under his contract but also what he could reasonably have expected to earn in the rest of his professional career it came to sixty million not counting the money he could have made with endorsements i always wondered what happened to him after he left the game castillo said my thoughts were unkind i wondered how long it would take himlike the winners of a lottery or heavyweight championsto piss away all that money and wind up broke reduced to greeting people in the lobby of some casino in las vegas and he wound up a diplomat oh you are a fine judge of character charley castillo jack could have of course bought an island in the bahamas and spent the rest of his life fishing but hes not that kind of guy he wanted to do something with his life and he had an education the foreign service seems a long way from a basketball court castillo said not if your wife is the daughter of an ambassador and for that matter your brotherinlaw a pretty highly placed guy in the united nations jack had a degree cum laudein political science so when he took the foreign service examination and passed it with flying colors no one was really surprised you dont think of pro athletes having cum laude degrees in anything castillo said do i believe that no i know better there have been exceptions but the accusation has been made justifiably that c g castillo has a tendency toward political incorrectness once jack was in the foreign service he started working his way up quickly working his way up hes good at what he does after this tour theyll probably make him an ambassador and you think the people who grabbed his wife knew this story hell this is the age of satellite television the average argentine twentyyearold knows more about american professional basketball than i do certainly more than i do i have never understood why people stay glued to a television screen watching outsized mature adults in baggy shorts try to throw a basketball through a hoop there arent very many african americans in argentina lowery said even fewer who stand sixfeeteight and get their pictures on the tv and in la nacion and clarin when theyre standing in for the ambassador or explaining a change in visa policy who is that huge black guy looks like a basketball player why thats jack the stack thats who he is the guy who got all those millions when the cerveza truck ran over him that makes sense lets snatch his wife lowery concluded yeah castillo agreed so far not a word from the kidnappers lowery said is that unusual the policia federal tell me they usually call within hours just to tell the family not to contact the police and make their first demands either then or within twentyfourhours its beenmy god it will be fortyeight hours at seven tonight how good are the police the ones that arent kidnappers themselves are very good really they fired the whole san isidro police commissariatlike a precincta while back on suspicion of being involved in kidnappings there were they probably lowery said he looked thoughtfully at castillo for a moment have i made it clear that i like jack masterson personally and professionally castillo nodded im worried about him both personally and professionally lowery said how so the policy of never dealing with terrorists or kidnappers makes a lot of sense intellectually lowery said but emotionally my wife hasnt been kidnapped and i dont have the money to pay any ransom you think if they contact him hell pay i dont know if he did he might get his wife back and he might not these people have just a couple of months ago after a rich argentine businessman paid an enormous ransom after the kidnappers sent him his sons amputated fingers santini told me that story castillo interrupted they found the boys body theyd shot him in the head nice people castillo said who are entirely capable of doing the same thing to betsy masterson lowery went on worstcase scenario jack doesnt get betsy back and it comes out that he paid a ransom in violation of strict policy with which he is familiar thatd mean he would have lost both his wife and his career in the state department or he does get her back and they find out hes paid the ransom and that would end his career a price any reasonable man would be happy to pay i think wives are more important than money or careers i wonder if mel gibson came to that conclusion you do have somebody sitting on him castillo asked excuse me its cop talk the first time i heard it was in the counterintelligence bureau of the philadelphia police department captain obrien ordered sergeant schneider to sit on dick miller and me until further orders i was more than a little disappointed to realize he only meant that she was to be helpful while not letting us out of her sight and ensuring that we didnt do anything we should not be doing keeping him company castillo said interesting term lowery said no i mean i try to stay in contact with him but i couldnt assign a guard to him or anything like that he has a driver of course one of those argentine security people in civilian clothes and armed but he does what jack tells him not the other way around but for one thing jack wouldnt permit being followed around by one of my guys and for another i dont have much of a staff castillo grunted then asked is he coming into work yes and no he comes in but then he leaves i know that yesterday he took their kids to school and picked them up and he called in this morning to say he was taking them to school again theres adequate security at the school hes not worried about something happening to the kids its the lincoln school lowery said its an accredited kthroughtwelve american school many nonamerican diplomats send their kids there and a lot of argentines not only does the school have its own security peoplethe same company we use at the embassy as a matter of factbut a lot of the parents station their own security people outside when school is in session its one of the safest places in town i dont know what im talking about of course but if my wife was kidnapped and i knew their school was safe id send themor take them make their life at least as normal as possible take their minds off mommy a very tall african american in a very welltailored suit walked into lowerys office without knocking followed by a small plump man with a pencilline mustache in a rumpled suit that has to be masterson i wonder who the bureaucrat with him is chief of mission j winslow masterson smiled absently at castillo and santini and then looked at kenneth lowery anything ken he asked not a word jack lowery said i just dropped the kids at school masterson said it looked to me like there were more policia federal there than usual could be jack lowery said masterson looked at santini good morning tony good morning sir mr masterson this is supervisory special agent castillo masterson smiled and put out his hand fbi from montevideo i was just about to go looking for you im with the secret service mr masterson castillo said just passing through i just now heard whats happened masterson shook his head but said nothing for a moment then he said its the not knowing thats getting to me what do these bastards want why havent we heard anything from them you poor bastard i was going to suggest jackeven before mr castillo showed upthat tony get together with those fbi people lowery said if you wouldnt mind mr castillo maybe you and tony i think thats a very good idea masterson said whats that phrase they use in the advertising business brainstorm where are they theyre using the dea office lowery said we could use my office masterson said but it would probably be better if we went there lowery stood up he looked at castillo ill have my secretary bring your frequent visitor badge up there castillo smiled at him and nodded excuse me masterson said mr castillo or do i call you agent castillo misters fine sir charleys better masterson smiled at him okay charley this is alex darby our commercial attache more important my friend darby offered castillo his hand there was curiosity in his eyes is the friendthecommercialattache curious about the secret service being here or the cia station chief hello mr castillo darby said how do you do charley replied now there was the hint of a smile on darbys thin lips what the hell does that mean the drug enforcement administration officea large room with a dozen desks and a large conference table plus three smaller glasswalled officeswas on the third floor of the embassy the seven men seated around the conference table stood up when they saw masterson come in three of them are wearing shoulder holsters probably the dea agents keep your seats masterson said with a wave and a smile there was a chorus of good morning sir i thought maybe if we all put our heads together masterson said and brainstorm the situation we might be able to make some sense out of it is that all right with everybody another chorus this time of yes sir the man at the head of the table one of those wearing a shoulder holster stood up clearly offering masterson his seat masterson took it this gentleman is supervisory special agent castillo of the secret service masterson said gesturing at castillo and then offering his hand to one of the other men im presuming youre one of the fbi agents from montevideo yes sir the man said special agent dorman sir and this is special agent yung special agent yung was oriental not korean castillo judged or japanese most likely chinese yung looked at castillo with far greater interest than dorman did im presuming you know mr santini our resident secret service agent masterson asked both fbi agents nodded well i suppose the best place to start is at the beginning masterson went on and two things gentlemen one is that youre the experts i have no experience with this sort of thing and second this will only work if you say almost anything that comes to mind okay lets start with what i sort of suspect may be the beginning does anyone think theres anything but unfortunate coincidencein the three automobile accidentsthe third on my way to meet my wifeive been involved in in the past month or five weeks he looked at yung why dont we start with you mr yung two hours and some minutes later masterson himself finally called off the brainstorming session everyone had really run out of ideaswild and reasonablethirty minutes before but no one seemed to be willing to suggest they stop masterson was no better off than when they had started and everyone felt sorry for him and a little guilty that they and he knew now exactly what they had known when they started nothing as masterson lowery santini darby and castillo were standing waiting for the elevator and castillo was wondering why they didnt just walk down the stairs darby broke the silence i just had a thought he announced and looked at his wristwatch its a couple of minutes to twelve i thought maybe mr castillo would be able to see something at the kansas that the rest of us have missed would you be all right jack if i took him out there for lunch maybe you could have lunch with tony and ken castillo saw that masterson was as obviously surprised at the suggestion as he was masterson looked like he was going to object to at least parts of it but finally clutching at straws said good idea alex we can walk over to the rio alba tony santini said and ken can buy ill come back for you jack in time to pick up the kids after school darby said when the elevator stopped at the second floor darby touched castillos arm as a signal they werent getting off the others did when they got off in the basement darby picked up a telephone punched a button and delivered a cryptic messageorder im taking your car dont take mine ill be back a little after two when they walked down the row of cars and darby pointed to a volkswagen golf and got behind the wheel castillo thought he understood darby didnt want an embassy car with a driver the golf had ordinary argentine license plates for some reason darby didnt want to be seen at the restaurant in an embassy car it wasnt until the security guard at the gate asked for castillos identification that castillo realized lowerys secretary still had them dont give me any trouble about this darby said not pleasantly in fluent spanish all you have to know is that this gentleman is with me reluctantly the security guard passed them out of the embassy grounds about half of them are really nice guys darby said the other half are like that they love to show their authority i had a little trouble getting into the embassy myself castillo said so from what youve seen so far castillo how do you like buenos aires castillo was about to reply when he belatedly realized darby had switched from english to pashtu one of the two major languages of afghanistan the other being afghan persian darby saw the surprise on castillos face and laughed you really dont remember me do you he asked still in pashtu castillo shook his head the last time i saw you was in zaranj darby said there were several highranking army officers who couldnt seem to make up their minds whether to courtmartial you and send you home in chains or give you a medal something about a stolen blackhawk i seem to recall well so much for my cover castillo said in pashtu what were you doing in zaranj zaranj was a city on the border of iran and afghanistan i ran the agency there whatever happened to that black guy whose knee was really all fucked up if you mean did he make it yeah he made it thanks to you i was there when you brought the chopper back he wouldnt have made itprobably none of them wouldif you hadnt gone after them he would have done the same thing for me castillo said as to what happened to him truth being stranger than fiction he wasat least for a while station chief in luanda angola i thought it probably was you two darby said thought what was i hate to think how many manhours and how much money i pissed away here looking for that stolen darby said langley was hysterical when they couldnt find it and then the search was called off without explanation i was curious so when i was in langley a month ago i asked strictly out of school an old pal told me that some hotshot named castillo had put his nose into agency affairs and found it and stole it back said action seriously pissing off the dci i figured that had to be you particularly after he also told me the dci had tried to crucify the luanda station chief who just happened to be an exspecial forces officer with a bad knee from afghanistan for giving intel to said castillo im not too popular with the fbi either castillo said so now what im wondering is what the hell youre doing here waving a secret service badge around the badge is legitimate i figured that santini would spot a phony right away or would have been told to ask no questions i dont think i could talk you into asking no questions not a chance the president sent me down here to find out whats going on with mastersons wife the way you said that it sounds as if the president himself said castillo go to buenos aires that it didnt come down through channels what the president said was i want to know how and why that happened and i dont want to wait until whoevers in charge down there has time to write a coverhisass report he said that to you castillo nodded is that what you think im going to do write a covermyass report no i think what you want to do is whatever it takes to get that poor bastards wife back to him alive thank you darby said there was a long silence and then darby said what were going to do now is have a nice lunch during which i will make up my mind what im going to tell who about you and when youll tell me what you decide yeah ill tell you thank you castillo said iv one restaurant kansas avenida libertador san isidro buenos aires province argentina july how much of that sixty million did he actually get do you think castillo asked darby they were sitting at a table in the crowded bar of the kansas smoking cigars with their coffee they had been sitting for several minutes without speaking lost in their own thoughts and the question came out of the blue it took darby a moment to come back from wherever he had been im going to give you the benefit of the doubt charley that thats not curiosity i was wondering if there is a ransom demand and he says fuck the rules i want my wife back ill pay where would he get the money how would he get it down here what is that line great minds run on parallel paths something like that the answer to the first part of the question is that the irs took their biteat his level right at half countinglouisiana state income taxout of the lostwages part of the settlement in other words he got something like eight and a half million and taxes ate half of that the rest of the settlement was compensation for pain and suffering et cetera thats tax free youre talking more than forty million dollars where is it its more than that now theres a guyhe and jack went to some private high school togetherin the hibernia national bank and trust in new orleans whos been managing it for him managing it very well hes from new orleans darby shook his head just across the border in mississippi a place called pass christian on the gulf betsys from new orleans her father whos a retired ambassador lives there you checked masterson out i guess no he told me i met jack when we were both in paris years ago were close im the successor executorafter his fatherof his will so he figured i should know what i was letting myself in for castillo nodded and they fell silent for a moment thats another problem the poor bastard has telling betsys family darby said you think hes told his i dont think hed want to tell his father without telling betsys and betsys fathers likely to have a heart attack literally hes got a really bad heart condition somebody said something about a brotherinlaw works for the un jack doesnt like him why not darby shrugged he never told me but it was pretty evident then darby changed the subject to answer your first question what i would do if i were jack mastersonwhat im half afraid hes already doneis get on the phone to his money guy at hibernia get me a million dollars get on the next plane down here with it and dont tell anyone it might not be that easy castillo said rich people dont keep much cash around either cashcash or in a checking account even a banker would have trouble coming up with a million in cash without somebody asking some hard questions you sound like youre speaking from experience darby said castillo ignored him and a million dollars in hundreds takes up a lot of space a hundred thousand right from the federal reserve makes a bundle about this big he demonstrated with his hands you really live in an apartment in the mayflower charley darby asked castillo decided to ignore that too but then changed his mind whered you hear that from the same guy who told me about you and the dci i wont tell you who he is but you know him he was in afghanistan when we were not to worry he likes you what else did my friend with the big mouth tell you about me that youre texas oil money im from texas and i can afford to live in the mayflower can we leave it at that okay theres also some sort of a law castillo said that when you take ten thousand or more in cash from a bank the bank has to tell somebody i dont know who maybe the irs but somebody and i dont know what im talking about here but i think theres another law that says you have to declare it if youre taking ten thousandmaybe five thousandin cash out of the country ill ask tony hed know or one of those fbi guys from montevideo they would know there was the buzzing of a cellular phone both men took theirs out hey charley howard kennedys voice came somewhat metallically over castillos cellular hows things going darby put his cellular away and looked with interest at castillo whats new howard castillo asked a mutual friend would like to see you really hes quite anxious you meet why do i find that menacing thats very flattering why i have no idea what are you doing now where are you im drinking a cup of coffee in a restaurant in san isidro it would just take a couple of hours charley can i pick you up what restaurant hold one howard castillo said and took the cellular from his ear painful experience had taught him that cellular microphones were very sensitive he hit a series of keys with his thumb to select the mute function then for insurance raised his right buttock shoved the cellular under and sat on it his buttocks was the only object he knew for sure would effectively cover the cellulars mic darby had apparently come to the same conclusion because he smiled understandingly castillo smiled back this is a guy i really should see castillo explained i was hoping it was tony saying theyd heard something me too castillo said is there some reason you think i should go back to the embassy darby shook his head but i have to get back i told jack id go with him to pick up his kids at school youll be all right to get to your hotel ill be fine castillo lifted his rump reclaimed the phone and keyed unmute you still there howard what the hell was that all about im in the kansas restaurant on libertador i know where it is ill be there in ten fifteen minutes same car can i get you to wait on the street why dont you go into the parking lot that will make it easier for the fbi thats not funny goddammit just pulling your chain howard ten minutes out in front kennedy said and the connection went dead darby looked at him curiously private joke castillo explained somebody else the fbi doesnt like darby nodded theres a lot of people like that why dont we put our numbers in each others cellular if youre going to tell loweryor masterson or the ambassadorwhat im doing down here that would be a waste of time not tonight maybe tomorrow but im not going to say anything tonight and then not until i give you warning and who knows whats liable to happen tonight thanks castillo said and handed him his cellular for darby to punch in his number two the black mercedesbenz s appeared in the flow of westbound traffic on avenida libertador and castillo stepped off the curb so they would see him the car pulled to the curb and the rear door was opened from the inside he saw kennedy inside get in charley kennedy said the car started the moment castillo had pulled the door closed gruss gott castillo said speaking the viennese greeting in as thick an accent as he could muster gruss gott herr gossinger frederic replied from behind the wheel thats not a viennese accent not even czech good ol frederics probably a hungarian why did i do that why do i care the mercedes made the next left turn they were moving through a residential area looking much castillo thought like one of the better neighborhoods of san antonio except that all the houses here were behind wallssome of them topped with razor wireand almost all of them had bars on the windows kennedy touched his arm and handed him something it looked like a black velvet bag whats this its a velvet bag kennedy said it goes over your head now i know why i felt menaced they call it intuition youre kidding right not at all you know my boss he pays a good deal of consideration to his privacy fuck you howard and fuck your boss castillo said evenly then he raised his voice for the benefit of frederic stop the car jesus christ charley theres nothing personal in this stop the car before i have to hurt you howard take us back to the restaurant kennedy ordered in german and then added to castillo you know hes not going to like this make sure you tell him i said go fuck yourself alex now stop the goddamn car kennedy hesitated a moment then ordered frederic to pull to the curb castillo got out slammed the door and started to walk toward avenida libertador he heard the mercedes drive off it was a threeblocklong walk to libertador and he was half a block away when he saw the mercedes it was stopped at the curb facing him and kennedy was standing on the sidewalk beside it he was holding something in his left hand i dont think hes stupid enough to pull a gun and force me into the car but theres no telling when castillo got closer he saw that what kennedy had in his hand was a cell phone you have a call herr gossinger kennedy said jokingly he was wearing an uncomfortable smile if frederic looks like hes even thinking of getting out of the car youre going to either the hospital or the morgue castillo said kennedy handed castillo the telephone and then took three steps backward and raised his open hands to show he had no intention of doing anything castillo maintaining eye contact said into the phone hello if howard offended you in any way my friend alex pevsner said in russian you have my apology howard was doing what you told him to do and dont call me your friend castillo replied in russian where i come from friends trust friends friends dont ask friends to put bags over their heads when you get here my friend you will understand why i was trying to be a little more cautious than i usuallyam and you will understand that i really consider you a trustworthy friend why should i go anywhere because i am asking you as a friend i dont want to have to hurt howard there will be no need to even consider something like that please give me just a few hours of your time whatever this is about its important to him he doesnt ask people to do things he tells them and it is credibly alleged has them killed if they dont do what he says okay castillo said after a just perceptible hesitation thank you charley pevsner said and there was a click as the connection was broken castillo looked at kennedy and then tossed the phone to him get in the car howard and put the bag over your head castillo said he took pity on kennedy when he saw the look on his face just pulling your chain howard three their route took them through the residential district of san isidro and then past a long line of interestinglooking restaurants facing the san isidro jockey club he thought he more or less knew where he was his grandfather had taken him and charleys cousin fernando here a half dozen or more times when they were in high school then quickly they were on a wide superhighwaysix lanes in each directionand although this was new to him castillo was pretty sure that it was the old pan americana highway the argentines had been expanding it for years and they had apparently finally finished what they called an autopista after six or seven kilometers at what castillo decided was at least twenty klicks above the posted kilometersperhour speed limitmeaning they were going ninetyplus miles per hourthe road split and frederic took the left fork signs said that the right fork was the highway to uruguay and that they were now headed for pilar they went through a tollbooth without stopping just slowing enough for a machine to read a device that opened the barrier and then frederic quickly accelerated back to their wayabovethespeedlimit velocity on the left was a large factory a long rectangular building three stories high and three hundred meters long connected to four enormous round concrete silos with a rats nest of conveyors luccetti la pasta de mama was lettered in thirtyfoottall letters across the silos castillo chuckled kennedy looked at him mamas family obviously eats a lot of pasta charley said kennedy smiled and said there are more italians here than spanish the autopista here was narrowerthree lanes in each directionbut the speed limit was still kph and frederic was still driving much faster than that outside the autopista fence there were now large attractive restaurants and what looked like recently constructed showrooms for audi bmw and other european and japanese automobiles charley saw only a ford showroom to represent american manufacturers and wondered idly where mercedesbenz had their showroom he had been out this way as a kid too but then there had been only a twolane highway leading from buenos aires to the estancias in the country the area around pilar was obviously now an upscale residential areasomebody had to be buying the audis and bmwsbut there were no houses visible from the highway just businesses catering to people with money frederic took an exit ramp off the highway and there was the missing mercedes showroom a typically elegant affair across the road from a large shopping center anchored by a jumbo supermarket and then they were in the country again three klicks or so down a twolane highwaywhich slowed frederic down to no more than say sixtyfive or seventy mphthe car braked suddenly and turned off the road and slowed as they approached a twostory redtiledroof gatehouse a sign carved from wood read buena vista country club there were four uniformed guards at the gatehouse two of whom looked into the mercedes carefully before a heavy redandwhite steel barrier pole was raised all the guards were armed and inside the gatehouse charley saw a rack holding a halfdozen riot guns they looked like american ithaca pump shotguns now this castillo thought is what you call a gated community once inside the property there were signs announcing a thirtykph speed limit and these were reinforced with speed bumps on the macadam road every two hundred meters or so frederic now obeyed the speed limit and then far enough into the property so they would not be visible from the road outside the first houses came into view the mercedes rolled slowly down a curving road past long rows of upscale houses set on wellmanicured hectare lots there were no barred windows as there had been on the upscale houses in san isidro they passed a polo fieldlined with the same quality housesand then another and then came to several greens and then the clubhouse of a wellmaintained golf course there were thirty or so cars in the parking lot and then more houses on the winding road the houses and the lots in this area were larger some perhaps mostof them were ringed with shrubbery tall enough so that only the upper floors of the houses were visible castillo saw that the shrubbery also concealed fences frederic turned off the road and stopped before a tenfoothigh gate after a moment the gate rolled open to the right charley saw a workman at what was probably the gate control he had a pistol under his loose denim jacket once they were inside charley saw a man in a golf cart rolling along the perimeter of the property there was a golf bag mounted on the cart that did not completely conceal the butt stock of a shotgun this is obviously a doublegated community a gated community within a gated community as opposed to a doublegaited community which is one whose inhabitants are a little vague about their sexual preferences he saw first a bell ranger helicopter sitting on what looked like a putting green and then the house an englishlooking near mansion of red brick with casement windows as they approached the main door of the house opened and a tall man who appeared to be in his late thirties walked out and down a shallow flight of steps to the cobblestone driveway aleksandr pevsneralso known as vasily respin and alex dondiemo and a half dozen other names an international dealer in arms and it was often and credibly alleged head of at least a dozen other enterprises of very questionable legality and for whom arrest warrants had been issued at one time or another by at least thirteen governmentswas wearing gray flannel slacks a white buttondown shirt in the open neck of which in the argentine manner was a silk scarf held in place by a sterling silver ring a powder blue pullover sweater and highly polished brown shoes with thick rubber cushion soles he folded his arms over his chest smiled and waited for the mercedes to stop and for frederic to quickly run around the front of the car to open the rear door ah charley pevsner called in russian as castillo got out thank you for coming its a delight to see you frankly i didnt think much of the first invitation alex castillo replied also in russian offering pevsner his hand for which i have already apologized and will apologize again now if you wish once is enough alex castillo said adding nice house pevsner broke the handshake and put his hands firmly on castillos upper arms and looked into his eyes pevsners eyes were large and blue and extraordinarily bright the first time charley had met him he had unkindly wondered if pevsner had been inhaling controlled substances through his nose i must ask you two questions my friend pevsner said in a moment you will understand why ask what are you doing in argentina why are you here this is one of those times when telling the truth and only the truth is the smart thing to do charley immediately answered the wife of the chief of mission at our embassy here has disappeared under circumstances which look like kidnapping the president sent me down here to see whats going on castillo saw that his answer surprised pevsner but he didnt pursue it directly your being here has nothing to do with me castillo shook his head not a thing i had no idea youor howardwere anywhere near argentina pevsner looked into castillos eyes for a long moment alex i dont care how long you look for signs of me lying you wont find any and if i have any luck at all you wont see signs indicating that im more than a little afraid of you pevsner finally squeezed castillos arms in a friendly gesture and let him go thank you for your honesty my friend he said now why dont we go in the house have a glass of wine and let me introduce you to my family your family castillo blurted yes my family my wife and children ill be goddamned well that explains all the concern but what the hell are they doing here castillo after meeting aleksandr pevsner for the first time in vienna had reported to secretary of homeland security matt hall that pevsner had told him the missing had been stolen by somalian terrorists who intended to crash it into the liberty bell pevsner had said he would do whatever he could to help locate it because he was against muslim terrorists for many reasons the primary one being he was a family man who adored his wife and three children he didnt want them hurt by muslim fanatics pevsner had then produced a photograph of him with what he said was his family a very attractive blond wife and three blond children who looked straight from a clairol advertisement castillo knew it sounded incredible and that hall was going to have a hard time believing any of it he was not prepared however for the look of unabashed incredulity on halls faceand on joel isaacsons and tom mcguires clearly they not only believed zero zilch nada of what he was telling them but were alsoworsenow questioning his reputation as a hardass special operator for wasting his and their time relating it charley ive seen his dossier isaacson said its this thick he held his hands eighteen inches apart theres a lot in there about murder extortion bribery smuggling armsdealing you name it but not one line about his being a devoted husband and loving daddy i believed him castillo had replied about what part hall asked most of it charley said the family photograph looked too cozy not to have been staged you actually think the airplane was stolen by somalians who plan to crash it into the liberty bell because of what this international thug told you hall asked more sadly than angrily sir you told me that one of the major problems in intelligence is with people at my level telling their superiors what they think the superiors want to hear instead of what they believe what i told you just now is what i believe that wasnt me who told you that hall said after a long pause that was the president charley do you know how close you came to having this guy take you out joel isaacson asked yeah i do joel he said he was glad he didnt have to give me an indian beauty spota smallcaliber bullet in the foreheadand i believed that too four pevsner led castillo into the house through a twostory entrance foyer to a sitting room with the exception of what was probably an antique samovar sitting on a table the furnishings of the sitting room gave it a british feeling two walls were lined with books and oil paintings and there was a redleather couch with matching armchairs the windows offered a view of a large swimming pool under a curved plastic roof something like a quonset hut vapor rose from the pool well they dont have many heated swimming pools in merry old england but this place still feels english a middleaged woman in a maids uniform came into the sitting room from a side door as the three men entered would you please ask madam pevsner if it is convenient for her and the children to join us pevsner ordered in russian the woman unsmiling nodded but didnt say anything she left the sitting room by the door pevsner kennedy and castillo had come in howard see if you can find someone in the kitchen who can bring wine and so forth pevsner ordered in english red right charley kennedy asked a cabernet please castillo said as he walked to the samovar for a closer look he had just decided that it was a bona fide antique russian kettle when pevsner said in russian ah anna come and welcome charley to our home castillo turned and saw the wife and kiddies from the clairol commercial walking into the room they were all almost startlingly blond and fairskinned the mother looked to be in her late twenties but charley decided she had to be older than that to be the mother of the girl who was thirteen or fourteen there were two boys one who charley guessed was ten or so and another about six everyone was wearing a thick white terry cloth robe madam pevsner smiled and put out her hand to castillo and said in russian im happy to meet you my husband has told me so much about you the maid was now in the room olga would you bring some wine madam pevsner ordered and the maid walked to what was apparently the kitchen door howards getting the wine pevsner said in russian and then switched to english greet our guest in english he said to the children charley this is elena darling this is mr castillo elena shyly almost blushing curtsied and said how do you do mr castillo in a pronounced british accent im very pleased to meet you elena the tenyearold was even more shy the sixyearold was not he walked past his brother put out his hand and announced i am sergei and i am happy to make your acquaintance sir and im pleased to meet you aleksandr pevsner said propelling the tenyearold into action the tenyearold squirming finally offered his hand and mumbled something unintelligible pevsner beamed proudly youll have to excuse the robes mr castillo anna pevsner said but my husband said he wasnt sure if you could come and the children like to have a swim when they come from school well i certainly dont want to interfere with that castillo said the sixyearold sergei beamed at castillo i really hate to leave them alone in the pool anna said howard can watch them for a few minutes darling pevsner said kennedy came into the room howard would you mind watching the children in the pool for a few minutes not at all howard is being banished from the conversation im about to have with pevsner and his wife whats going on the older two children trailed by kennedy went out of the sitting room sergei marched up to castillo shook his hand and ran after them nice kids alex castillo said thank you charley pevsner said and then as a younger maidthis one looked argentinecame in with a tray holding glasses a bottle of wine and a large chrome corkscrew said ah finally the wine why dont we sit down anna asked gesturing at the redleather couch and armchairs castillo sat in one of the armchairs anna sat on the couch and pevsner after gesturing for the maid to put the tray on the coffee table sat beside her and reached for the wine and corkscrew local wine pevsner said from a bodega near mendoza in the foothills of the andes ever been to mendoza charley uhhuh we have some friends there pevsner poured the wine into enormous crystal glasses handed one first to his wife then one to charley then he tapped his glass against charleys welcome to our home charley he said thank you charley took a sip and expressed his appreciation with a smile why do i think charley that your curiosity is about to bubble over what in hell is alex doing here maybe youre reading my mind again castillo said what were doing charley is hiding in the open pevsner said aleksandr pevsner a hungarian whose estates were seized by the communists got everything back when freedom came and then having enough of both hungarian winters and oppressive governments sold everything and came to the new world to start life again he invested his money in land and vineyards including this one as a matter of fact he tapped the wine bottle very clever castillo said theres a tradition of that you know of people running from whats going on in europe to find peace in argentina theres a bona fide grand duke of the austrohungarian empireactually his grandson but he has taken the title and is pleased when i call him your gracein a little town called maschwitz near here he teases me that i have the same name as an infamous russian scoundrel very clever castillo repeated think about it charley where could we live in russia russia is now not far from where it was before the revolution crime and corruption are rampant and i wouldnt be at all surprised if communismunder another name of coursecame back anywhere in a muslim country i do business there of course but can you imagine anna in an environment like that not even allowed to drive a car living in constant fear that some muslim fanatic will machinegun her car because shes obviously an infidel and while this may surprise you there are people in prague and vienna and budapest and bucharest who dont like me im shocked castillo said there is corruption here of course and crime the newspapers are full of stories of robbery and kidnapping the result of that has been the development of what i call the country club culture the upper classes live in places like this and when they go to buenos aires they frequently are accompanied by bodyguardscalled securitywhich raises no eyebrows whatever i saw the guy in the golf cart with the shotgun castillo said i have a few of my own people of course but most of my security is argentine there is golf here do you play charley castillo shook his head and polo i dont play but aleksandr and sergei are taking lessons and anna and elena are taking courses in horse riding whats that called equestrianism anna furnished equestrianism at the stables here and of course the schools are good the better ones like saint agnes in the hills are a british legacy your kids go to a school called saint agnes in the hills castillo asked smiling pevsner smiled back which has an anglican priest for a headmaster there being no russian orthodox church to speak of in argentina and since the anglicans and the russian orthodox recognize each others priesthood and liturgy elena was last year confirmed into the anglican church well you seem to have everything under control alex castillo said good for you i thought so charley until howard came here this morning and asked me guess who got onto my elevator in the four seasons just now at the risk of repeating myself i had no idea until today that either you or howard had ever been near argentina and if youre worried that im going to tell anyone we bumped into each other dont you said something about a kidnapping the wife of the chief of mission at the american embassy is missing under circumstances that suggest kidnapping castillo said kidnapping is common here pevsner said didnt she have security why would anyone kidnap a diplomats wife anna asked does he have money a lot of money charley said i didnt see anything in the paper pevsner said as he leaned forward to pour wine into charleys glass theyre trying to keep it quiet they hope that maybe when the kidnappers find out shes a diplomats wife theyll turn her loose thats not what theyre liable to do pevsner said i can make a couple of calls for you if youd like all contributions gratefully received castillo said so far theres been no contact i really feel sorry for the husband they have three kids and they want to know when mothers coming home oh god anna said how awful yeah castillo said where did they take her anna asked not from their home from the parking lot of the kansas restaurant in san isidro alex and i eat there often anna said then a touch of horror in her voice not right in front of her children castillo shook his head she was waiting for her husband to pick her up after work the kids were at home and the president sent you down here to do what pevsner asked find out what happened and report to him speaking of the president and before i make those calls did you ever have a chance to mention to him that i was helpful in getting that airplane back for you yes i did the presidents diary for that weekend read in part friday june pm arrival at presidents residence saturday june through sunday june pm no official events or guests or visitors sunday june pm departure for the white house that was not exactly the truth the president believed both that what he did in the privacy of his home was nobodys business but his own and furthermore that he had the right to decree what was an official event and what was not the diaries of the secretary of homeland security the director of central intelligence the director of the federal bureau of investigation and the commander in chief of us central command for the same period however all reported they had spent periods of from two to five hours on saturday june at a location variously described as the carolina white house the presidential residence or hilton head all but secretary hall of homeland security were sitting in upholstered white wicker armchairs drinking beer with the president when the first of the helicopters a glistening blue twinengine air force huey made its approach to the lawn between the house and the atlantic ocean and fluttered down john powell the dci and mark schmidt the director of the fbi were in business suits and general allan naylor cinc central command was in uniform the presidentwas wearing a white shirt with the cuffs turned up a necktie pulled down khaki trousers and loafers an air force colonel in a summerweight uniform got out of the helicopter reached back inside to pick up a small softsided suitcase and then followed one of the secret service presidential detail agents to the awningshaded verandah of the house the president shook the hand of colonel jacob d torine usaf then handed him a bottle of beer then they watched as another hueythis one a singleengine army helicopter painted a dull olive drabmade its approach over the sea and landed a large man in a business suit and an army officer a major in a summerweight uniform got out and followed another secret service agent to the verandah better late than never right tom the president greeted secretary hall mr president were ten minutes early hall said how are you charley the president said to major promotable c g castillo special forces usa offering him his hand good afternoon mr president castillo said well lets get this over with the president said then you two can get out of those uniforms he turned to look at a door of the house three men were already coming onto the verandah one held two blue leathercovered boxes about eight inches by three the second held a nikon digital camera and the third a suit jacket the president folded down his cuffs buttoned them buttoned his collar pulled the necktie into place and then put his arms into the suit jacket do not get the khaki pants in the picture the president said to the photographer then asked where do you want us against the wall would be fine mr president youre about to be decorated the president said youve heard ive had a problem with this yes sir torine and castillo said almost in chorus well let me tell the story again for the benefit of director schmidt and director powell there is no question in my mind that what these two officers did merits a higher decoration than the distinguished flying cross when they found that that no one else seemed to be able to find and then stole it back they saved the lives of god only knows how many people and prevented chaos and panic in philadelphia and across the nation not quite as important but nearly so they sent a message to likeminded lunatics that the united states possesses military force and intelligence resources that can stop what we have to admit was a pretty clever plan unfortunately to award them a medal for valormy initial thought was the distinguished service crossthere has to be a citation to accompany the decoration since their activities were of a covert nature acting on a presidential finding that certain actions were necessary a citation describing what they have done would make that presidential finding public thats not in the best interests of the nation general naylor pointed out to me too that a citation saying nothing more specific than actions of a classified and covert nature would come to the attention of one or more congressional oversight committees who would demand to know just what the hell was going on the result would be the same the story would be all over the washington post and the new york times so they dont get the decoration they deserve and i would really like to see them have general naylor also suggested that what they did could honestly be described as participating with the highest degree of professionalism in aerial flight under exceedingly hazardous conditions so thats what the citations on the dfcs say he looked at the directors of the fbi and the cia these pictures will not be released to the press but when charley and colonel torine look at them in years to come id like them to be able to recall the award was made with you twoand you too tom of courselooking on come on up against the wall general will you read the orders please the fbi director and the dci with absolutely no enthusiasm got out of their white wicker armchairs general naylor waited until the photographer had lined everybody up and then began to read attention to orders headquarters department of the air force washington dc june subject award of the distinguished flying cross the distinguished flying cross thirteenth award is awarded to colonel jacob much better charley the president said in reference to what castillo was now wearing a polo shirt khaki trousers and boat shoes now sit down have a beer and tell me what i can do for you the president saw the look on castillos face why do i think im going to regret that offer the president asked castillo didnt reply come on charley whats on your mind the president pursued general naylors face was frozen theres two things mr president castillo said we would never have located that airplane without mr pevsner thats the russian gangster yes sir what do you want me to do charley the president asked more than a little sarcastically pardon him i dont think i can do that i think were the only country in the western world who doesnt have a warrant out for him sir he has intelligence sources we selfevidently dont have id really like to to suggest that the government should maintain a relationship with him for gods sake castillo fbi director mark schmidt exploded that russian bastards got a record that makes john gotti look like a boy scout and he has intelligence sources we just dont have castillo repeated evenly and which he has proved willing to make available to us hes got a point mark the president said how would we do what you suggest charley what does this guy want he wants the cia off his back sir right or wrong he suspects that since they have stopped using him they hold it right there the president interrupted stopped using him the cias been using him he looked at the dci tell me about that john the dci looked uncomfortable on several occasions mr president he said operations has covertly dealt with pevsner chartered his aircraft to deliver certain things where they were needed how about frequently dealt with him castillo interrupted earning an immediate glower from the dci to deliver the weapons and other goodies they bought from him castillo went on the president looked at castillo and then at the dci and waited for him to go on there were some transactions of that nature mr president the dci admitted but thats in the past ive ordered that all connections with this character be severed and now he believes rightly or wrongly castillo said that since the agency has stopped using him theyve been trying to arrange his arrestor worseby the governments the agency hired him to work against you dont know that castillo the dci snapped i said thats what he believes castillo said why the president asked softly because if hes in some jail in a remote area of the congoor deadtheres no trail back to the agency sir the president sat back in his chair and looked out across the atlantic he took a long and thoughtful pull at the neck of his beer bottle after a moment he turned to charley and said carefully i want you to tell mr pevsner that while i find it difficult to believe that anything like that could be happeningit sounds more than a little paranoiaci have as a token of my gratitude for his valuable assistance visavis locating that directed the dci to look into the matter and if anything like that is going on to stop it immediately thank you sir castillo said you have any questions about that john the president asked no sir the dci said and that i have told the director of the fbi that i want to be informed of the details of any investigation of mr pevsner now under way in the united states or which may be begun in the states make sure he understands that if he violates any of our laws he will be prosecuted yes sir you understand what ive just said mark yes sir the director of the fbi said castillo happened to look at general naylor who was shaking his head as if in disbelief okay charley the president asked jocularly what else can i do for you i dont suppose you would let me go back to being a simple soldier would you mr president general naylors eyebrows rose from what i have seen charley the president said i doubt if you were ever a simple soldier but to answer your question no i would not thats out of the question and what was the presidents reaction alex pevsner asked he said that if he finds out youre breaking any laws in the united states he will cheerfully throw you in jail but he told the director of central intelligence that if hes running any sort of operation to tip you to anybody to stop it and you believe he really said that to the cia i was there when he said it he appreciates what you did helping us find that airplane pevsner looked with his brilliant blue eyes into castillos face for a long moment i was about to say that i will show my appreciation for the presidents appreciation by seeing what i can find out about the diplomats wife thank you castillo said let me finish please pevsner said sharply but obviously if you reported to him that i had told you thus and so that would locate me here and i dont want that so i will make inquiries with the understanding that if i am able to learn anything you will tell no one the source of your information okay understood thank you alex anna why dont you get a pair of my swimming trunks for charley then you can have a swim while im on the phone i should be getting back to buenos aires castillo said i think your time would be more profitably spent waiting for me to find out what i can pevsner said somewhat sharply and then added far more charmingly and anna and i would really like you to stay for dinner thank you castillo said if there were developments someone from the embassy would call you right uhhuh then have a swim and later well have some more wine and i will personally prepare an argentine pizza for you you will personally prepare an argentine pizza sounds fine alex thank you five the pizza oven a woodfired sixfootwide claycovered brick dome was about twenty feet from the swimming pool in front of a thatchroofed quincho which was a building devoted to the broiling of food over a woodfired parrilla and then eating it picnicstyle there were firestended by a young argentine manblazing in both the parrilla and the oven when castillo followed anna and the children through a flap in the heavy plastic swimming pool enclosure to walk to the quincho where more enormous crystal glasses and a half dozen bottles of wine awaited them there was also a wooden table near the oven covered with a tablecloth at which two young argentine maids under the stern supervision of the middleaged russianspeaking maid were kneading pizza dough and chopping tomatoes and other pizza toppings castillo felt a tug at his sleeve and looked down to see that sergei was smilingly offering him a plate of empanadas a deepfried meatfilled dumpling muchas gracias castillo said taking one de nada sergei said it would appear sergei is taken with you pevsner said castillo hadnt seen him come into the quincho at least one member of your family is a good judge of character unfair charley pevsner said im an excellent judge of character and anna is even better castillo smiled but didnt reply pevsner handed him a glass of wine come with me and watch as i personally prepare your pizza pevsner said i wouldnt miss that for the world the secret is the oven temperature pevsner said as he walked up to the domed oven and this is the way you test that he walked to the table behind which the three maids and the young man were lined up and picked from it a page from a newspaper he crumpled it in his hands and walked back to the oven the young man trotted over and raised its iron door with a wroughtiron rod pevsner tossed the balledup paper into the oven and signaled to the young man that he should lower the door one two three four five six pevsner counted aloud then gestured for the door to be raised the newspaper was blazing merrily if it doesnt ignite in six seconds its not hot enough pevsner announced very seriously gesturing for the door to be closed again fascinating castillo said pevsner gestured for him to go with him to the table the russianspeaking maid came around with a twofootwide pizza dough on a large wooden paddle she held it between pevsner and the maids who stood waiting behind the table with large serving spoons with his index finger pevsner directed one maid to spoon tomato sauce onto the dough and kept pointing the finger until he decided there was a sufficiency he repeated the process with red and green peppers then with several kinds of salami and pieces of bacon and chicken finally concluding the process by supervising the spread of what looked like parmesan cheese over the whole thing then he marched back to the oven with the maid holding the pizza on a paddle trailing him gestured to the young man to raise the door and then gestured for the maid to slide the pizza into the oven and finally for the young man to close the door charley had a hard time keeping a smile off his face so far he hasnt touched the pizza hes personally preparing for me with so much as his pinkie i will now prepare another pevsner announced and marched back to the table where he repeated the process twice more this time however the prepared but unbaked pizzas on paddles were laid on the table i can usually trust them pevsner said once ive made sure the temperature is right to put them into the oven and take them out but i like to prepare them myself if you want something done right do it yourself charley heard himself saying solemnly exactly pevsner said its not fair of me to make fun of him whats the matter with me hes being nice this whole thing is nice the little kid sergei handing me an empanada is nice the whole family thing is nice it reminds me of grandpa dodging abuela to slip fernando and me a couple of slugs of wine at the ranch in midland while he was roasting a pig over an open fire for the family except of course that grandpa did everything but butcher the pig and crank the spit this is family this is nice i think betty schneider would like this not the guy with the shotgun in his golf cart but anna and the three kids and proud papa preparing a pizza for everybody with his own unsullied hands i wonder what the masterson kids are going to have for supper tonight i wonder what that poor bastard has told them is telling them is he pretending everything is going to be all right preparing them for the worst jesus when you hear somebodys been snatched you never think of the kids what a rotten fucking way to make an easy buck grabbing a kids mother and here i am making nice watching alex looking into his pizza oven theres nothing i could do in buenos aires so why am i feeling guilty lost in thought charley castillo turned to see howard kennedy holding a glass of wine he had disappeared from the swimming pool when castillo and anna pevsner had gone out to it and he hadnt been around since i was wondering what the masterson kids are having for supper tonight castillo said the kids of the wom castillo nodded alex is working on it kennedy said there should be something soon jesus i hope so whats the penalty for kidnapping here do you know not for sure but i do know theres no death penalty period and the average sentence for murder is fifteen years which means theyre on the street in seventoten the russianspeaking maid marched into the quincho with the nowbaked pizza and alex pevsner supervised her slicing of it with an enormous butcher knife pevsner was called to the telephone three times as they ate their supperthe pizza was followed by steaks and foilwrapped potatoes from the parrilla castillo was stuffedeach time taking the call in a small closet with a small window through which castillo could see him talking it reminded charley of the phone booth off general naylors conference room at centcom headquarters in tampa where the secure telephone was located pevsner returned to the table without saying anything the first two times but when he came out of the closet the third time he signaled for charley to come with him they walked thirty feet or so away from the quincho i dont have anything for you charley im sorry this last call was from someone who knows the important people at side you know side charley nodded and if anybody knew anything side would and theyre looking hard the pressure is on them well thanks for the effort charley said ill keep trying pevsner said then all of my sources believe this is not an ordinary kidnapping my source with connections to the policia federal and the gendarmeria said that theyve hauled in for questioning everybody even suspected of being involved in kidnappings and they came up with nothing he paused and then asked did this fellow actually get fifty million dollars after a truck ran over him sixty million charley said the kidnappers may not be argentine they might even be american yeah charley agreed thoughtfully ill put that thought in my email to hall its the only wild idea about this that didnt come up in that brainstorming session at the embassy why email ill be up all night if i start swapping emails with hall and darby made it clear that hes going to blow my cover to the ambassador tomorrow anyway itd be better to get on the horn he took his cellular out and pressed an autodial number he had the phone to his ear before he considered the genuine possibility that there might not be cellular service out here in the country darby charley castillo i want to get on a secure line to washington can you do that for me i can but theres the problem of you being just a secret service agent and there would be questions go ahead and tell the ambassador why not okay i think thats probably the best thing to do ill set up things at the embassy where are you castillo was aware that pevsner was trying to make sense of his call ever hear of a little town called maschwitz yeah i wont ask what the hell youre doing way out there dont theres one more thing alex it was suggested to me that the kidnappers might not be argentine that they might even be american that was very delicately suggested to the fbi by the policia federal if you notice a lot of activity in the commo center its the transmission of the names of every american whos come to argentina in the past thirty days to the ncicthe national crime information centerto see if they come up with a hit well somebodys done this alex some sonsofbitches one more thing alex lowery took my secret service credentials to get me a visitors badge and we left the embassy before i got them back ill take care of it darby said well be in touch the connection was broken thank you pevsner said for what for maschwitz if i think anyone is unusually curious about where ive been or with whom ill drop your austrohungarian grand duke into the conversation castillo said thatll lead them on an interesting expedition pevsner smiled alex i have to get back to buenos aires i understand you want me to send howard with you thats not necessary i just need a ride to the embassy charleys cellular buzzed as they approached buenos aires hello mr castillo castillo recognized darbys voice alexander darby here mr castillo what can i do for you mr castillo ambassador silvio wonders if you would be free to come to his office at ninethirty tomorrow morning ill be there thank you ill see you then the connection was broken it didnt take you long to tell the ambassador about me did it alex and why do i suspect you made that call in his presence and that you told him simply that i had identified myself to you and not that we knew each other in afghanistan an american who did not identify himself in any way making castillo reasonably confident that he was a cia agent who worked for darbywas waiting just outside the fence at the employee entrance to the embassy grounds with castillos visitors pass and secret service credentials if youll come with me please mr castillo six the communications center the united states embassy avenida colombia buenos aires argentina july there was a phone booth in the embassy communications room too as the man castillo now thought of as darbys guy led him to it most of the eight or ten people in the room looked at him with frank curiosity one of them was the oriental fbi agent yung the guy who looked at me in the brainstorming center with what i thought was a little too much interest hes either fascinated with my good looks and manly charm or the secret service or he knows something about me or suspects something oh jesus has there been an fbi backchannel no copies burn before reading let us know if a guy named castillo shows up anywhere and what hes doing he has embarrassed the director and we would really like to burn his ass castillo closed the door of the phone booth and sat down before a tiny desk more of a shelf built into the wall on which sat the secure telephone it looked except for the much thicker than usual cords to the wall and from the base to the handsetlike an ordinary phone there was also a lined notepad which had a sheet of aluminum under the top page to keep whatever was written from making an impression on the pages beneath two sharpened pencils in a water glass and a redstriped burn bag hanging from the wall castillo picked up the telephone operator a male voice said he sounds young probably a soldier my name is castillo i need a verified secure line yes sir you have been cleared the number please its a little after tenthirty here half past nine in washington hall may or may not be in the office ill let the switchboard find him castillo gave the white house switchboard number to the operator sir thats the white house the operator said yeah i know sir youre not cleared to call the white house who has to clear me castillo asked and at the last split second added sergeant either the ambassador or mr masterson sir well he took the sergeant without any reaction that may be helpful well i dont want to bother mr masterson sergeant so i suppose youd better get the ambassador on the horn i need to put this call through sir mr darby has the authority to clear calls to the white house would he know if youre authorized yes he would give him a yell sergeant thirty seconds later commercial attache darby gave the operator permission to put mr castillos call through to the white house switchboard white house this is the us embassy buenos aires the operator said would you verify the line is secure please that took about fifteen seconds the line is secure the white house operator announced this is c g castillo i need to speak with secretary hall i have no idea where he is oh i think we can find him for you hold one hall i have a secure call for you mr secretary from mr castillo in buenos aires put mr castillo through please hall said in the presidential apartment in the white house the president looked across the table in the breakfast room at his wife and matt halls wife and made a decision put that on the speakerphone matt he ordered but dont tell him you there charley yes sir weve been expecting to hear from you before this sir theres not much to report that you probably havent heard already well take it from the top charley you never know yes sir joels pal tony santini met me at the airport really good guy sharp as a tack tony took me to the hotel the hyattwhich is now the four seasons by the way he told me what he knew essentially that mrs masterson was grabbed in the parking lot of a restaurant called kansas in an upscale neighborhood called san isidro she was waiting for her husband and when he didnt show went to her car and was grabbed he said there had been no word from the kidnappersthis was at maybe seven this morning and there still has been no word as of now tony said the argentines were keeping it out of the papers so if i went there as gossinger they would a wonder how i heard about it and b tell me zilch so i went there as a secret service agent who just happened to be in town apparently that happens all the time tony introduced me to the embassy security guy lowery nice guy but a lightweight why do you say that charley hall interrupted the way tony santini put it most of his investigations have been of some diplomat fooling around with some other diplomats wife nothing like this okay hall said while i was in his office masterson came in a really nice guy and really upset you know the story of his getting run over and getting a fiftymilliondollar settlement yeah i know it the figure i heard was sixty million anyway i was introduced to him as a secret service agent and he asked me to go to a brainstorming session with all the players the cia station chiefmore about him in a moment the dea people and two fbi guys from montevideo who are supposed to have some experience with kidnappings one of them looked at me strangely then and just now when i came in the commo room what do you mean by that if i were paranoid and i am i would suspect that theres been a deniable bulletin from the j edgar hoover building telling everybody to keep an eye open for that sonofabitch castillo you really think that charley i cant prove it but i got the same look from the cia station chief a guy named darbyhes as sharp as a tack tooand i know he knew who i was am how do you know that after the brainstorming sessionwhich came up with nothinghe offered to show me the restaurant and when we got in his car he told me the last time hed seen me was in zaranj afghanistanhe was station chief thereand that hed put two and two together and concluded i was the guy involved in getting the back so is he going to tell the ambassador or anyone else for auld lang syne he said he would wait until tomorrow morning but that he would have to tell him about two hours ago i told him to go ahead and tell him i wanted to get on a secure line rather than screw around with emails so he knows as i was coming into town darby relayed a very polite request from the ambassador that i come to his office at half past nine in the morning what about the ambassador both santini and darby think hes first class anyway after having a very nice lunch in the kansas which really made me feel guilty i went nosing around by myself and came up with zilch except the possibility that the kidnappers are american when i passed this on to darby he said the argentine cops had already delicately he saidoffered this possibility outside this phone booth the fbiincluding yung the fbi guy i think has made meis sending the names of all americans whove come down here in the past thirty days to the ncic what about the local authorities from everything ive been able to pick up theyre really doing their best and with the same result zilch so what everybody is doing is waiting for the other shoe to drop and thats about it yes sir i feel about as useless as teats on a boar hog jesus i wish the president hadnt come up with the nutty idea that im sherlock holmes id really like to help and im in way over my head hold one charley sherlock this is the president jesus christ castillo blurted no just the president the president chuckled and im glad i did sherlock i could not have asked for a more succinct and comprehensive report and i know that any report that came close to being as good as the one you just gave secretary hall would have taken a lot more time to reach me sir im sorry no need to be charley i have just one question sir what about mr masterson is heand their childrenbeing protected yes sir mr darbyhe and mr masterson are closetold me that hes having some of his people sit on mr masterson hopefully without his being aware that this is going on and theres argentine cops and side people all over too their fbi yes sir much like it both mr santini and mr darby tell me theyre good at what they do when you see ambassador silvio in the morning you might tell him of my concern yes sir i will well i guess thats it the president said youre doing what i sent you down there to do charley and doing it well thank you sir mrs hall wants me to pass on her regards and im sure my wife would like to add hers yes sir goodnight charley the president said interesting guy the president observed and a very nice one mrs janice hall said you could hear his concern for that poor woman and the family in his voice until she actually met him janice could not stand men to whom women are drawn like moths to a candle you can go to hell matt mrs hall said i think sending him down there was one of my better ideas the president said and then added as was leaving him with matt excuse me the first lady asked when he got that airplane back my first thought was to bring him into the white house then i realized that wouldnt be smart can you imagine what pressure would be on him if he worked here everybody in this building would be trying to a control him and b keep him off my phone and out of the oval office having him working for matt fixes all of that seven room the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july castillo had left a call for sevenwhich would give him two hours to get dressed have breakfast and get to the embassy by half past nineand when he glanced at his watch as he reached for the ringing telephone and saw what time it was he felt a chill it was too much to hope this call was going to be good news hola castillo it was darbys voice not at all charming yes you didnt answer your cellular darby accused whats up there will be a car waiting for you by the time you can get downstairs whats up well ill tell you its not good news darby said and hung up v one avenida tomas edison buenos aires argentina july there had been a small gray alfa romeoas far as castillo could tell they were identical to fiats except for the nameplateswith argentine civilian license plates waiting on the drive outside the four seasons hotel when castillo pushed through the revolving door as castillo looked at it wondering if it was meant for him the driver pushed open the passenger door senor castillo castillo walked quickly to the car and got in the car took off with a squeal of its tires before castillo had time to fasten the seat belt you speak spanish mr castillo the driver asked in american english castillo took a good look at him he was an oliveskinned darkhaired man in his thirties in a business suit who could castillo decided easily pass for a porteno a native of buenos aires si castillo said say hello to colonel alfredo munz of side the driver said in fluent porteno spanish the windows of the alfa romeo were heavily darkened castillo had not seen anyone in the backseat he turned on his seat and saw a stocky blond man in his forties castillo put out his hand mucho gusto mi coronel munzs grip was firm mucho gusto he replied adding senor darby has told me about you senor i wonder what he told you the car was now passing the french embassy its horn blowing steadily in short beeps the driver ran the red light and nearly got clipped by a fiat delivery truck going up avenida julio the alfa romeo made a squealing left turn onto julio and then raced down the autopista in the extreme right lane reserved for emergency vehicles whats happened castillo asked where are we going the cocksuckers shot masterson the driver said what did he say they shot her oh jesus h christ but that sounded as if he meant him mrs masterson you mean no masterson what the hell i thought darby had somebody sitting on him yeah he did me i fucked up big time they came to a row of tollbooths without slowing still blowing the horn the driver went through the right lane despite the furious armwaving of a policeman who saw him coming the policeman jumped out of the way at the last minute and reached for his pistol side side side colonel munz shouted out his open window christ i hope that cop believes him there was no shot at least none that i can hear they came to a t in the road running another red light the driver turned left dodging between two enormous overtheroad tractortrailers and then rapidly accelerating castillo saw they were now on avenida presidente castillo this is not a very elegant street to be named after a castillo el presidente or even one from san antonio it was apparently the main route to the docks and the roadway showed the effects of heavymost probably grossly overloadedtrucks the alfa bottomed out every thirty seconds or so it was too noisy in the car to ask questions and it would not have been wise to distract the drivers attention from the traffic avenida presidente castillo took a bend to the left then came to a stop sign which the driver ignored which almost saw them hit headon by an enormous scania tractor pulling a trailer with two containers on it then another left and another and castillo saw they were now on avenida tomas edison this was even rougher looking than avenida presidente castillo it was a twolane road where the macadam had been mostly worn away from the cobblestones it had at one time covered on their left were deserted warehouses and on their right a decrepit port area lined with rusting derelict and halfsunk riverboats and then there was a sea of flashing redandblue lights four policia federal stood in the middle of the street all of them with their hands up to stop them castillo saw a half dozen other cops taking barriers from the back of a truck the driver slammed on the brakes slowing but not stopping colonel munz was now halfway out the rear window waving his credentials and shouting side side side the policemen got out of the way two of them saluted fifty meters farther down the street an enormous and enormously confidentpolicia federal sergeant held up his hand in casual arrogance to stop them the arrogance disappeared immediately when he recognized munz in there mi coronel he said pointing to the shell of a deserted warehouse the entire front of which was open another thirty meters distant there were three police cars one policia federal a second from the naval prefecture which has police power in the port and a third from the gendarmeria national there were several unmarked cars with flashing blue lights on their dashboards and two ambulances one from the german hospital the second from the naval prefecture fifty yards past them a huge tractortrailer with a singleenormous container on it was stopped in the middle of the road its stop and parking lights flashing when the driver slammed the brakes on and the alfa romeo screeched to a stop before the deserted warehouse castillo could see a taxicab parked nosein against the rear wall of the building there was a knot of seven or eight men most of them in uniforms carrying the symbols of senior police officers between the taxi and the front of the building munz erupted from the backseat of the alfa and marched purposefully toward them castillo and the driver got out and followed the knot of police all turned to face him several of the senior police officers saluted i sent word that nothing was to be touched until i got here munz announced i presume nothing has mi coronel a man in a navy uniform with the sleeve stripes of a commander said one of my men was first on the scene aside from reaching into the victims pockets looking for identification he touched nothing else looking into his pockets to see if he had any money is more like it the driver of the alfa romeo said softly behind his hand to castillo one of the senior police officers said something to munz that castillo couldnt hear colonel munzs eyebrows went up in surprise where is he munz demanded the navy officer indicated a man in a khaki uniform standing uncomfortably near the street get him over here munz ordered he pointed to a spot on the ground the command to have the naval prefecture policemancome over worked its way down the hierarchy of police officers and finally one of them walked quickly toward the policeman munz walked toward the taxi castillo started after him and then the driver and that started the police officers moving munz sensed this he turned and held out his hand to stop them then pointed at castillo and the driver signaling them they shouldor were permitted togo with him the right rear door of the taxi was open munz stuck his head inside looked around for a moment and then pulled it out he signaled that it was permitted for the driver and castillo to have a look castillo was closest and went first there was the smell of blood and the buzzing of flies j winslow masterson was leaning against the far door half sitting up his eyes and mouth were open there was one entrance wound in his temple and to judge from the now dried blood on his neck another entrance wound under the hair behind his ear the taxi driver was slumped over the wheel the silver gray hair at the back of his skull was heavily matted with blood and the back of his jacket was black with dried blood castillo pulled his head out of the cab met the alfa drivers eyes and said sonofabitch he heard another squeal of tires near the opening of the building and when he looked saw alex darby open the door of an embassy bmw and get out several policemen tried to stop him pass him colonel munz shouted in a voice that would have done credit to a drill sergeant then he started walking toward him castillo heard darby ask its him im afraid it is munz said and hes dead munz nodded shot twice in the head wheres mrs masterson darby asked christ i didnt even think of her munz gestured toward the german hospital ambulance darby started toward the ambulance munz caught up with him alex i think shes drugged munz said dammit who authorized that darby demanded furiously according to the first policeman on the scene she was drugged when he got here presumably theres a doctor with her darby said i think theres three doctors munz said i called the german hospital myself darby went to the ambulance a large mercedes van pulled the door open and climbed inside castillo became aware the driver was now standing beside him darbys in the ambulance with mrs masterson castillo said i heard munz tell him shes drugged was drugged when the navy cop got here shit the driver said i make it two shots to the heads i saw only one entrance wound in the cabdrivers head castillo said i think theres two the driver said not argumentatively darby came out of the ambulance and walked with munz toward the taxi alex the driver said im sorry were all sorry paul darby said darby walked to the taxicab looked inside for a long moment and then walked back to where munz the driver and castillo were standing alex munz said i think she should be taken to the hospital they cant determine what they gave her here they told me darby said but i think the ambassador would want to see her here hes on the way of course munz said darby looked at the driver paul it looks to me like an assassination the driver said you agree with that charley darby asked could be i dont know another embassy bmw pulled up and then a second a tall lithe welltailored man got out of the backseat and another man got out of the front passenger seat that has to be the ambassador castillo decided and the other guy his bodyguard well here comes the ambassador the driver confirmed ken lowery the embassy security officer and three other men got out of the second bmw one of the men was a burly scandinavian type with a nearly shaven head castillo decided he was one of the embassys marine guards ambassador silvio and lowery walked past the outer line of argentine police no one tried to stop them they must recognize them all the others stopped at the line of policemen silvio walked up to them good morning he said bring me up to speed jack is in the taxi mr ambassador darby said he has been shot twice in the head silvio looked at castillo but didnt say anything to him excellency munz said permit me to be the first to express my most profound regrets thank you colonel silvio said in spanish does anyone know whats happened before anyone could form a reply silvio went on mrs masterson shes in the german hospital ambulance your excellency munz said she has apparently been drugged by the villains silvios eyebrows rose but he didnt speak he started for the ambulance munz darby and lowery walked after him after a momentwhat the hell im supposed to find out whats going oncastillo walked after them as they reached the ambulance silvio turned to castillo youre mr castillo he asked yes sir silvio knocked at the rear door of the ambulance and then pulled it open and climbed in there in the van were two men and a woman all wearing thin blue hospital coats all of which carried nameplates with their names followed by md mrs elizabeth masterson was sitting on a chair against the far interior wall of the roomy ambulance there was a plastic oxygen mask over her nose and mouth and a blood pressure device wrapped around one arm the female doctor was taking her pulse silvio went to mrs masterson dropped to his knees and took her hand elizabeth he said softly in english i am so very sorry she looked at him visibly confused and then looked away she has apparently been drugged the female doctor said what are you doing about it silvio asked theres not much we can do until we know what drug was used we suspect a couple but cant be sure until we get a blood sample to the laboratory why hasnt she been taken to the hospital silvio asked and then without waiting for a response said please take her there now he turned and looked at lowery go with her please mr lowery make sure she is all right yes sir lowery said take as many people as you think will be necessary yes sir as silvio started to leave the ambulance munz shouted in a paradeground bellow captain jiminez one of the men in civilian clothing in the knot of police officers came running over eight men two cars munz ordered one car to precede the ambulance one to trail there will be americans make sure of senora mastersons safety report when she is safely in the hospital and do not allow the press anywhere near her or the medicos si mi coronel captain jiminez turned and ran off shouting orders as he ran lowery ran after him thank you colonel silvio said to munz now what do we know about what happened we were about to find out excellency just before you arrived munz said if you will come with me excellency munz led them to the policeman from the naval prefecture you were the first officer on the scene munz asked si mi coronel that cops about to piss his pants hes terrified of munz ambassador silvio saw this too he smiled at the policeman and put out his hand good morning he said in what castillo now recognized as a good porteno spanish accent my name is silvio im the united states ambassador and were trying to find out what happened here si senor well munz demanded mi coronel i was patrolling in puerto madero when i got the call to come here what did the call say investigate a possible robbery murder the policeman said and added reluctantly and a crazy woman do we know where that call came from munz asked looking over castillos shoulder castillo turned and saw that the navy commander who had spoken to munz earlier had come up the truck driver mi coronel the commander said where is he get him over here when two naval prefecture policemen started to hustle the truck driver a burly visibly nervous man in his late forties over toward them munz signaled them to stop and walked over to them the ambassador castillo darby and the driver followed the navy officer started to but was ordered with a wave of munzs hand to stay where he was then munz dismissed the policemen with an impatient wave of his fingers would you please tell us what you know of this senor munz asked the man nodded and then turned and gestured toward the street i was coming down edison the truck driver began toward jorge newbery when i saw the woman she was staggering in the street i thought she was drunk he stopped having considered that he might have said something he should not have said i dont think he knows who munz is beyond being someone of importance to the other police but hes afraid of him and munz prodded i felt sorry for her and stopped the driver said not too convincingly and then added she was in the middle of the street and i didnt want to run over her he waited for a response and munz prodded again so i got out of my truck and she sort of dragged me in here the driver said and i saw the taxi what was in itthey were both deadand i got on my phone and called there seemed to be more flashing redandblue lights and now sirens castillo saw that a little convoy had been formed and was apparently waiting for the ambulance then the flashing lights on the ambulance began to blaze and its siren started screaming it backed up and then left the building a policeman directed it into the column of linedup vehicles castillo saw that the embassy car had been placed into the convoy behind the ambulance then the whole convoy took off when the sound of the sirens had diminished to the point where he could be heard munz again said and yes sir the truck driver said the lady fell down what she fell down the truck driver said she didnt pass out but she couldnt stand up and she didnt understand what i was saying to her what were you saying to her that the police were coming and it would be better if she got out of the middle of the street i tried to pick her up but she screamed so i just waited and what happened between then and when the policeman came nothing the truck driver said and then corrected himself what happened was she crawled out of the streetmaybe she wanted to go back to the taxicab maybe she was only as far as the curb when the policeman came the truck driver said he said to leave her where she was and he went and looked into the cab and came out with the mans wallet how much money would you say was in the wallet munz interrupted i didnt see any money the truck driver said and then he called for an ambulance and an officer and picked her up and put her in the front seat of the police car and he told me that the man in the back was a norteamericano diplomat and to leave my truck where it was and we waited for the others who came first munz asked i dont remember the truck driver said munz looked at him for a moment then at the ambassador and then at darby castillo and the driver as if asking them if they had any questions no one did thank you senor munz said whats going to happen now is that as soon as the technicians get here they will take some photographs of your truck and otherwise examine it and then well move it out of the middle of the road then you will be taken to the naval prefecture where other officers will take a statement from you and probably your photograph and fingerprints i will issue orders that your truck will be guarded while you are gone and that you be allowed to telephone your employer and your wife if you want you will tell them that you witnessed an accident and that the police are taking your statement nothing more nothing about the taxicab you understand me si senor thank you munz said and offered the man his hand and then ambassador silvio offered his and said thank you darby and then the driver and finally castillo shook hands with the driver then everybody followed munz back to where the navy commander stood with the policeman another embassy car drove up the two fbi agents from montevideo got out special agent yung looks more than a little surprised to see me colonel ambassador silvio said those are two fbi agents i borrowed from montevideo if at all possible i would like them to be able to witness your investiga pass them munz bellowed the two fbi agents trotted over munz turned to the navy commander i want the truck driver taken to the prefecture get a statement take his photograph and his fingerprints let him call his employer and his wife but make sure that he says nothing more than that he witnessed an accident and is giving a statement treat him wellmy first reaction is that hes a good samaritanbut keep him there until you hear from me si senor all right munz said to the naval prefecture policeman tell me what happened from the moment you arrived on the scene his story neatly dovetailed with what the truck driver had told them munz looked at the two fbi agents i will issue orders that you are to have access to all facets of this investigation thank you ambassador silvio said is there anything else your excellency munz asked silvio responded but to darby the children he said my wife is at the masterson house darby replied i will send my wife over there as soon as i can get on the phone silvio said and then he asked presumably youve taken steps to guard it yes sir your excellency senora masterson and the children will not be out of sight of my best men munz said i realize thats not much you can put confidence in why do you say that colonel silvio asked courteously senor sieno and i were sitting in his car outside the masterson home from eleven pm onward and senor masterson got away from us so thats his name sieno paul sieno is that how you think of it he got away from you from senor sieno and me and from senor sienos men and mine there were eight people watching his house your excellency why would he want to get away from you do you think i think he was contacted by the villains who told him where to meet them and threatened his wifes wellbeing if he didnt come alone so he went alone how i dont know but he was desperate and he got away from us and made it to somewhere where he could find a taxithe san isidro railroad station probablyand took it to wherever he was told to meet them did your excellency notice the taxi is not a buenos aires city taxi yes i did as a matter of fact ambassador silvio said and i was thinking thats what probably happened i am both deeply sorry and grossly embarrassed your excellency that i have failed my duty munz said if you and sieno were sitting up all night in pauls car colonel silvio said i dont think anyone can fairly accuse you of being derelict in your duties i fucked up big time mr ambassador thats the bottom line paul sieno said i dont feel that you did paul silvio said kindly then turned to alex darby alex will you stay here to learn what you can and at the hospital yes sir mr castillo can i see you for a moment yes sir of course silvio took castillos arm and led him out of earshot were going to have to talk mr castillo the ambassadorsaid is there some reason we cant do that now would you ride to the embassy with me yes sir of course do you have any idea whats going on here mr castillo ambassador silvio asked when they were in the ambassadors big bmw is there something i should know sir i have no idea whats going on castillo said and then blurted except that its a fucking outrage im a diplomat im not supposed to use language like that but i quite agree sorry sir that slipped out he was such a nice guy yes he was silvio agreed then he said excuse me and took out his cellular telephone and pushed an autodial number jack has been murdered my love he said in spanish at the moment thats all i know betsy who has been drugged has been taken to the german hospital no drugged not sedated i was going to suggest that you go to the hospital but until they bring her out of it i cant see what good that would do alex darbys wife is with the masterson children thank you make sure you have at least one of lowerys people with you and that the policia federal are following you none of us would have believed what just happened my love do what i tell you ill call you shortly two the office of the ambassador the united states embassy avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina july i expect that you will want to make a report to your superiors mr castillo ambassador silvio said as he led castillo into his office yes sir you might as well do that from here silvio said thats very kind of you sir but i dont mind we really havent finished our conversation have we silvio interrupted him just as soon as i speak with the secretary of state ill have them put you through is he doing that to be a nice guywhich he certainly seems to beor so that he can hear my report thank you very much sir having said what i just said i realize that i have no idea how to get through to the secretary at this hour of the morningits what half past five in washington and i think she would want to hear this directly from me sir i know how to do that castillo said the ambassador indicated the secure telephone on his desk castillo put the receiver to his ear and heard operator my name is castillo i need a secure line to the white house the ambassadors here to clear it if you need that silvio took the phone from castillo this is ambassador silvio mr castillo is cleared to call the white house now and at any time in the future thank you castillo said as he took the handset back white house this is the united states embassy buenos aires please verify this line is secure ten seconds later the white house operator said this line is secure this is c g castillo i need the secretary of state on a secure line please this took a little longer it was thirtyfive seconds before a male voice said this is the secretary of states secure line c g castillo for the secretary of state the secretary is asleep mr castillo i thought she might be put me through please another fortyfive seconds passed put him through please natalie cohen said castillo madam secretary charley do you realize what time it is here in washington yes maam hold one for ambassador silvio he heard the secretary of state mutter oh god as he handed the ambassador the telephone then he started for the door the ambassador waved his hand to signal him to stay ambassador silvio madam secretary silvio said i have the sad duty to inform you that the body of chief of mission j winslow masterson was found an hour and a half ago he had been shot twice in the head the secretary wishes to speak to you mr castillo silvio said and handed him the telephone yes maam how come you placed the call charley i knew how to get through to you without going through layers of bureaucrats do you know anything the ambassador doesnt no maam nobody has any idea whats going on presumably youve told matt hall no maam thats next you want me to give him a headsup thank you but i dont think thatll be necessary im going to have to wake the president up with this he finally told me last night that hed sent you down there and of what you found out sherlock yes maam im sure well be talking charley yes maam there was a series of clicks on the line then white house are you through castillo again now i need secretary hall on a secure line hold please secretary halls secure line said a new voice tom this is special agent dinsler who is this please is either tom mcguire or joel isaacson around there no my name is castillo will you put me through to secretary hall please the secretary is asleep sir he called me sir which means he doesnt know castillo from adams off ox wake him please may i ask what this concerns sir get him on the goddamn phone now there was no reply but fifteen seconds later secretary of homeland security matthew hall came on the line all you had to do was tell dinsler who you are charley you didnt have to swear at him hall said his voice annoyed yes sir sir mr masterson mr masterson the chief of mission has been murdered jesus christ hall said and his wife shes in the german hospital surrounded by eight side agents and four of ours the bastards drugged her she woke upmore accurately came half out of it in the backseat of a taxicab and found her husband slumped beside her with two bullets in his brain my god charley yeah and he was a really nice guy too when did this happen sometime after midnight he got away from the people sitting on him at his housea cia guy and a big shot a colonel from side plus half a dozen others and apparently took a taxicab to meet somebody probably to pay ransom or to arrange to pay it give me all the details and slowly im going to have to tell the president and natalie natalie already knows ambassador silvio just talked to her and she said she would tell the president okay now you tell me what you know yes sir theres not much beyond what i already have told you a truck driver found mrs masterson wandering dazed on a street in the port she had been drugged he called the cops the cops found mastersons body searched it enough to find his diplomats carnet and called side the colonel from side a heavy hitter was sitting outside mastersons house with one of darbys guys darbys guy called darby darby called the ambassador and then called me and said he was sending a car for me the side colonel his name is munz was in darbys guys car when we got there mrs masterson was already in an ambulance with an oxygen mask and there were cops all over the place darby the ambassador and the embassy security guy lowery and some of his guys showed up moments later once the ambassador had seen mrs masterson they took her to the hospital the side colonel sent two cars and eight of his men with the ambulance and lowery and some of our people went with them how is mrs masterson shes still pretty much out of it but once they get her to the hospital what the hell is going on charley who the hell is doing this why nobody has a clue and every time i think maybe this or maybe that it doesnt wash for example a bungled kidnapping why did they kill masterson if he paid the ransom why didnt they kill her too they killed the cabdriver maybeprobablybecause he saw them so why let her live she certainly saw something i just wish the president had sent somebody who knows what hes doing down here he didnt he sent you hall said and then asked you think masterson was trying to pay the ransom where would he get the money i thought you said there had been no contact with the kidnappers somebody contacted masterson last night maybe before otherwise why would he have gotten away from the agency guysand sidewatching his house okay and as far as getting money to pay the ransom all that would take is a telephone call telling somebody his financial guy probably theyre old friendsto get five hundred thousand or a million in cash and get it down here as quickly as possible a courier could have been on the same plane i was on for that matter and theres a direct american airlines flight from dallas or he could have hired a citation or something like it he hashadthe money and he was desperate yeah hall agreed thoughtfully and then asked where are you im with ambassador silvio in his office he knows you were sent down there by the president yes sir whats your next step you know hes going to ask im going to go to the hospital maybe when she comes out of it how am i going to be able to get in touch with you santini joels buddy loaned me a cellular i dont know if you can call it but i know i can call the states with it give me the number ninety seconds later as castillo held it in his hand the cellular rang castillo it works apparently hall said im going back to the secure line two seconds later hall said i could have said this on the cellular keep in touch charley let me know anything you find out yes sir hall broke the connection without saying anything else white house are you through shut it down please castillo said and replaced the handset in its cradle he sensed silvios eyes on him you think jack masterson was trying to pay ransom silvio asked sir thats one a female voice came over an intercom loudspeaker mr ambassador the foreign secretary is on two silvio reached for the telephone good morning osvaldo osvaldo im always happy to receive you at your convenience that will be fine i will be expecting you i appreciate that osvaldo and i agree this is a genuine tragedy i will be waiting for you silvio broke the connection with his finger but kept the handset in his hand the foreign minister officially requests an immediate audience silvio said and personally he said hes heartbroken i think he means that he got along very well with jack castillo nodded but didnt say anything silvio took his finger off the switch then pressed a button on his telephone oh sylvia im glad youre in could you come in right away please thank you he hung up the telephone and looked at castillo again the foreign minister sometime during our audience is going to ask me how i intend to deal with the press to avoid hurting his feelings by having some doubts about his suggestions along that line im going to show him what i have already released to the press a moment later a slightly chubby woman in her late forties put her head into silvios office she had heavily rimmed spectacles sticking out of her saltandpepper and somewhat unkempthair silvio waved her in good morning sylvia silvio said with all due respect mr ambassador whats good about it jack was one of the good guys and those poor kids sylvia this is mr castillo mr castillo this is mizz sylvia grunblatt our public affairs officer ms grunblatts offered handshake suggested that while she considered it a strange custom and a complete waste of her time she resigned herself to the act how much have you heard sylvia she looked at castillo as if wondering what she could say before a man she didnt know ken lowery gave me a headsup earlier she said finally and then he called and told me he was at the german hospital and i went there on my way here he pretty much filled me in the foreign minister is on his way here when he gets here i want to be able to tell him what we have released to the press which is in the opening lines id like something to the effect that we are grateful to the argentine governmenton whom we have been relying to get to the bottom of this tragic event since it developedfor their great efforts in which we have complete confidence ms grunblatt considered that for about fifteen seconds okay and what else sylvia i learned from you that when all else fails tell the truth and the truth is all we know is that mrs masterson disappeared undercircumstances that suggested she had been kidnapped and that mr masterson was murdered probably by the abductors as she was left in the taxicab with him okay she said ill get right on it it will take him say fifteen minutes to get here youll have it mr ambassador id like a look at what miss grunblatt comes up with please castillo said that earned him a frosty glance she said its mizz grunblatt mr costello its castillo mizz grunblatt you think you might wish to add something mr castillo silvio asked oh no sir id just like to know what were saying am i allowed to ask who mr castillo is she asked he works for the president sylvia which means we tell him anything he wants to know is that for dissemination she asked absolutely not castillo said she held up both hands palms out to indicate that that information could not be torn from her under any conditions he smiled at her do you kill people who look over your shoulder while you work castillo asked only if theyre looking down my dress ms grunblatt said you that hot to see what i come up with id like to see it before i go to the german hospital he said sure why not she said ill see that you have a car and driver mr castillo the ambassador said i can take a taxi sir indulge me the ambassador said thank you sir three so what do you think ms grunblatt asked i think its just what the ambassador wants castillo replied who gets this once the boss approves it ill email it first to the heraldthats the englishlanguage paper hereand then ap then the new york times then ill call them to let them know i sent it after that everybody elsethe local media fax one to a man named karl gossinger at the four seasons who is he he works for a german newspaper called the tages zeitung and he will shamelessly paraphrase your very wellwritten yarn and send it off as his own she looked at him curiously but said only consider it done the door to her office opened and a large and muscular young man in civilian clothing came in his tweed jacket didnt do much to conceal the large revolver on his belt castillo was sure he was one of the marine guards mr castillo right sir ive got your car anytime youre ready to go im ready castillo said he looked at ms grunblatt thanks if you find out anything over there youll keep it to yourself right you will be the second to know the marine led him to an embassy bmw in the embassy basement and held the rear door open for him would it be all right with you if i rode up front castillo asked yes sir whatever you want sir castillo walked around the front of the car and pulled the passenger door open there was a leather toilet kit on the seat theres a toilet kit on the seat castillo announced yours no sir thats for you sir the ambassador thought i needed a shave its a weapon sir a pistol really castillo unzipped the bag it held a gi mm beretta semiautomatic pistol that was a damned nice thing for silvio to do for me castillo took the pistol from the bag and pressed the magazine release button the magazine did not slip out he looked there was no magazine sir thats a beretta model semiautomatic pistol caliber nine millimeter ill be damned yes sir it will fire fifteen rounds just as fast as you can pull the trigger this one wont sir theres no whatchacallems bullets sir the cartridges are held in a magazine he held up a full magazine for castillos edification and only then began to understand his chain was being pulled what is it sergeant castillo asked reaching for the magazine staff sergeant sir he more than reluctantly let go of the magazine castillo took it checked to see there was no round chambered in the pistol and then slid the magazine into its place in the handle i dont want this to get any further than it has to sergeant which means that was the last time you call me sir but the cold and unvarnished truth is that im a soldier sir the ambassador didnt say anything what part of dontcallmesir didnt you understand sorry s i dont think the ambassador knows im a soldier actuallythe reason i can give you ordersim a major yes s the sergeant said and then major it comes automatically i say sir to civilians all the time well try not to say it to me okay yes sir oh shit im sorry i brought the subject up castillo said chuckling lets go sergeant four room the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july there were half a dozen uniformed policia federal in the lobby of the hospital and when castillo asked for mrs masterson one of them a sergeant walked up to him somewhat menacingly senor he began a tall welldressed man walked up senor castillo charley nodded come with me please senor get yourself a cup of coffee castillo said to the marine the ambassador said im not to let you out of my sight good no sir charley said tell the ambassador i was difficult not to worry almost biting his lip not to say sir the marine said ill be right here the tall man waved castillo onto an elevator nodding at another welldressed man already on it as they entered the man pushed the button for the sixth floor there was a sign saying seimens had built the elevator and the lobby was spotless waxed and shiny and that rauchen verboten sign in black and red when they say german hospital they mean german hospital when the door opened castillo saw more uniformed police and several other welldressed men who he decided were almost certainly side agents the tall man led him down a corridor to a door opened it and waved castillo in colonel munz was in the room which was some sort of monitoring center there was a row of television setsall of german manufactureon the wall i thought it would be best if senor darby and senor lowery spoke with mrs masterson munz greeted him as i dont think she feels kindly about anything argentine right now he dismissed the tall man with a wave of his hand and then pointed to the television monitors on two of them castillo could see mrs masterson she was in a hospital gown sitting up in a bed lowery was on one side of her and darby on the other something from a limp plastic bottle was dripping into her arm he could hear darby talking to her but he couldnt make out what he was saying how long has she been out of it castillo asked about ten minutes munz replied they found a drug in her blood theyre giving her something to neutralize it its obviously working i cant hear what theyre saying munz walked to one of the monitors and increased the volume darby was assuring her that the children were all right that they were under the protection of both argentine police and security people from the embassy castillo got the feeling that darby was repeating his assurances meaning she had not yet completely come out from under the effects of the narcotic he heard munzs cellular buzz munz said hola but then switched to german it soon became obvious that he was speaking with someone who was not overly impressed with colonel munz of side or more likely not impressed at all his explanations that something had happened that had kept him from coming home as promised and from at least calling apparently were not falling on appreciative ears the odds were that el coronel munz was speaking with senora munz he turned his attention back to darbys gentle interrogation of mrs masterson she didnt have much to tell him from the time she was grabbed and felt what was the prick of a hypodermic needle in her buttocks she remembered practically nothing until she had woken up in the taxicab sitting beside her dead husband she did not get a good look at her abductors she didnt even know how many of them there had been she had no idea where she had been taken she could not describe the room in which she had been held castillo had just had an uncomfortable thought one that shamed himjesus shes still probably full of that drugwhen munz spoke to him in german why do i suspect you speak german herr castillo castillo turned to look at him while i was talking to my wife in a thick hessian accent i saw your reflection on one of the monitors you were smiling why the hell is she lying and to darby who is an old and close friend guilty castillo said speaking german my mother was german a hessian as a matter of fact and ive got to get an email off to the tages zeitung which i dont think ill mention to munz and i want to call pevsner i should have gotten his phone number all i have is kennedys cellular number well he can either give me the number or have pevsner call me maybe shes just scared she has every right to be she must know that darbys the resident spook and that she is now safely in his hands really munz said where in hesse was your mother from jesus is he onto something has he connected me with gossinger at the four seasons both santini and darby said side is good a little town called bad hersfeld i know it my fathers family was from giessen and my wifes family from kassel howd you wind up here i was born here one day maybe ill tell you how my mother and father got here and my wifes parents okay shes not drugged shes making decisions shes lying munz changed his mind you ever hear of the gehlen organization castillo nodded immediately after world war ii a german general staff officer reinhardt gehlen who had been in charge of eastern intelligence had gone to the americans and offered to turn over not only his files but his entire intelligence networkwhich included among other things of great intelligence value inplace spies in the soviet army and in moscow his price was that none of his officers be tried as nazis and that the americans arrange to get their families out of germany to somewhere safelike south america argentina being preferredwith their husbands to join them later the deal was struck when castillo had first heard the story as a west point cadet he had been fascinated he had wondered then who had made the decision to deal with gehlen it had to have been someone really senior if the story had gotten out there would have been a political eruption he had been trying ever sinceand for years he had held security clearances that gave him access to a great deal of heavily classified filesto find out more he hadnt learned much the conclusion he had drawn without any proof whatsoever was that the decision to deal with gehlen had been made by president harry s truman himself probably at the recommendation of general eisenhower who at the time was commander in chief in europe almost as soon as roosevelt had died and truman had started dealing with the soviet union he had recognized the soviet threat my mother came here in and my father in munz went on he became one of the few civilian instructors at the military academy when he died several years ago he was buried here quite close to a man named hans von langsdorff that name ring a bell the graf spee captain castillo said why is he telling me this to let me know hes one of the good guys maybe darby has him in his pocket and he wants me to know or maybe he wants me to think that hes muy simpatico and i will thereafter regard him as a pal and tell him things i shouldnt well i dont have time to stay here and play games with him when mr darby comes out of there would you ask him to give me a call i dont see any point in hanging around here certainly munz said five room the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july why dont we go in the bar and get you a cup of coffee while youre waiting for me castillo said to the sergeant as they entered the hotel lobby were back to the ambassador saying im not supposed to let you out of my sight i need thirty minutes out of your sight castillo said if you think you have to sergeant call the ambassador and tell him i said that otherwise your waiting in the bar will be our little secret i would say yes sir but you told me not to just dont take off on me please that would put my ass in a crack ill be down in thirty minutes maybe a little less castillo said he walked the sergeant into the bar got a bar tab signed itmaking sure the sergeant didnt see the gossinger signatureand then rode the elevator to his room there was no fax press release from the embassy for herr gossinger waiting in his room nor when he called was it waiting downstairs to be delivered he wondered if ms sylvia grunblatt had overlooked sending it or had intentionally not done so castillo knew that that didnt matter right now he got out his laptop computer and working from his memory of the press release wrote the story of the murdered diplomat and then emailed it to otto goerner at the tages zeitung he thought about calling him immediately but decided that he might not read it right away and that he would call him after he talked to pevsner alex pevsner answered kennedys cellular on the second buzz hola that you alex i heard what happened about thirty minutes ago i thought you would call and i knew you didnt have the number here so i asked howard for his cellular i should have given the number to you how is mrs masterson you heard about that too castillo replied and then went on without waiting for an answer they doped herbupivacaine im toldand she doesnt seem to remember much of what happened but shell be all right i think so yes anna was concerned i dont suppose youve heard anything my sourceand hes close to a man named munz who is the power at sidetells me he doesnt think this is a kidnapping for ransom he say what he thinks it is he doesnt have any idea and neither apparently does colonel munz if i hear anything ill let you know is it all right if i call your cellular number of course let me give you the numbers here pevsner said and did so goerner did you get my masterson story im fine karl and how are you ive been a little concerned about what i got your story very interesting so far theres nothing on the wires or cnn there will be shortly im impressed with yourwhat do they say in the states your scoop well i try to earn my keep i hope you havent had time to work on the oilforfood scandal i mentioned i havent why do you ask i got a story from our guy in vienna yesterday i would have called to tell you about it but as usual i didnt know where to find you if you check your email youll find a rather anxious message from me theres also a rather pointed message on your voice mail at the mayflower in washington what sort of a story the vienna police were called to an apartment on the cobenzlgasse to investigate a terrible odor it came from the decomposing corpsehed apparently been dead for ten days or soof a lebanese man named henri douchon a mental image of the cobenzlgasse the cobblestone street in grinzing leading up the hill to the vienna woods popped into castillos mind he had met alex pevsner for the first time at the top of the hill whos he from what ive been told he was a middleman a very important middleman in the oilforfood arrangement the illegal part whats that got to do with me according to my man before they cut herr douchons throatalmost decapitating himthey pulled several of his fingernails out and several of his teeth he was strapped into a chair jesus i dont want anyone pulling your teeth out with a pair of pliers karlchen much less cutting your throat i want you to forget everything i told you about there possibly being an argentine connection that cow is out of the barn otto if i had known how to reach you yesterday i was going to tell you not to make inquiries discreet or otherwise about oil for food moving money to argentina or anything remotely connected with either not to worry i wont have time now im on the kidnapping story yes im sure you are goerner said that was a notverywellveiled reference to what he knows i do for a living one of the reasons i called was to ask whatoff the top of your headyou think might entice someone to kidnap a diplomats wife when i gave your story to the foreign news editor it will run in all the papers with your byline and photographhe asked me isnt masterson that football player who got seventyfive million dollars after he was run over by a coal truck basketball sixty million and a beer truck castillo said that wasnt in your story karlchen goerner said were going to see if the ap or cnn or bbc mentions it then well either quote them in our wrapup or run it as a sidebar why the hell didnt i mention it i was writing a news story not an embassy press release because you are not a bona fide journalist thats why it should have been in the story castillo said what did you say sixty million that would inspire a kidnapper im sure one of my sources a good oneyou know who he is otto alex pevsnerjust told me there is some doubt in the minds of the senior cops heretheyre called side sort of a combined cia and fbithat the abduction and the murder had anything to do with collecting a ransom even more reason that you not ask penetrating questions when you are far from home there are some very unpleasant people in the world karlchen people who are willing to attract all the attention that kidnapping an american diplomats wife and then killing the diplomat would bring to them would not hesitate before killing a journalist from a not very important german newspaper if they thought he was asking impertinent questions hey im a big boy otto who has always been too big for his pants goerner said there was something else i found missing in your story karl what happens now i dont know what you mean ambassador joe blow said the remains of masterson will be flown to the united states for burial in arlington national cemetery something like that i dont know otto but ill find out and send it to you your editor would like you if possible to accompany the remains to the united states and provide the full story of the funeral im not sure that will be possible im not sure you would go if it was possible but i am a foolish old man who worries about the godfather of his children and thought i should ask otto hold it a minute goerner said and a moment later it just came in on agence france press he said they say seventy million and baseball player trust me its sixty million and basketball castillos cellular buzzed my cellular just went off i have to go otto ill keep you up to speed after you give me that cellular number and where youre staying goerner said hold one castillo said to the cellular then gave otto the cellular number and his room number in the four seasons please karlchen be very careful otto said i will thanks otto auf wiedersehen karlchen sorry castillo said into the cellular i was on the other line how long will it take you to get to a secure line charley the secretary of homeland security asked ten fifteen minutes the sooner the better hall said ill be waiting hes gone ballistic the line went dead castillo had no doubt that he who had gone ballistic was the president of the united states vi one communications center the united states embassy avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina july the slender trim man sitting behind the desk rose when castillo walked in the man was wearing a suit and a crisp white shirt but there was something about him carriage short haircut attitudethat made charley sure he was a soldier mr castillo right i need a secure line to the white house its been cleared sir the ambassador left word that if you came in he wanted to see you right away shit this situation wasnt covered in obeying orders at the point the rule there was simple you obey your last lawful order my last order was to get on the horn as quickly as possible and technically ambassador silvio cant even legally issue me orders or can he hes the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states and major c g castillo is not about to tell ambassador silvio in his embassy that i dont have time for him right now but i will try to fit him into my busy schedule just as soon as i can thank you castillo said and headed for the ambassadors office you wanted to see me sir castillo asked when silvios secretary ushered him into the ambassadors office yes i did thank you for coming so quickly i just wanted to tell you that the security staff has been alerted and are holding themselves ready for your instructions what the hell is he talking about sir you dont have any idea what im talking about do you no sir i dont i thought you might not may i ask what youre doing in the embassy sir i got word to get on a secure line to my boss to secretary hall as quickly as possible i just had a very interesting conversation with my boss as a matter of fact well why dont you speak with your boss and when youre finished we can compare notes so to speak sir i have the uncomfortable feeling that ive done something to displease you im displeased frankly but its nothing youve done mr castillo silvio said in a manner of speaking i would say that you and i are leaves being blown about by the winds of a storm charley couldnt think of anything to say why dont you speak with secretary hall and then come see me silvio said yes sir hall charley sir let me get right to it secretary hall said by direction of the president major castillo you are directed and empowered a to take whatever action you deem necessary to protect the family of the late j winslow masterson while they are in argentina and b to ensure their safe return jesus christ let me finish charley by direction of the president i have written all this down sorry sir and b to ensure their safe return to the united states and you are c directed and empowered to assume responsibility for the investigation of the kidnapping of mrs elizabeth masterson and the murder of mr masterson he paused you understand me so far yes sir the us ambassador in buenos aires has been advised of this presidential directive and directed to provide you with whatever you feel you need to accomplish your duties the directors of the cia and the fbi have similarly been notified of this directive and directed to furnish you with whatever support you feel you may need to carry out your duties my god i told you he went ballistic it began with him banging his fist on the desk and declaring the assassination of a us embassy official will not stand and got more heated from there i dont think ive seen him so angry since we were under fire in nam sir you know im not qualified to do anything like this the president apparently feels you are from what ive seen everybody from the ambassador on down has done everything possible and is still doing everything possible apparently the president doesnt think so this is not open to debate charley thats another quote yes sir to assist you in the accomplishment of your duties the dci has notified the cia station chief that he is to place himself under your orders and the director of the fbi has been ordered to send a team of fbi experts down there to assist you in your investigation and the commander in chief centcom has been ordered to dispatch an aircraft together with adequate security personnel to return the remains of mr masterson and his family to the united states i understand from general naylor that that aircraft will be wheelsup within the hourwhich means its probably already in the air and the senior officer aboard has been placed under your orders sir what part of this is not open to debate did you miss charley i understand sir the only thing i need to hear from youin addition to timely reports of any and all developments of courseis what assistance you think you need castillo exhaled audibly how are the fbi experts going to come down here on the air force transport they have their own plane is there any chance you could send jack britton and betty schneider down here on either airplane odd that you should ask charley just after the fireworks started joel told me that since he thought they were both spinning their wheels in the training academy he had asked the superintendent of the school if he could get them out early to come here and take over your reading of the daily intel reports i dont suppose you knew anything about this no sir i did not the objections the superintendent had were twofold it would set a bad precedent and he had planned to ask for both to serve as instructors sir i really by now both have been sworn in issued credentials and are probably already on their way here if they havent landed already joel can be very persuasive if you hadnt noticed ive noticed sir why do you want them down there because theyre both cops and im not and bettys a woman and im not and jack is black and im not welcome to the secret service dont unpack go back to the airport where an fbi plane is waiting for you castillo will explain everything when you get to argentina can you do that sir the truth is charley that i cant not do it i dont want to explain to the president why i didnt give you something you asked for sir how about getting dick miller out of the hospital and having him vet the daily intel reports charley you know as well as i do that he just had yet another operation on his knee sir he told me that just as soon as he can get out of bed hes going on recuperative leave and instead you want him to come over here with his knee in a cast and go through the daily intels i think hed rather do that than lie in a bed at walter reed or go home ill see what i can find out but refusing you that would be something i might be able to justify to the president even in his present state of mind i think he might be sympathetic to my explanation sir major miller is in walter reed recovering from an operation on his knee yes sir ill call you when i have etas on both planes thank you sir charley did you ever hear that no good deed goes unpunished yes sir im almost sorryoperative word almostthat you found the goddamn yes sir two doctor the secretary of homeland security said into the phone to the chief orthopedic surgery division the walter reed army medical center at the other end of the line let me be sure i understand you presuming he keeps his leg as immobile as reasonably possible there is no reason major miller has to stay in walter reed while waiting for his cast to be removed and that will not be for fifteen days and you have advised him of this and that hes free to go on recuperative leave hall looked at joel isaacson sitting in an office chair on the other side of the desk as hall parroted the doctor you have strongly recommended personally that he go home and get tlc from his mother whom you have known all of major millers life and you think i should know that major miller is at least as stubborn and hardheaded as his father whom you have known even longer than you have his mother as he has declined to take the recuperative leave despite your strong personal recommendation isaacson smiled and shook his head with your permission doctor im going to ask major miller if he would like to perform some limited dutyadministrativein my office if he agrees i have a placewith room servicefor him to stay and can get a yukon to haul him back and forth just keep him off his leg i can do that sir joel you call him secretary hall directed if i call hell consider it an order isaacson nodded and reached for halls telephone hall slid a yellow stickem note with the walter reed telephone number on it and isaacson punched it in put it on the speakerphone hall ordered dick joel isaacson am i calling at a good time a good time for what for you to tell me how youre doing for example im up to my ass literally in about thirty pounds of plaster of paris how do you feel how would you feel joel if you were up to your ass literally in thirty pounds of plaster of paris i thought they might let you go home on recuperative leave they are trying to make me go home on recuperative leave you dont want to go tell me joel if you were up to your ass in thirty pounds of plaster of paris would you want to spend your days taking the correspondence courses offered by the command and general staff college i dont follow you that is what major general miller has in mind for his beloved son to do he has this thing about using ones time profitably and never wasting a second so what are you doing with your time watching reruns of hollywood squares and mash on the tube i havent been too successful in enticing any of the nurses to hop in bed with me we need some help in the office couple of hours a day interested joel when was the last time you were kissed by a sixfoottwo black man when do you want me you didnt even ask what we need you to do quoting clark gable in gone with the wind which i have seen two more times since i have been in here frankly my dear i dont give a damn what if i came over in the morning and picked you up youre still welcome in charleys apartment i guess what if you come over right now and pick me up and where is that sonofabitch he was supposed to bring me a bottle the day before yesterday and never showed up hes in argentina i just saw that on fox news the bad guys blew jack the stack away whats charley got to do with that ill tell you when you get here and back to that question when will that be hold one dick isaacson said punched off the speakerphone covered the microphone with his hand and looked at secretary hall go get him hall ordered dick ill be over there in say half an hour isaacson said well if thats the best you can do miller said and hung up three castillo came out of the phone booth and smiled at the guy in charge of the communications room thank you he said and then pointing at a coffeemaker what are my chances of getting a cup of that couldnt be better sir the man said and handed castillo a china mug soldier or marine castillo asked soldier sir sergeant first class do you ever yearn for simple soldiering castillo asked nothing to worry about except maybe an ig inspection sometimes sir but this is pretty interesting and the life here is good did you know mr masterson yes sir one of the good guys what the hell is going on right now nobody knows castillo said including or maybe especially the guy who by direction of the president is now in charge of the investigation and who is about to become the most unpopular sonofabitch in the embassy with everybody from the ambassador on down pissed at him and with cause they have done their very best from a sense of duty plus their feelings of admiration for masterson and his wife and it hasnt been good enough theyre probably thinking some hotshot whos been in buenos aires for two days is now in charge god only knows what that sonofabitch said about us when he got on a secure line to washington he took a sip of the coffee burned his lip and said shit i should have warned you it was hot the commo sergeant said my fault castillo said well at least i learned how to handle a situation like this at the point its essentially a matter of what not to do you dont line the troops up and say jesus guys wait until you hear what a dumb order we just got when you get a lawful order no matter how dumb and with all due respect mr president this decision of yours is about as dumb as orders getyou either refuse to obey it or you obey it and since this order cannot be refusedits not open for debate and i have sworn a solemn oath without any mental reservations whatsoever to cheerfully obey the orders of officers appointed over me which would certainly include the presidentthat means i will have to go before the troops bubbling over with enthusiasm to carry out the brilliant order i have just received and then do my goddamnedest to execute it can i take this with me the ambassador wants to see me ten minutes ago sure the sergeant said four sir i just spoke with secretary hall who told me what the president has ordered the president made it crystal clear what he wishes done what he wants you to do ambassador silvio said for your ears only sir im way out of my depth the president doesnt seem to think so silvio said and thats all that really matters isnt it yes sir i guess it is ive asked everybody with a role in this to come to the conference room theyre in there now have you said anything to them sir i thought i would ask you what you would like me to say before i said anything sir i think the simple factsthat the president told you he has given me the responsibility to get mrs masterson and the children and mr mastersons body safely out of the country and that i am now in charge of the investigationwould be the best way to handle it thats about what i was thinking silvio said just before the president called me i made a decision that i dont think is going to please the fbi team thats coming down yes sir colonel munz asked for permission to perform the autopsy on mr mastersons body and i gave that permission it was a tough call im not sure i follow you sir we get into a somewhat hazy area of law and diplomacy here silvio said a murder and an abduction have occurred those are violations of argentine law the murder of an official of the us government no matter where it occurs is a violation of the united states code one of the few offenses for which the death penalty may be applied castillo thought if i needed another proof that i dont know what the hell im doing i never thought about any of this and in theory at least the government can demand that the perpetrators be extradited to the united states for trial i dont knowi just havent had the time to look into itwhere mrs mastersons abduction fits into this but her abduction violates argentine law i never even thought about this castillo confessed ive given it some thought silvio said now presuming that the people who did this are apprehended they would be arrested by the argentines and tried in an argentine court the problem i have with that is that if found guilty the maximum penalty is twenty or twentyfive years imprisonment no death penalty castillo said and for your ears only mr castillo while i would dearly love to see these peoplewhat is that lovely phrasehung by the neck until dead dead dead thats just not going to happen furthermore extradition poses some problems unfortunately a number of argentine officials and more important legislators oppose anything we norteamericanos ask forprobably a vestige of juan domingo peronas a pavlovian reflex while im fairly certain that extradition would ultimately be approved im not certain our death penalty enters into the equation when i was a young consular officer in paris there was a terrible man from philadelphia who stuffed his girlfriend in a trunk and let her petrify there when this was finally discovered and he was arrested his attorneynow senator arlen specter as a matter of interestgot him out on bail which he promptly jumped we finally located him in france when we tried to have him extradited french officials and legislators who seem to share the argentine fondness for denying anything we americans ask were more than a little difficult one of the reasons they cited for denying extradition was that we have the death penalty and they dont there were other reasons but that was one of their major moral arguments it took us about twenty years to get this chap extradited from france that took place just a couple of years ago and i feel sure that our death penalty would be advanced as a reason for the argentines to deny extradition i heard that story castillo said i have some friends in the philadelphia police department including a former sergeant named betty schneider who at this very moment is on her way down here and who may not be nearly as delighted to see me as i will be to see her two of whom sir castillo went on have become secret service agents i asked that they be sent here to assist me one of them is a woman whom i intend to assign to mrs mastersons security detail the other is a very bright detective who will keep his eyes on the investigation for me hes a black guy which i thought might be useful so you do have some ideas what to do silvio said i suspect youre not nearly as far out of your depth as you say you are oh yes i am and did i ask for sergeant schneider because i wanted her to sit on mrs masterson or because i cant get her out of my mind how does dick miller so cleverly phrase it that i have the lamentable tendency to think with my dick with all of these things in mind silvio said it seemed to me that justiceas much of it as can be expected in this circumstancewould best be served to have these scum tried and convicted in an argentine court yes sir i understand which means of course that all evidence gathered will be retained by the argentine judicial system that extraditionof these people even if finally approved would be futile even if we could get around the double jeopardy business we would have no evidence to present plus the very actjustified legally permissible or not of asking for extradition would certainly offend argentine pride it would be tantamount to saying we dont trust their judicial system did you tell the president what you had decided mr ambassador the conversation mr castillo was rather onesided silvio said is there anything else we should talk over before we go into the conference room do you think i cant think of anything sir five everyone sitting at the long conference table stopped talking and rose to their feet as ambassador silvio and castillo entered the room alex darby was at the foot of the table kenneth lowery sat on his right and tony santini on his left the two fbi agents from montevideo sat together there were a dozen other men around the table castillo didnt know any by name but some of them the dea people he recognized from the brainstorming session masterson had organized the day before there were three people in uniform an air force colonel an army colonel and a marine gunnery sergeant castillo pegged them as the defense attache the military mission commander and the nco in charge of the marine guards everybody looked at castillo with unabashed curiosity keep your seats please gentlemen silvio ordered as he walked to the head of the table he put his hands on the back of the chair there for those of you who havent had the opportunity to meet him this gentleman is mr c g castillo who is in argentina as the presidents agent a short time ago the president conveyed to me his decision to place mr castillo in charge of dealing with all aspects of the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in visavis chief of mission j winslow masterson and his family the president further informed me that the secretary of state the secretary of defense and the directors of the central intelligence agency and the federal bureau of investigation have been informed of his decision the ambassador looked at castillo said mr castillo you have the floor and sat in the first chair at the side of the table castillo looked around the room theres not a hell of a lot of friendly faces looking at me as a matter of fact none well here goes good morning gentlemen castillo began our priorities are these first the protection of mrs masterson and her children second the protection of all embassy personnel third to cooperate with the argentine authorities in their investigation of what has happened in regard to the last after consulting with ambassador silvio i have decided that we will proceed on the assumption that the argentine government will find out who committed these crimes arrest the culprits and subject them to trial in argentine courts were not even going to try to extradite these scumbags fbi agent yung asked that is what after consultation with ambassador silvio i have decided and please dont interrupt me again until i open the floor for comments and questions castillo said there was some murmuring but nothing more well i got away with that lets see what else i can get away with with regard to priority one mr santini who has had extensive experience with the secret service presidential protection detail will assume responsibility for the protection of the masterson family until we can get them safely out of the country an air force transport is already in the air on its way down here to transport mr mastersons body and his family to the united states with regard to priority two mr lowery will put in place whatever heightened security measures he deems necessary for the protection of all other embassy personnel i know the president has a deep interest in this so id like within the hour a rough game plan from you mr lowery so that after ambassador silvio approves itor modifies iti can send it to washington castillo looked at lowery who said yes sir within the hour two down with regard to priority three mr darby will handle all arrangements to cooperate with the argentine authorities in their investigation of this situation and coordinatingwith mr santini and mr lowery the incorporation of what security personnel the argentine government provides into our own security arrangements further the fbi is sending a team of investigators down here they will report to mr darby mr yung is it yung he confirmed you will be responsible for the logistic support of the fbi team find them someplace to live to operate automobiles whatever they need and also keep ambassador silvio mr darby mr lowery mr santini and myself advised on a timely basis of whatever their investigation develops the secret service is sending two special agents down here one special agent schneider will report to mr santini to assist in the protection of the masterson family special agent britton will monitor both the argentines and our investigationincluding of course the fbis and report to the ambassador and me what information he comes up with i will since both special agents will be working for me handle their logistic requirements now how the hell are you going to do that finally to ensure everyones working on the same page and to ensure that someone sitting behind a desk in washington doesnt start to try to micromanage what were going to do here there will be no communication by any meansradio email or telephonewith any agency in washington unless it has been first vetted by the ambassador or myself youre telling me sir that im forbidden to communicate with the bureau yung demanded thank you for the opportunity to make myself perfectly clear agent yung as apparently my request to finish without interruption also went unheard castillo said icily you are forbidden to communicate with the bureauor anyone elseabsent the approval of the ambassador or myself in every instance got it there was a moments hesitation then a cold ive got it now are there any questions or comments there were far fewer questions and comments than castillo expected there is however a sullen bubbling resentment toward presidential agent castillo that can be cut with a knife but i think trying to be a nice guy would have made things even worse well if thats it gentlemen thank you for your time and attention now lets get to work mr darby and mr santini will you remain behind please will you be needing me for anything else mr castillo ambassador silvio asked when everyone but darby and santini had left the room if you would sir give me another minute of course tony alex that commo block doesnt apply to either of you but i couldnt keep just the fbi off the horn and i really didnt want some hotshot secondguessing what were going to try to do here he looked at darby remember the langley hotshots with access to a satellite phone in afghanistan alex painfully darby chuckled joel said you were really a hardnose santini said you did very well in here just now ace i wish i thought so i thought so too ambassador silvio said i did wonder however why you claimed my decision not to go for extradition as your own we had a saying in afghanistan sir when we did something we suspected might get us in hot water screw it what are they going to do send me to afghanistan silvio chuckled theres also an expression if you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen but that was gracious of you mr castillo im grateful sir do you think you could bring yourself to call me charley of course thank you my first name is juan my friends usually call me john my real first name is carlos sir and with your permission i will continue to call you sir and mr ambassador charley who are these two agents theyre sending down santini asked theyre both exphiladelphia cops we worked with them when we were looking for the the lady was a sergeant in intelligence and the guy worked deep cover for years for counterterrorism hall was impressed with both of them and told joel to recruit them joel just got them out of the training academy early to work in halls office so they were available what are you going to do with them well as far as the sergeant is concerned i am going to look passionately into her beautiful eyes and get as much cabernet sauvignon down her lovely throat as possible this is why i asked you to stay mr ambassador castillo said alex i was at the hospital when you and lowery were talking with her munz told me you were there darby interrupted and i had the feeling alex that you werent getting the truth the whole truth and nothing but darbys eyes first registered surprise and then hardened charley she was coming out of the drug she didnt know what she was saying she knew enough to be very concerned about her kids castillo said but when it came to any detail of her abduction she drew a blank not a partial blank alex a blanket blank that was not the feeling i had darby said well what were going to do now is go over to the hospital so that youand if you can spare the time mr ambassador you toocan introduce her to tony and me at which time tony will ask her what happened and what she remembers darby shook his head why would she lie about what he asked i think mr castcharleyis suggesting that her abductors told her to tell youusas little as possible and threatened her silvio said yes sir castillo said and we need all the information we can get after they blew jack away darby pursued it seems to me she would want to tell us anything we wanted to know unless they threatened her children castillo said if they were willing to blow her husband away she knew theyd be willing to hurt the kids kill the kids or maybe her family her father and the brother i think youre really reaching charley darby said what brother santini asked he works for the un castillo said thats about all i know except what alex told me about his not getting along with masterson i met him once years ago silvio said he has some sort of liaison coordinationofagencies job in paris i was thinking of perhaps trying to get in touch with him so that he could break this news to his father who has some sort of heart problem siralex do you know his name lorimer alex said jeanpierre jeanpaul something like that french the ambassadorsbetsys fathersfirst name is philippe theyre french maybe way back way way back like jacks family darby said jack used to delight in telling people who hated the south that there were three mastersonsfree men of colorwho were confederate officers two in the navy and one in the army if he was really pulling their chain hed say the family had made its money in the slave trade silvio chuckled was there money alex castillo asked before he was run over by the beer truck not that kind of money but yeah both families are more thanwhats the wordcomfortable sugar i think and cotton growing it and dealing in it mr ambassador charley said i was going to suggest that you get in touch with the state department and see if we can get a location maybe even a telephone number on the brother in case we cant get that information from mrs masterson ill get right on it silvio said and if youd like ill go to the german hospital with you and introduce you and tony to mrs masterson thank you sir that will be very helpful six the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july el coronel alfredo munz of side walked up to them as they entered the lobby of the hospital your excellency gentlemen he said in spanish what a fortunate happenstance i was about to call senor castillo and ask if he could spare me a moment of his time fortunate happenstance my ass munz wasnt surprised at all to see us he was waiting for us which means he knew we were coming here how did he do that hes got somebody inside the embassy more than likely to keep an eye on things generally and the ambassador in particular somebody who heard the ambassador call for his car to bring us here or someone listening to that allegedly encrypted radio in his car or darbys or maybe hearing the marine guard calling lowery to update him on the ambassadors location why am i surprised both darby and santini told me sides good and with this business going on theyve got their act in high gear but what does he want with me mi coronel i am at your disposal castillo said and then to the ambassador sir why dont you go up to mrs mastersons room i know where it is and i can catch up with you munz led castillo to a corner of the lobby you have at once greatly disappointed several important people in the ministry of information herr gossinger munz said in german and added a little excitement to what im sure you and i would both regard as their rather boring and mundane lives oh shit he found out i entered the country as gossinger and i never went to the ministry of information to register as a journalist castillo smiled at him how is that herr oberst he replied in german munz handed him a sheet of paper it was a copy of the immigration form castillo had filled out on the airplane and handed to the immigration officer at the airport it also had his photograph obviously taken by a good and unobtrusive camera as he stood at the immigration booth they so wanted to explain to a prominent german journalist how concerned the argentine government is with this sad situation and then when you failed to show up at the ministry of information as you promised to do they thought that perhaps this german fellow had something to do with the villains were looking for actually my name is gossinger charley began i know i took the trouble to find out the german embassy told me you are not only a distinguished foreign correspondent for the tages zeitung but the greatgreatgrandson of the founder what a wonderful cover a second persona that is real i feel like a kid caught with my hand in the cookie jar what happens now ive assured them that not only have i informed you of our efforts to get to the bottom of this situation but also that i told you it would be unnecessary to register with the ministry of information there is no longer a problem thank you and i have this for you too he handed him a small plasticcovered card it read corps diplomatique and had his photograph and gossingers name on it a diplomatic carnet in case one of our everalert police would ask why youre carrying a pistol a pistol actually it was my intention to loan you one but i see under your suit coat that youre already carrying one in the small of your back the ambassador lent it to me karlyou dont mind if i call you karl do you herr oberst you may call me anything you wish there are some very dangerous people here in argentina im afraid and im not talking about our cottage kidnapping industry i havent been able to come up with any connection between herr masterson and themfrom what i have hes in that charming north american phrase mr cleanbut that doesnt mean there isnt one and these people have proven that murder is just part of their game i would be very sorry if they decided to eliminate you you dont think this is a kidnapping do you do you well they abducted her so thats a kidnapping but it smells yes it does you have no ideas whatever none if you did would you tell me castillo met his eyes yes i would between us what did you think when mrs masterson was being i guess the word is interrogated by darby and lowery i would not describe her responses as fully forthcoming what do you think shes hiding there may be more to it than this but the first thing that came to my mind was that they threatened her probably her childrenif she revealed anything she had learned about them why didnt they kill her they want something from her maybe masterson didnt bring the ransom with him and they are threatening to kill the children if she doesnt get it to them i just dont know tony santini is an experienced secret service agent i know did he really injure himself falling off the presidents limousine castillo thought a moment before replying the vice presidents limousine how embarrassing for him anyway charley said ignoring the subject the ambassadors going to introduce him as the secret service man assigned to protect her and the children and hes going to use that to see what he can get out of her and is he going to tell her of your appointment as the generalissimo in charge you heard about that too did you alfredo like yourself karl im sure i like to keep my ear to the grindstone nose to the grindstone ear to the ground castillo smilingly corrected him thank you munz said theres a planeload of fbi agents on their way down here to assist in the investigation and two secret service agents to assist me one is a really bright female with a good deal of experience in intelligence im going to put her on the protection detail hoping shell be able to get to mrs masterson the other one is a very good streetsmart cop who worked under deep cover in really bad situations for years im going to have him look at what the fbi comes up with and i would be grateful if you would let him see what youve come up with certainly but theres not much theres also an air force transport on its way to transport mastersons body and his family home are you going with them jesus i never thought about that maybe but if i do i have the feeling that ill be coming back munz nodded then put out his hand im glad we had this chance to chat karl thank you for everything alfredo seven mrs elizabeth masterson was not in the intensive care room where she had first been placed but castillo had no trouble in finding the room to which she had been moved there were four uniformed policia federal under the command of a sergeant and two men in civilian clothingone of them paul sieno the cia agent hovering around a door near the end of the corridor sieno nodded at castillo who then knocked on the door a moment later ambassador silvio opened it a crack and then all the way come in mr castillo he said and as castillo went through the door the ambassador went on betsy heres mr castillo mrs masterson was sitting up in a hospital bed she was in a nightgown that had to be hers from home and castillo saw there were two other women in the room almost certainly darbys wife and the ambassadors they were sitting in chairs along the wall and darby and santini were leaning on the wall next to them castillo walked up to the bed the president has asked me to tell you how terribly sorry he is mrs masterson that little lie came quickly to my lips didnt it well if the president had thought about it he would have thats very kind of him mrs masterson said she did not offer her hand and her smile was visibly an effort and if i may i would like to offer my own condolences when there was no response to this except the frozen smile castillo went on my orders maam are first to absolutely guarantee your safety and that of your children and then to get you to the united states just as quickly and as safely as possible the smile remained fixed and she said nothing has ambassador silvio told you that mr santini has many years experience on the secret service presidential protection detail yes he has and the argentine authorities have provided us with some of their very best men to help mr santini so the ambassador has told me we hope to have word very soon about the arrival of the aircraft the president has sent down here one of them is a transport which will carry you and your family to the united states just as soon as you feel up to it and the other is bringing both a team of fbi experts to assist in the investigation and two secret service agents for your protection detail one of them is a female agent mrs masterson nodded im very much aware mrs masterson that this is a difficult time for you mrs masterson snorted but i hope youll understand that certain plans have to be made such as where in the united states would you like to go keesler she said keesler air force base in biloxi is closest to jacks parents home in pass christian pass christeeann thats the french pronunciation and while im on that subject what about her brother whos supposed to be in france is there someone there in pass christian who we can contact your father my father lives in metairienew orleans and he has a heart condition my fatherinlaw lives in pass christian i really think hed be the man to break this to my father i was just talking about that frankly with mrs silvio when you came in mr castillo shes going to call jacks father or the ambassador is just as soon as they can get to a phone i hope they can get through to him before he sees it on cnn or fox and then ill call him of course when they let me out of here have they told you when thats going to be they want to keep me overnight for observation she said then turned to the ambassador juan cant you do something about that i want to be with the children i understand silvio said but they really want to look for signs of whatever that drug might have done to you if youd like we can bring the kids here to see you no i dont want them to see me like this theyre better off with julia julia presumably is darbys wife theyre in school now castillo asked their father has just been murdered she snapped of course theyre not in school forgive me castillo said then the other woman is lowerys wife darbys wife julia the old friend of the familyis with the kids is there anyone else maam that we should contact no ill notify everyone just as soon as im out of here that no came really quick wouldnt she want to tell her brother even if he didnt get along with her husband mrs masterson i wont intrude on your grief anymore if theres anything you need all youll have to do is tell mr santini thank you castillo nodded at the people in the room and walked out he had taken half a dozen steps to the elevator when ambassador silvio caught up with him santini was on the ambassadors heels im forced to agree with you mr cascharley silvio said shes concealing something i got nowhere with her either santini said mr ambassador she didnt even mention her brother castillo said would you be willing to try to get him on the telephone i thought that was odd too silvio agreed ill put a call in to him just as soon as i get back to the embassy where will you be at the embassy sir i want to get the etas of the airplanes then ill see you there eight the united states embassy avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina july it was a frustrating fortyfive minutes on the telephone even getting the number of the united nations european directorate of interagency coordination was frustrating the buenos aires international operator had trouble first connecting to and then communicating with the paris information operator silvio gave up on that and called the american embassy in paris the political attache had somewhat reluctantlyand only after silvio had proven to him who he wasprovided a listing for the directorate but said he had neither an address nor a number for a jeanpaul lorimer a somewhat nasalvoiced french woman at the directorate told silviowhose french was fluentthat msieu lorimer was out of the office that she had no number at which he could be reached and that any further inquiries should be directed to the director of information she was unmoved by silvios announcement that he was the united states ambassador to argentina and was trying to contact lorimer because there had been a death in the family the only address and telephone number the state department in washington and the united states mission to the united nations in new york city had for lorimer was his office let me see what the secret service can do sir castillo said finally and started to punch in isaacsons number in washington on his cell phone you dont want to get a secure line whats classified castillo said and immediately added i didnt mean to sound flip sir sorry i didnt think you were being flip silvio said it was a dumb question isaacson charley joel i see were being telepathic again isaacson replied i was just about to call you about the fbi planeon which im sure youll be thrilled to hear casanova is the beauteous agent schneiderand the c you didnt say something allegedly witty to her did you joel no but i was sorely tempted she really is a delight to the eyes and i felt dutybound to warn her about you tell me about the airplanes she and jack britton are on a gulfstream five which left here at elevenohfive local time they make about four hundred sixty knots and its about fiftytwo hundred miles from here to there so you figure it out without asking permission castillo snatched a pencil from a mug on silvios desk silvio quickly handed him a yellow lined pad the call sign is air force zerofoursevenseven theyre bound for an airport called jorge newbery which i presume is somewhere near buenos aires also on the plane are six somewhat annoyed fbi agents pissed not only because they were told to report to youas secret service not presidential hotshotbut because two of their number got bumped because schneider and britton got on jorge newbery is the downtown airport in buenos aires the ctail number air force zerothreeeightoneleft charleston air force base south carolina an hour earlier but its going toprobably already hasmade a stop at hurlburt where it picked up a dozen air commandos ready to go to war and a tenman spitandpolish detail from the old guard under a lieutenant for the burial party who were conveniently in florida burying some retired general jesus i think you can guess where that order originated isaacson added anyway the c will be landing at an airfield called ezeiza thats the main international field i guess they couldnt get that big airplane into the little airport you can sit a globemaster down in your backyard joel no kidding well for some reason thats where its going and it will take however long after it leaves hurlburt to go fortytwo hundred nautical miles at four hundred fifty knots castillo scribbled down those numbers okay got it now i need something from you shoot the widows brother jeanpaul lorimer works for the un in paris the ambassador has been trying for fortyfive minutes to get him on the phone without any luck have we got anybody in paris who can help ill get right on it call the embassy here and leave the numbers and address with the ambassadors secretary done you got anything else you want me to tell the boss i put tony santini in charge of the mastersons security she came out of the drug they gave her all right but theyre keeping her in the hospital overnight i dont know when shell want to leave here but when she does she wants to go to keesler air force base in mississippi near where he lived she wants to bury him there apparently i know the president was thinking of arlington i think she wants the family plot in mississippi joel thats going to pose a little problem i also know the president wants walter reed to do the autopsy the argentines are already doing the autopsy and theyre going to prosecute these bastards presuming we can catch them in argentine courts who decided that i did charley said he met silvios eyes and added the ambassador concurs i think that may cause more than a little pique at the highest level charley there was considerable doubt that we could extradite the doers and the crime occurred here and its a done deed the ambassador has already told the foreign ministry i think the boss will more than likely want to talk to you about that charley or maybe his boss will i thought that might happen well be in touch charley watch your back castillo pushed the disconnect button and then did the calculation of the arrival times both planes will probably arrive here between eleven and midnight tonight he announced to ambassador silvio the gulfstream to jorge newbery and the c at ezeiza theres an honor guard from the third infantry regimentthe old guardon the globemaster plus a detail of air commandos as a suggestion if you want to meet your agents and the fbi i can have the defense attache meet the transport thank you hell have to arrange transportation for them and a place to live i think the best thing to do with the military personnel is move them in with the marines and you told that fbi agent yung to arrange to take care of the fbi what about your agents ill take care of them but i am going to need wheels can i rent cars for them you could but the rentals here are generally small and not always reliable and they dont have radios ill have ken lowery deal with it how many are you going to need if i can keep the one i have one more i really dont need a driver you never know the ambassador said ill tell ken to get you another car and a driver tonight first thing in the morning and what are you going to do now sir what are your immediate plans for the next fortyfive minutes or an hour i dont have any sir i thought i might go have a look at the masterson house have you had breakfast no sir neither have i and its now after three fortunately right around the corner from here is a restaurantthe rio albathat serves what i believe are the finest steaks in the world why dont we go have one while we wait to hear from your friend in the secret service i think thats a splendid idea sir vii one the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july the marine guardwho castillo had learned was staff sergeant roger markham twenty years old of des moines iowa who had been a seventeenyearold fresh from parris island when he had been on the marine march to baghdad before being assigned to the marine embassy guard battalionpulled the embassy bmw i to a smooth stop in front of the four seasons and started to open his door castillo caught his arm if you try to rush around and open my door roger i swear to god youll regret it markham looked at him sheepishly its now a little after nine castillo said the planes due at eleventhirty give or take which means we should leave here around eleven what are your plans for those two hours wait here right here can you leave the car here dip plates i can leave it anywhere what you are going to do roger is park it the driveway is right there castillo pointed to the entrance of the hotels basement garage and then youre going to come to my room where we will try to get a little shuteye whatever you say s there you go again castillo said what do they do to you at parris island give you fifty pushups every time you to forget to say sir fifty sometimes a hundred sorry not really a problem but try huh markham nodded go park the car castillo said and got out as he walked through the lobby castillo remembered that he had not gotten rooms for betty schneider and jack britton that proved to be more of a problem than he anticipated the house was nearly full the assistant manager on duty told him after ten minutes of consulting the computer it was decided that herr gossinger would move from his suiteinto fifteen hundred was far grander than castillo needed and consequently far more expensive he toyed with the idea of putting betty into but decided against it she would almost certainly decide that i was plying her with luxurious accommodation as part of my wicked and devious plan to get into her pants if i thought that would work id rent the whole goddamn floor vacating made it available to someone else and somehow that freed up and both very nice single rooms with views of avenida julio and the port both were equipped with two queensized beds castillo asked the assistant manager which was farthest from and was told put senorita schneider in fifteeneighteen please would you like to have a bottle of champagne and some flowersroses perhapswaiting for the young lady senor gossinger i dont think that would be a very good idea thank you as far as the young lady is concerned our relationship isand will remainprofessional and platonic there wasnt much that had to be moved from to and there were two bellmen and sergeant markham to help him but it was after ninethirty before the process was completed i am now going to drink one of these castillo said holding up two bottles of quilmes beer from the inroom bar and then make a valiant attempt to catch a few winks he extended a bottle to markham and added i suggest you do the same im not sure i should be drinking markham said trust me roger you should drink that beer with sergeant markham stretched out on the couch in the sitting room of suite castillo lay down on the superkingsized bed in the bedroom the first thing that came to mind were mental images not all of which could honestly be deemed lewd and obscene of special agent schneider he finally chased them away with images of jack the stack masterson in the taxicab jesus was that only this morning when his cellular telephone buzzed he was dreaming in his dream sergeant schneider was being much much more affectionate than she had ever been in his waking hours he looked at his watch he had been asleep for fifteen minutes castillo i really hope i either woke you up or interrupted something really indecent major h richard millers very familiar voice announced you have no idea you sonofabitch how did he get this number hows the knee how do you think it is after every sonofabitch and his brother has been digging around in it for a month with the very latest in shiny sharp instruments of torture whats up dick we cant find this lorimer guy in paris and god knows ive tried you are going to have one hell of a phone bill old pal you sound as if youre not calling from your walter reed bed of pain actually having accepted your kind invitation to share your pad miller said im lying on your couch in the mayflower as we speak in the morning they will roll me into your office at the nebraska complex where i will lie on your couch there what about lorimer well we finally got an address for him seven rue monsieur and a phone number no answer on the phone isaacson called some secret service guy he knows in paris the guy went there the concierge said she had no idea where lorimer was but that he was often gone for a week or two his car is in the garage isaacson said that hes going to ask secretary hall to ask secretary cohen to lean on the un to find out where he is and isaacson said for me to call you and bring you up to speed thanks dick are you sure youre all right to work im fine i presume the love of your life has not yet arrived screw you and if youre referring to betty schneider the eta is twentythreethirty local an hour difference between here and there huh its almost ten here as a friendly word of advice im almost positive you will ignore try to think with your upper brain for a change before you do something stupid with that woman jesus christ castillo heard himself flare shes no longer a cop that i can make a pass at shes now in the secret service and she works for me i still like to think of myself as an officer and a gentleman so fuck you dick there was a moments silence and then miller said charley ol buddy you have no idea how happy that outburst made me ill be in touch the line went dead castillo sat up in the bed and turned the light on i dont know where that outburst came from either but it was right on the money i cant make a pass at special agent schneider i shouldnt even be fantasizing about her moot point she has made it as clear as humanly possible that she has no interest in me at all but im glad dick brought it up i am entirely capable of doing the wrong thing and probably would have what the hell is the matter with me in one movement he laid the cellular on the bedside table and fell back on the bed then a moment later he sat up again picked up the phone and punched the autodial button for howard kennedy kennedy answered on the third ring hello did i wake you up howard as a matter of fact no are you in the hotel why i thought we might have a drink theres a jazz quartet in the bar very kind of you but what im doing is standing in the rain at ezeiza watching ground handlers in whom i have no confidence whatsoever loading very expensive and very nervoushorses onto an airplane ill take a rain check though are you going with the horses wherever theyre going as a matter of fact yes but youll be coming back soon kennedys silence indicated he wasnt going to answer the question pity castillo went on some old friends of yours are coming to town there was another silence long enough to make castillo think kennedy was not going to respond when he did the major crime investigation team from quantico i dont know where theyre from but theyre coming from washington have you got their names this time castillo hesitated before replying why the hell not get him the names what harm can it do i can get them as soon as they get off the gulfstream when will that be eleventhirty give or take i told another of your former associates to meet the plane and find them someplace to sleep whats his name yung hes stationed in montevideo chinese feisty little bastard round face fiveeight onefifty yeah you know him very well what did he tell you hes doing in montevideo he didnt tell me hes doing anything i have the impression hes just one more of your former associates looking into money laundering the ambassador asked the ambassador in montevideo if any of them had kidnapping experience and he sent yung and another guy here his name i dont have it handy but i can get it where are they landing here jorge newbery theres a transport on the way that should land at ezeiza at about the same time i just saw an air force colonel in full uniform surrounded by argentine air force brass i wondered what he was up to im going to get the familyand the bodyout of here just as soon as i can what were you planning to chat about charley while we were listening to the jazz quartet i thought i might idly inquire if you had ever heard of a fellow named jeanpaul lorimer kennedy replied by spelling lorimer in the phonetic alphabet correct never heard of him but if you get me those names ill be happy to ask around deal how do i get them to you on the phone how else i thought you were about to leave ill leave after i have those names done heres a freebie charley whatever david william yung jr is doing in montevideo it almost certainly has very little to do with examining bank statements you mean hes looking for you that too of course but thats not what i meant hes a real hotshot they dont waste people like david looking for dirty money you sound as if you know him well i told you i did we used to work together can you give me a hint i just did ill be waiting for your call charley the line went dead two aeropuerto internacional jorge newbery buenos aires argentina july sergeant roger markham had just turned the embassy bmw i onto avenida julio near the four seasons hotel when the radio went off yung for castillo castillo was looking around for a microphone when markham put one in his hand castillo took it and pushed the press to talk button go sir the aircraft will be parked on the private aviation side of the field got it thank you sir eta is fortyfive minutes got it thank you were on the way out well he not only told me where the airplane will be parked which he didnt have to do but he called me sir maybe hes resigned to me being in charge and decided he might as well go along but on the other hand its equally likely considering that everybody in the fbi got the castilloknowskennedy memo he thinks that if we can become pals i just might let something slip that would put him onto howard kennedy what the hell did kennedy mean when he said whatever yungs doing hes not looking for dirty money you might as well slow down roger theyre fortyfive minutes out am i driving too fast sir i wish there was someplace we could get a cup of coffee castillo said back to the hotel theres all kinds of restaurants on the river near the airport pick one yes s ill do that dont let this go to your head roger but maybe theres some hope for you after all it was raining hard when they got to the civilian side of jorge newbery airfield so hard that castillo wondered if the gulfstream was going to be able to land there was only one runway paralleling the bank of the rio de la plata and it didnt look like a fun place to try to land in a driving rain with gusting winds on the tarmac in front of a southern winds hangar he saw a bmw with diplomat plates two small white mercedesbenz buses called traffiks each of which had a cardboard sign with cd lettered on it taped to the windshield and a peugeot sedan with argentine plates when sergeant markham pulled in beside the buses castillo saw that the interior lights of one of the buses were on and saw special agent yung holding a newspaper looking out at them there was an air force major on the bus if i sit here eventually yung will come here establishing me as king of the hill but he will get drenched and make the seats here wet and i can get a much better look at him in the bus than i can here i want to see his eyes castillo turned to markham i suppose its too much to expect you to have an umbrella the sergeant produced one instantly seemingly out of thin air castillo chuckled appreciatively thank you roger for the umbrella as castillo reached the bus and the door swung open inwardly with a whoosh two men got out of the peugeot and holding newspapers over their heads half ran toward it well what do you think yung are they going to be able to get in senor castillo one of the argentine men said and when castillo turned he was handed a small handheld transceiver he saw that it was lit up and tuned to what he presumed was the jorge newbery tower frequency he put it to his ear there was the tobeexpected hissing which suddenly cleared jorge newbery this is united states air force zerofoursevenseven i have your runway in sight a cheerful confident american voice announced castillo handed the argentine the radio thank you he said and then to yung talk about timing he sat down so that he could see out the windshield for a moment he could see nothing and then a second after he spotted first a grimes light and then the navigation lights a very bright landing light suddenly blazed the glistening white gulfstreama us air force cacame in low and touched down immediately after the threshold the words united states of america were lettered boldly down the side of the fuselage they were illuminated so the legend couldnt be missed telling castillo the airplane belonged to the th presidential airlift group at andrews air force base maryland only their airplanes had the classy paint jobs castillo felt a lump in his throat it was like seeing the colors flying somewhere very foreign which indeed was the case now jesus thats a pretty bird the air force major said softly my sentiments exactly major castillo said smiled and offered the major his hand my name is castillo yes sir i know my name is jossman sir youre going to take care of the crew the embassy administrative officer put everyone in the las pampas aparthotel mr castillo yung answered for him i presumed he had checked with you is that all right you are a clever sonofabitch arent you yung he obviously did so with the ambassadors blessing castillo said are you satisfied with them yes sir yung im going to need a list of the fbi people castillo said put your name and the other fbi agent from montevideo on it just the names and what they do if theyre not special agents and while youre at it you might as well list the fbi personnel in uruguay ill get it to you first thing in the morning is there some reason i cant have it right now im going to give one copy to these gentlemen for colonel munz he paused and then asked in spanish you do work with el coronel munz the man nodded thank you senor castillo he said i was about to ask if i have the names there will be no problem with immigration there you go yung castillo said with a smile he really hoped would burn yung have at it yes sir he is not used to being ordered around like howard kennedy another if former fbi hotshot what the hell is he doing in uruguay here it comes air force major jossman said gesturing out the window castillo looked and saw the gulfstream coming down the taxiway do i have the only umbrella he asked ive got some major jossman said as the gulfstream rolled onto the tarmac before the southern winds hangar floodlights in the hangar came on and a stream of gendarmeria national men most of them carrying submachine guns came out of the hangar formed a line and came to attention ignoring the rain the officer in charge saluted major jossman took two umbrellas opened one inside the bus and then tried and failed to get it through the door he gave up collapsed it stepped into the rain and then opened it major castillo ordered everybody in here they can deal with the luggage later the major nodded and walked to the nowstopped gulfstream its engines winding down the door opened and a stocky man in a business suit appeared in the doorway the major handed him the second umbrella the major pointed to the bus and the man nodded opened the umbrella and started toward the bus special agent elizabeth schneider appeared next in the doorway major castillos heart jumped special agent schneider looked around saw the bus saw major castillo in it smiled and gave a little wave major castillos heart jumped again harder jossman held the umbrella for special agent schneider and walked with her to the bus they got there as the stocky man came through the door my name is he started to say but then noticed agent yung well hello dave yung looked up from his lined yellow pad hey paul he said then mr castillo this is special agent paul holtzman im supposed to report to you sir holtzman said im the senior agent he didnt offer his hand hand your umbrella to the major please castillo said and take a seat ill save what i have until everyones on board it had been major castillos firm intention to greet special agent schneider formally she blew this plan out of the water by smiling at him again then sitting down next to him innocently resting her hand on his shoulder in the process and saying hello charley so close to him that he could smell her breath peppermint they had apparently issued chewing gum to counter the pressure differential that occurs when an aircraft makes a rapid descent from cruising to approach altitude so the plan to greet special agent schneider with good to see you again schneider or words to that effect was replaced with jesus im glad to see you as he also became aware of special agent schneiders perfume he became simultaneously aware that special agent yung hadnt missed a thing it took several minutes for the umbrella shuttle to get everybody off the gulfstream into the bus including the crew special agent jack britton was about the fifth man to climb onto the bus and for a moment castillo didnt recognize him the last time castillo had seen him britton had been wearing a somewhat straggly beard and the philadelphia conception of arabic robes and his hair had been both cornrowed and embedded with beadery now his hair was neatly cut he wore a wellfitted suit he looked castillo thought like colin powell brittons grip was firm i dont know the protocolam i supposed to call you sirbut its good to see you charleys fine jack its good to see you too ready to go to work i would like to visit a gentlemans rest facility first the one on the airplane went on the fritz somewhere over brazil and if possible id like to get something to eat theres probably a mens room in the hangar you want to take a chance whats going to happen here wont take long and then its about ten minutes to the hotel britton looked at the driving rain and said i think ill wait while this was going on castillo was more than a little aware that special agent schneiders upper leg was pressed against his no doubt only because the seats in the mercedes traffik seemed to have been designed for midgets finally everyone was aboard castillo stood up and faced the rear of the bus may i have your attention please he began and when he had it went on my name is castillo as i understand you have been informed i have been placed in charge of the american investigation into mr mastersons murder and the abduction of mrs masterson additionally i have been given responsibility for the safety of the masterson family while they are in argentina the investigation itself is being conducted by argentine authorities under the overall control of side and i think you all know what side is there was a tug on his jacket and he looked down and saw first that agent schneiders eyes were even deeper and more lovely than he had remembered and also that she was shaking her head just enough to indicate she didnt know what side was ill brief you and agent britton separately later agent schneider he said and then went on it has been decided that this investigation and any prosecution resulting from it will be done by the argentine authorities who the hell decided that special agent holtzman demanded i did and ambassador silvio concurred castillo replied and let me bring you up to speed on what else the ambassador and i have decided there will be no communication of any sort by any means with any federal agency in washington or elsewhere without the prior approval of ambassador silvio or myself i want that clearly understood are there any questions about it an agent in the back said you mean i cant call my wife and tell her i got down here all right you can call anyone you wish as long as there is no reference to the situation here clear there were murmurs nothing is going to happen tonight special agent yung will take you to your hotel and get you fed et cetera in the morning i will inform him or you agent holtzman your call where you can meet with the argentine authorities they have agreed to make you privy to what they have learned so far but i want it kept in mind this is their investigation and things will be done their way were here to help thats all so far as interviewing mrs masterson is concerned for a number of reasons including that she was drugged by her abductors and is still in the hospital unless there is some overriding reason for the fbi to question her all interviews of her will be conducted by special agent santini of the secret service and special agent schneider if she is interviewed by the fbi it will be in the presence of one of them or of mr alex darby whos he holtzman asked hes the commercial attache of the embassy he has the complete confidence of the ambassador mrs masterson and myself what the hell are we doing down here then if we cant even youre here agent holtzman castillo interrupted for the same reason i am the president has ordered it may i ask a question sir a man in an air force flight suit with the insignia of command pilot and the silver leaf of a lieutenant colonel asked i wonder how long it will be before yung confides in the lieutenant colonel that the hotshot in charge is really a lowly army major yes sir of course how long are you going to need the c ill be able to answer that better in the morning colonel after i get my orders thats the best i can give you right now fine hows the security here that platoon of men in the brown uniformsthe ones with the submachine gunswill guard the gulfstream colonel theyre gendarmeria national you think thats enough castillo felt the eyes of the side agents on him i have no problem with them at all colonel good enough thank you sir thats all i have ill give agent yung my cellular number in case anything comes up but please dont call it unless its really necessary ive been up since half past six and i want to go to bed ill bet special agent yung said softly with a knowing smile you sonofabitch you have that list of names for me agent yung castillo asked smiling at him warmly three the rain if anything was heavier and castillo thought that if the gulfstream had come in ten minutes later there would have been a real problem where other than ezeiza was the alternate field and how much fuel was remaining it was a long flight nonstop from andrews sergeant roger markham got himself soaking wet first getting into the bus from the bmw and then now armed with a description of it getting betty and jacks luggage from the other bus into the bmw bettys umbrella was blown inside out as she ran for the bmwcastillo wondered how she had managed to hang on to it at alland she was soaked too when castillo and britton made their dash from the bus to the bmw britton got in the front seat i didnt elbow jack out of the way this time the fickle finger of fate got me the backseat next to her hey stop an officer and a gentleman does not make passes at his subordinates for christs sake remember that major castillo smiled at special agent schneider she appeared to be shivering cold schneider he asked freezing she admitted what is it winter down here yes it is they should have told you here let me give you my jacket the first duty of an officer is to take care of his men and thats what she is one of your men remember that thanks she said it was a tenminute drive from the airport to the four seasons halfway there the rain seemed to slacken by the time they rolled up to the four seasons it had stopped completely bellmen appeared and took care of the luggage roger are you hungry castillo asked no s no im not go home get a hot shower and be here at half past seven sergeant markham nodded and got back in the car very nice jack britton said about the hotel i didnt want him to catch pneumonia castillo said gesturing at the departing bmw whos he special agent schneider asked one of the marine guards i noticed the haircut she said so we dont have wheels to go out to a restaurant can we go inside please special agent schneider said its cold out here sorry he said and motioned her ahead of him through the door he saw that water was dripping from the hem of her skirt onto the polished marble floor she found her way to the reception desk by herself and they handed her her key so about dinner castillo said its midnight is anything open jack britton interrupted this is argentina they go to dinner starting at ten castillo said theres the hotel restaurant i dont want to get dressed up enough to go to a restaurant britton said you betty i want to get out of these clothes special agent schneider said triggering mental images in major castillos mind and into a hot shower she concluded triggering additional mental images but im starved what about room service britton asked sure is that what you want to do are the rooms big enough for all three of us to have dinner special agent schneider asked i dont like to eat sitting on a bed mine is castillo said why dont we do that britton asked could you order dinner for us while we shower neither of us speaks spanish that well what do you want anything as long as its warm and comes with a double jack daniels he said special agent schneider laughed and got onto the elevator make that two she said and handed castillo his jacket major castillo happened to notice that with the jacket no longer covering her special agent schneiders rainsoaked dress now clung to her body like a coat of varnish he averted his eyes im in fifteenhundred he announced as they got off the elevator at the far end of the corridor ill order us something to eat the elevator triggered a memory of howard kennedy shit i didnt call him with the names he felt in his jacket for the sheet of lined paper yung had given him it was soaked but it was legible he carefully laid the soggy sheet of paper on the glasstopped coffee table in the sitting room then went into his bedroom and stripped off his clothing four years of practicing west point class personal hygiene or how to take a shower in no time at allpaid off five minutes after entering his bedroom he came out of it showered and dressed in slacks and a shirt first he called room service and ordered dinner plus a bottle of jack daniels and after a moments thought a bottle of famous grouse and two bottles of senetin cabernet sauvignon he had shared a bottle of that with ambassador silvio at lunch and as the ambassador had said it was really first class then he called the valet and told him he had a soaking wet suit that he absolutely had to have dried and pressed and back by sixthirty in the morning that posed no problem for the valet which made castillo suspect the drying and pressing service of the four seasons was probably going to cost as much as the suit had when hed bought it at the annual brooks brothers sale at thirtyfive percent off the tag price finally he sat down on the couch and punched kennedys autodial button on his cellular they could barely hear each other which was explained when kennedy said hed never seen so much goddamn rain in his life the rainstorm had apparently moved the fifteen miles or so between jorge newbery and aeropuerto internacional ministro pistarini de ezeiza and was interfering with the cellular signals he was down to the last name on the list of fbi agentshed had to spell each one phonetically sometimes twicewhen the doorbell chimes bonged when he opened it special agent schneider a lady who was probably from the valet service and a man in a bartenders white jacket pushing a rolling table with the whiskey wine and the accoutrements were standing there special agent schneider was wearing blue jeans and a sweater her hair looked damp he motioned them all into the room fix yourself a drink he said foods on the way he signed the bill for the drinks then motioned the lady from the valet service into the bedroom and pointed out the waterlogged suit to her all of this while simultaneously spelling daniel t westerlys name phonetically to howard kennedy for the third or fourth time and being very much aware that special agent schneider filled out both her sweater and her blue jeans in an incredibly delightful way she wasnt wearing makeup not even lipstick and castillo thought she looked fine without it kennedy finally could hear westerlys name spelled out phonetically westerly okay hes a fingerprint guy damned good at it too he once lifted two eightpoint digits from a used condom thats it howard thats the last of the names all of them are on the major crimes team should any of them be of special interest to me no yungs the one who interests me watch yourself with him charley i will and you will inquire about mr lorimer for me right just as soon as you get where youre going the way its raining charley i may never get out of here thats twono foursentences that came through intact howard i like you im going to make the rain stop what trust me howard in ten minutes fifteen tops it will stop raining i have issued the order have a nice flight and remember to call he pushed the end button and laid down the cellular what was that all about special agent schneider asked not that im not delighted to see you but i thought women took longer to shower and dress than men that means youre not going to tell me right betty replied to answer the second question jacks calling his wife you really dont want to know castillo said she raised her glass of bourbon youre not drinking im going to have the wine on your good behavior are you yes maam this quote room unquote looks like a set for a movie she said and mines not exactly a slum either the whole bathroom is marble which raises the question how do we pay for all this wait until you see the view he said and went to the windows and found the switch for the opening mechanism thats beautiful she said and walked and stood beside him but it doesnt answer the question about the bill when we get back to washington agnesmrs forbison who runs things in the nebraska complex will show you how to fill out the forms for travel expenses outside the country when you get the check sign it over to me what i think that means is that you intend to pick up the difference between what the secret service will pay and what you will i wanted to keep you and jack separate from the fbi castillo said this is the only answer i could come up with on short notice the chimes bonged again this time it was jack britton and two waiters pushing two roomservice carts loaded with food covered by stainlesssteel domes britton was wearing a sports jacket slacks and a shirt and tie i thought you didnt want to get dressed up for dinner castillo said i changed my mind when i saw my room do you always live this good whenever i can fix yourself a drink jack and as soon as theyve set up the food ill tell you whats going on just out of idle curiosity what does this place cost by the night i really have no idea castillo said why am i not surprised betty said and there was an unpleasant sarcastic tone in her voice i really dont know how this works in the secret service castillo said but i dont think the presidential protection detail people stay in the economy motel ten blocks from where the president is staying to save the government money i intend to find out i dont want to spend my money to buy things ive bought to carry out what ive been ordered to do the government is not on my list of favorite charities britton nodded i wanted to keep you two away from the fbi castillo said they dont like you much either britton said i picked that up on the airplane castillo found an excuse not to get into that when he saw one of the waiters opening a bottle of the cabernet ill do that thank you he said in spanish and well serve ourselves by the time castillo had finished relating what had happened and why he had asked that they be sent to argentina and what he expected of them they had finished what had turned out to be an enormous meal and as they talked castillo had the feeling that his moral dilemma had solved itself special agent schneider was in fact a cop and a smart one and this was business not romantic fantasy and there was no question in his mind that if he made the first preliminary pass at schneider she would turn it down gently and kindly probably because schneider was a good guy but turn it down and it was after two am lets knock it off he said i want to get started early in the morning you want to eat herewe may think of something we missedor do you want to meet in the restaurant downstairs at say quarter to seven if you dont mind here special agent schneider said for personal reasons i want to look out your windows in the daylight okay here at quarter to seven britton said my ass is dragging he got up from the table and walked to the door special agent schneider followed both waved a goodnight but neither said anything three minutes after they had gone castillo was in bed and thenhe had no idea how much laterthe door chimes bonged oh shit the floor waiter wants to get the goddamn dishes not quite knowing why he did so he picked up the beretta from the bedside table and held it behind his back as he stormed out of the bedroom and across the sitting room to the door and jerked it open special agent schneider was standing in the corridor i seem to have dropped my handkerchief she said he didnt reply may i come in he stepped out of the way i thought it was the floor waiter he said were you going to shoot him special agent schneider asked he held up both handsone of them holding the berettahelplessly she walked to the table and poured wine into a glass im not sure this is a very good idea he said she walked to him and handed him the glass and smiled there stands the legendary charley castillo in his underwear with a gun in one hand and a glass of wine in the other she said and shook her head and then went back to the table and poured another glass of wine with her back to him she said i thought of you all the way down here on the airplane i thought of you at other times of course but i thought of you all the goddamned time i was on the airplane castillo saw her take a healthy swallow of the cabernet one of the things i thought about she went on speaking softly was how i was going to handle the pass the man whose secret service code name is don juan was certainly going to make at me i wouldnt dare make a pass at you castillo said jocularly not only would your brother break both my legs let me finish please charley she interrupted firmly sorry i had to be very careful so as not to hurt your feelingswhich i didnt want to door to piss you off because you might get your masculine ego in an uproar and do something crappy and screw me up with the secret service from what ive seen so far i like the secret service and when i took the appointment i burned my bridges with the department in philadelphia christ i wouldnt goddamn you charley let me finish she turned to glare at him he nodded and she turned her back to him again she took another swallow of the cabernet shook her head and went on so then what happened was that you didnt make a pass at me and my initial reaction to that was thank god and then i realized that you were being responsible you were being the upstanding guy who would never make a pass at somebody who worked for him and my reaction to that was what the hell is the difference hes not going to make a pass at you so thats it relax and then when i left here and i saw you sitting at the table i thought thats the loneliest guy in the world and then i got in bed and faced the facts the truth which is he asked softly that what i really wanted to do was come back she said and turned her head to look at him and then quickly looked away he didnt move or say anything which obviously was a pretty dumb thing she said sorry she turned and walked quickly toward the door he caught her arm and she tried to break loose but he held on what she asked i dont think youve been out of my mind for more than thirty consecutive minutes since the last time i saw you in philadelphia she turned to face him and looked up into his eyes oh jesus charley oh jesus presidential agent castillo said to special agent schneider he had just rolled onto his back breathing heavily and put his arm over his eyes yeah betty said after a moment she shifted around on the bed so that she could rest her head on his chest he put his arm around her and ran the balls of his fingers gently up and down her spine what happens now charley asked your brother comes in and breaks both my legs well hed have no trouble finding us betty said we left a trail of my clothes from the living room into here he chuckled what are you thinking now charley i knew all along shed be easy worse than that i thinkignore thati know im in love with you youre under no obligation to say something like that ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free castillo quoted i think john lennon said that she tweaked his nipple thats from the bible she said chuckling well well what no response in other words are my feelings for you reciprocated partially reciprocated or reciprocated not at all she raised her head and looked down at him my god couldnt you tell she asked then you want me to say it dont you he nodded okay i love you i guess i knew that when i walked into counterterrorism and saw the guy whod thought i was a hooker in the warwick bar and my heart jumped oh boy four the buenos aires herald azopardo buenos aires argentina july at almost exactly this timealthough neither of them cared a whit what hour it was or even what day as charley reached down to pull betty onto hima small white fiat van pulled away from the loading dock at the buenos aires herald building in downtown buenos aires it drove to the austral air cargo building at jorge newbery airfield where the driver handed over approximately six hundred copies of the herald so fresh from the press that the ink had not had time to completely dry the newspapers were tied together in sixteen packages each with a simple address most were in fiftycopy packages but some of the packages contained far fewerin three instances only five the austral people put all of them into three large blue plastic shipping containers and then put the containers on a baggage cart after all other cargo and passenger luggage had been loaded aboard austral flight the containers would be loaded aboardlast on first off flight would depart jorge newbery at and land in montevideo twentyfive minutes later the blue plastic containers would be offloaded first and turned over to a representative of the herald who would arrange for their further distribution he would load two hundred copies in his car they were destined for downtown montevideo and for carrasco a suburb through which he would pass on his way downtown the others he took to the airports bus terminal where they were stacked according to their destination the route stack would be placed aboard the first morning bus to san carlos maldonado and punta del este the posh seaside resort on the atlantic ocean the route stack would see stacks of the newspaper dropped off at treinta y tres melo and jaguarao the route bus would drop off newspapers at canelones florida and then continue across the dam holding back the lago artificial de rincon del bonete to tacuarembo where it would drop off the last stack there were just three copies of the herald in the last stack the manager of the tacuarembo bus terminalhe was paid to do sowould then telephone the manager of a remote estancia to tell him the herald had arrived sometimes it didntthings happenedand telephoning the estancia manager to tell him that the newspapers had or had not arrived saved the manager an hourlong ride down an unpaved highway all of this took time of course and it was almost three in the afternoon before the herald was delivered to estancia shangrila and another half hour before it was in the hands of el patron who was taking an afternoon siesta with juanita a sixteenyearold maid jeanpaul lorimer sitting up in bed read the frontpage banner headline with dismay and muttered merde the banner headline read american diplomat murdered in port area and showed a photograph of the late j winslow masterson lorimer was of course disturbed and at first frightened jack was after all his brotherinlaw and this had to be very difficult on poor betsy but there was no reason to judge from the heralds rather extensive coverage of the matter for jeanpaul lorimer to think it had anything to do with him jack and his family had been ripe for something like this to happen for years ever since he had been given that obscenely generous payment for being run over by the beer truck and argentina certainly was the place for it to have happened kidnapping there had replaced schools that taught english as the national cottage industry he would notcould notallow what had happened to jack to force him to change his plans all this really meant was that it would soon be discovered that jeanpaul lorimer was missing in parisand that might have already happened if he called betsy to express his condolences even if he didnt tell her where he was calling from that would mean that although he had been missing since the thirteenth of julyin other words for ten dayshed been alive on the twentythird that didnt even get into the matter of traceable telephone records which would locate him and his expression of condolences would after all be hypocritical i never liked the arrogant sonofabitch and am not at all sorry that he got knocked off his high horse with two bullets in the brain there was even an upside to this the attention by the press would be to the murder of jack the stack masterson who despite his phi beta kappa key didnt have enough brains to get out of the way of a beer truck and no one would pay much if any attention to the disappearance of his brotherinlaw in france he dropped the herald onto the floor beside the bed and turned to maria del juanita darling put some clothes on and tell senora sanchez i will have my coffee in the library viii one el presidente de la rua suite the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july a full minute after special agent jack britton lifted the brass knocker on the door of suite which was actually a switch triggering the door chimesmajor c g castillo pulled the door open to him castillo was wearing a plush white anklelength terry cloth robe adorned with the crest of the four seasons hotel he needed a shave his hair wasnt combed and it wasnt wet either britton thought i got here even before he got into the shower then said schneiders not up yet either or shes in the shower she didnt answer when i knocked but your driver is they put him through to me by mistake i told him id tell you he was here come on in jack castillo said were running a little late they havent even taken the dishes away from last night castillo walked to the telephone on the coffee table punched a number and in spanish asked the concierge to send up his driver with copies of la nacion clarin and the herald to check on his suit with the valet and to immediately send up two large pots of coffee britton listened and watched intently trying to understand what was being said and then his interest really perked up the bedroom door opened and special agent schneider came out dressed as she had been the night before in blue jeans and a sweater good morning jack she said matteroffactly she had her voice under control but not her blush mechanism if youre going to order breakfast she said order a big one for me she then walked out of the el presidente de la rua suite calling over her shoulder i wont be long the door closed and britton and castillo looked at each other i think jack castillo said finally that this is one of those times when silence would be golden britton nodded then said sorry i have to say this from the way you looked at her just now i could tell that youre not fooling around with her that its something more serious so good for you i know shes nuts about you how the hell could you know that when we were in gman school the subject of our conversations always seemed to wind up with you and the proof came last night when we were eating both of you looked at everything but each other and then just now the two of you looked like adam and eve in the garden before eve started fooling around with the snake shes a good lady youre lucky because he could think of nothing else to say castillo asked is that what you call it gman school yeah actually it wasnt too bad he grinned betty was a laugh when they finally put us on the range she had kept her mouth shut and her face straight when they were explaining how to squeeze the trigger and telling her not to let the recoil throw her after a while shed get used to it but i could tell she didnt like being patronized anyway there we are on the pistol range two lowly candidates and the instructor im standing behind her so she gets the open fire order and her glock sounds like an uzi this was timed fire candidate schneider one aimed shot at a time thats what i did sir schneider says all sweet and feminine i aimed each time sir well the instructor adds as you will see youll never hit anything firing that rapidly roll back number seven so they rolled the target back to us and shed put all fourteen rounds into the bad guys face the instructor didnt like being duped but couldnt let it go it would seem candidate schneider that you have had some previous marksmanship experience if youre trying to make me look foolish or whatever it wont work castillo chuckled the door chimes went off it was the lady from the valet service with castillos suit theres a roomservice menu in the drawer of that desk castillo said and pointed when roger gets up here find out what he wants and then order for everybody im going to get dressed two special agent schneider sat across the breakfast table from major castillo which position precluded major castillo from surreptitiously holding her handor perhaps touching her kneebeneath the table but did not he soon learned prohibit special agent schneider from rubbing the ball of her foot against his calf they were almost finished eating when the chimes sounded again roger markham rushed to the door and castillo was wondering what the hell it could be now when he heard a familiar voice youre american right maybe a marine yes sir markham replied go back in there throw major castillo and whoevers with him out of bed and tell him colonel jake torine usaf wishes a moment of his valuable time castillo laughing started to get out of his chair as he did he saw from special agent schneiders face that she failed to see what was amusing colonel torine a tall somewhat bony man in a sports jacket and slacks marched into the sitting room and saw the people at the table in the dining alcove oops he said sorry charley i didnt know you had people in here good morning sir castillo said i should have contacted you last night no its the other way around i should have reported to you when we got in last night those were my orders from general allan naylor himself but it was late and raining like hell and i figured id wait until morning the defense attache told me where i could find you great castillo began torine silenced him with an upraised palm and went on then i got here and the hotel had never heard of you so i stood there in the lobby for a couple of minutes wondering why the attache had sent me to the wrong hotel and then i decided that there are two four seasons hotels and i was in the wrong one so i went back to the desk and asked the guy where the other one was castillo laughed at that point i remembered your alter ego asked for herr gossinger and here i am castillo saw from their faces that betty had some idea what was going on and jack britton and roger markham none at all guys i sometimes use the name gossinger when im working he explained thats how im registered here britton who had worked deep undercover for years as ali abid arraziq nodded his understanding roger markhams face registered what could have been awe my god hes a real intel operator with a phony id and all colonel castillo said remember when the philadelphia cops turned up the intel that the guy who owned our had sold another one to costa rica oh yeah there they are charley said no britton said there she is betty put that together i had nothing to do with it betty schneider and jack britton now of the secret service castillo went on this is colonel jake torine who flew the home from costa rica they shook hands no i havent had breakfast and yes thank you i could eat a bite torine said i dont know how warm it still is castillo said liftinga stainlesssteel dome and revealing a pile of stillsteaming scrambled eggs warm enough torine said and sat down he started spooning eggs onto a plate so whats going on charley torine asked castillo handed him the buenos aires herald this is whats been given out he said most of its pretty accurate ill fill you in on whats not torine took the newspaper and started to read shaking his head as he swallowed his last bite of breakfast torine handed the herald back to castillo theres an editorial too castillo said headlined the nation is shamed should they be torine asked embarrassed sure castillo said a diplomats wife is kidnapped and then the diplomat gets blown away thats not supposed to happen in a civilized nation this isnt the congo but shamed is a little strong and god knows they got their act in high gear the minute this happened to find out who did it what we think happened is that mrs mastersons kidnappers got in touch with him set up a meeting and he sneaked out of his house and went to meet them and got himself blown away werent they watching the house torine asked incredulously they had cops and side agentsyou know what side is torine nodded so not only cops and side agents all over the place but sitting in a car in front of his house at two in the morning when masterson sneaked out was a cia spook named paul sieno and colonel alfredo munz the head of side you think masterson went to pay the ransom and something went wrong i just dont know all i know is that alex darby the station chief sienogood guy i knew him in afghanistan his cover is commercial attache and alex says hes his best manand munz did the best they know how to make sure something like this didnt happen and it did i should throw in that masterson was darbys best friend jesus what the hell is this all about i wish to hell i knew castillo said and one more thing colonel these bastards have something on mrs mastersonmaybe a threat to kill the kids maybe something elsethats got her terrified thats understandable isnt it surrounded by the embassys security people plus the cia the secret service and side youd think shed feel protected enough to at least come up with a description of who grabbed her castillo said if we are to believe her and i dont she doesnt remember anything thats one of the reasons i had them send betty down hereone of them anywayto see if she can get close to her and come up with something special agent schneiders mind apparently ran on a parallel path with one of them anyway castillo felt the ball of her foot on his calf again and when he looked at her there was a hint of a smile on her lips and a naughty look in her eyes the one question in my mind ever since i heard about this was whether it is terroristconnected torine said if it had just been assassinating masterson maybe but if terrorists did it they would have been boasting about it an hour after it happened and i dont think they would have passed up the opportunity to kill mrs masterson when they had the chance torine nodded his understanding so what happens now he asked we get her and the children out of argentina just as soon as we can get her on your airplane have you got approach charts for keesler air force base of course why keesler mrs masterson wants him buried in mississippi thats where hes from the mississippi gulf coast general naylor told me the president wants mr masterson buried in arlington its her call isnt it obviously when do you think shell be ready to leave i thinkthink dont knowthat theyre going to release her from the hospital this morning if i had my way shed go directly from the hospital to the airport but i doubt thats going to happen maybe late tonight which would put us into keesler in the morning but probably sometime tomorrow the defense attache told me the argentines want to put the casket in the catedral metropolitana so they can pay their respects torine said whats that i hadnt heard that castillo replied and i have no idea its like their national cathedral sergeant roger markham furnished not far from the casa rosada which is like their white house except its pink the casa rosada i mean the cathedral looks like what the parthenon must have looked like before it fell down marble i think the marines to the rescue castillo said keep going roger well its their bigtime church san martinthat general they call the great liberator he was a pal of thomas jefferson avenida libertador is really named after him like if we named washington square father of our country square fascinating colonel torine said managing to keep a straight face they guard his tomb inside like we do the unknown soldier twentyfourseven if they want to put mr mastersons body in there its really an honor youre right roger and i can see why theyd want to do it but i dont know how thats going to go down with mrs masterson not to mention my orders to get her and the kids out of here as quickly as possible he looked at torine what were going to do now is go to the hospital and introduce betty and jack to her i told you shes frightened it might be useful if you went along if youd be willing tell her the travel plans you know whatever might make her feel better you dont have to ask charley colonel torine said about that or anything else general naylor didnt like it much i dont think but he made it very clear that youre running this exercise i hear a cell phone ringing betty announced castillo patted his clothing as he remembered his was in the bedroom then quickly got up and went to get it that took some time as it was in the pocket of the pants he had been wearing when betty had come looking for her lost handkerchief and had been kicked out of sight when jack britton had rung the door chimes as had castillo learned when he reached under the bed for them bettys brassiere and underpants that means when she walked out of here she wasnt wearing anything under her blue jeans and sweater a series of mental images flooded his mind goddammit whats the matter with you answer the goddamn cellular by the time hed gotten the telephone from his pocket it was too late the phone however had captured the callers number he pushed the missed call key then the dial key sylvia grunblatt the embassy public information officer what the hell does she want c g castillo ms grunblatt were you trying to reach me where are you not that its any of your business but im in the four seasons according to them they dont have anybody named castillo registered you want to tell me what thats all about howd you get my cellular number ambassador silvio gave it to me how can i help you ms grunblatt the shoes on the other foot the press is onto you somebody around here has a big mouth you want to explain that the new york times guy wants to know about the presidents agent starting with his name and so do cnn and ap and la nacion ad infinitum what do i tell them you have no idea what theyre talking about theyre not going to believe that and theyre not going to like it ambassador silvio told me youre a firstclass press officer youll think of something i can hear them now she said are you trying to tell me sylvia that my source was lying to me to which you respond i cannot vouch for your unnamed sources i can only tell you what i have been told to which they will respond oh bovine excreta sylvia or words to that effect sylvia im sorry but your splendid relations with the press are going to have to be sacrificed for operational requirements i was afraid of that she said the ambassador said i was to handle this any way you wanted the one thing i dont need is my name picture or the words presidential agent in the newspapers or on the tube okay you got it but be warned theyll be looking for you since there arewith one exceptionno other developments in the story youthe presidents agent are the story whats the one exception presuming the ambassador can get mrs masterson to go alonghe hasnt asked her yetthe argentines want to pin the grand cross of the great liberator on jacks casket which at the time will be lying in state in the catedral metropolitana if she goes alongand she might not if i were her i think id tell the argentines to go piss up a ropethat will be a spectacle the press especially tvlikes spectacles and that may get some of the heat off you i was about to go to the german hospital castillo said you got somebody from side with you who can get you in the back door otherwise be prepared for celebrity how will they know what i look like the leak about the presidents agent was intentional i think it follows they would have also leaked a description you have any idea who the leaker is if i had to bet id bet it was one of the law enforcement types yeah castillo thought and ill bet the bastards name is yung but nothing more specific than that if i can get the name you want it indeed i do i was hoping you would why because i ran out of imagination after i thought castration would be a suitable punishment for the sonofabitch and im sure you can think of something more exquisitely painful indeed i can stay in touch please mr x thanks sylvia castillo put the cellular in his trousers pocket whereupon it immediately rang again now what the hell does she want yes sylvia actually this is juan silvio good morning sir before i get into this i presume ms grunblatt did get in touch with you yes sir i just got off the line with her i guess she told you theres been a leak yes sir im sorry id really like to know who did it so would i did sylvia also tell you the argentine government wants to honor mr masterson both by having him lie in state in the cathedral and by posthumously decorating him with the grand cross of the great liberator yes sir i didnt think i had the right to agree to either without talking to both you and mrs masterson and i think we should talk this over before i broach the subject to her sir i was just about to go to the hospital i want to introduce special agent schneider to mrs masterson shes the female agent i asked be sent down here and i have colonel torine who flew the c down here with me i thought he might be able to reassure mrs masterson about the travel arrangements which brings up something else sir colonel torine informed me the president wants to inter mr masterson at arlington and all of which suggests that we should talk and not on the telephone as soon as possible im at your disposal sir since we both are going to the hospital why not there im sure we could find someplace there to talk you tell me when and where sir the hospital in thirty thirtyfive minutes can you do that ill see you there sir thank you castillo broke the connection looked at the cellular for a moment and then pushed an autodial button si alfredo si karl alfredo i need a service whatever i can do karl im on my way to the german hospital someone at the american embassy not only got the crazy idea that there is some sort of white house agent down here and that i am that agent but he told the press herr gossinger you mean probably castillo anyway i understand that the press is all over the hospital then my friend i suggest you stay away from the hospital i have to see mrs masterson and the ambassadors going to meet me there there was just a moments hesitation youre at the four seasons right yes you have an embassy car right i have a car in the basement garage the embassy car is there very well go to the basement and get in your car my man will make himself known to you follow him to the hospital i will arrange for you to enter via their service basement thank you when you finish your business with mrs mastersoni presume you heard about the lying in state and the decoration im not sure mrs masterson wants to go along with that thats one of the reasons i have to see her may i ask the others i want to introduce her to the female agent i had sent from washington and i want to confirm her travel plans and if youre going to be there i want to introduce the other secret service agent to you ill see you here shortly then youre at the hospital i thought your security man would like to hear our security plans for the catedral metropolitana and so would i id also like a look at the place ill see you here then shortly was that tone of voice a yeah sure or an i dont know about that thank you alfredo three the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july the embassy bmw had been crowded colonel torine had claimed the front passenger seat because of his long legs special agent schneider rode in the middle of the backseat between castillo and britton while special agent schneiders right calf did come in contact with that of castillo what he had been most aware of was something hard and sharpedged pressing against his lower left rib cage he endured the discomfort deciding that saying schneider your glock is stabbing me in the ribs would not only provoke mirth from the other passengers but probably result in betty sitting so far away from him that the calftocalf contact would be lost the side cartwo burly men in a peugeothad taken a fairly circuitous route from the four seasons and had turned off avenida pueyrredon two blocks before they had reached the german hospital as they followed castillo could see that the street and sidewalk at the hospital were crowded with television vans with satellite link dishes and journalists of one kind or another festooned with microphones and still and video cameras the side car led them to the basement of the hospital past doors that opened as they approached and closed the moment they were inside gendarmeria national troops guarding the elevator passed them through somewhat reluctantly and only after the side agents had vouched for them the corridor outside mrs mastersons room was crowded with more uniformed and plainclothes security personnel argentine and american and the walls were lined with floral displays two of themthe ones on each side of the doorwere enormous is mr santini in there castillo asked one of the americans he didnt know his name but he had been in the brainstorming session yes sir would you tell him im here please the man went into the room and castillo bent over the largest of the floral displays to get a look at the card i wonder if anyone took a look at this to make sure it wont blow up of course they did munz wouldnt let it into the building much less up here without checking the card was impressive it had a goldembossed representation of the seal of the republic of argentina at the top under which it had the name of the president the message was handwritten with my profound condolences for your loss and my prayers for your rapid recovery just as santini came through the door charley looked at the card on the other floral display this one carried the gold seal of the foreign minister who also offered his condolences and prayers can i read anything of significance in them being outside her room instead of inside good morning santini said and then saw colonel torine and jack britton and betty schneider this is colonel torine whos flying the c castillo said and special agents britton and schneider santini smiled at betty schneider did you really put all fourteen rounds in the bad guys face he asked thirteen betty said one went in his ear you have an admirer in joel isaacson santini said he told me when this business is over i think theyre going to want you on the protection detail when this business is over tony special agent schneider is going to give all this fun up and come live with me in a rosecovered cottage by the side of the road or maybe on the ranch in midland i wonder if shes ever been on a horse santini shook brittons and torines hands and then gesturing down the corridor said come on they gave me a room to use the ambassadors waiting for you castillo wondered about the security of the room and looked with a raised eyebrow at santini when charley mouthed swept santini blinked once slowly and made a slight nod you must be miss schneider ambassador silvio said offering his hand with a smile yes sir im very glad youre here mrs masterson will probably be delighted to see a feminine face in the sea of men around her lets hope so sir betty said you all might as well hear this silvio said im torn between my sense of duty as a diplomat and my personal feelings the argentines are determined to go ahead with this business of having mr mastersons casket lying in state in the catedral metropolitana and awarding him the medalthe grand cross of the great liberator officially i am delighted personally and not only because i knew jack well enough to know that his reaction would be a medal for what getting shot i wish the argentines hadnt had the idea i also dont like the idea of exposing mrs masterson and the children to any possible danger colonel munz assures me sir santini said that the level of protection being established at the cathedral will be as good if not better than that provided to the president i almost asked him when was the last time someone took a shot at his president then realized that with the countrys economy still in dire straits there likely have been some serious threats the bottom line sir is that i really cant fault munzs plans and ill be with her and special agent schneider and some other of our people and the government would beperhaps understandablyupset if i just told them thank you but no thank you silvio said and then looked at castillo charley sir isnt it her call castillo asked if she doesnt want to go to the cathedral we can say truthfully that shes just too griefstricken i think the argentines would understand that you mean have the casket lie in state but not have mrs masterson participate in the decoration ceremony yes sir thats a good thought sir id like to get the mastersons out of the country as soon as possible when are they going to let her leave here she can leave anytime santini answered they did another blood workup first thing this morning shes clean when do the argentines want to start the show castillo asked they want to move the body to the cathedral this afternoon silvio said then they will permit the public to pay its respects from six until ten tonight and from eight to ten in the morning theyre going to provide an honor guard and ive asked the marines to be ready to do the same theyve scheduled the award ceremony for ten starting with a mass which will be celebrated by the papal nuncio fortunately jack was a roman catholic as opposed to being a southern baptist you mean santini said and immediately added i didnt mean to be flippant if jack had been a southern baptist or jewish or a mormon the ambassador said that probably would pose a problem hows the security at her house castillo asked i went out there in the wee hours santini replied it looked fine to me and if she leaves the hospital in say an hour how long is it going to take to set up a secure motorcade munz says give him thirty minutes notice he has people standing by will the motorcade be secure ambassador silvio asked actually sir there will be three motorcades santini said each consisting of a gendarmeria national lead car followed by a policia federal car followed by two armored embassy cars with blackedout windows followed by another policia federal car and an ambulance and a gendarmeria chase car they will go to the house in san isidro by three different routes the embassy cars will have security personnel in both mrs masterson will be in one of them which one castillo asked ill decide that just before we leave the hospital santini said castillo had just thought that threemotorcade business is really clever thank god santini really knows how to handle things like this when the ambassador asked sound good to you charley which brought on the sobering realization jesus christ santini may be good but this is my responsibility it sounds fine to me sir castillo said well lets go see how mrs masterson feels about all this ambassador silvio said as charley says its her call no castillo thought its not its mine i have both the responsibility for her safety and the authority to say no way are we going to put her in the line of fire again i dont care if the argentines like it or not the rolldown metal shutters over the windows of elizabeth mastersons room were closed the fluorescent lights in the room were harsh she was sitting in an armchair wearing a dressing gown the ashtray on the small table beside her was full of butts most of them were long as if shed taken just a few puffs before putting them out good morning betsy ambassador silvio said taking the dirty ashtray from the table and handing it to one of the guards at the door with the unspoken order to bring a clean one how are you how would you suppose i am mr ambassador she asked sarcastically i hoped i was juan to you betsy silvio said you remember mr castillo from yesterday good morning castillo said she acknowledged his presence with a slight inclination of her head and the faintest of smiles yesterday she looked sick today she looks bitter and more than a little wary she obviously would prefer that i not be here what the hell is she hiding mrs masterson castillo said this is special agent schneider of the secret service if you have no objection shell be with you and the children hello mrs masterson said with a smile that looked genuine she put out her hand im very sorry about your husband mrs masterson special agent schneider said thank you would you be offended what do i call you betty would be fine maam would you be offended betty if i said youre not what comes to mind when you hear secret service not at all betsy masterson turned to silvio i heard a doctor tell a nursei guess they think i dont speak spanishsomething about a ceremony at the catedral metropolitana whats that all about actually its the reason im here betsy silvio replied what the argentine government wants to do is to place jacks casket in the cathedralto have him lie in state in other words with an honor guardlet the public pay their respects tonight and tomorrow morning and then in connection with a memorial mass to be celebrated by the papal nuncio to award jack the grand cross of the great liberator either the president or the foreign ministerprobably the presidentwill do that its quite an honor jack didnt like either one of them she said then immediately added i shouldnt have said that you can say anything you want to say silvio said am i expected to participate in this all you would have to do is be there and thats entirely up to you betsy mr castillo and i are agreed that its your decision the entire diplomatic corps will be there in other words it would be what jack would call a command performance she asked but it was a statement not a question jack had a good many friends in the diplomatic corps silvio said when jack thought it was in the interests of the united states he could make the devil himself think they were close friends she said thats true silvio said with a smile jack would want me to participate in something like this so okay to repeat myself betsy thats entirely up to you not really she said my father would not understand my not participating its always been duty first with him too he used to sayand i dont think he was jokingthat a diplomat should be like a jesuit priest who gives up his personal life and comfort to serve something far more important and we both know jack went along with that notion which brings me to my family have they been told whats happened i spoke with ambassador lorimer shortly after i saw you yesterday silvio said i didnt get into your abduction just what happened to jack what exactly did you tell him that jack had been assassinated by parties unknown silvio said im aware of ambassador lorimers physical condition that was the right thing to do thank you he wanted to telephone but i told himi guess this is a diplomatic obfuscation i really believed it was in a good causethat you had been sedated and it probably would be best to wait until you felt yourself again at which time you would call him again juan that was the right thing to do and thank you again well i feel myself again when do i get out of here an hour after you say the word mrs masterson castillo said it will take us about that long to arrange your transportation she looked at him and not with gratitude i dont think ive done anything to annoy herexcept maybe being an intruder into the diplomatic communityso that leaves her being afraid of me what the hell is that all about and how come her brother the un diplomatjeanpaul lorimerwasnt in the conversation she didnt ask if hed been notified and he wasnt mentioned in that diplomatic holy orders speech she gave whats the word she asked almost belligerently i want to get out of here and be with my children you just said it mrs lorimer ill tell mr santini to get things rolling good mrs masterson castillo went on colonel torine the pilot of the cthe globemaster iii that the president sent down hereis outside i thought perhaps he could tell you about whats planned to get you and the children out of here and back to the states and that you could tell him what you require she looked at him and nodded then turned to betty schneider would my children be safe at the ceremony in the cathedral the head of side mrs masterson castillo began if you dont mind mr castillo i asked her excuse me betty exchanged a glance with charley who nodded and turned to mrs masterson mr santini and mr castillo are better equipped to answer that mrs masterson than i am still id like to hear what you think please betty nodded and then after a justperceptible hesitation said the secret service is pretty good at protecting people mrs masterson but its not perfect president reagan was shot a crazy woman shot at president ford twice let me put it this way if they were your children would you take them to the cathedral fortunately for me i dont have to make that choice and i certainly wouldnt presume to advise you what to do thank you i appreciate your honesty mrs masterson said and then looked at castillo my children and i will attend the ceremony at the cathedral i want them to have that memory of their father being honored and jackand my fatherwould see it as my duty castillo nodded and again no mention of the brother send in your colonel please mr castillo mrs masterson said id like to be able to tell my children whats the agenda castillo nodded again and left the room el coronel alfredo munz was standing in the corridor with colonel torine jack britton and tony santini she has decided to attend the ceremony with the children castillo announced and she wants to go home give me thirty minutes santini said i told her an hour castillo said which will give me a chance to take a look at her house before we send her out there everythings in place charley santini said evenly id like a fresh look myself munz said i directed some modifications to the plan well maybe that got me off the hook with santini who understandably wonders who the hell i think i am to be checking his work tony what this probably is is me covering my ass but i want to see for myself the arrangements at the house and at the cathedral castillo said your call charley and i want you to get schneider a cell phone i want the number of mine on an autodial button on it and i want the number of her phone on mine santini reached in his pocket and came out with a cellular telephone i already gave one to jack and one to colonel torine he said and if youll give me yours ill put their numbers in it castillo handed him his telephone and then looked at britton im presuming youve met colonel munz yes sir hes offered when youre finished with me here to send me to his headquarters and show me the investigation so far castillo turned to munz thank you alfredo will it be possible for us to get a copy of the investigation report of course it may take some time to get it translated you give me the report ill translate it munz nodded colonel why dont you go in there and tell mrs masterson about the travel plans when do you want to go wheelsup charley what id like to do is go directly from the cathedral to ezeiza castillo said i havent asked heror the ambassadorbut shoot for that youre not going in there with me torine asked i have the feeling shed rather i just went away castillo said but yeah just as soon as tony gives me my cellular back im going in there ive got to get you some wheels four dr jose arribena san isidro buenos aires province argentina july major c g castillo stood in the middle of the residential street in front of the mastersons property in the upscale san isidro neighborhood he pulled out his cell phone punched an autodial button and special agent schneider answered on the second ring schneider hello baby yes mr castillo i love you so i have been led to believe and vice versa that is my understanding of the situation where did you say you were sir im standing on the street in front of the masterson house and youre satisfied with the security arrangements sir id like to have a couple of abrams tanks and a couple of twentymillimeter gatlings but yeah i am since youre all business ill let you know what to expect please the whole areamaybe ten blocks on a sideis cordoned off provincial cops stop everybody trying to get in they demand identification and want to know where everyone is going then they search the car theres a second ring inside the outer one this one manned by the gendarmeria national more military than cops theyre armed with submachine guns same routine more thorough this is an upscale residential neighborhood people have to get toand out oftheir houses and the house itself sir im not finished special agent schneider sorry sir on the block the masterson house is onits in the middle of the blockthe street is blocked off with barriers cars and whatever they call those strips with steel points on them to blow tires i know what you mean sir plus more gendarmeria national and side people and our guys now the house itself sits behind an eightfoot brick wall topped with razor wire the wall completely surrounds the property in the rear there is a service roadfor deliveries garbage et cetera thats been blocked off the house is three stories masonry and all the windows except two in the attic are barred heavily barred and they dont open the front door looks like a bank vault and the rear door is steel the gates in the fence two in the front one vehicular one for people and two in the back dittoare steel decorative but heavyduty the vehicular gate in the front slides on tracks when a switch inside the front door is pushed the one in the back has to be moved by hand closed its locked with a huge padlock keys kept in the kitchen the people gates are opened with a solenoid switches by the front door and in the kitchen the front and back yards are illuminated by floodlights triggered by motion sensors or they can be turned on and left on we have two of our guys and two side guys inside the house there are two telephone lines plus a dedicated line for the burglar alarm and everybody has cellulars i cant think of a thing to add except maybe the abrams tanks i mentioned that sounds pretty secure sir when are you going to leave the hospital in the next couple of minutes if you tell me you love me ill tell you where im going from here that would be very difficult at this time sir well if somebodys listening to us then why dont you say wiener schnitzel and ill understand she giggled then said wiener schnitzel and same to you love of my life where will you be sir wemunz jack and meare going from here to the cathedral after that were going to side headquarters ill call again better yet when youve got mrs masterson in her house call me yes sir and be prepared to say wiener schnitzel whatever you say sir wiener schnitzel baby five catedral metropolitana plaza de mayo buenos aires argentina july c g castillo answered his cellular telephone on the second buzz castillo schneider sir wiener schnitzel schneider that schneider yes sir i called to tell you were in the house in san isidro no problems no sir went off like clockwork ive just had a tour of the cathedral led by sergeant roger markham he dazzled colonel munz he knew more about the cathedral than munz did betty chuckled hes a really nice kid anyway no problems that i can see its right down the street from the casa rosada the cops around here have a lot of experience dealing with angry mobs and they keep a cache of barriers handy munz offered a helicopter to fly the family from the racetrackthe jockey clubin san isidro after they put the barriers up theres room to sit one down but i turned him down may i ask why sir two reasonsand you may ask me anything you want to wiener schnitzel the first isi thought you knew thisthat i am one of the bestif not the best chopper pilots in the world and i dont trust any other chopper jockey unless ive flown with him jesus charley i guess no one can hear this conversation no im in the kitchen having a cup of coffee in that case can we dispense with the wiener schnitzel nonsense and come right out with i love you charley you said there were two reasons sir and ill tell you the other one if you tell me you love me betty hesitated a moment and then said chuckling wiener schnitzel okay close enough okay what munz offered was a french alouette iii the sa a its an old one that bothered me as i dont know what kind of maintenance it gets here and they replaced the tail and main rotors they had problems with them not being strong enoughon the b model and this is the a model you do know about helicopters dont you therefore special agent wiener schnitzel after carefully weighing the pros and cons of the matter i decided it would be more prudent to have the alouette fly roof cover than to utilize it for personnel transport youre really hooked on that wiener schnitzel nonsense arent you and whats roof cover first of all its not nonsense and second you might say that im in love with wiener schnitzel and roof cover special agent wiener schnitzel is when a rotary wing aircraft flies low over an urban area carefully observingrooftops to make sure there are no bad guys with sniper rifles mortars or other lethal weaponry on them and hes going to do that colonel munz yeah and this way the frog bird will also be available as emergency transport if we need it you think thats liable to happen no i dont the cathedral looks as safe to me as the house the family will arrive by car enter the cathedral by a side door make a brief appearance at the casket then take seats in an alcove theres two alcoves near the altar the president probably and the foreign minister for certain plus assorted bigwigs including ambassador silvio will be in the one on the lefton the left facing the altarand the family two guys from side and you special agent wiener schnitzel enough already with the wiener schnitzel charley will be in the one on the right at the appointed hourtenthe prime minister or the president will approach the casket drop to his knees for a moment on the priedieu the what a thing you kneel on it means pray god in french i suppose that identifies you as a noncatholic im lutheran as a matter of fact wonderful so am i why do i suspect that if i said i was catholic you would have said the same thing i would have and with a clear conscience my mother was evangelische which is just about the same thing as lutheran and until i was twelve i even went to an evangelische school then i moved to texas where my texican family is all roman catholic i am a multifaith sinner in other words may i continue youre a lunatic and is that why you wiener schnitzel me special agent wiener schnitzel god as i was saying after whoever does this rises from the priedieu one of his staff will hand him the grand cross of the great liberator which he will then pin to the flag on the casket he will then return to his alcove the mass will start communion will be served to the family in their alcove as soon as the papal nuncio moves across the aisle to do the same for the president the family will leave their alcove get back in the motorcade and head for the airport this motorcade will not have flashing lights or a motorcycle escort but it will have lead and chase cars three of each at the airport the mastersons will immediately board the globemaster iii meantime mass will be offered to the bigwigs and diplomatic corps onlythe first four rows of reserved seats as soon as thats done the casket will be taken out a side door and loaded into one of the embassys yukons and taken under heavy escort to ezeiza as soon as its on the globemaster we go wheelsup for keesler im going to need clothing betty said something for the cathedral and how am i going to get my things from the hotel youll be at the hotel tonight castillo said not here i want you brighteyed and bushytailed for the cathedral and the flight tomorrow and for tonight too as a matter of fact brighteyed bushytailed and naked all you could do at the masterson place is doze in an armchair while i tossed sexually frustrated and miserable alone in my bed i suppose she said ill call after ive been to side with jack and munz then im going to see the ambassador and a sell him on my plan to get out of here and b get him to sell mrs masterson i have the feeling if i suggested it shed be against it she doesnt like you thats pretty obvious betty said ill call you later sweetheart charley yeah wiener schnitzel six the american club of buenos aires viamonte buenos aires argentina july side headquarters was not at all like the j edgar hoover building which is the fbi headquarters in washington or like the cia complex in langley virginia it was housed in a nondescript office building half a block off avenida julio and two blocks away from the colon opera house as they followed colonel munzs peugeot past the opera house sergeant roger markham matteroffactly informed them the opera house had been built in the heyday of argentina wealth with the primary architectural concern that it be larger and more elegant than the opera houses of vienna paris and rome there was no sign identifying the buildings purpose and entrance to side headquarters was through a truck loading dock and then onto a freight elevator operated by a man with an uzi submachine gun hanging from his neck special agents david william yung jr and paul holtzman of the fbi had been given a small glasswalled office in which to review the reports of the side and other law enforcement investigations neither seemed either surprised or pleased to see castillo and markham and since those reports are all written in spanish it can logically be assumed that they both read and write spanish colonel munz announced he had a few calls to make and castillo and markham sat down at a table beside yung and holtzman and started reading the reports alex darby walked into the small office about an hour later and a moment later munz came in i just came from the embassy darby announced where there are now two demonstrations one to express sympathy and the other protesting the price of milk or something in patagonia there was a third which seemed to approve of what happened to jack that was ended in front of the tv news cameras of the world by twenty guys on horses from the corps of mounted police there were no flashing sabers but just about everything else including mace sylvia grunblatts nearly hysterical he paused and looked at castillo and a guy from your office called miller he said either your cellular doesnt work or you talk a lot he couldnt get through to you the message is youre to call your boss on a secure line at four washington time five here got it and the ambassador wants to be brought up to speed to avoid the circus at the embassy he suggests lunch at the american club i reserved a private room he especially hopes you can be there alfredo of course munz said does that include us holtzman asked after a moment castillo said yes of course the american club was on the eleventh floor of an office building across the street from the colon opera house the first thing castillo saw when they got off the elevator was a huge american flag which had been flown from a warship off normandy on dday it was framed and hung on the wall castillo was a little surprised that sergeant roger markhamwho he insisted eat with themdid not deliver a little historical lecture on dday activities and world war ii in general there was a goodlooking oak bar with a very appealing display of various spirits me for one of those darby said heading for the bar possibly two i have earned it so have i castillo thought but i better not c g castillo and sergeant markham were the only two teetotalers and castillo suspected that was because markham was following his noble example the meeting went well ambassador silvio solved the problem of whether mrs masterson would be willing to leave for the united states immediately after the ceremony in the catedral metropolitana by calling her suggesting that was what he thought to be the best idea and getting her approval as they waited for the elevator castillo had an unpleasant thought everything is going very well too well what the hell am i missing when does the other shoe drop seven the united states embassy avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina july my name is c g castillo i need secretary hall on a secure line please weve been expecting your call mr castillo hold one please mr castillo is on a secure line

you too matt if you wish me to be there yes sir hall said thats the first time hes opened his mouth i think it would be a good idea matt the president said then ill be there sir and you mr ambassador presumably well see you there too sir i thought i would ask secretary cohens guidance about what the president asked sounding impatient sir mr masterson was our chief of mission if i came along and my wife and i would personally very much like to come direction of the mission would fall on the shoulders of mr darby our commercial attache juan secretary of state cohen said i know how you feel but i think it would be best if you remained in buenos aires we dont want to make it appear as if were recalling you for consultation and thats the first time shes opened her mouth yes maam the ambassador replied your call natalie the president said anything else from anybody there was a moments silence then the president said thank you charley thank you both eight schneider don juan for agent wiener schnitzel i dont think youre funny charley why do i suspect no one can overhear this conversation as a matter of fact im in the restroom you want me to call you back in a couple of minutes no whats on

libertador san isidro buenos aires province argentina july charleys glass of senetin cabernet sauvignon was just about empty and he was getting just a little concerned jesus betty should have been here by nowwhen his cellular buzzed castillo wo bist du karl munz and using the intimate form of address as if were pals between us mantoman im sitting in the bar of the kansas waiting for my lady love at the bar youre sitting at the bar yes i am and no i dont want any more comp listen to me karl carefully this instant get away from the bar and into a booth keep your head down hes serious what the hell is going on charley thought then said was ist los do what i tell you for gods sake im trying to keep you alive ill have cars there in a couple of minutes the line went dead shit castillo got off the bar stool signaled to the bartender that he was moving to a banquette and did so as surreptitiously as he could he took the beretta from the small of his back and worked the action he didnt think anyone saw what he did a minute or so later he heard the wail of a siren and then realized it was sirens plural a minute after that there was the screech of brakes outside and first two members of the gendarmeria national burst into the restaurant their hands on uzis and on their heels came two men in civilian clothing also carrying uzis smart if theyd come in first instead of the uniforms after munzs warning i might have decided to shoot first and sort it out later one of the men he was sure were side agents half trotted into the bar saw him and walked quickly to the table if youll come with us please mr castillo what the hell is going on if youll come with us please mr castillo he repeated colonel munz will explain everything when we get there it was a short ride actually the narrow streets and the high speed made it seem longer he saw first the flashing lights of police cars and then the ambulances and then the embassy car the embassy carthe windows looked as if someone had attacked them with a baseball batjesus christ somebody shot the shit out of the carwas backed into a sidewalk cafe at the traffic circle at the southeast corner of the san isidro jockey club property tables and chairs had been scattered and there were people sitting in chairs and lying on the ground who had either been run over or shot castillo was out of the car before it stopped moving munz was standing by the embassy car karl im sorry munz said castillo started for the car munz tried to stop him castillo evaded him three other men rushed to stop him munz ordered the men to let castillo pass the front passenger window was gone castillo stuck his head in sergeant roger markham usmc was lying across the front seats his head looked as if it had exploded castillo couldnt see in the backseat so he pulled open the rear door where the hell is betty there was a lot of blood on the leather upholstery castillo ran to colonel munz where is she i sent her by ambulance to the racetrack munz said a helicopter will take her to the german hospital how bad castillo asked multiple gunshot wounds at least one to the face what the hell happened first scenario fragmentary witness reports munz said professionally the car was making the circle at that point it stopped for some reason the driver his name was roger he was twenty years old castillo blurted roger lowered the window then he apparently saw what was happening which was a madsen submachine gun munz said its still in the window roger didnt get it closed in time but the window closed the madsens still there he pointed castillo looked a madsens barrel was pinned between the driversside window and the window frame they go all the way up automatically castillo said and he put the car in reverse and tried to get away which is why the car is where it is jesus h christ so the villain held on to the trigger as long as he could munz said and then ran away did you catch him munz shook his head and then made a gesture one of his men walked up with a resealable plastic bag munz took it and then extended it to castillo it held a glock semiautomatic pistol the inside of the bag was heavily smeared with blood that had come off the pistol your agent got one shot off munz said shes not my fucking agent he handled the weapon through the bag with disbelief shes my my my love i know karl munz said i saw your eyes there was the sound of rotor blades and castillo looked in the direction in time to see an alouette iii the sa a the one with the weak main and tail rotors struggling for altitude ill go with you to the hospital karl el coronel munz said ix one autopista del sol accesso norte san isidro buenos aires province argentina july el coronel alfredo munz leaned forward tapped the driver of the jeep grand cherokee on the shoulder and told him to slow down turn off the siren and take the flashing blue light from the roof castillo looked at him in surprise then anger then horror as it occurred to him the probable reason it was no longer necessary to speed jesus christ did somebody call him to tell him shes dead and i missed it munz read his mind if you and i wind up in hospital beds beside fraulein schneider because we ran into a gasoline truck that wont do her any good will it karl castillo didnt reply what will happen at the hospital is that they will check her vital signs type her blood her blood types on her credentials castillo interrupted if they were in her purse thats on the way to my laboratory i dont think theyll find any prints of use on it but i dont want to omit anything munz waited until that had sunk in then went on and even if the hospital had something alleging to give her blood type they would make their own examination unless her condition was really critical giving transfusions of the wrong type of blood can be fatal not critical christ alfredo there was blood all over the backseat not all of it i dont think was hers munz said and you know how heavily any wound to the head bleeds yeah i do im a soldier so start thinking like one charley for christs sake this damn situation is my fault no question about that but its done evaluate the damage and decide on a course of action fighting to keep control of his voice castillo said you didnt tell me where she was hit munz tapped his right cheek just above his mouth and in the body the upper leg and here in the side thats all i saw he pointed to both locations three wounds from what was that madsen firing i dont know i saw some ninemillimeter casings well maybe we got lucky and it wasnt one of the madsens i dont think it was acp munz said noting that castillo knew of the brazilianmade model and we may be even luckier what do you mean i didnt see an exit wound on her face that makes me think maybe it was bounced bullets what bounced bullets you mean ricochets exactly those marvelous windshields on that armored bmw designed to keep bullets out in this case may unfortunately have kept them in as well jesus i didnt think about that well find out when we get to the hospital and theres something else i didnt think about either he took out his cellular and punched an autodial button alex darby answered on the second buzz darby castillo theres been an ambush my car at the sante fe circle in san isidro they got sergeant markham and betty schneider is in a chopper on the way to the german hospital are you all right charley i dont know if all right is the phrase but i wasnt in the car i was drinking wine in a bar where are you now in colonel munzs car on the accesso norte on the way to the hospital so the argentines know they told me me the guy whos supposed to be on top of things charley you cant blame yourself for not being in the car who do you think these bastards were trying to hit me or a female secret service agent and a marine driver ill have people at the hospital in ten minutes dont move from there until they get there if you have anybody to spare send them to the masterson house tell them not to let mrs masterson hear what happened charley itll be all over the television and the radio then make sure she doesnt watch tv or listen to the radio i want her to hear about this from the ambassador as soon as i get off this with you im going to call him okay charley anything else find tony santini tell him to get jack britton something heavier than his glock then get him a car and send him to the hospital done ill be in touch alex castillo said pushed the end key and then the autodial key for ambassador silvio then he pushed the end key again and turned to munz alfredo sergeant markhams body whats going to happen to it when my people have finished doing their work at the sante fe circle it will be taken to the german hospital for an autopsy is an autopsy necessary we know what killed him at least one gunshot wound to the cranium causing severe trauma to the brain we will need the bullets in his body as evidence when we catch the villains and bring them to trial munz said matteroffactly yeah right castillo said and put his finger back on the autodial key that would connect him with ambassador silvio is that about it charley silvio asked ill go to san isidro and ask mrs masterson what she wants to do about the ceremony tomorrow and call you and let you know one more thing sir i would let me interrupt silvio said forgive me how do you want to handle telling washington would you like to do that yourself ill have to call the state department obviously would you like to meet me at the embassy after i speak with mrs masterson im going to call washington as soon as i can reporting what happened from the embassy on this phone not on a secure line if they want me on a secure line ill tell them ill go to the embassy as soon as i can which will be after i learn betty schneiders condition i understand how you feel silvio said but i really think theyre going to want you on a secure line as soon as possible and as soon as possible ill get on a secure line castillo said simply there was a perceptible hesitation before silvio went on you said there was one more thing two now that i think about it i would be personallygrateful if you could send one or more marines right now to the sante fe circle to be with and stay with sergeant markhams body if its gone when they get there tell them to go to the german hospital the marines take pride in never leaving anybody behind and roger was one hell of a marine ill take care of that right away silvio said and get a casket and a flag to the german hospital roger will be on the globemaster when it goes wheelsup tomorrow ill see that thats done thank you sir let me know about miss schneiders condition as soon as you learn anything will you please yes sir i will well be talking charley yes sir castillo pressed the end key and then punched in a long series of numbers from memory department of homeland security how may i direct your call five please secretary halls office mrs kensington this is charley mrs k well how are you lousy is the boss there you just missed him charley good i really didnt want to talk to him excuse me what about dick miller hes here whats

this telecon at fiveten pm washington time july twentyfour between c g castillo h r miller and maryellen kensington all of the office of the secretary of homeland security is being recorded with the permission and knowledge of all parties thereto major h richard miller jr came on the line whats going on charley you remember telling me not to do anything stupid with betty schneider yeah why well i exceeded your expectations im in a side car on the outskirts of buenos aires on my way to the german hospital to which betty was medevaced suffering from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body jesus h christ major miller said oh my god mrs kensington exclaimed what the hell happened miller asked to spare special agent schneider any possible embarrassment that might ensue from the hotshot in overall charge of this operation picking her up at work himself people might get the idea she was emotionally involved with her boss and we couldnt have thather boss had himself dropped off at a bar and sent his car and driver to pick up said special agent schneider as sergeant roger markham usmc was navigating the sante fe traffic circle in san isidro en route to the bar where the hotshot in overall charge of this operation was sipping wine the car was bushwhacked by parties unknown the bastards managed to get a madsen through rogers window and damned near emptied the magazine roger took several hits in the head which just about exploded it and the projectiles from the madsen ricocheted off the bulletproof glass inside the car at least three of them wound up in betty jesus h christ miller said you already said that dick castillo said now while mrs k is reporting this to the bosstell him please mrs k that ambassador silvio is going to get on a secure line to report this just as soon as he tells mrs masterson about this and sees what she wants to do about the medal ceremony tomorrow and that i will do the same as soon as i can which means after i find out about betty of course mrs kensington said oh charley im so sorry you dick castillo interrupted her get on the horn to the police commissioner in philadelphia whats his name kellogg miller furnished better yet what

sorry mrs k ill handle that charley mrs maryellen kensington said what about you are you all right safe im sitting next to the guy who runs side in argentina it dont get no safer than that you will call when you know something about betty mrs kensington asked i will now i have to break off were nearly at the hospital watch your back buddy major h richard miller said castillo pushed the end key slipped the telephone in his pocket and looked at munz may i suggest karl that before we enter the hospital it might be a good idea to take the round out of the chamber of your pistol jesus christ i forgot about that how did you know i saw the pistol at sante fe circle munz said when i looked in the window of the bmw castillo took the beretta from the small of his back removed the magazine ejected the round from its chamber put the round in the magazine and then put the magazine back in the pistol two the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july castillo got to the intensive care unit of the hospital just as special agent schneider was being wheeled on a gurney out of one of the glasswalled treatment units there were so many hospital personnel around the gurney that castillo had trouble getting a good look one of the medical people was pushing what looked like a clothes tree on wheels there were three plastic bags hanging from it with clear plastic tubing leading from them to under the blue sheets one of the bags contained human blood charley could only guess what the other two bags held betty was wrapped in pale blue sheets they were fresh and crisp but bloodstained near the groin and in the side her head was swaddled in white bandage also bloodstained her eyes were open but there was no reaction when as the gurney was rolled out of intensive care toward a bank of elevators he pushed one of the nurses aside to look down at her i dont see any reaction charley said i dont speak english a man in surgical greens answered in broken english charley repeated the question in spanish she has been sedated the man answered they reached the elevator bank a button was pushed and eventually a door whooshed open we are taking the patient to the operation theater the man in surgical greens said you are forbidden charley was about to say fuck you and your forbidden when he felt munzs hand firmly on his shoulder the chief of surgical staff will explain whats going to happen to her karl munz said gently you just cant go into the operation theater with her the chief of surgical staff looked like santa claus with a shave his more than ample belly strained the buttons of his white nylon jacket his name tag read jose p rommine md there was an xray viewing device on one wall of his office holding so many large xray films that in places three and four were pinned by the same stainlesssteel clip i regret my english is not good dr rommine said as he shook castillos hand herr castillo speaks german munz said in german that would be easier rommine replied in german i took my university in germany first at philipps in marburg an der lahn then at heidelberg i know the schools castillo said german doctorsand im sure she had the best couldnt keep my mother alive i hope you can do better for betty herr doktor santa claus please god let him do better were interested in your diagnosis herr doktor munz said of course the doctor said turning to the xrays and picking up a pointer as you can see from this the wound to the leg while it has of course done some muscle damageand there will be more as the projectile is removedcould have been much worse yeah sure those bastards could have used a mm and blown it off jesus if they wanted to whack me and they obviously have access to weapons why didnt they use a hand grenade once they got roger to lower the window all they would have had to do was drop it inside the car heroic stories to the contrary when a grenade lands close very few people have ever been able to toss it back castillo had an unpleasant image of roger markham desperately searching for a grenade on the floorboard and then finding it just before it went off grenade shards would have gone through the upholstery and thin sheet metal of the seats without trouble and of course probably bounced off that wonderful bulletresistant glass dr rommines learned lecture concerning bettys leg wound illustrated with half a dozen xrays took at least three minutes so did part ii the wound in the groin area which was also serious but not as serious as it could have been the xrays revealed no damage to the reproductive organs except for the sympathetic trauma whatever the hell that means and the surgery to remove that projectile would of course clear up the questions unanswered by the xrays i think the wound to the face is going to cause the greatest difficulty dr rommine said turning to the xrays of the patients cranium with emphasis on the mandible area as you can see the projectile is rather deeply embedded in the bone here he used the pointer and then turned to first one and then a second and then a third xray covering the mandible area from all angles there is a fracture and some tobeexpected splintering removing the projectile will be somewhat difficult we dont do much oral surgery here and i attempted to locate a good man i know but hes skiing in bariloche and he wont be available for several days i hope the bastard breaks both his legs castillo asked are you saying youre going to leave the bullet in her jaw until you can get this guy back from bariloche dr koos is his name oh no the projectile will be removed now but the restorative surgeryher jaw will of course have to be wired closedis quite important and should be placed in the hands of the best man available jesus thats bettys skull im looking at castillo suddenly felt lightheaded then dizzy what am i going to do pass out throw up on santa clauss shiny floor no goddammit i will not lose control of myself he steadied himself with a hand on the xray display rack doctor how soon can she be moved i beg your pardon how soon could i fly her to the united states oh i see what youre thinking he thought the question over and then continued that would depend in large measure on what sort of support you could provide in terms of oxygen bloodin case of unexpected bleedinget cetera on the aircraft and there would have to be provision to feed her liquids of course her jaw as i say will be immobilized for at least two weeks she would have to be accompanied by a physician and a nurse im speaking of moving her soonsay tomorrow or the day after if you were willing to wait say seventytwo or ninetysix hoursthree or four dayswhile she would be in some discomfort she could travel far more easily with medical personnel in attendance of course how long is she going to be in the operating room now oh i would say dr rommine began then thought that over for a good twenty seconds before finishing two hours perhaps a little longer and id better get scrubbed they almost certainly have the patient prepared by now youre going to operate of course el coronel munz has explained the situation to me it will be my privilege dr rommine then walked out of his office without saying another word he left so quickly that castillo doubted dr santa claus had heard his somewhat belatedly expressed thanks you all right karl munz asked castillo nodded you looked a little pale there for a while im all right thank you for everything lets see if we can find a cup of coffee munz said and wed better start thinking about getting a little something to eat alfredo im not hungry if people dont eat their blood sugar drops especially after they have been subjected to stress and they pass out munz said castillo looked at him a moment realized reluctantly that he was right and nodded his thanks okay castillo said starting for the door lets go sit down karl munz said ill have something sent up alfredo do you really think these bastards would try to whack me in a hospital cafeteria that seems to be the problem doesnt it if you dont have any idea who the villains are then its rather difficult to assess their plans or their capabilities munz punched an autodial key on his cellular and told someone to go to the cafeteria and bring up some sandwicheslomo sandwiches if they had them otherwise ham and cheesecoffee and some very sweet pastry castillo sat in dr santa clauss chair and looked at the bullet lodged in bettys jaw jack britton showed up at the same time as the sandwiches he had a madsen submachine gun under his arm hanging from a web strap around his shoulder shes in the operating room castillo told him without waiting to be asked he pointed to the xray films and then the weapon three wounds from one of those from one of these britton asked incredulously yeah from one of those whered you get that darby britton said he asked me if i could handle it and i lied i never saw one before they hit betty with one of these yeah a ninemillimeter model and blew sergeant markham away i heard that britton said what the fuck is going on charley i have no goddamn idea castillo confessed and extended his hands for the madsen let me have that ill show you how it works britton handed castillo the submachine gun he removed the magazine and checked to see that there was no cartridge left in the mechanism pay attention jack you may have to use this castillo said im all ears britton said this is a madsen m castillo began caliber ninemillimeter parabellum this has a curved thirtyroundmagazine the earlier models have a stick it fires from an open chamber in other words to fire it you pull the operating lever on the top to the rear he demonstrated by pulling the operating lever back it caught in place with a firm click the first thing you do is take the safety off in other words move this thing to f he demonstrated the functioning of the safety control then you select auto or singleshot mode this is the selector lever for that a stands for automatic he demonstrated the function of the selector switch then you pull the trigger he pulled the trigger the bolt slammed into the battery position if there had been a loaded magazine in there the bolt would have stripped off the top cartridge shoved it in the action and it would have gone bang then the bolt would return to the rear position if you were in singleshot mode to fire again you would have to release your finger on the trigger and then pull it again if you were in auto modeyour finger still holding the trigger to the rearit would go bangbangbang at a rate of six hundred and fifty rounds per minute until you ran out of ammo we try to teach people to try to get off threeshot burstsit takes some practicebecause otherwise as when firing any other submachine gun the muscles of the shooter tend to involuntarily contract raising the muzzle and you miss what you wanted to shoot he looked at britton i hope you took notes there will be a quiz when you said we try to teach people you meant special forces didnt you castillo nodded youve fired submachine guns right yeah but not this one a lot of people like the madsen castillo said he handed the weapon back to britton the bolt is forward he said put the safety lever on s and the rate of fire selector on a he said and when britton looked at him added yeah now please jack britton did as he was told okay it is now safe to load the magazine he handed it to him watched as britton inserted it and then went on okay all you have to do now is pull the action lever back take off the safety and pull the trigger got it britton said good castillo said now carefully lay it down on that shelf i dont think youre going to need it in here right now and i want to eat my sandwich are you hungry jack no thanks you sure these look good castillo said and reached for one castillo was finishing a generous slice of incredibly good apfelstrudelwhy i am surprised this is the german hospitalwhen there was a knock on the office door a large man in civilian clothing came in and offered colonel munz a small resealable plastic bag and mi coronel there are americans here for senor castillo munz didnt reply directly he held up the bag castillo saw that it held two fired cartridge cases there are others right we wont need these in court there are twentyfour in all mi coronel we are still looking it is possible that some spectators took some others as souvenirs munz opened the bag and took out a brass cartridge case examined it carefully and then handed it to castillo israeli he said same year stamp as the ones we found on avenida tomas edison in the taxicab castillo took the case and handed it to britton we now have conclusive proof that in israel made ninemillimeter ammunition he said munz smiled at him dont smile castillo said i cant think of anything else we have conclusive proof of he looked at britton just to satisfy my curiosity whats in the embassy madsen britton took a curved magazine from his pocket thumbed a cartridge loose and examined its base israeli he said and conclusive proof that the bad guys have fresher ammo than the good guys castillo said not that it matters as im beginning to wonder if well ever get a chance to shoot back you want these munz nodded yes thank you castillo said and took the plastic bag put the cartridge britton held out to him in it zipped it shut and dropped it in his pocket americans for me he asked munzs man si senor castillo gestured for them to be brought in a civiliancastillo recognized his face from the brainstorming session but couldnt come up with a nameand a marine the man in his middle twenties was oliveskinned and castillo decided he was probably one of the drug enforcement administration agents he was carrying an m rifle the marine who was in greens and had a beretta in a field holster hanging from a web belt was a corporal im castillo youre looking for me solez mr castillo dea i was told to report to you and do whatever you told me to do do you speak spanish mr solez castillo said in spanish i spoke it before i learned to speak english solez replied in spanish castillo picked up on the accent and where are you from in texas castillo asked still in spanish san antone senor me too yes sir i know how do you know my father is antonio solez sir i think you know him antonio solez had been one of castillos grandfathers cronies a familiar face around both the offices and the ranches and a pallbearer at the funeral of don juan fernando castillo a mental image of him a large swarthy man standing across the open grave with his chest heaving and tears running unashamedly down his cheeks leaped into castillos mind indeed i do how is he still taking care of don fernando solez said with a smile it took a moment for charley to take his meaning he smiled back when did my fat and ugly cousin start calling himself don fernando people started calling him that after don fernando passed i think he likes it dona alicia does i know youre ricardo right the last i heard you were at college station si senor i graduated in and went right into the dea you dont have to call me sir and please dont solez nodded why didnt you say something when we were at that brainstorming thing castillo asked solez shrugged i wasnt sure you would remember me i should have recognized you im sorry solez shrugged again no problem you had other things on your mind were both a long way from san antonio im really happy to see you ricardo castillo said you heard what happened solez nodded shes in the operating room now castillo said shell be in there for probably another two hours from the moment she gets off the elevator until i get out of here i want you or special agent brittonyou know each other we met since youre talking about me i wish youd do it in english charley britton said sorry charley said now in english it seems that special agent solez is not only a fellow texican but his family and mine have been friends for generations my dad is chief engineer for castillo properties solez said with pride everything but the petroleum side britton looked at him and nodded okay castillo went on from the time special agent schneider gets out of the operating room until i can get her the hell out of here i want one or the other preferably both sitting on her you got it britton said solez nodded there will be side people with you of course munz said both britton and solez nodded castillo turned to the marine corporal and looked closely at him for the first time he was no more than five feet four or five and weighed no more than oneforty he looked to be about seventeen years old i thought marines on embassy duty had to be fiveeleven and oneeighty or better where did this little guy come from oh yeah rule of war thirteen b every military organization with an authorized strength of two or more men will have a designated paper pusher this little guy is the marine guard detachment clerk pressed into duty as a driver youre the driver right corporal the corporal came to attention no sir the driver is with the car sir the gunny instructed me to tell you sir that an armored car was not immediately available and to suggest you take appropriate precautions until one can be found for you okay my name is corporal lester bradley sir i am your bodyguard sir for a moment there was silence and then jack britton was suddenly overwhelmed with a coughing fit colonel munz his face turned red and dea special agent solez became suddenly fascinated with the xrays on display major c g castilloafter covering his mouth with his hand so it would not be obvious he was biting his lip as hard as he could one chuckle the hint of a giggle from him or anyone else would trigger something close to hysterics in everybodyfinally decided he could trust his voice well im glad to have you corporal he said i know how reliable the marines are semper fi sir corporal lester bradley said sincerely colonel munz turned from his examination of the xrays and probably not trusting himself to speak signaled with a nod of his head toward the door that he wanted a private word with castillo excuse me a minute guys ill be right back castillo said and followed munz into the corridor munz put his hand on castillos arm now that youre under the protection of the us corps of marines karl would you mind if i left you dont underestimate the marines alfredo theyre nice people to have in your corner are they all like that boy they are not often troubled with selfdoubt charley said and neither should you be karl munz said seriously ive been practicing our trade for a while and i have met very few people with your natural talent for it i take that as a great compliment alfredo it was meant as one listen to me karl dont let what happened in there bother you he means my almost taking a dive there would be something wrong with a man who looking at a bullet in the skull of the woman he lovesa bullet which but for gods mercy would have taken her lifewas not affected as you were castillo met his eyes but said nothing munz squeezed his arm and pay attention to what your bodyguard said about your not having an armored car munz said with a smile i presume youll be going to your embassy why not dr santa claus said bettyll be in there two hours and im going to have to talk to washington on a secure line castillo nodded i took that to heart there will be a side car with you munz said and then offered castillo his hand goodbye karl goodbye what does he mean by that thanks for everything alfredo i will pray for your lady karl munz said touched castillos shoulder then walked quickly down the corridor to the elevator charley went back in the office told britton and solez he was going to the embassy and to call him if there was any word at all and thenunder the careful watch of corporal bradley his bodyguardwent to the basement and got in the unarmored embassy car on the way his cellular went off and he answered it with his heart in his throat it was ambassador silvio who told him that mrs masterson wished to go ahead with the ceremony at the catedral metropolitana im on the way to the embassy sir to get on the horn to washington would you like me to wait until you get there please charley ill be there in thirty minutes three the united states embassy avenida colombia buenos aires argentina july white house this is c g castillo i need to speak on a secure weve been waiting for your call sir hold one please secretary halls office mrs kensington speaking we have mr castillo for secretary hall mrs kensington this line is secure mrs kensington pushed her intercom button said pick up boss its charley on a secure line then dialed another number on the secure phone charley listened as she said we have secretary hall and mr castillo on a secure line for a conference call with director montvale oh shit charles w montvale former deputy secretary of state former secretary of the treasury and former ambassador to the european union was the recently appointed united states director of national intelligence the press had immediately dubbed him the intel czar charles montvale oh shit again he sounds like hes got his teeth clenched are you okay charley secretary hall asked as he came on the line im well thank you matt and yourself director montvale said a touch of condescending amusement in his voice castillo are you on hall asked there was a touch of impatience in his voice yes sir are you all right charley yes sir im fine and the girl shes in surgery now at the german hospital she took three hits am i correct in assuming the third party to this call is major castillo director montvale interrupted he still sounded amused yes sir castillo said i am charles montvale major do you know who i am now his voice was serious yes sir the president has asked me to take your call major do you understand yes sir this call is being recorded you may proceed hold off charley matt hall said icily mr montvale lets get some things clear between us before anyone says another word is there a problem several im afraid for one thing i dont like being informed that my call is being recorded you said nothing about that when you told my executive assistant you wanted to listen to this call actually it was my executive assistant who spoke with your executive assistant montvale said and recording my callsespecially calls of this natureis standard procedure its not my standard procedure i would like your assurance that the recording device has been turned off that what has been recorded so far will be erased and that there is no one privy to this call but the three of us i intend to have the tape of this conversation available should the president ask for it when i report this telecom to him do i understand i dont have your assurance the recorder is being turned off i frankly dont understand your attitude secretary hall is that a yes or a no mr montvale joanne turn off the recorder montvale said after a moment and erase anything thats been recorded hall insisted erase what has been recorded so far please joanne thank you you said there were several problems secretary hall major castillo works for me i will tell him when to proceed or when not to is that clear may i point out mr secretary that we all work for the president and that it is at the presidents order that i am taking the call major castillo hall said you understand that you take your orders from either the president or me and only the president and me yes sir i will of course seek clarification of this from the president montvale said we both will mr montvale hall said and then when there was no response from montvale went on okay charley go on sir ambassador silvio is with me were in his office in the embassy the call is on the speakerphone good evening mr ambassador hall said youve heard whats been said so far yes i have mr secretary silvio said do you know the director of national intelligence mr montvale yes sir i know the ambassador good evening sir how are you silvio very well sir thank you i attempted to call you silvio earlier when the president brought me in on this you were not available when was that sir fortyfive minutes ago an hour im curious why you werent available i was with mrs masterson at that time sir and they didnt tell you i was calling i left instructions that i was not to be disturbed when i was with her mr montvale even for a call from me from anyone sir it was my intention sir to return your call when mr castillo had completed his call to secretary hall i must say thats an odd priority but why dont you tell me about mrs masterson the president is deeply concerned yes sir mr montvale hall said may i respectfully suggest that you telephone ambassador silvio when major castillo has finished his report to me you dont seem to understand do you hall that i am acting at the orders of the president from the tone of your voice charles and if i didnt know better i might think that two of my most senior staff are having a little tiff over turf the president of the united states said you fellows dont mind if i join the conversation do you of course not mr president montvale said good evening sir hall said you on here charley the president asked yes sir castillo replied and so is ambassador silvio sir how much did i miss i hate to make you go over it all again but i just couldnt get the goddamn get my distinguished visitor to leave i was just about to start mr president start with the condition of the female agent the president said yes sir special agent schneider is in surgery she suffered three gunshot wounds from a ninemillimeter madsen submachine gun it took castillo perhaps five minutes to report what had happened and what was planned the president had interrupted him three times once to ask where the argentine police were when the embassy car had been attacked a second time to ask what castillo thought about the quality of the medical treatment special agent schneider was getting and a third time to ask what had been done about notifying schneiders family and that of sergeant roger markham thats about it sir castillo concluded there was a tensecond silence and then the president said you havent had much to say mr ambassadorcan i take that to mean you and charley are on the same page yes sir silvio said simply we pretty much see things the same way and would you tell me if you didnt yes sir i would silvio said there was another long pause and then the president said you ever hear that story about the people who went to president lincoln to tell him general grant was a drunk lincoln was pretty fed up with people around him bickering and history tells us he had one hell of a temper but this time he kept it in check what president lincoln said was well find out what general grant is drinking and ill see that my other generals get some of it the president paused now mr ambassador changing the subject i wonder if you would be good enough to send me via major castillo a bottle of whatever you two have been drinking ill share it with secretary hall and director montvale it would be my pleasure mr president silvio said a smile in his voice just idle curiosity the president asked what will it be major castillo sir shares my appreciation of a local wine a cabernet sauvignon from the sentenir bodega in mendoza ill look forward to it the president said maybe two bottles would be better than one better yet make it a case yes sir one more thing the president said charley are you watching your back yes sir i guess what i really meant to ask is whos helping you watch your back sir as we speak my marine bodyguard is standing outside the ambassadors door well do what he says charley too many people are getting shot down there yes sir i will unless someone has something else that would seem to be it no one said anything okay ill see you sometime late tomorrow charley and charles i think it would be a good idea if you went down to mississippi with us too of course mr president director of national intelligence montvale said four as castillo came out of ambassador silvios office corporal lester bradley usmc popped to attention and said there are two air force officers to see you sir i asked them to wait in the outer office thank you corporal castillo said and went into the outer office where he found colonel jake torine and the light bird pilot of the gulfstreamif he had ever heard his name castillo couldnt remember it now sitting in the row of chairs against the wall both were in civilian clothing sports jackets and slacks i was just about to call you castillo said shaking torines hand we heard what happened torine said hows that female secret service agent doing betty betty took three hits shes in surgery now nice girl torine said is she going to be all right jesus christ i hope so castillo said im going to the german hospital from here any change in the plan for tomorrow no mrs masterson has decided shes going ahead with the whole dogandpony show jake just now i remembered or think i did something about an ambulance configuration for the gulfstream torine shrugged indicating he didnt know either and then asked walter yes there is an emergency ambulance configuration for the c the lieutenant colonel confirmed installed on the one youre flying colonel charley asked yes there is tell me about it please may i ask why youre asking what is it classified or something walter torine asked sarcastically yes sir as a matter of fact it is the configuration of all eightyninth presidential airlift group aircraft is classified jesus christ torine exploded and youre worried castillo doesnt have the proper clearanceor maybe its me for a moment charley thought the light bird was goingto say just that but then as castillo studied him he thought this chickenshit light bird has only now decided that a full bird colonel sent on presidential orders as pilot in command of a globemaster more than likely has the proper security clearances and since he was senior if he said it was all right to describe the configuration of the gulfstream any breach of security would fall on his shoulders three of the seats on the left side of the cabin can be placed in a horizontal position the light bird began there is a mattress and sheetsrubber and the ordinary kindstored behind the galley behind the paneling by the sheets is some other medical equipment a blood pressure device things like that and an oxygen feed connected to the aircrafts main oxygen supply whats on your mind charley torine asked castillo didnt reply directly colonel you came direct from washington castillo said can i extrapolate that to mean you can go direct jorge newberyphiladelphia are you a pilot major castillo aha somebodys tipped himand i think i know whothat hes dealing with a lowly major thats why he doesnt want me to know the secrets of the gulfstream yes i am castillo said with some experience in longdistance jetlongdistance flight i know for a fact that he flew the right seat of a from costa rica to macdill and worked the radios and everything torine said smiling at charley whats with all the questions walter sir it would be easier if the major were conversant with the problems involved in a flight of that distance can your fancy little bird make it from here to philadelphia nonstop or not walter jesus christ torine exploded theoretically yes but it would be prudent to think of somewhere to refuel if fuel consumption turned out to be greater for one reason or another than planned for worst fuelconsumption scenario colonel can you make it from here to miami very probably there are never any guarantees what about macdill castillo asked as a refueling stop very probably the lieutenant colonel said after considering it for a moment thank you castillo said but speaking hypothetically macdill requires advance noticetwelve hours i believe id have to checkto refuel transient aircraft im not being hypothetical colonel castillo said whats going to happen is this ambassador silvio at this moment is arranging for an american physician he paused and looked at torine who fortunately a is a fellow miami cuban and b is in town conducting a seminar at the university of belgrano and a nurse or maybe two torine nodded his understanding and castillo looked back at the lieutenant colonel you are going to fly special agent schneider the doctor and the nurses from here to philadelphia just as soonmaybe tomorrow maybe the day after tomorrowas they say shes up to the trip on whose authority major on mine castillo said softly im afraid i cant do that major my orders were to fly the fbi team down here and then to return them to washington listen to me very carefully colonel newley colonel torine said icily i am telling you that major castillo has all the authority he needs to tell you to do anything now you can accept that and cheerfully and willingly comply with any orders he may give you or i will get on the horn to general mcfadden at centcom and inform him that after relieving you for obstructing a presidential mission i am placing your copilot in command of the gulfstream assigning one of my backup crew as copilot and returning you to andrews by commercial air general albert mcfadden us air force was the centcom deputy commander lieutenant colonel walter newleys face paled he swallowed then said yes sir very softly does that mean you understand youre under major castillos orders yes sir lieutenant colonel newley said softly what i didnt hear that youre supposed to sound like an air force officer not some faggot wearing the wings of an air chad cabin attendant yes sir lieutenant colonel newley said much louder wait in the corridor for me please colonel torine said in a normal voice yes sir lieutenant colonel newley said somewhat loudly torine waited until the door closed then turned to castillo charley he began and then saw that corporal lester bradley usmc had heard the exchange son torine asked i dont think you heard much of that little conversation did you what conversation is that sir corporal bradley asked the only thing i like better than a marine is a selectively deaf marine torine said permission to speak sir granted during our training at quantico sir we are told we will hear things we will immediately forget we heard thank you torine said now son please go into the corridor for a moment so that it wont be necessary for you to forget what major castillo and i are going to discuss yes sir corporal bradley said and went into the corridor when the door had closed torine said i have no idea what that nonsense with newley was all about but i have the feeling theres something more to it than him being a bythebook asshole he knew im a major i never said i was so somebody told him i think i know who torine made a giveittome gesture with his hands theres an fbi agent assigned to the embassy in montevideo name of yung i think hes made me i dont think i understand howard kennedy told me hes one of their hotshots kennedy is here torine asked visibly surprised he was kennedy said he used to work with this guy and that whatever hes doing in montevideohes supposed to be working on money launderingisnt what hes really doing ill try to figure this out as you continue charley i suspect theres still an fbi interest in charley castillo what the cops would call a locate but do not detain kennedy is still very worried about what he calls his former associates and hes not a fool the fbi thinks i can lead them to pevsner andor kennedy charley i was there with you when the president told the dci and director of the fbi to lay off pevsner i interpreted that to mean lay off pevsner and the people who work for him thats the primary reason im telling you this now jake somebody told the new york times guy hereand some othersthat the presidents agent is down here and somebody told colonel newley that im a major and probably a troublemaker watch out for that sonofabitch he can get you in trouble am i being paranoid or is it possible the fbi is ignoring what you and i would call a direct order from the president colonel torine considered that for a moment then said well you know what they say charley no what do they say just because youre paranoid doesnt mean that little green men arent trying to castrate you with machetes shit castillo chuckled what are you going to do about it torine asked i have a gut feeling i should do nothing about it now maybe because im a little afraid of the clout theyve given me and i dont want to burn the bastard until im sure he is a bastard and i also want to find out what howard kennedy meant when he said whatever yung is doing in montevideo its not reading bank statements what else could he be doing i have no idea but i do know that the minute the fbi finds out ive fingered him hell stop doing it and then ill never know torine shrugged its your call charley i cant fault it what do you want me to do with newley see that he gets the airplane ready have him hang around here until we can get this doctor to look at the airplane and see what else he will need done torine said charley ive got a guy at ezeiza who can fly that gulfstream redundancy was one of the reasons i brought him along say the word and ill have him fly it no i dont want to do that if you relieve newley there goes his career he was doing what he thought was the right thing to do and i think you made a christian out of him your call what are you going to do now im going back to the hospital and wait for betty to come out of the operating room want some company after i make sure ive made a true christian out of newley one who wont go back to his wicked ways the minute we get off the ground thanks but no thanks jake x one the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july there were two men castillo suspected were side agents in the lobby of the hospital when he and corporal bradley walked in confirmation came when one of them walked up to them and told castillo your agent was in room it was the room where mrs masterson had been placed castillo wondered whether it was coincidence or whether the everresourceful colonel munz had an arrangement with the hospital for really secure rooms for patients in whom side had an interest when he got to the sixth floor castillo found jack britton sitting in a folding metal chair outside the room holding a madsen on his lap bettys still in the operating room charley britton said solez talked somebody into letting him wait outside the operating room apparently theyre going to bring her here instead of to a recovery room theyve been taking all sorts of equipment in there and theres a couple of guys with uzis down the hall castillo looked and then said i just made arrangements for betty to be flownon the gulfstream that brought you down hereto philadelphia when shes up to traveling i want you to go with her britton nodded i had dick miller call chief inspector kramer to give him a headsup when we know something ill call him and bring him up to speed unless im gone before that happens then youll have to do it britton nodded again castillo looked into the room and saw that it was prepared to treat someone just out of an operating room i hope theres a john in there castillo said i really need to take a leak he saw on corporal lester bradleys face that a visit to a toilet was high on his agenda as well clearly uncomfortably perhaps even painfully high corporal there are two things that a warrior must always remember castillo said sternly the first is to void ones bladder at every opportunity because one never knows when there will be another opportunity to do so yes sir the second is rhip rank has its privileges yes sir which in this case means i get to go in there before you do yes sir just kidding go on bradley castillo said i can wait you go ahead sir you have your orders corporal this is your opportunitymaybe your only opportunity take it yes sir britton chuckled nice kid he said when bradley had gone into the room yeah and so was sergeant roger markham castillo said and then went on bitterly the secretary of the navy regrets to inform you that your son staff sergeant roger markham was killed in the line of duty what he was doing was chauffeuring a secret service agent to a bar where she was to meet her boyfriend first ill tell you about markham britton said tell me about markham the gunnery sergeant came looking for youthe guy in charge of the marine guards i know who he is he brought a casket for markhams body and a flag theyve got him in a cooler in the morgue here in the hospital and theyre going to take him out to ezeiza first thing in the morning he said that if he didnt get a chance to see you to tell you thanks for making sure markham had a marine escorttheres two marines in the morgue with the bodyand for sending him home in a military aircraft instead of like one more piece of luggage on delta or american well you know me jack charley castillo always looking out for his men hes not very good at it and some of them get blown away but what the hell castillo means well oh bullshit charley thats the second thing im going to tell you what happened to markham and betty is not your fault i should have been in that car jack and you know it no thats bullshit if you had been in that car one of two things would have happened youd either be in the cooler with markham or youd be in a hospital bed like betty maybe i could have gotten one of the bastards more bullshit and you should know it face the facts charley what are the facts i dont know how it is with the secret service but i suspect its just like on the cops i dont follow you jack on the cops when something like this happens your partner gets shot or whackedthey wont let you near the investigation youre too emotionally involved im afraid if you keep up this its all my fault bullshit somebody importants going to hear you and theyll keep you off the investigation and i wouldnt like that why not because the only way a brandnew secret service agent like me is going to be allowed to try to find the bastards who whacked masterson markham and almost whacked betty is if you can fix it and i really want those bastards charley for a moment castillo couldnt find his voice then he said for however long im on this jack if i have anything to say about it you will be too youll be on it a lot longer if you get your act together starting with nobody has to know about you and betty can you get that air force colonel to keep his mouth shut yeah okay it was just the four of us in the hotel room and markhams dead you say the air force guy will keep his mouth shut and if you and i play it cool no one has to know about you and betty thatll be tough for me to fake jack youre supposed to be a hardass fake it corporal bradley returned to the corridor castillo touched brittons shoulder and went into room when he came out of the toilet there was a large welldressed man with a full neatly trimmed mustache standing with his hands folded in front of him by the door which was closed castillo was startled but quickly recovered if this guy wasnt supposed to be in here britton wouldnt have let him in maybe hes a doctor or something no hes not unless the doctors around here wear shoulder holsters conclusion one more guy from side a senior guy from side senor castillo asked senor castillo si i am el coronel alejandro gellini of side senor castillo castillo crossed the room to him and put out his hand mucho gusto mi coronel castillo said i have just seen ambassador silvio senor i conveyed to him on behalf of the president of the nation our profound regret for what has happened to the female secret service agent and the corps of marines sergeant that was very good of you of the president mi coronel castillo said ambassador silvio told me that you are in charge of security for senora masterson and her children in fact of everybody thats true castillo said and i have come to personally assure you that all the resources of side will be used for the protection of senora masterson and her children and of course the female agent and yourself while you are in argentina i give you my personal guarantee that nothing like this will happen again mi coronel thats very kind but i have to say that el coronel munz is already doing everything possible i have replaced el coronel munz as director of side senor excuse me el coronel munz has been relieved of his duties senor a board will be convened to look into allegations of his dereliction of his duties oh shit and munz knew this was coming thats why i got the little pep talk and the goodbye charley when he left these bastards needed a scapegoatthis had to be someones fault anybodys but some bureaucratsand theyre hanging alfredo out to flap around in the wind sonofabitch thats rotten mi coronel if there will be witnesses before the board you speak of i would like to appear to testify for the defense senor castillo forgive me but this is an internal argentine matter i better shut up right now whatever i say next will be the wrong thing fuck it forgive me mi coronel but any dereliction of el coronel munz would obviously have to do with what has happened to americans and i as the american officer charged with the security of those americans am probably better qualified than anyone else to judge how well el coronel munz discharged his responsibilities i repeat senor castillo that this is an internal argentine matter it stinks mi coronel and you may quote me i regret you feel that way senor colonel gellini said if you have some question my men know how to contact me good evening senor he put out his hand castillo looked at for a long moment and then turned his back that wasnt too smart charley fuck it he heard the door close and took out his cellular and pushed an autodial button ambassador silvio answered on the second buzz silvio castillo sir colonel munzs replacement just came to see me he came to see me i wondered if sending him to see you was the wise thing to do probably not thats a rotten thing to do to munz jack masterson used to say that it took him a long time to figure out the argentines but he finally had anything that goes wrong is always somebody elses fault in this case somebody is colonel munz is there anything we can do for munz ive been thinking of writing a letter expressing our appreciation of colonel munzs services and sending it to the newspapers but it probably wouldnt do much good why not munz is out there hanging in the breeze and god knows hes done everything possible they probably wouldnt print the letter and if they did it would be regarded as an unwelcome meddling by the norteamericanos in argentinas affairs and following that it would start being bandied about that the whole affair was really our fault we shouldnt have sent jack down here knowing that a very wealthy man like jack would almost certainly be a target for kidnappers i dont think whats happened has anything to do with kidnapping castillo said the trouble is we dont know what this is all about the ambassador said how undiplomatic were you charley not as undiplomatic as i would have liked to have been castillo replied i told him i would like to be a witness in munzs defense and then after he told me twice that it was an internal matter i told him it stinks and he knows it and that he can quote me oh how i sometimes yearn to be free of diplomatic restraints silvio said you may not quote me of course but i couldnt have said it any better myself charley chuckled thank you sir i expect youre still waiting for the young lady to come out of the operating room yes sir please let me know as soon as you know something silvio said i just sent a car to pick up dr mellener to take him to jorge newbery to meet the pilot and see what medical equipment is on the gulfstream thank you two after talking to the ambassador castillo had just enough time to see that the battery on his cellular was running low and to slip it in his pocket when the door to room swung inward and two somewhat burly nurses in operatingroomblue uniforms pushed in a gurney a good deal less gently than charley would have preferred they transferred the body on the gurney to the hospital bed and connected it to an array of wires and clear plastic tubing it was only after the heavier of the two nurses had settled in a chair by the side of the bed it looked as if she planned to be there for a whilethat charley could get close enough to the bed to get a look at betty all of bettys body but her face and one arm was wrapped in pale blue sheets and most of her face was hidden under bandages what he could see of it was grayish and looked distorted he felt woozy again the door swung open and dr santa claus waddled into the room his surgical mask was hanging from his neck and his surgical blues were bloodspotted he smiled at charley and held up both hands balled into fists with the thumbs extended then he saw charleys face get out of that chair he ordered the nurse as he quickly and firmly led charley to her chair and sat him down in it put your head between your knees he ordered as he firmly shoved charleys head into that position charley had no idea how long he was in that position for the next thing he became aware of was a vial of aromatic spirits of ammonia under his nose he pushed it away and sat up usually dr santa claus observed dryly his german accent subtle yet clearly evident i have to do that to husbands who insist on seeing the miracle of birth themselves are you all right charley felt dr santa clauss hands on his face and then became aware that the surgeon was holding his eyes open apparently to examine them then he answered his own question youre all right thank you castillo said then how did the operation go procedures plural the surgeon said the trauma to the wound in the patients leg was far less severe than it could have been there was some musculature damage and she will find walking painful for some time visavis the wound in the groin area i saw no damage of any consequence to the reproductive organs what the fuck does that mean no damage of any consequence and while the area will likely be quite painful for some timecontributing to the discomfort when the patient movesi can see no indication that the patient will not fully recover well thank you god for that the trauma to the patients jaw is problematical the initial trauma plus the trauma caused by the removal of the projectile which was rather deeply embedded caused both fracturing and splintering i have immobilized her jaw which means she will not be able to take solid food for some time just as soon as dr koos is available hes the fellow whos skiing right id like him to look at the patient doctor ive arranged for an airplane to fly her to the united states as soon as she is able to travel can you tell me when that will be the surgeon did not reply directly theres a very good orthognathic surgeon at the university of pennsylvania hospital he said chap by the name of rieger william rieger what kind of a surgeon orthognathic the surgeon repeated actually something like this requires three specialists an orthognathicista plastic reconstructive surgeon and an orthodontist may i have that doctors name again and would you spell orthognathic for me the surgeon corrected castillos botched pronunciation of the term and then spelled it and the name of the physician at the university of pennsylvania castillo wrote it down she should be able to travel presuming she will be accompanied by a physician and a nurse sometime tomorrow i will prepare a packageher xrays a report of the procedures she has undergone a record of her pharmacology et ceteraand have it available for you thank you i presume you intend to stay with her until she wakes up yes i do it will be some time before she wakes up at all and when she does the drugs i have prescribed for the pain will be having their effect i dont suppose youd listen to my suggestion that you go home and get a good nights rest yourself and come back in the morning i doubt if shell even recognize you tonight ill stay ill check in on her later dr santa claus said and walked out of the room castillo followed him out corporal lester bradley usmc had acquired a second folding chair somewhere and was sitting beside jack britton bettys going to live castillo told them but the sooner we get her to philadelphia the better dr whatsisname he gestured at the surgeon who had just reached the elevator bank gave me the name of a good doctor in philadelphia at the university hospital rieger ever hear of him britton shook his head i need to get on the phone but my batterys about dead castillo said he looked at corporal bradley bradley go get me a battery charger this is a motorola i think he checked then extended the telephone to bradley take a look make sure you get a charger thatll fit with respect sir i dont like leaving you ill be all right for a few minutes castillo said as he reached into his pocket for money not only are side agents controlling who can come onto this floor but special agent britton is here corporal bradley looked doubtful and then on the edge of saying something jesus christ hes working up the courage to ask me why britton cant go buy a charger bradley all you have is your pistol special agent britton has the madsen andto keep you from letting me know you shot expert with the madsenis generally acknowledged to be the best madsen marksman in the secret service aye aye sir corporal bradley said reluctantly as he examined the cell phone he handed it back to castillo ill be as quick as i can sir bradley said and trotted off toward the elevators best madsen marksman in the secret service my ass britton chuckled to the best of my knowledge youre the only madsen marksman in the secret service making you ipso facto its best castillo smiled at him and went back into room the plump nurse had made herself comfortable in a metal folding chair by the window she had her feet resting on an overturned wastebasket and was reading a magazine with a picture of the king of spain on the cover what looked like a kitchen timer was clicking away on the windowsill i guess when that goes off she goes and checks on betty castillo went to the bed and looked down at betty after a couple of moments he gently rested the balls of his fingers on bettys wrist just above the needle that had been inserted in the back of her hand and was dripping something into her vein charley was still there when corporal bradley came quietly into the room and offered whispered apologies for having taken so long then bradley searched the room for a socket into which the cellular charger could be plugged he found one behind the bedside table plugged in the charger and connected it to castillos cellular which chirped encouragingly there you are sir he said good man castillo said and reached for the cellular when connected to the cellular the cord was not long enough for castillo to use it standing up or he immediately learned even when he was sitting in a folding metal chair he sat on the floor next to the bedside table and punched in a long string of numbers from memory there was not an immediate answer and he had just decided it was seven oclocksupper timein san antonio and the kids were making so much noise the phone couldnt be heard or that the el patron of the casa lopez was watching oreilly on fox and didnt want to be disturbed when a voice impatiently snarled what don fernando si this is don carlos castillo heard fernando lopez his cousin exhale in exasperation then fernando said i wondered when you were going to check in gringo youre all over television excuse me live from our fox man in buenos aires long lines of argentines wait patiently outside the national cathedral to pay their last respects to j winslow masterson jesus and since youre el jefe of whats going on down there weve all been sitting here hoping to catch a glimpse of uncle gringo on the tube castillo heard faintly but clearly two female voices one said dont call him that in front of the children for gods sake castillo recognized the voice as that of maria fernandos wife the second said fernando in a tone suggesting both annoyance and sadness castillo recognized that voice too it was that of hisand fernandos grandmother dona alicia castillo as you walk out of the room fernando so abuela cant hear this conversation answer this question carefully was my name or picture or the phrase presidents agent or anything like that on the tube castillo heard fernando say i cant hear him ill go in the library a moment later fernando said okay answer the goddamn question no then how the hell did you know about me being el jefe fernando hesitated long enough for castillo to find the answer to his own question im going to burn that bigmouthed sonofabitch a new anal orifice calm down gringo fernando said fuck you too when youre through with your tantrum let me know jesus christ hes a federal agent he should know better than to run off at the mouth lets start with why hes in the dea i dont give a goddamn ricardo originally wanted to be an army aviator like the family heroes jorge castillo and his son carlos when he couldnt pass that physical he was willing to become an ordinary armor officer like me and when he couldnt pass that physical either and filled with a noble desire to serve his country he settled for the dea all they wanted was somebody with a college degree who could speak spanish you seem to know a lot about the sonofabitch of course i do what the hell does that mean you dont know do you fernando asked incredulously know what for christs sake if you had more than a passing interest in the family carlos maybe you would fernando only calls me carlos when hes really pissed at me get to the goddamn point abuela is ricardos godmother i didnt know that i figured you didnt and when ricardos mother diedhe was thirteen at the time how old were you when your mother died twelve three guesses gringo which really nice old lady who took her godmother vows seriously just about raised ricardo solez i didnt know that castillo admitted softly and he didnt say anything so what happened is abuela called ricardothey have this thing gringo called the telephone which some people use just to say hello how are you and not only when theyre in trouble and want something and he said hey dona alicia guess whos el jefe in charge of finding out who killed jack the stack and protecting his family or words to that effect and our abuela who really is always running off at the mouth called me and said hey fernando guess whos el jefe okay okay im sorry i didnt know which had the whole family sitting in front of the tube hoping to seewhat is it otto calls youthe prodigal son in action castillo didnt reply so what kind of trouble are you in now gringo and how can the family help youre right castillo said does that mean you agree that youre a sonofabitch or that youre in trouble both what kind of trouble gringo fernando said there was now concern in his voice im sitting on the floor of a room in the german hospital in the bed next to me is betty schneider what what the hell is she doing in argentina right now she just came out of the operating room where they took three ninemillimeter bullets from a madsen out of her madre de dios one from the leg one from the jaw and one from what the doctor euphemistically refers to as the groin area is she going to be all right shes going to live thank god yeah i did that at the time special agent schneider suffered her wounds she was being transported in my car from her place of dutythe masterson houseto a bar called the kansas where her boyfriend was waiting for her the most likely scenario is that the bastards who whacked masterson attacked said car in the belief that i was in it i wasnt but what the hell since they were there they stuck a madsen through the drivers window emptied the magazine and succeeded in blowing away the driver a really nice twentyyearold marine named staff sergeant roger markham by putting two maybe three rounds in his head and getting betty three times they didnt get the boyfriend fernando asked and who the hell is he castillo didnt reply after a moment fernando understood no shit when did that happen last night right after she got here wow fernando said you have been busy he paused and then went on so what do you need before you answer that what about you whos covering your back ive got a marine bodyguard castillo said and ricardo and jack brittonremember him the black undercover cop from philadelphia yeah ricardo and jack are sitting on betty tomorrowor no later than the day after tomorrow shell be on a plane to philadelphia shes going to need more surgery for her face and jaw ive got the name of a good doctor at the university of pennsylvania hospital gringo you dont want to send her commercial if i leave at first light tomorrow in the lear i thought about the lear youd have to refuel at least twice so what ive got an air force gulfstream that can make it to philadelphia with only one stop for fuel it also has a hospital configuration what i want you to do is send the lear to keesler air force base in mississippi why there because thats where im taking mastersons body and his wife and kids and i think i will probably need some fast transportation okay were going to be wheelsup here no later than noon tomorrow buenos aires time in a globemaster its about ten hours theres a twohour time difference so well probably be on the ground there at eight eightthirty tomorrow night ill be there i said send the lear and i said ill be there anything else gringo yeah dont call me that when your kids are listening fernando chuckled ill say a prayer for your girlfriend gringo have abuela say one shes probably got more influence than you do watch your back castillo got off the floor stood by the bed looked down at special agent schneider for a long minute then he put his back to the wall slid down and punched another long series of numbers into the cellular supervisory special agent thomas mcguire of the united states secret service answered on the second ring fourzerosevenseven tom is that you charley yeah hows schneider shes out of surgery shes going to be all right but she was pretty badly hurt as soon as she can travel tomorrow or the next dayim going to send her to philadelphia on that air force gulfstream thats one of the reasons im calling before we get into thathow are you im all right what do you need can you arrange for somebody to meet the airplane the surgeon who treated her hey charley shes secret service we take care of our own he paused and then asked incredulously youre not sending her alone jack britton will be with her and a doctor and a nurse the surgeon who treated her here has a packet of recordsxrays her pharmacology et cetera jack will have that i want to make sure hes able to get it to there will be people at the airport theyll do whatever has to be done have the pilot send an inflight advisory as soon as he enters american airspace okay ive got the name of a doctor at the university of pennsylvania whos supposed to be very good give me his name ill check him out william rieger md what does schneider need she took a ninemillimeter bullet in the jaw plus two others in the body but the problem is the jaw the medical specialty isyou better write this down ballpoint in hand i dont even know how to say this she needs an orthognathicist ill spell that he did got it anything else a plastic reconstructive surgeon and an orthodontist castillo finished shell have them thanks what happened charley all we got is that she was shot and her driver got killed they ambushed my car in the back of his mind he heard jack brittons warning if you keep up this its all my fault bullshit somebody importants going to hear you and theyll keep you off the investigation castillo stopped himself and mcguire pursued castillo stuck to the basics it was stopped at a traffic circle near mastersons house somebody got the driver to lower his window stuck a madsen in it and emptied the magazine the driver a marine sergeant named markham took at least two hits in the head as he was trying to back off the doctor thinks what hit schneider were ricochets off the bulletproof glass did that sound professionally dispassionate enough or is mcguire going to see right through it its projectile resistant not bulletproof mcguire corrected him absently you said it was your car you think they were trying to get you i dont know tom just an ordinary lets whack an american any american assassination i dont think so these people are obviously professionals why would they risk something like this going sour for them just to take out a secret service agent unless maybe a they expected you to be in the car and b they know that youre not just a secret service agent but the presidents agent that would put you in the same category as masterson somebody important enough to whackfor whatever reason that brings us back to why did they kill masterson and not mrs masterson when they had the chance mcguire didnt reply for a moment then he said mockingly solemn if you would be interested in the opinion of a lowly but old balding and wise secret service agent there is something rotten in the state of denmark i just wish to hell i knew what it is me too tom what else can i do for you two things ask dick miller to take my officers modelwhich is cleverly concealed behind the books on the bookshelf behind my bedand put it and enough summer clothes for a couple of days in mississippi into one of the carryon bags in the closet and somehow get it down to me in mississippi ill get it for you charley joel and i are going down there on air force one with the boss thanks anything else i asked my cousin fernando to bring his airplane to keesler im not sure theyll let him land there can you fix it i dont think itll be a problem if there is ill call him and tell him where to take it thanks again charley would you take some straight advice from the old irishman im all ears for anything you have to say one scenario that came to my mind is that were dealing with a lunatic or lunaticsnot necessarily ragheads maybe even americanwho get off by whacking important people masterson qualified as a diplomat and as jack the stack that may explain both why they kidnapped the wife and why they didnt kill her they just used her to get to him castillo grunted and it may explain why they tried to whack you the presidents agent is in the same league as a diplomat maybe even more important how much of a secret is that down there somebody tipped the new york times that there is a presidential agent and some other members of the press i dont think my name came out well that might explain the ambush do you know who had the big mouth ive got my suspicions have you got a name im not sure about this tom when people are trying to whack you charley an overdose of decency can be lethal theres an fbi agent down here who i think made me made you how do you thinkdespite the president personally ordering the director to lay off pevsnerthat they still have a locate but do not detain out on me it would be stupid of them but it wouldnt surprise me they really want kennedy this guys name is yung hes attached to the embassy in montevideo supposedly working on money laundering supposedly i ran into howard kennedy hes down there mcguire interrupted his surprise was evident in his voice he was doing what he said he had brought an airplane load of objets dart to the king faisal islamic center and was going to take a load of polo ponies back to arabia oddly enough that sounds legitimate i think thats what he was doing anyway hes gone and i dont think he or pevsner has anything to do with this pevsner wants to be invisible what kennedy wants is what pevsner wants and whacking an american diplomat does not seem to be a good way to be invisible with pevsner you never know anyway kennedy said he knows this guy yung says that hes a hotshot and whatever yungs doing in montevideo has nothing to do with money laundering thats interesting let me see what i can find out about this guy thanks again tom i was about to offer you some serious advice shoot tell me its okay for me to call tony santini and tell him to sit on you until you get out of there tonys with the mastersons i think he should stay there and i have a marine bodyguard who wont let me out of his sight your call charley but the more i think about it i think these people are trying to whack you so be careful i will i just had another thought mcguire said off the wall lets hear it the whackersof schneider if they werent specifically after youare sending a message what kind of a message i havent figured that out yet but part of it could be we can get to you if we want to secret service protection or not i dont know tom i said it was off the wall mcguire said that doesnt mean its not possible it brings up something else tom what about protection for the mastersons in mississippi charley the presidents going to be in mississippi the secret service will be all over keesler and the head of the protection detail has to know how pissed off he is about masterson getting whacked the presidents not going to stay in mississippi good point ill talk to joel and see what he says anything else cant think of anything okay ill see you down there castillo called ambassador silvio and told him that betty was out of the operating room but still unconscious and that her doctor had said she could travel either the next day or the day following then he got off the floor and looked down at betty again she was still out castillo turned to the heavyset nurse how long will she be like this he asked probably for at least an hour senor if she wakes before i get back tell her ill be back castillo ordered i will castillo unplugged the cellular from the charger saw that he now had enough battery remaining to get to the four seasons then unplugged the charger from the wall and put both devices in his pocket then he walked out of the room corporal lester bradley usmc who was sitting beside jack britton got quickly to his feet when he saw castillo castillo met brittons eyes shes still out the nurse says shell be out for an hour or more so corporal bradley and i are going to go pack ill have them move your stuff and hers into my room and settle those bills after were gone tomorrow there will be people to relieve you and solez and got it britton said while im dealing with the hotel bradley will go where his billet is and pack enough clothingincluding his dress bluesfor a week then he will go back to the hotel pick me up and well come back here sir bradley said what my orders are that im not to leave you and why do i need my dress blues because you have the sad duty corporal of taking sergeant markham home and burying him the gunny didnt say anything about that sir the gunny doesnt know about it yet sir i cant go without orders you just got your orders castillo said if it makes you feel better call your gunny and tell him what i have ordered yes sir corporal bradley said doubtfully one of the side agents in the corridor followed castillo and bradley onto the elevator and when the elevator door opened in the basement two more men obviously side agents also were waiting for them castillo wondered how they had been notified he hadnt seen the side man use a cellular obviously stupid one of the other side agents called and said we were getting on the elevator and since it took you some time to figure that out it means youre tired and not thinking clearly sir i am the major querrina of the side with the honor of having your security i speak spanish major charley interrupted him major querrinas relief was visible youre going someplace sir first to the four seasons and while i am in there my bodyguard here is going to the marine barracks or whatever its called to quickly pack a suitcase major querrina looked dubiously at corporal bradley but didnt say anything when hes done that castillo went on hes going to go back to the four seasons and pick me up and were coming back here he turned to bradley where is this place corporal just off libertador bradley started i know where it is querrina interrupted its a twenty to thirtyminute drive from the four seasons is time important i want to get back here as quickly as i can may i suggest sir that we send the corporal to the marine house in one of my cars that will save time and so far as security for yourself is concerned there will be two side cars with you or i could ride with side and send bradley in the embassy car but if i do that and these bastards want towhat did tom mcguire saysend a message by taking me out then i might have two dead marines on my conscience and god i dont want that major querrina has kindly offered one of his cars to take you to the marine house he saw bradleys face drop corporal you will go in one of their cars which will bring you back here to the hospital thats not open for discussion aye aye sir bradley said with a visible lack of enthusiasm three el presidente de la rua suite the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july why dont you fix yourself a drink major castillo said to querrina as they came into the sitting room of the suite i wont be long very kind of you sir but no thank you i have the duty i have it too castillo said but there are exceptions to every rule and i have just decided this is one of those times he walked to the bar and poured an inch and a half of famous grouse into a glass he took a sip and then held the glass up in a second invitation as you say sir there are always exceptions querrina said help yourself i wont be long castillo said and carried his glass into the bedroom and closed the door he found a socket for the cellular charger behind the bedside table and plugged it in when he connected his cellular to it he found that he wasnt going to have to sit on the floor he laid the charging cellular on the bed and then started to pack it didnt take him long and he was just about to zip the bag closed when he remembered the bill hed gotten at the desk there was no sense carrying that around in his pocket for god knows how long and he couldnt just toss it because the teutonically efficient financial department of the tages zeitung demanded a copy of his bills to compare with what american express said he had spent he patted his pockets found the bill and started to put it in his laptop briefcase when a warning light lit up in the back of his brain what the hell is wrong he looked at the bill carefully well the four seasons doesnt give its accommodations away but theres nothing on here out of the ordinary except that its made out to karl gossinger theres nothing wrong with that either except that gossinger entered the country which means castillo didnt and castillos going to leave tomorrow all sorts of questions would be asked about the german national getting on the usaf globemaster with the widow masterson and her husbands body shit you fucked up again inspector clouseau as a practical matter however when argentine immigration shows up at ezeiza i dont think they are going to peer suspiciously at c g castillos passport to see if he entered the country legally especially since c g castillo will be surrounded by side agents so what ill do is hand them my american passport hope they dont look closely and worry about gossingers immigration problems later he put the four seasons bill in the briefcase and checked to make sure gossingers passport was concealed in the lid with his other alter ego identification then he sat on the bed and pushed an autodial number a deepvoiced male answered hola my name is castillo he said in spanish may i speak with senor pevsner please one moment senor castillo glanced around the room and saw something he hadnt seen before on the bedside table on the other side of the bed was some sort of package whatever it was it was wrapped in tissue and a rose lay across it what the hell is that charley i was hoping you would call aleksandr pevsner said in russian were you why to learn that youre all right i heard what happened to your driver and agent well if you heard that from somebody close to colonel munz alex you better get a new source they fired munz i heard that too im sorry about your people charley alex i want the bastards who did that i understand this is personal alex there was a moments hesitation before pevsner replied i would expect nothing less of you as an officer or do you really mean personal i mean really personal alex oh then i really am sorry my friend i spoke with howard just before he left he didnt mention that i asked him to find out what he could about a man named jeanpaul lorimer a un diplomat in paris the next time you speak with him would you tell him that i now really want to know about this man ill have howard contact you where will you be here until about noon tomorrow thats when we leave with mastersons family and his body i doubt if ill hear from him before that then youll be in washington first mississippi then washington tell him to call my cellular or the hotel i will and i will also see what i can learn about this lorimer person jeanpaul lorimer you said right i would really be grateful i hesitate to say this to someone of your background but are you adequately protecting yourself i have two side cars four side agentsincluding a majorand far more reassuring an american marine im not sure is old enough to vote pevsner chuckled then said seriously there are some very dangerous peopleobviously professionals involved in whatevers going on im sure you appreciate that i do you havent had any fresh ideas about what this is all about have you no and no one ive talked topeople one would think would have at least an ideahave any idea either keep asking will you of course and anna will pray for youand yours my friend thank you friends take care of friends my friend well be in touch charley be careful goodbye alex pevsner switched to german not goodbye auf wiedersehen castillo broke the connection then looked at the cellular flash cnn and the new york times have learned that c g castillo the presidents notsosecret agent is a close personal friend of aleksandr pevsner the infamous russian arms dealer and allaround bad guy their source is an unnamed fbi agent whose reports have been reliable in the past shit he put the cellular in his pocket what the hell is in that tissuewrapped package he walked around the bed pushed the rose on top of the package out of the way and untied the bow that held the tissue paper in place the package contained the freshly laundered brassiere and underpants of special agent elizabeth schneider which the room maid had apparently found where they had been kicked under the bed oh jesus castillo breathed with some difficultyhis eyes were wateringcastillo rewrapped the intimate apparel and put it in his laptop briefcase in the space beside the extendable handle then he swallowed hard breathed deeply and picked up his bag and the briefcase and went into the sitting room okay major he said all done lets go four room the german hospital avenida pueyrredon buenos aires argentina july corporal lester bradley usmc was visibly relieved to see castillo when he got off the elevator all packed corporal castillo asked yes sir bradley replied sir the gunny said in case he misses you tomorrow to tell you thanks for what for sending me with sergeant markham castillo nodded but didnt reply he turned to jack britton the hotels moved your stuff and bettys to my room jack the bills taken care of tom mcguire said to tell you to send an inflight advisory as soon as the gulfstream enters american airspace giving your eta in philadelphia the secret service will meet the plane britton nodded send it to who shit castillo thought he said that little detail got overlooked send it to philadelphia approach control with a copy to the office of the secretary of homeland security personal attention secretary hall that ought to get their attention youre also probably going to refuel at macdill air force base theres secret service people there find them and tell them got it castillo nodded and then slowly opened the door to room there wasnt much light just a small lamp on the bedside table over which the stout nurse had draped a blue cloth did she wake up castillo asked softly shes starting to the nurse said castillo walked to the bed and looked down at betty she looked gray the stout nurse tugged at his arm and he turned to look at her she had a cheap white stackable plastic chair in her hands charley had heardhe didnt know if it was truethat they were molded from the recycled plastic of milk cartons and coke bottles you cant just stand there until she wakes up senor the nurse said sit down put your feet on this and try to get a little sleep how the hell am i going to be able to sleep muchas gracias he sat in the folding chair put his feet on the plastic chair and when he was reasonably sure the nurse wasnt watching put his hand up so that he could touch bettys shoulder castillo opened his eyes jack britton was standing beside him extending a coffee mug castillo took the mug as a reflex action what time is it he asked quarter to nine britton said time for you to change shirts shave and head for the cathedral jesus christ i should be in san isidro why the hell didnt you wake me all you were going to do charley was get in the way in san isidro britton said i talked to santini he said to let you sleep castillo got up knocking the plastic chair over as he did your electric razor and a clean shirts in the bathroom britton said and walked out of the room castillo looked down at betty her eyes were open and she was pale but no longer gray hello baby castillo said betty made a grunt that could have meant hi how do you feel betty rolled her eyes and then touched the bandages on her face and then made grunting sounds that after a moment he understood meant cant talk sweetheart youre going to be all right betty pointed to the chair and grunted when he looked confused she repeated the grunts i snore he asked she nodded i love you charley said betty nodded he bent over her and very gently kissed her on the lips more grunts but this time he easily made the translation wiener schnitzel you took three hits castillo said youre going to be all right either tomorrow or the next day youre goingto philadelphia on the gulfstream jack will be with you she nodded then grunted roger he didnt make it baby he went out quick tears ran down her cheeks into the bandages betty pointed to herself then mimed firing a pistol and grunted get bastards he shook his head she grunted damn i have to go with the mastersons charley said she nodded i dont want to leave you she nodded again then mimed something that after a moment he understood was shaving shes telling me to go shave he nodded and walked to the bathroom as he started to pull the door closed she made a loud sound and he quickly turned and looked at her she shook her head and pointed to her eyes he nodded not trusting himself to speak as he shaved he could see her watching him in the mirror when hed finished and had changed his shirt he went to the bed and looked down at her and ran his fingertips over her forehead she raised her balled hand with the thumb extended oh jesus he said softly she pointed to the door he kissed her once more and then turned and walked quickly out of the room xi one catedral metropolitana plaza de mayo buenos aires argentina july when the threecar convoy carrying castillo and corporal lester bradleya leading side car the embassy bmw and a trailing side carapproached the rear of the cathedral castillo saw that the entire block was ringed with brownuniformed gendarmeria national troops armed with submachine guns when he and bradley got out of the embassy car and started for the side door of the church they were stopped and it was only after major querrina more than a little arrogantly flashed his side credentials at the gendarmeria major in charge that they were passed inside in the corridor just inside the door there were uniformed policia federal officers and men in civilian clothing who castillo presumed were side agents they guarded the door to the alcove in which the mastersons would be seated with bradley on his heels he went through the door to the alcove once inside he could see mastersons casket covered by an american flag at each corner of the casket two soldiers one argentine and the other american stood facing outward at parade rest their rifles resting on the ground there were people seated in the alcove across the nave obviously argentine dignitaries there were four empty chairs in the front row which suggested that the president and the foreign minister and their wivesor two other dignitarieshad not yet arrived el coronel alejandro gellini of side was standing to one side of the alcove with another burly mustachioed man castillo guessed was one more side officer gellini met castillos eyes but there was no nod or other sign of recognition castillo looked again at the absolutely rigid soldiers at the corners of the casket the argentines were in a dress uniform that looked as if it dated back to the early nineteenth century they wore black silk top hats with a teninch black brush on the side they were armed with what looked like model mausers which had been chromeplated the americans were in class a uniforms with white pistol belts they were holding chromeplated m rifles on which chromeplated bayonets had been mounted the us army had stopped using the m during the vietnam war but the m which replaced it did not lend itself to the balletlike manual of arms practiced by the old guard castillo had the unkind thought that whatever kind of soldiering they had done before they had been assigned to the rd infantryand to judge from the medals glistening on their tunics they had heard shots fired in angerwhat they were now were actors in a pageant he turned and for the first time saw a first lieutenant in an incredibly crisp and precise old guard uniform standing stiffly almost at parade rest in a corner of the alcove that beret hes wearing looks like those molded leather hats the spanish guardia civil wear what did he do soak it in wax and its not a green beret or even a tan ranger beret anybody who can stumble through basic training gets to wear what he has on thanks to the remarkably stupid idea of the chief of staff that putting a beret on any soldiers head turns him into a warrior the lieutenant looked at castillo but there was no nod nor a hint of a smile and all of those medals glistening on his chest are iwuzthere medals plus of course the expert infantry badge which means hes never been in combat andwhy i am not surprisedhes wearing the ring identifying him as a graduate of the united states military academy at west point more importanthes the officer in charge of a guard detailwhy the hell didnt he ask me who i am or if he knows who i am why didnt he say good morning sir castillo walked over to him good morning lieutenant good morning sir i was wondering how much ammunition your men have the question surprised the lieutenant actually none sir why is that sir were a ceremonial unit you are aware arent you that the man in the casket was murdered yes sir and that last night the bad guyspresumably the same onesmurdered a marine sergeant and seriously wounded a secret service agent yes sir under those circumstances lieutenant dont you think it behooved you to acquire enough ammunition for your men so that they could at least defend themselves the lieutenant didnt reply and possibly even be in a position to contribute to the defense of mrs masterson and her children should that situation arise the lieutenant colored but did not reply to answer the unspoken question in your eyes lieutenantto wit who the fuck is this civilian questioning the behavior of a professional officer such as myselfim major c g castillo us army charged with the security of this operation permission to speak sir granted sir i have been taking my direction from the defense attache and sir i can only presume that if he wanted my men to have live ammunition he would have issued live ammunition lieutenant i was a boy scout therefore even before i was told by my tactical officer at that school on the hudson river of which we are both graduates that the second great commandment for any officerright after take care of your menis that he be prepared for the unexpected i knew that be prepared is a commendable philosophy to follow since you were apparently asleep when your tac officer tried to impart that philosophy to you i suggest you write it down so you wont forget it yes sir castillo heard the door to the alcove open and turned ambassador silvio and alex darby came through the door jesus castillo suddenly thought what was that all about why did i jump all over that guy not that he didnt deserve it because youre angry with the world and want to vent it on somebody and he was there but it wasnt smart good morning sir castillo said alex the mastersons are three minutes out the ambassador said we just got a call from mr santini yes sir what i would like to do silvio went on if its all right with you is stay behind when the mastersons go to ezeiza then go out there with the casket anything you want to do sir is fine with me tony needs to know charley if youre going to go out there with the mastersons darby said tony has more experience than i do castillo said i dont want to get in his way then ill go with the family darby said my wife and i will fine and ill go out there with the ambassador okay the ambassador said lets go find our seats alex a moment after they had left castillo decided he should be outside when the mastersons arrived and walked out of the alcove corporal lester bradley followed on his heels they found themselves standing alone in the narrow street outside the church i wonder where the hell the gendarmes are then he saw there were gendarmes at either end of the street some were blocking the street where it entered plaza de mayo at the other end a gendarme was making policemanlike trafficcontrol gestures and a moment later a peugeot sedan started backing into the street an embassy bmw followed then a gmc yukon xl i guess theyre backing the convoy in so they can get out quick lester said my thoughts exactly corporal bradley permission to speak sir granted you really ate that lieutenant a new asshole didnt you sir bradley said admiringly you werent supposed to hear that corporal hear what sir castillo smiled at him and shook his head bradley pointed up the street tony santini and two other americans whose faces castillo recognized but whose names he didnt know were walking quickly down the street to them both were wearing topcoats castillo knew concealed submachine guns hows schneider santini greeted him awake and hurting she was really unhappy that she didnt hit one of the bastards with the one shot she got off britton and a dea agent named ricardo solez are with her you checked inside santini asked nodding toward the cathedral two embassy yukons had now backed down the street to where they were standing one of them discharged six americans three armed with m rifles two with uzi submachine guns and one with a madsen santini motioned one of the men with an uzi to them and then looked at castillo you checked inside he repeated castillo nodded argentine vips but neither the president nor the foreign minister is across the aisle they probably want to come in last for the show santini said the ambassador and darby and wives are here castillo went on darby and his wife want to go to ezeiza with you and the mastersons the ambassador wants to go with the casket and you i thought thats what id do santini nodded scenario he said masterson family convoy leaves we head for ezeiza via avenida julio and the autopista as soon as the street is clear the ambassadors car the embassy yukonsthree one for the casket two for the honor guardplus a bus for the argentine soldiers back in here with the side tail vehicles mass is over honor guard moves casket to yukons that convoy takes same route to ezeiza okay with you fine wheres your car around the corner castillo said gesturing with two side cars id say go with the ambassador but these side people are not going to like it if theyre not in the parade your call id say screw them but theyre liable to insist and cause trouble i agree ill have your car and theirs lined up back there santini said pointing to the rear of the cathedral when the side and embassy lead cars pull out of the street the ambassadors car will get in the line and then after the yukon with the casket passes youll get in the line with your side cars then everybody else okay tony you know what youre doing well do whatever you think we should santini nodded then turned to the man with the uzi you heard that yes sir set it up yes sir santini raised his voice for the benefit of those out of earshot im going to check inside if everything looks all right we take the mastersons in you want me to go inside with you castillo asked your call charley ill follow the mastersons in castillo said santini nodded and entered the cathedral ninety seconds later he came out again okay we move them he ordered and walked quickly to the closest yukon and opened the rear side door a very tall slim girl of thirteen or so got out first santini smiled at her then showed her the door to the cathedral then a tenyearold boy got out and followed his sister into the cathedral and then mrs masterson climbed down from the yukon she looked at castillo and then turned back to the truck just climb over the seat jim she ordered and then a sixyearold appeared in the open door mrs masterson put her arm around his shoulders and led him toward the door in the cathedral wall as she passed castillo she said i cant tell you how sorry i am about betty and the marine castillo didnt reply the only difference between the masterson kids and pevsners kids is the color of their skin same sexes same ages same intelligent eyes wrong theres one more difference some sonofabitch shot the masterson kids daddy castillo followed mrs masterson and the sixyearold into the cathedral the president of the republic of argentina whose face castillo recognized was now sitting across the nave of the cathedral with another man and two women who castillo guessed were the foreign minister and the appropriate wives colonel gellini stood behind the president the organ which had been playing softly suddenly changed pitch and volume and castillo heard the scuffling of feet as people stood up thirty seconds later a crucifer appeared in the nave carrying an enormous golden cross and leading a long procession of richly garbed clergy in two parallel columns which split to go around the flagdraped casket of the late j winslow masterson two estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay july jeanpaul bertrand had been sitting in his silk sulka dressing robe before the wide flatscreen sony television in his bedroom since nine oclock watching the ceremonies marking the departure of j winslow masterson from argentina first on argentinas channel nine and then on bbc cnn and deutsche welle and now on channel nine again jeanpaul lorimer had acquired a uruguayan immigration stamp on jeanpaul bertrands lebanese passport indicating bertrand had legally entered uruguay on july fourth and another document dated the next day attesting to his legal residence in that country as an immigrant july fourth of course predated by nine days jeanpaullorimers having gone missing from his apartment in paris it was unlikely that any party attempting to find lorimer would be interested in anyone crossing any border on a date prior to a date lorimer was known to have been in paris he could of course have picked any date to be placed on the passportthe immigration stamp and the certificate of legal residence had cost him ten thousand us dollars in cashbut he had picked as a fey notion july fourth because it was now his as well as the united states independence day once jeanpaul bertrand had the documents in his safe at shangrila jeanpaul lorimer had ceased to exist and jeanpaul bertrand couldafter a suitable period of course of at least eighteen months probably two years during which he would be very discreetget on with his life bertrand had been a little surprised at the amount of attention jack mastersons murder had caused around the world he would not have thought the bbc or deutsche welle would have had nearly the interest in the murder of a relatively unimportant american diplomat that they showed jack had been the chief of mission not the ambassador and buenos aires was not really a major capital city of the world although in honesty it had to be admitted that its restaurants did approach the level of those in paris he was not surprised by the attention being paid by argentine and american television jack had been shot in argentina which explained the argentine interest in all the time jeanpaul had been coming to uruguay and especiallysince satellite television had become available he had seen with mingled amusement and disgust that argentine television was even more devoted to mindless game shows and gore than american television which was really saying something the coverage of the murderand todays eventsby american television seemed to be based more on jacks fame as the basketball player who had been paid sixty million dollars for getting himself run over by a beer truck than on his status as a diplomat they had even sought out and placed the driver of the truck on the screen asking his opinion of the murder of the man obviously destined for basketball greatness before the unfortunate accident and of course his fellow players both from notre dame and the boston celtics had been asked for their opinions of what had happened to jack the stack and what effect it would have on basketball and the nation generally jeanpaul had always been amused and a little disgusted that a basketball team whose name proclaimed celtic heritage had been willing to pay an obscene amount of money to an obvious descendant of the tutsi tribes of rwanda and burundi for his skill in being able to put an inflated leather sphere through a hoop from the comments of some of jacks former playmates jeanpaul was forced to conclude that many of them had no idea where argentina was or what jack the stack was doing there at the time of his demise one of them who had apparently heard that jack was chief of mission extrapolated this to conclude that jack was a missionary bringing christianity to the savage pagans of argentina and expressed his happiness that jack had found jesus before going to meet his maker jeanpaul had also been surprised by the long lines of argentines who had filed into the catedral metropolitana to pass by jacks casket he wondered if it was idle curiosity or had something to do with the funeral of pope john paulalso splendidly covered on television or had been arranged by the argentine government he suspected it was a combination of all three factors he had hoped to see more of betsy and the childrenthey were after all his sister and niece and nephews and god alone knew when or if he would see them again he didnt see them at all at the cathedral there had been a shot from a helicopter of a convoy of vehicles racing on the autopista toward the ezeiza airport that was described as the one carrying the masterson family but that might have been journalistic license and anyway nothing could be seen of the inside of the three large sport utility trucks in the convoy there was a very quick glimpse of them at the airfield obviously taken with a camera kept some distance from the huge us air force transport onto which they were rushed surrounded by perhaps a dozen probably more heavily armed us soldiers that whole scene offended but did not surprise jeanpaul bertrand it was another manifestation of american arrogance the thing to do diplomatically using the term correctlywould be for the us government to have sent a civilian airliner to transport jacks body and his family home not a menacing military transport painted in camouflage colors that more than likely had landed in iraq or afghanistanor some other place where the united states was flexing its military muscles in flagrant disregard of the wishes of the united nationswithin the past week and if it was necessary to provide securitywhich in itself was insulting to argentinato do it with some discretion guards in civilian clothing with their weapons concealed would have been appropriate soldiers armed with machine guns were not jeanpaul corrected himself those arent soldiers theyre something else air force special operators wearing those funny hats with one side pinned up like the australians theyrewhat do they call themair commandos that distinction is almost certainly lost on the argentines what they see is heavily armed norteamericanos and a north american warplane sitting on their soil as if they own it will the americans ever learn probably almost certainly not i have seen this sort of thing countless times before the only difference is this time i have no reason to be shamed and embarrassed by the arrogance of my fellow americans for i am now jeanpaul bertrand lebanese citizen currently resident in uruguay nothing much happened on the television screen for the next couple of minutesreplays of the activity at the cathedral the convoy on the way to the airport and the far too brief glimpse of his sister and niece and nephews being herded onto the air force transportand jeanpaulhad just stood up intending to go into his toilet when another convoy racing down the autopista came onto the screen this convoy the announcer solemnly intoned carried the last remains of j winslow masterson now the posthumous recipient of argentinas grand cross of the great liberator jeanpaul bertrand sat back down and watched as the convoy approached the airfield and was waved through a heavily guarded gate and onto the tarmac before the terminal where the enormous transport waited for it the soldiershe corrected himself againthe machine gunarmed air commandos were out again protecting the airplane as if they expected iraqi terrorists to attempt to seize it at any moment now more soldiers appeared these were really soldiers wearing their dress uniforms some of them lined up at the rear ramp of the airplane and half a dozen of them went to the rear of one of the sport utility trucks opened the door and started to remove a flagdraped casket when they had it out they hoisted it onto their shoulders and started at a stiff and incredibly slow pace to carry it up the ramp and into the airplane the air commandos gave the hand salute some other people got out of the trucks jeanpaul had no idea who they were they went into the airplane a minute or so later four people two men and two women came back out they were followed by eight or ten other people some of themincluding two marinesin uniform they all headed for the yukons and got into them the remaining soldiers and the air commandos went quickly up the ramp and into the airplane the four people who had come out of it watched as the ramp of the airplane began to close and then got in two of the trucks the huge transport began to move jeanpaul bertrand watched his television until it showed the airplane racing down the runway and lifting off and then he went to the toilet three aeropuerto internacional ministro pistarini de ezeiza buenos aires argentina july colonel jacob d torine usaf who was wearing a flight suit had been standing on the tarmac beside the open ramp of the globemaster iii when the first convoy had arrived he had saluted when mrs masterson and her children surrounded by the protection detail approached the ramp my name is torine mrs masterson im your pilot if youll follow me please she smiled at him but said nothing he led them down the cavernous cargo area of the aircraft past the strappeddown flagcovered casket of sergeant roger markham usmc a marine sergeant standing at the head of the casket softly called atenhut and he and a second marine who was standing at the foot of the casket saluted torine led the mastersons up a shallow flight of stairs to an area immediately behind the flight deck here there was seating for the backup flight crew two rows of airline seats eight in all which often doubled with the armrests removed as beds torine installed the mastersons in the front row where the kids would be able to see the cockpit pointed out the toilet and offered them coffee or a coke there were no takers ill be with you in a moment torine said just as soon as everybodys aboard mrs masterson nodded made a thin smile but again said nothing torine went back to the ramp where the loadmaster a grayhaired air force chief master sergeant was waiting for him how we doing torine asked there was an unexpected bonus the chief master sergeant said the caterers lunch and dinner came with wine which you of course declined with thanks knowing that consumption of intoxicants aboard usaf aircraft is strictly forbidden the chief master sergeant chuckled nice food he said chicken and pasta for lunch filet mignon and broiled salmon for dinner and very cheap and the headset the chief master sergeant held up a wireless headset thank you torine said the chief master sergeant gestured toward the terminal a second convoy of yukons and security vehicles was approaching the globemaster c g castillo got out of an embassy bmw and walked to the ramp a marine corporal went to the trunk of the bmw and took luggage from it then followed castillo to the ramp put that inside corporal and then find yourself a seat castillo ordered and then turned to torine good morning sir how is she charley her jaw is wired shut castillo said but she was awake and reasonably comfortable when i left her torine shook his head sympathetically and then said i spoke with colonel newley a few minutes ago he assured me that the gulfstream has been placed in the ambulance configuration and is ready to go wheelsup on thirty minutes notice thank you chief master sergeant dotterman this is major castillo sergeant dotterman saluted the colonels told me a good deal about you sir he held out the wireless headset intercom is up he said indicating a switch down is whatever radio the pilot is using castillo examined the headset and then put it on voiceactivated sergeant dotterman said castillo blew into the small microphone and then nodded signifying both that he understood and that the device was working the flagdraped casket of j winslow masterson on the shoulders of the honor guard of the old guard was now very slowly approaching the ramp i better go up front charley torine said dotterman will let me know when everybodys onboard yes sir castillo and dotterman said almost in chorus the honor guard pallbearers slowmarched up the ramp and into the airplane with the casket dotterman followed them inside to supervise its placement and tiedown castillo turned to watch and saw that dotterman was placing it aft of sergeant markhams casket and decided that meant they were going to unload masterson first hows special agent schneider ambassador silvio asked startling castillo when he turned to look at him he saw that mrs silvio alex darby and another woman probably mrs darby were also standing at the bottom of the ramp she was awake when i left the hospital her jaw is wired shut the ambassador introduced mrs darby then said my wife and mrs darby if you think its a good idea will go to the hospital from here to let her know shes not alone i think thats a wonderful idea thank you castillo said and then had a sudden thought wheres santini darby pointed tony santini an m rifle cradled in his arms like a hunter was standing on the cab of an enormous yellow fire engine when he saw castillo looking santini waved alex castillo said returning the wave tell him thanks and that ill be in touch please well tell the mastersons goodbye and then let you get out of here ambassador silvio said castillo nodded as soon as they had moved into the fuselage the old guard lieutenant walkedmore accurately marched down the ramp to castillo came to attention and saluted good morning lieutenant castillo said that was well done at the cathedral and here thank you sir the lieutenant replied and then handed castillo a handful of ribbon and a gold medal mr mastersons grand cross of the great liberator sir i took the liberty of removing it from the colors good thinking lieutenant thank you no presentation box i gather none that i saw sir castillo looked around to make sure no one was watching then put the medal in his trousers pocket ill see that mrs masterson gets this thank you yes sir the lieutenant said saluted again did a crisp aboutface movement and marched back up the ramp castillo watched as he went the difference between me and that natty young officerwhen i was out of hudson high as long as hes been outwas that i had already fallen under the mentorshipgeneral naylor called it the corrupting influenceof general bruce j mcnab and had already acquired at least some of his contempt for the spitandpolish army and a devout belief in the scotty mcnab definition of an officers duty get the job done and take care of your men and if the rules get in the way screw the rules ambassador silvio alex darby and their wives came back through the fuselage darby wordlessly offered his hand and then after the wives had done the same started to help the highheeled women down the ramp ambassador silvio put out his hand i expect well be seeing more of one another he asked yes sir im sure we will castillo said and then remembered something i wont be needing this anymore sir thank you he took the mm beretta from the small of his back cleared its action and handed it to the ambassador who matteroffactly stuck it in his waistband muchas gracias mi amigo silvio said and i dont mean only for the pistol then he touched castillos shoulder and walked quickly down the ramp the moment he had cleared it the air commandos who had been on perimeter guard came trotting up to it the moment the last of them had cleared the door there was the whine of an electric motor and the ramp started to retract castillo saw chief master sergeant dotterman with his hand on the ramp control and then a moment later heard his voice on the headset all aboard and closing the door colonel roger that torines voice came over the headset starting number three five seconds after that dotterman reported all closed colonel roger that starting number two castillo looked at dotterman dotterman smiling was bowing him into the fuselage in an after you gaston gesture castillo smiled back what i should do now is give mrs masterson her husbands medal fuck it i dont want to see her right now castillo sat down in the nearest aluminum pipeframed nylon seat next to one of the air commandos and fastened the seat harness then he moved the switch on the headseat to the radio position ezeiza us air force zerothreeeightone torines voice called ready to taxi ten seconds later the globemaster iii began to move they were still climbing to cruise altitude when castillo unfastened his harness and made his way through the fuselage and up the stairs to the airliner seats he stopped took the grand cross of the great liberator from his pocket folded the silk ribbon as best he could and then walked to mrs elizabeth masterson mrs masterson he said extending it to her the officer in charge of the honor guard unpinned this from the colors and asked me to give it to you she took it from him looked at it for a long moment softly said thank you then put the medal in her purse when she looked up again castillo had moved to the head of the stairs mr castillo she called he stopped when she realized that he was not going to come to her she unfastened her seat belt and walked to him i wanted to thank you for everything youve done she said and to tell you how sorry i am about miss schneider and the sergeant castillo didnt reply he looked past her for a long moment told himself to keep his thoughts private but when he looked back at mrs masterson the scene of the shotup embassy bmw fresh in his mind he said his name was sergeant roger markham mrs masterson he was twenty years old and in my judgment that very nice young man would still be alive and special agent schneider would not be in a hospital bed with three bullet woundsand her jaw wired shutif you had been truthful about the people who abducted you how dare you talk to me in that manner my orders are to protect you and your children mrs masterson i have done that to the best of my ability and will continue to do sountil i am relieved of the responsibility but there is nothing in my orders requiring me to politely pretend i think you were telling the truth to the officers investigating your abduction and your husbands murder when you and i both know you were lying he met her eyes for a moment then nodded and went down the stairs to the cargo section of the fuselage twenty minutes later chief master sergeant dotterman walked up to castillo who was sitting on the floor of the fuselagea good deal of experience in riding globemasters had taught him the floor was far more comfortable than the aluminum pipesupported nylon seatsand mimed that castillo should put the headset back on when he had done so dotterman leaned over him and flipped the switch on the headset to intercom castillo you on torines voice asked yes sir you want to come up here please yes sir well i put jake torine on the spot didnt i in addition to flying the airplane and his other worries hes had to contend with a furious female who didnt like being called a liar and wasted no time whatever to complain to the most senior officer she could find and he didnt need that torine is one of the good guys but am i sorry i told her what i thought not one goddamn little bit castillo pulled himself to his feet and went through the fuselage again and up to the cockpit there was no way he could avoid seeing mrs masterson but if she saw him she gave no sign he walked between the pilots and copilots seats and when colonel torine didnt seem to be aware of his presence leaned down and touched his shoulder torine turned and looked up at him smiling dotterman told me you were on the floor back there torine said if you want to lay down charley and god knows you have every reason to be tired just pull the armrests out from one of the seats ive even got a blanket and pillow ill loan you hes neither pissed nor embarrassed which he would be if the widow masterson had complained to him about me well maybe shes waiting to tell the president what a coldhearted bastard i am and i really dont care if she does thanks but im not sleepy sir well then maybe youd like to sit in the right seat for a while and see how real pilots aerial navigate over the amazon jungle is that where we are over the amazon jungle i dont know where we are torine said he nodded at the copilot im relying on him and my painful experience with him has been that he often gets lost in a closet how about getting out of there bill and well see if this army aviator can find out where we are the copilot smiled and unfastened his harness when castillo had taken his seat and strapped himself in the copilot leaned over him and pointed out a screen on which their location was shown a welldetailed electronicmap showed that they were about two hundred miles from buenos aires a few miles north of rosario the screen also showed their altitude airspeed course and the distance and time to alternate airfields castillo was familiar with the equipment there was a civilian version of it in the lear bombardier guided by data from threeor moresatellites fed through a computer the location and ground speed provided on the screen was accurate within six feet and three miles per hour i wonder if tom got fernando permission to land at keesler that gadget takes all the fun out of flying colonel torine said it was much more fun when you could stick your head out into the slipstream and see if the highway was still under you four keesler air force base biloxi mississippi july as castillo sat in the jump seat while torine lined the globemaster up with the keesler runway and then smoothly sat the huge airplane down he could see bathed in the light of maybe a dozen polemounted banks of highintensity floodlights the boeing the air force called it the vca which when the president of the united states was aboard became air force oneparked at the end of the taxiway paralleling the runway it was being protected not only by sentries but also by a half dozen humvees with caliber machine guns threezeroone on the ground at three five past the hour torine said into his microphone close me out please and taxi instructions please air force threezeroone this is keesler ground control halt in place at the termination of your landing roll be advised that you will be met by a followme vehicle be advised that you will be met by a vehicle which will take major c castillo from the aircraft to his ground destination acknowledge keesler torine responded threezeroone understands halt in place at termination of landing roll further understand followme vehicle will be there further understand major castillo will be taken by a second vehicle to his ground destination that is correct threezeroone the copilot touched torines shoulder and then pointed out the window an air force blue pickup truck with a follow me sign mounted on the bed and a gmc yukon were sitting side by side on a taxiway access ramp dotterman you heard that torine asked im by the side door colonel torine turned to castillo why do i think your ground destination is that keesler the copilot said into his microphone threezeroone is halted on the runway we have you in sight threezeroone ground control replied colonel dotterman announced here comes a suburban and a followme the suburban sees me hes coming up this side of the fuselage thats probably a yukon dotterman torine said whats the difference i dont know torine confessed people getting out of the whateverthehellitis chief master sergeant dotterman reported when colonel torine started to unfasten his harness with the obvious intention of leaving his seat castillo got off the jump seat folded it out of the way and stood in the cockpit door he felt mrs mastersons eyes on him he met them for a moment and then looked away thirty seconds later a tall slim marine lieutenant colonel in dress blues to which splendor had been added the golden aiguillettes worn by aides to the commander in chief appeared at the head of the stairs he glanced at castillo then headed straight for mrs masterson mrs masterson im lieutenant colonel mcelroy an aide to the president whats going to happen next is the aircraft will taxi to a hangar ambassador and mrs lorimer will come onboard at that time im special agent willkie of the secret service a stocky man announced in castillos ear are you mr castillo castillo was annoyed at the interruption mrs masterson had locked eyes with him again and had been paying far more attention to him than to the presidents aide and she wasnt angry it wasnt a now youre going to get yours you sonofabitch look it was an i need your help look or a we have to talk look or both whats going on and now this sonofabitch is in the way castillo stopped himself at the last split second from pushing the secret service agent out of the way im castillo will you come with me please sir the president would like a word with you castillo nodded special agent willkie started down the stairs as castillo turned to follow him he looked at mrs masterson again their eyes locked again she looks distressed almost frightened she doesnt want me to leave mrs masterson stood up and pushed lieutenant colonel mcelroy to one side and called mr castillo yes maam may i have a moment alone with you please yes maam of course she brushed past mcelroy and walked up to the cockpit opening she got so close that castillo backed up which pushed him right up against torine what can i do for you maam castillo asked is something wrong she looked up at him he saw tears forming i was afraid to say anything in buenos aires mr castillo she said my priority was keeping my children safe he nodded elizabeth masterson took a deep breath but now were out of argentina were here she paused and then went on slowly and carefully as if she had rehearsed what she was going to say the people who abducted me wanted me to tell them where my brother is they said that unless i told them they would kill my children one at a time and they said they would kill my children and my parents if i said anything about it and then they killed jac her voice caught she swallowed and went on then they killed my husband to show me they mean what they say and you dont know where your brother is do you castillo asked gently she shook her head castillo put his hands on her arms listen to me mrs masterson you have my word that no one is going to hurt your children or your parents or you i just didnt know what to do thats why i didnt mr castillo the president is waiting secret service special agent willkie impatiently announced hes just going to have to wait castillo snapped and then looked down at mrs masterson again she was shaking her head and smiling through her tears he looked at her quizzically i knew i was going to have to tell somebody she said and i guess i was right in choosing you i dont under how many people do you think there are who on being told the president of the united states is waiting for them would say hes just going to have to wait that just may be an indication that i act impulsively castillo said no mr castillo what it is is that youre what alex darby told me you are he looked at her quizzically again she explained one really tough sonofabitch and just the guy you need in your corner when youre really in trouble well if you believe that maam please believe im in your corner mr castillo for gods sake the president is waiting special agent willkie called ill be back as soon as i can castillo said she reached up and kissed his cheek said thank you and went back to her seat castillo looked at colonel torine you heard all that right torine his face stern nodded would you come with me please i may need a witness sure torine said turned his head and raised his voice bill im leaving the aircraft its now yours yes sir when special agent willkie saw colonel torine follow castillo down the stairs he looked at him in surprise and then announced the president said nothing about wanting to see anyone but you mr castillo well then i guess hell be surprised when he sees colonel torine wont he as soon as they were standing on the runway beside the globemaster special agent willkie spoke to his lapel microphone mr castillo insists on bringing the pilot with him not the pilot my friend torine said not very pleasantly colonel jake torine us air force he says his name is torine special agent willkie said to his lapel microphone thirty seconds later special agent willkie said if youll get in the yukon please gentlemen i will escort you to the president they had been in the backseat of the yukon about thirty seconds when torine touched castillos shoulder and pointed out the window castillo looked and saw soldiers armed with car rifles forming a perimeter guard around the globemaster i didnt know they trusted air force guys with loaded guns castillo said torine smirked those arent air force guys wiseass theyre soldiers almost certainly special forces and probably delta force and at least one of them is gray fox that is sergeant orson isnt it castillo looked one of the soldiers was a tall blond sergeant first class named orson the last time castillo had seen the gray fox communicatorsniper was in costa rica where orson had very professionally taken out two of the terrorists who had stolen the ill be damned thats orson all right what the hell is going on the yukon stopped in front of the wide flight of stairs that had been rolled up to the huge boeing and castillo and torine got out there was a knot of people guarding access to the stairs including two females who were obviously secret service agents one of them spoke to her lapel microphone and then turned to castillo and torine you may board gentlemen she said the president is expecting you xii one aboard air force one keesler air force base biloxi mississippi july although hed seen the presidential aircraft before and had been closer to both of them than most people ever get castillo had never actually been inside one of them the first thing he noticed when he stepped through the door was that the interior was unlike any other that hed ever seen on any boeing or for that matter on any airliner instead of row after row of seats he found himself looking at the seal of the president of the united states mounted on a creamcolored wall running as far as he could seefifty feet or soalong the left side of the aircraft down to where there was a bend in the corridor that the wall formed the second thing he noticed was a secret service agent standing in the short section of corridor to his left castillo had heard that the presidential apartment was in the nose of the aircraft under the flight deck and had just decided the secret service agent was guarding the president when a second secret service agent spoke to him this one he knew down the corridor to the door joel isaacson said pointing and then he added good to see you charley castillo shook isaacsons hand as he walked past him but didnt speak the door isaacson made reference to was in the bend of the corridor as castillo got close to it a secret service agent appeared and pushed the door inward castillo stepped through it and found himself in a decentsized conference room there was a large table with eight leatherupholstered armchairs around it they all had seat belts seated at the table were the secretary of state dr natalie cohen the secretary of homeland security the honorable matthew hall the director of national intelligenceambassador charles montvale and general allan naylor commander in chief of centcom the president of the united states was sprawled on a leather sectional couch against the interior wall talking on the telephone when he saw castillo he smiled and signaled for him to come in and to take one of the unoccupied armchairs at the table then when he saw colonel torine he signaled for him to come in and to take another of the armchairs castillo got a smile from the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security general naylor nodded at him and the director of national intelligence looked at him in what castillo thought was both curiosity and disapproval then the president said into the phone sweetheart charley castillo just walked in the door ill have to call you later with a little bit of difficulty the president replaced the handset in a wall rack then stood up and walked to castillo as castillo started to get up the president waved his right hand to order him to stay seated and then offered the hand to him good to see you charley he said and then turned to torine and you too colonel i was a little surprised to hear youd flown the globemaster down there but then i realized i shouldnt have been you and charley are sort of a team arent you yes sir i suppose we are is it still hot outside the president asked as he walked to the head of the conference table and sat down hot and humid sir torine said wise people dont come to mississippi in the middle of the summer the president lightly proclaimed or go to minnesota in the middle of the winter wise people go to south carolina during any season and never leave there was dutiful laughter two things are going to happen right away the president quickly said next his tone now serious the first because i simply cant stay here for the funeral as much as i would like to is that were making a photoop ceremony of taking mr mastersons casket from the airplane including a band theyre setting that up now i understand well have about fifteen minutes which is time enough to set the second thing thats going to happen in motion he reached under the table and came up with a wellworn leather attache case he opened it and took out two sheets of paper and handed them to general naylor would you please read that aloud general yes sir naylor took the sheets of paper glanced at them a moment then began to read top secretpresidential the white house washington dc july presidential finding it has been found that the assassination of j winslow masterson chief of mission of the united states embassy in buenos aires argentina the abduction of mr mastersons wife mrs elizabeth lorimer masterson the assassination of sergeant roger markham usmc and the attempted assassination of secret service special agent elizabeth t schneider indicate beyond any reasonable doubt the existence of a continuing plot or plots by terrorists or terrorist organizations to cause serious damage to the interests of the united states its diplomatic officers and its citizens and that this situation cannot be tolerated it is further found that the efforts and actions taken and to be taken by the several branches of the united states government to detect and apprehend those individuals who committed the terrorist acts previously described and to prevent similar such acts in the future are being and will be hampered and rendered less effective by strict adherence to applicable laws and regulations it is therefore found that clandestine and covert action under the sole supervision of the president is necessary it is directed and ordered that there be immediately established a clandestine and covert organization with the mission of determining the identity of the terrorists involved in the assassinations abduction and attempted assassination previously described and to render them harmless and to perform such other covert and clandestine activities as the president may elect to assign for purposes of concealment the aforementioned clandestine and covert organization will be known as the office of organizational analysis within the department of homeland security funding will initially be from discretional funds of the office of the president the manning of the organization will be decided by the president acting on the advice of the chief office of organizational analysis major carlos g castillo special forces us army is herewith appointed chief office of organizational analysis with immediate effect general naylor stopped reading and looked at the president the finding is witnessed by miss cohen as secretary of state mr president the only sound in the room was that of cold air flowing through ports in the ceiling that deafening silence were hearing major castillo the president said softly after a moment suggests to me that everyone is trying to come up with good and solid reasons why i should tear that finding up and how these objections can be brought diplomatically to my attention so let me save everybody the effort this finding is not open for debate the president looked around the table as he let that sink in then continued i not only want the bastards who murdered masterson and sergeant markham brought down but i want to send a message to whoever is behind them and to anyone else who thinks they can get away with murdering an american diplomat that this president will be as ruthless as necessary to keep this from ever happening again and this is how ive decided is the best way to do that mr president ambassador montvale asked may i ask what my relationship to the major will be im glad you asked charles the president said lets make sure everyone understands this it also applies to natalie and tom of course and to the other secretariesand the attorney general you and they will provide to him whatever he feels is necessary to carry out the mission i have given to him but he answers only to me everyone clear on that there are some potential problems that immediately come charles you can discuss those with major castillo the president interrupted you did hear me say didnt you that this is not open for debate yes i did mr president okay this is ground zero the president said what i would like now is for major castillo to tell us where he believes we are and where hes going from here he looked at castillo okay charley go ahead castillo realized that he was sitting erectly on the edge of the armchair seat like any other junior determined not to miss a word of what would be said by the president or any of the others so vastly senior to a major as a pavlovian reflex he started to stand up as a mark of respect and subordination to those seniors wait a minute if i do that it will signal that a lowly major is delivering a report to his seniors that they can consider with their greater wisdom and accept or reject i dont think the president wants me to do that instead of standing up he slumped back in the chair and crossed his interlocked hands on his chest as if gathering his thoughts which happened to be true he saw that general naylor and colonel torine were looking at him incredulously well lets see if i can get away with this mr president he began sitting up when mrs masterson was being interviewed at the german hospital by mr darby who is the cia station chief in argentina and was a close friend of the mastersons she professed to know absolutely nothing about her abductors i thought she was lying you decided major that she was lying montvale interrupted incredulously yes ambassador montvale i did charley said meeting his eyes and later both mr darby and ambassador silvio agreed with that judgment lying about what charley the president asked more of an omission sir than a mistruth she said she could recall no details whatever of her abduction i didnt believe that the woman montvale said was obviously under the most severe the president held up his hand to silence montvale castillo looked at the president then continued just before we took off from ezeizathe buenos aires airporti gave mrs masterson the medal the grand cross of the great liberator which had been pinned to the colors on mr mastersons casket by the president of argentina she expressed to me her regret for sergeant markhams death and the wounds suffered by special agent schneider im afraid i was less than gracious to her i had just come from the hospital where special agent schneider was lying in pain with her jaw wired shut and sixty seconds before i had walked past sergeant markhams casket what i said to her in effect was that if she had been truthful i thought markham would still be alive and schneider would not have been wounded you called her a liar to her face charley natalie cohen asked in sad disbelief yes maam im afraid i did and what was her reaction the president asked softly not much at the time sir but just now just before we came here she came to me again and said that now that she was in the united states she could talk she told me that her abductors wanted her to tell them where her brother is her brother the president asked jeanpaul lorimer sir he works for the united nations in paris mrs masterson said her abductors threatened to kill her children if she didnt tell them and to kill the children and her family if she revealed any of this and they murdered mr masterson to prove they meant what they were saying sonofabitch the president of the united states said mr president natalie cohen said weve been trying to find mr lorimer for several days without success all we know is that hes not in his apartment and hasnt been in his office mrs masterson said she had no idea where her brother is castillo said and why do you think major montvale asked that mrs masterson chose to confide in you rather than in say ambassador silvio or her friend the cia station chief probably because we had just landed in the united states castillo said if i may mr president colonel torine asked the president waved his permission i was privy to the conversation between major castillo and mrs masterson just now torine said and the reason she gave for her going to major castillo was because she believed what mr darby had told her about major castillo and that was montvale asked apparently sir torine replied mr darby told mrs masterson that he believes that major castillo is this is just about verbatim from mrs mastersonone really tough sonofabitch and just the guy you need in your corner when youre really in trouble the president cocked his head and smiled well for once i find myself in complete agreement with the opinion of a cia station chief that pretty much answer your question charles yes it does mr president castillo saw that general naylor was quietly coughing behind his hand from long experience castillo knew he did this when he wanted to conceal a smile when castillo glanced at secretary hall hall winked at him and didnt bother to try to conceal his smile up yours ambassador montvale you pompous sonofabitch charley thought then caught himself there you go again stupid if theres anybody you should try to get along with its charles montvale the director of national intelligence you havent been in his presence ten minutes and hes already decidedprobably with justificationthat c g castillo is one arrogant little sonofabitch who needs to be cut down to size as quickly as possible the worst thing you can do to a guy like montvale is humiliate him in the presence of his peers and the president of the united states hes not going to forget or forgive that why do you think these people want the brother charley the president asked and who do you think they are i have no idea mr president castillo confessed but i think talking to himpresuming i can find him is the next thing i should do and the un says they dont know where he is natalie the president asked we wanted to contact him when mrs masterson was abducted so that he could deal with the family as their father ambassador lorimer has serious heart problems nothing and all our embassy in paris has been able to come up with is that his car is in his garage his clothing is in his apartment and it looks like hes just taken a trip or something apparently hes pretty much his own boss going wherever he wants whenever he wants these people have killed to show how much they want this fellow the president said so his life is in danger are you going to tell the un that would that get them off the dime sir i presume that the un in new york and paris knows of the masterson murder but not what mrs masterson told charley right no sir ill get on the horn right now to our un ambassador and have him pass that on if you think i should i wish you wouldnt castillo blurted why not natalie cohen asked curiously not offended i have a gut feeling its the wrong thing to do the secretary of state looked at the president his face was thoughtful im about to make a point here so pay attention the president said were going along with castillos gut feeling not because i necessarily agree with it but because i dont feel strongly enough about it to override him and i am the only person who canand from time to time willoverride him okay yes sir dr cohen said what are you going to do about the missing brother charley im going to go to europe and see if i can find him when as soon as im sure mrs masterson and the children are safe sir i gave her my word she will be protected and she will be the president said did you notice some of your delta force buddies out there charley yes sir i did the attorney general agreed with me that in this situation the use of troops to protect the mastersons was justified obviously theres a time limit but for now id say theyre safe mrs masterson asked special agent schneider to find out about private security sir im going to see what i can do that out of the way you want to go to europe as soon as possible yes sir you want to ride to washington with us i suspect that you can get to europe quicker from washington than you can from biloxi sir i asked my cousin to bring the familys airplane here i want to use that not an air force plane a gulfstream maybe i think a civilian airplane would be better sir less conspicuous and very expensive to operate what about that whos going to pay for that sir the last time we used itin the operation flying it to mexico and costa ricait was leased to the secret service i was hoping that could be done again the president looked at secretary hall the secret service had become part of the department of homeland security any problem there matt no sir hall replied and then added its here charley fernando is in the hangar where well hold the ceremony okay then the president said anything else you need right now equipment people its a long list sir the president signaled him to continue id like to stop at fort bragg and pick up a gray fox satellite radio and an operator and take that with us and id like another installed at the nebraska avenue complex and a third to be sent to the embassy in argentina with an operator that will pose no problem will it general naylor the president asked none sir ill get right on the horn to general mcnab anything else charley yes sir id like to borrow one of colonel torines pilots one with overtheocean experience ive never flown across an ocean by myself shouldnt be a problem should it colonel unfortunately it is sir torine said until this moment mr president i had no idea major castillo was not entirely satisfied with my flying skills i am crushed and humiliated beyond words you mean you want to fly his airplane the president asked smiling very much sir so ordered the president said thanks castillo said to torine the president looked at his watch well were out of time ive got to change my shirt while im doing that you can finish your shopping list he walked out of the conference room castillo felt montvales cold eyes on him so what else can we do for you major he asked with emphasis on the major castillo looked at the secretary of state im going to need some help with my passports maam passports plural montvale asked i went to argentina on my german passport i beg your pardon montvale interrupted major castillo has dual citizenship mr ambassador general naylor said suddenly and pointedly sometimes he uses his german nationalityvery effectivelywhen hes on a covert assignment did he come to my aid as loving uncle allan or because montvales attitude toward me got under his skin maybe probably both in one of his many lectures before i went to west point he told me to never forget that being given rank does not carry with it the right to jump on those of junior rank especially in the presence of others which of course i did when i gave that old guard lieutenant hell with corporal lester bradley usmc standing there with both ears open which proves of course that i am not nearly as good an officer as i like to pretend i am go on please major naylor said general gossinger is on argentine immigration records gossinger montvale interrupted whos gossinger this time the secretary of state came to castillos aid charles she said perhaps we could let major castillo finish at least one sentence before we start asking questions montvale for a second glared at her but then he apparently considered that natalie cohen as secretary of state was not only the most senior officer of the presidential cabinetand thus the presiding officer of this ad hoc meeting of members of the cabinetbut a close personal friend of the president and therefore was not to be crossed pardon me major montvale said please continue the argentines have a record of gossinger entering the country dr cohen castillo said there was no immigration check as we left which was lucky for me since i didnt have to produce an american passport which didnt have an entry stamp or the german passport which would have blown that cover so according to the books gossinger is still in argentina and id like to get him out i get the picture she said i suggest we issue you a new american passport which will obviously have no immigration stamps in it at all and then have the cia put an exit stamp on your german passport their documents section is very good at that sort of thing she looked at montvale wouldnt you agree charles that would seem to be the solution montvale said well need a passport photo dr cohen said theres some in my desk in the nebraska complex castillo said charley if youll give me both passports before we leave here secretary hall said ill have joel isaacson pick up the passport photo and then run everything through foggy bottom and langley he knows all the right people in both places he turned to montvale that sound all right to you charles whatever is the most efficient means of accomplishing what has to be done of course would you like me to call dci powell charles and tell him what we need or would you prefer to do that yourself natalie cohen asked ill call him montvale said anything else charley she asked yes maam one more thing theres an fbi agent attached to the embassy in montevideo david william yung jr he was sent to buenos aires when mrs masterson was abducted as someone with kidnapping experience what about him montvale asked he seemed to be unusually interested in me for one thing castillo said i would be too if i were an fbi agent and a young army major was placed in overall charge of a situation like that montvale said castillo looked at both cohen and hall and saw in their eyes that they had taken his meaning and second castillo went on a usually reliable source a former senior fbi official who knows special agent yung told me he doesnt believe yung is really doing what he says hes doing looking into money laundering in my experience the fbi does not confide in outsiders montvale said just who told you the door opened joel isaacson put his head in excuse me he said the president would like mr castillo to join him and i would like to know what yung is really doing charley said very quickly the secretary of state nodded at him the secretary of homeland security gave him a thumbsup castillo got up quickly and started for the door charley hall called your source is your friend from vienna right yes sir well he has proven reliable in the past hasnt he hall said yes sir he has castillo said and went through the door isaacson pulled the door closed he didnt answer my question did he montvale said the president sent for him charles hall said im not accustomed to having junior officers not answering questions i put to them and frankly i dont like it montvale said charles the secretary of state said may i say something of course the impression this meeting left on me is that the president made it clear that he places in major castillo a trust that you and i might not share i picked up on that montvale said just a bit righteously sarcastic the impression this meeting left on me charles secretary hall said is that the president made it absolutelyclear that charley castillo is answerable only to him or did i get that wrong montvale looked at the secretary of state for help when it was not forthcoming he stood up id like to freshen up before we go to the ceremony god alone knows how long well be standing out there in the heat and humidity for that two the presidential suite aboard air force one keesler air force base biloxi mississippi july charley supervisory special agent isaacson said as he put his hand on the door to the presidential suite tom mcguire brought a bag for you containing i desperately hope some summer clothes it does and a i had to clear the bag aboard which meant i had to see what was in it where is it in there isaacson said pointing to a door next to the entrance to the presidential suite its the medical office if the president lets you go in time you could probably get out of those winter clothes its going to be hot as hell in that hangar you will get your reward in heaven joel isaacson isaacson smiled then opened the door to the presidential suite castillo could see what was obviously the presidents private office it contained an angled desk with a highbacked red leather chair bearing the presidential seal in gold facing aft two armchairs facing the desk and a credenza behind the desk mr president isaacson called major castillo is here come on in charley the president called im in the bedroom straight through to the front when charley made his way all the way forward he found the president of the united states supporting himself with one hand on a chest of drawers as he fed his right leg through his trousers there were two single beds in the small area on one of which lay the suit the president had just taken off and on the other the jacket to the suit he was now putting on god youre going to be hot in that the president said as he stuffed his shirt in his trousers tom mcguire brought a summer suit for me sir well as soon as were finished here you better put it on quickly god and the presidential protection detail wait for no man including the president yes sir this wont take long first a quick question whats mrs masterson like very tall and elegant very intelligent is she going to weep maybe get hysterical i doubt that very much mr president thank god for that okay what i didnt say in the conference room was that in order to keep you out of the sight of the eyes in the white house i want you to avoid going there as much as possible yes sir i also told matt hall privately that hell be your conduit to me a threeman loop in other words if hes for some reason not available the switchboard has been told to put you through to me and there will be an any time any area white house pass for you in the guard shack closest to the oeob at all times just identify yourself and theyll pass you yes sir natalie cohen isnt happy with the finding but shell go along with it the director of the fbi and the dci are going to like it less than natalie does but i dont think theyll fight it charles montvale loathes the finding i understand why i suspect that he will be searching for your failures so that he can bring them to my attention im going to speak privately to him if he poses problems tell matt hall or me yes sir and how do you think general naylor regards the finding the president asked sir i think his reaction is much like mine which is that you have given a lot of responsibility and a lot of authority to a very junior officer not without a good deal of thought charley not without a good deal of thought now go change your clothes three keesler air force base biloxi mississippi july jake torine was waiting at the foot of the stairs to air force one when charley castillo came down them they could see the globemaster iii was now backed up against the open doors of a huge hangar and that the hangar was really crowded outside the hangar and just inside it held back by rope barriers and lines of airmen facing them was a huge crowd of spectators farther inside the hangar what looked like a company of air force airmen was formed on one side of the cavernous space across from them was a us marine corps band a reviewing stand with a lectern bearing the presidential seal was in the rear of the hangar facing outward the rear of the stand held maybe fifty american flagsof course therere fifty one for each stateon either side of the presidential flag next to the presidential flag were those of the secretary of state the secretary of homeland security and one that had to be the brandnew flag of the director of national intelligence flanking that were the flags of the army navy air force marine corps and coast guard and maybe a dozen personal flags of the general and flag officers of the armed forcesthe red one with four stars is naylorspresent for the ceremony most of whom were already on the platform standing at parade rest in front of the reviewing stand was a tenman squad of marines in dress uniforms and a second squad composed of two men from each of the armed services each under the command of a crisply uniformed lieutenant and in front of the reviewing stand were two blackdraped catafalques ready to receive the caskets well thats a nice touch theyre going to put markham beside masterson very impressive torine said as the secret service yukon stopped beside the globemaster the white house billed this as a major foreign policy speech the secret service agent driving the yukon said the proof of that was the unruly sea of television cameramen still photographers and what had become known as print journalists held back by barriers and more airmen on both sides of the reviewing stand castillo and torine got out of the yukon and found themselves facing four soldiers wearing green berets and armed with car s im colonel torine the aircraft commander torine began you are armed sir one of the special forces soldiers said to castillo it was an accusation well so much for trying to conceal a under a seersucker jacket yes i am you can pass him sergeant a voice behind them said not only is he the man hes one of us castillo turned to see a very short totally bald man wearing a tweed jacket that didnt come close to fitting around his barrel chest he was cradling a madsen submachine gun in his arm hello vic castillo said offering his hand to cwo victor dallessando special forces usa retired just like old times charley dallessando said you get yourself in the deep doodoo and mcnab sends me to haul you out youre running this dallessando motioned for torine and charley to step over to a spot in the shadow of the globemasters wing where he could speak without being overheard yeah i am he said boy am i glad to hear that castillo exclaimed what have you got twentyfour shooters mostly delta and a few guys from gray fox i saw sergeant orson castillo said actually colonel torine saw him oh hell excuse me colonel this is an old buddy of mine vic dallessando i thought youd know each other why do i think youre not wearing your green beret vic torine said with a smile i hung the fucker up colonel after twentyseven years they medically retired me as a cwo now im a goddamn doubledipping civilian gs assimilated full fucking bird colonel who runs the stockade at fort bragg castillo said i know it well torine said smiling now i know who you are colonel dallessando said youre the air commando who we used to fly our almost correct torine replied former air commando when they made me a full fucking colonel they paroled me from the stockade and put me behind a desk from which mcnab rescued you when charley was looking for that stolen you went with charley to costa rica and flew it back to the states after charley and some of my guys stole it back from the bad guys guilty torine said and hes in on this operation vic castillo said welcome aboard dallessando said smiling and offering his hand what have you got going vic in detail or just the highlights in detail okay naylor called mcnab and told him that your boss hall had called him and said the president wanted either delta or gray fox or both to make sure nothing else happened to the mastersons when they got here i almost had to tie mcnab down to keep him from coming here himself castillo and torine chuckled so we saddled up like i said twentyfour shooters mostly delta but with four guys from gray fox we got two black hawks and two little birds from the th both little birds are gunshipswe can move everybody on the black hawks but you never know when youre going to have to pop somebody then we came here the guy running things is mastersons father big tall drink of water the widows fatherthey call him the ambassador which i guess he wasis a little guy who almost went out with a heart attack so theyre trying to keep him in the dark as much as possible mastersons father has a great big farm not far from here no airstrip but no problem with the choppers theyre going to bury masterson in a cemetery on the farm after a mass in a little catholic church in a little dorf called de lisle right outside the farm property they wanted to have a big deal with the funeral but the old manmastersons fathertold them no way whats going to happen here after the president does his thing is take the body out to the farm in a hearse funerals by invitation only but they expect maybe three hundred people at the cemetery can you handle that many people im not going to have to the old man mobilized the mississippi state police theres about fifty of them under a lieutenant colonel and the head man a coloneltough bastardis here as a friend of the family sos the governor plus of course the sheriff and all his deputies you dont see any problems in protecting the family no dallessando said flatly but it would help charley if i knew who popped masterson and why and why they may try to pop the widow and the family ill tell you what i know vic its not much i have no idea who these people are none all i know is that it has something to do with mrs mastersons brother shejust now after we landed heretold me that the people who grabbed her in buenos aires want her to tell them where her brother is and promised to kill her children and family and she didnt tell them she doesnt know where he is he works for the un in paris but we cant find him interesting she said they killed masterson to make the point that they meant what they said and you have no idea why they want the brother no all i know is they shot masterson with israelimade ninemillimeter cartridges and killed the marine sergeant driving my carand wounded a female secret service agent in the carby sticking one of those through the window and emptying the magazine also loaded with israelimade ninemillimeters with a madsen castillo nodded how do you know that i think sergeant markham saw it coming and as he tried to move out of the way pushed the windowup button it was automatic and caught the madsen it was still in the window when i got there thats interesting too theres not too many madsens around and thats all you know and i just now learned in a sixtysecond conversation with mrs masterson about masterson getting whacked to make the point that they want the brother at any cost somebodys going to have to talk to her some more dallessando said i know i dont know how much time there will be now but thats why im here whos in charge i am i mean now that theyre in the states and after the funeral i am vic no shit the president just told me thats stretching your envelope some isnt it charley understatement of the year castillo replied id like to introduce you to mrs masterson vic see if you can reassure her that shes safe now i want to meet her too dallessando said now castillo nodded dallessando spoke to a lapel microphone castillo had not noticed three coming through the side door he announced four lieutenant colonel mcelroy the aide to the commander in chief was standing at the foot of the steps to the passenger compartment of the globemaster sir he said when he saw castillo and the others coming the masterson family is alone up there my name is castillo would you please go up and tell mrs masterson id like a brief word with her sir mrs masterson asked that the family not be disturbed do it colonel colonel torine ordered yes sir lieutenant colonel mcelroy said and started up the stairs castillo looked down the cargo compartment of the globemaster corporal lester bradley now wearing his dress blue uniform was standing almost at attention while talking to a marine captain castillo walked to them you look very spiffy corporal castillo said thank you sir captain whats corporal bradleys role in the ceremony may i ask who you are sir my name is castillo phrased another way captain colonel torine added hes the man the captain looked at them curiously and then replied to torine sir immediately after the ceremony when the sergeants remains are taken from the hangar the corporal will meet up with the cask captain castillo interrupted i told the gunny in buenos aires that corporal bradley will accompany sergeant markhams remains all the way home im sure he passed that on to sergeant markhams buddies i want that to happen make room for him in the ceremony sir im not sure that will be poss do it captain colonel torine ordered flatly the captain considered that just long enough for it to be perceptible then said aye aye sir thank you castillo said ill see you later bradley yes sir castillo saw mrs masterson coming down the stairway and hurried forward im glad youre here mr castillo my father is here and the less he knows about the threats made the better he has a heart condition i understand castillo said mrs masterson this is mr dallessando have you ever heard of delta force there was a terrible movie she said you mean theres really something like that yes maam there is the real delta force is made up of the best of special forces theyre not much like what you see in the movies but they are really professional mr dallessando has been associated with delta for a long time and hes brought twentyfour men here with him to make sure you and your family are all right thats very reassuring she said im really pleased to meet you mr dallessando im really sorry about your husband maam he said that shouldnt have happened thank you she said castillo saw a very tall very slim man in an elegant doublebreasted dark suit coming down the stairs my god he looks just like masterson the only difference is the white hair and that absolutely immaculate pencilline mustache the man walked up to them and smiled dad betsy masterson said this is mr castillo and mr dallessando gentlemen my fatherinlaw winslow masterson how do you do masterson asked offering his hand may i ask which of you is mr castillo i am sir i was actually about to go looking for you sir when it somewhat belatedly occurred to me that it was likely you were asking for a word with my daughterinlaw that accent is not what you expect to hear from a mississippian a farmer or a black mississippi farmer or any combination thereof what the hell is it may i be of some service sir castillo asked first let me express my appreciation for everything you have done for my daughterinlaw sir thats absolutely unneces pray let me continue sir pardon me sir and then let me inquire of you as a government officiali spoke with colonel mcelroy who had absolutely no idea what i was talking aboutwhy in a situation like this with all the resources of the government presumably at your disposal you have been unable to make contact with jeanpaul lorimer betsy masterson and castillo exchanged glances sir castillo began mrs mastersons father ambassador lorimer is quite upset mr castillo and if i may say so understandably so he has a certain physical condition and should not be under stress dad betsy masterson said please permit mr castillo to answer the question if he desires to do so sir there are problems locating mr lorimer mrs masterson is aware of them indeed masterson asked and looked at his daughterinlaw i didnt want to get into it with my father listening masterson nodded id really like to explain much of this to you sir castillo said but this i suggest is neither the time nor the place to do so hes right dad betsy masterson offered well i need to know whats going on as soon as possible masterson said and at the plantation your parents will be there and it would be impossible to exclude them without he paused visibly in thought then nodded in obvious agreement with what he had thought of mr castillo it was of course my intention to ask you to stay with us at the plantation i wouldnt want to intrude sir castillo protested masterson dismissed that with a wave of his hand but is there some reason you have to go there immediately after this masterson inquired gesturing toward the activities in the hangar would my daughterinlaw and the children and of course the lorimers be safe in your judgment if you werent personally there for an hour or so yes sir im sure they would be in addition to the state police you already have mr dallessando and his men youre thinking of the belle visage betsy masterson said and what do you think of me thinking of the belle visage masterson asked thatd do it dad she said no one would disturb you there then its settled what well do as the cortege heads for the plantation mr castillo is go to the belle visage we can have our little talk in private and then go out to the plantation you can ride with me how does that sound sir i dont know what the belle visage is its a gambling hell on the coast theres a place there where we will not be disturbed whatever you say sir but there is one other problem i have to establish contact with my cousin your cousin may i inquire what thats all about excuse me torine said but i just heard the band play hail to the chief charley i can handle things until you get to the plantation vic dallessando said as they saw lieutenant colonel mcelroy walking up to them colonel you want to come with me or go with charley charley torine asked seeking guidance ill see you at the plantation castillo said you stay here my dear winslow masterson said ill go get the children and your parents he started for the stairs then stopped and turned if you are seen with me mr castillo there might be interest that at the moment neither of us wants can you get to the belle visage by yourself yes sir well then ill see you there winslow masterson said and started again for the stairs castillo looked at dallessando you have wheels vic not to spare charley you have the secret service guy on your radio dallessando nodded tell him that i need a yukon here right now for i dont know how long you can do that you can do that and well see what happens dallessando tilted his head slightly you on ogilvie he said mrs masterson looked at him with great curiosity hes got a radio under there castillo explained mr castillo wants a yukon at the globemaster right now dallessando said there was a pause all he told me was to tell you he wants a yukon here now dallessando straightened up and announced on the way charley now tell them to find fernando lopezhes my cousin hes in the vip section and they know itand bring him here dallessando bent his head again and repeated the order and then said theyll do it betsy mastersons eyes met castillos my fatherinlaw is just like jack isnt he yes maam i was thinking the same thing i guess its the genes she said five estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay july jeanpaul bertrand watched the ceremonies taking place at keesler air force base on cnn they are really making a show of it he thought with somewhat grudging admiration and then he thought thats precisely what it is a show jack gets himself shot and theyre acting as if he were the secretary of state and all he was was chief of mission in a thirdrate embassy the president arranged the show for his own agenda jeanpaul got to watch not only betsy and the kids this time but his father and mother as well there was a camera long shot of the family walking behind the casket as it was slowly marched off the airplane daddy looks fine old but fine not as one would expect of someone who nearly died of a heart attack mom must have her hands full with him jacks father looks just like jack and so does the older boy what the hell is his name do they call him junior or the third the cameras were trained too on the reviewing stand as the family took their places beside the president the president not only kissed betsy but put his arms around her in a compassionate hug if thats not for the purpose of putting the ignorant masses who voted for him in a receptive state of mind for what hes going to say then what is it for the secretary of state also embraced betsy and kissed her then did the same to ambassador and mrs lorimer and then the kids daddy at least had the dignity to look a little offended god how i loathe that arrogant little bitch shes nearly as bad as the president my fellow americans the president began and jeanpaul bertrand almost switched the television off then but curiosity stayed his hand i come here tonight bearing two messages one is from you the american people offer their profound condolences to the families of j winslow masterson and sergeant roger markham usmc who gave their lives in the service of the united states the second message is from me the president went on it is to those who committed the cowardly murders of these two good men i say to you that this outrage will not go unpunished i have ordered jeanpaul bertrand switched off the television it would have been nice to see more of the family but if the price to do that is looking at that man while he mouths such nonsense it is simply too high xiii one penthouse c the belle vista casino amp resort us highway the magic mile biloxi mississippi july when the dark blue nearly black gmc yukon xl pulled up in the brilliantly lit drive of the hotel the drivers door was opened by a doorman in what looked like the uniform of an admiral in the imperial russian navy welcome to the belle vista casino and resort he announced how may i be of service you can tell me where i can park this thing the driver said we have valet parking sir no the driver said and showed the doorman his secret service credentials i keep control of the vehicle and i need it close in case its required in a hurry oh the doorman said is one of you gentlemen mr costello my name is castillo charley said from the backseat and you are mr mastersons guest sir uhhuh welcome to the belle vista casino and resort mr castillo the doorman said and opened the rear door mr threadgill the manager on duty will be here momentarily castillo and fernando lopez got out of the yukon fernando lopez was an enormous mansixfootthree two hundred thirty poundswith a full head of dark black hair and a swarthy complexion he was wearing a dark blue suit a crisp blue shirt with a white collar a redstriped tie and black ostrichhide western boots if you want to get a cup of coffee or something castillo said to the driver i think this will probably take about an hour the secret service agent nodded but didnt say anything a tall thin elegantly dressed man in his late forties walked up to them mr castillo he asked and when charley nodded put out his hand welcome to the belle vista casino and resort mr castillo my name is edward threadgill and i am the manager on duty if youll follow me please he led them through the lobby in a lounge to one side three enormous television screens showed air force one taxiing toward a runway he stopped before an elevator somewhat dramatically flashed a plastic card and then demonstrated how the card operated the elevator door he then presented the card to castillo hell need one of those too castillo said certainly mr threadgill announced produced anotherplastic card and handed it to fernando there you are sir and you are sir my name is lopez fernando said welcome to the belle vista casino and resort mr lopez thank you threadgill bowed them onto the elevator the elevator ascended then its doors opened on a large foyer threadgill led them to one of the four doors opening off it ran the plastic card through another reading device and then bowed them through the door penthouse c was a large elegantly furnished suite of rooms threadgill threw a switch and curtains swished open revealing a wall of floortoceiling windows offering what in daylight would be a stunning view of the gulf of mexico the sugarwhite sandy beach and the highway running along the coast now a few lights twinkled out on the water and us was an intermittent stream of red lights going west white lights going east there was a basket of fruit on a coffee table and beside it a cooler holding two bottles of champagne if you need anything gentlemen threadgill said there are buttons in every room which will summon the floor waiter there is of course twentyfourseven room service thank you very much castillo said is there anything else or may i leave you i cant think of anything thank you very much castillo said fernando lopez waited until the door closed after threadgill and then said knowing you as i do gringo im sure there is some very simple reason why we are here in a suite normally reserved for really heavily losing baccarat players baccarat players castillo asked yeah this place is world headquarters for people who want to drop a couple of hundred thousand playing baccarat you didnt know castillo shook his head so what are we doing here fernando asked thank you for not asking in the truck castillo said thats the answer mastersons father and i have to talk we cant do that at his placewhich he calls the plantationbecause the widows father has a bad ticker and we dont want to upset him he sent me here what do you have to talk about wait ill rephrase that interrogatory what the fuck is going on so i dont have to repeat everything twice can you wait until he gets here he should be here any minute and i need a drink okay i could use a little belt myself fernando said what did that guy say about a floorwaiter button there has to be a bar in here fernando said he walked to a panel mounted on the wall and started pushing buttons one of them caused a section of the paneled wall to move revealing a small but wellstocked bar eureka the gold they had just enough time to fix the drinks and touch glasses when winslow masterson walked into the suite i couldnt get away as quickly as i had hoped he said but they were ready for you yes sir castillo said i took the liberty of youre my guests masterson shut him off with a gentle wave of his hand and a drink seems entirely appropriate at this time he went to the bar and poured himself a drink from the bottle of famous grouse that fernando had used the economics of this place has always fascinated me masterson said god only knows how much it costs them to maintain something like this and since they are obviously not in the business of being a friend to man there has to be a profit motive it would therefore seem to follow that their hospitality is offered only to those who haveor are likely to losean enormous amount of money at the tables where do such people and so many of themcome from i was thinking just about the same thing sir fernando said excuse me sir for my breach of courtesy i am winslow masterson my name is lopez sir fernando lopez and youre a westerner mr lopez may i say i admire your boots thank you sir texan san antonio fernando said masterson drained his drink and made another mr castillo tells me youre cousins masterson said yes sir years ago masterson offered i had some business dealings with a delightful chap in san antonio who had your christian name mr lopez and your surname mr castillo i dont suppose you may be talking about myourgrandfather sir charley said did your grandfather have a magnificent santa gertruda bull named lyndon j grandpa was not an admirer of president johnson fernando said and lyndon j even as a calf produced amazing amounts of droppings so when it came to naming the calf for registering so your grandfather told me masterson chuckled what is it they say about a small world hes making small talk charley thought hes delaying hearing what he knows he wont like to hear what do i do bring him back to earth so i can go out to his farm no fuck it vics out there the mastersons are safe we just brought his son home in a flagdraped casket let him do whatever he wants to do i was distressed to learn he had passed masterson said my deepest condolences to you and your family then he turned and walked to the plateglass windows and looked out at the twinkling lights on the gulf a very long moment later with his back to them masterson said gambling has been going on here on this coast for centuries did you know that no sir charley said i didnt no sir fernando added the very first gamblers were the freebooters the pirateswho plied their profession here masterson went on they had the custom of raffling off the more comely of the females they had removed together with other valuable property from vessels they intercepted entering or leaving the mississippi river i didnt know that fernando said it is i suspect why my wife is a bit vague when discussing our ancestors it is one thing to take some pride in them having been free men of color in new orleans before the war of cessation and quite something else to acknowledge how they achieved that status excuse me fernando asked masterson took a long sip of his drink and continued after the battle of new orleans jean laffite was pardoned for his services as were his officers and men most of them stayed in louisiana but some of them including a notorious scoundrel captain alois hamele and his son captain francois hamele originally from haiti and before that of course from africa came here where the land was cheaper and there were a number of bays and coves where ships not wishing to pass their cargoes through customs could unload captainthey used the french term maitre in those dayshamele and his soncommonly known as the fils de le maitredecided upon hearing that jean laffite had returned to his sinful ways and knowing that the authorities would almost surely come looking for other pardoned freebooters that a change of name was probably i know where youre going charley said son of the master right masterson winslow masterson slowly turned from the window smiled and nodded over the years he went on the masterson family acquired rather extensive land holdings in this area some of it was splendid farmland some was in timber and some like the land on which this splendiferous gambling hell is built was essentially useless swamp and now fernando said smiling i think i know where youre going perhaps masterson said smiling about fifteen years ago some gentlemen from las vegas came to see me about acquiring this property i suspect perhaps unkindly that they were disappointed when they found that i was not plowing my land walking barefoot behind a mule castillo and fernando chuckled and i know they were disappointed when i told them i wasnt interested in selling the property i didnt tell them that not only do i dislike selling property but in this case my wife had also weighed in she truly believes that proprietors of gambling hells grow rich on the poor but it is true i suppose that everyone has their price and in this case the las vegas people finally met mine an absurd from my standpoint amount of money and this apartment in perpetuity together with what they term full maintenance which means i never am billed for anything i suspect they still entertain hope i will come here have too much of this stuffhe raised his glassand go downstairs and lose it all back to them shooting dice castillo and lopez laughed primarily i use it to house people who come to see me who i would rather not have in my home masterson said and took a sip of his scotch after a moment he added my wife has never been in the building masterson looked between them for a moment then drained his glass he put the glass carefully on the bar and turned to face castillo very well he said enough of that please tell me mr castillo who abducted my daughterinlaw and murdered my son and why and what i can do to avenge his death yes sir castillo said ill tell you what i know which isnt very much when the president heard that mrs masterson was missing in what appeared to be a kidnapping he sent me to buenos aires and you have no idea whatsoever who these people are masterson asked when castillo had finished no sir i do not obviously it has something to do with mr lorimer so im going to start by trying to find him if theres anything anything at all you can tell me that you think might help masterson nodded thoughtfully there is a subculture here mr castillo of affluent negroes who can trace their ancestry back to the free men of color it is simply a matter of our being more comfortable with each other than we are with other people we texicans have something like that in san antonio fernando said masterson considered that and said yes i daresay you would your grandfather mentioned in passing that he had ancestors on both sides who died at the alamo fighting the mexicans i dont know about texas but here ours is a rather small community were primarily roman catholic we send our daughters to the nuns in new orleans for their high school education and our sons to the brothers at saint stanislaus here in mississippi for theirs my son went to saint stanislaus as i did and my father did and my grandfather so did jeanpaul lorimer as did his father andi believehis grandfather jacks mother and jeanpauls mother had known each other in the blessed heart of jesus school in new orleans and then gone to spring hill college in mobile it was thus inevitable that jack would meet betsy and that they became sweethearts when they were in their teens surprising most of us the romance continued after jack went off to notre dame on a basketball scholarship they were married against the wishes of both families two weeks after jack graduated our sole objections were that betsy had not completed her degreeshes a year younger than jackand that they were too young their argument to which we finally acquiesced was they would be separated again by his professional athletic career he paused and smiled betsy i strongly suspect was fully aware of the tales of the offcourt activities of the celtics and was determined that she would not lose jack to some adoringwhats the phrasebasketball groupie if jack was going to boston so was she fernando and castillo chuckled and then of course jacks career ended prematurely when he was struck by the beer truck i hoped he would come home to work the plantation he said he would the day i announced my retirement and not before the ambassador suggested he take the entrance examination for the foreign service and we all thought this was a splendid idea the world as they say is growing smaller every day and by the time i was ready to retire jack would be fluent in more languages than french and english and the fruits of their union would have been exposed to experiences they would not have if they went to the nuns and brothers here and with one exception until this outrage occurred their lives were going as well as my wife and i and ambassador and mrs lorimer could have wished that exception was the unpleasantness that developed between jack and jeanpaul lorimer castillo about to take a sip of his drink stopped over what he asked at first we thought it was differing political views but on second thought we realized that it almost certainly was more than that it went back to their days at saint stanislaus and had other causes masterson paused what im doing is what my wife would call airing the dirty family linen but you said anything at all should i continue yes sir please castillo said shortly after jack joined the foreign service he was posted to paris my wife and i went to see them they had an apartment on the quai anatole france do you know paris mr castillo yes sir i can find my way from the arch of triumph to the place de la concorde without a guide fernando said facing the river seine from the place de la concorde masterson said just across the river is a row of apartment buildings on the quai anatole france do you know where i mean yes sir fernando said the highrent district castillo said masterson nodded and jack and betsywho was very pregnantwere ensconced in an upperfloor apartment in one of the more expensive buildings on the quai anatole france he was so junior in the foreign service that government quarters were not made available to him they paid a rental allowance instead and you were supposed to find yourself someplace to live what jack and betsy found was a lovely apartment from which one could see the bateauxmouches on the seine the place de la concorde and it was priced accordingly i questioned jack about the wisdom of his flaunting his affluence his response was that everyone knew of that incredible settlement hed been given and that it would be hypocrisy to pretend they were not extremely welloff later in his career he became more discreet in any event he and betsy gave a party for us jeanpaul lorimer was also in paris he had resigned from the state department some months beforelater i learned that was shortly after he learned jack would be sent to parisand joined the un when my wife learned that he had not been invited to the party becausehe and jack had had words my wife prevailed upon betsy to include him i dont think jeanpaul had been in the apartment ten minutes before he said something that jack construed as antiamerican it quickly became ugly very ugly betsy was in tears cutting that short jack threw himliterally threw himout of the apartment as far as i know thats the last time they ever saw one another at first we thought it was a question of their political differencesjacks mother always said that jack was more chauvinistically patriotic than patrick henrybut on reflection we realized that it went back as far as saint stanislaus i dont think i follow you sir castillo said the greeneyed monster mr castillo jealousy masterson said jeanpaul is three years older than jack saint stanislauss football team leaves something to be desired but they have always had a firstrate basketball team jeanpaul didnt earn a place on the team until he was a senior jack made it as a ninthgrader they played together in other words jack immediately became the star the celticsand othersmade their first offers to him when he was still at saint stanislaus and they were not doing so as their contribution to affirmative action and then came the scholarship to notre dame jeanpaul went to spring hill where he didnt attempt varsity sports and where his academic career was unspectacular jacks skill on the basketball court on the other hand gave a new meaning to the term black irish and academically he did well enough to earn a phi beta kappa key then came his contract for all that money from the celtics and shortly thereafter he was struck by the beer truck the enormous settlement he received from that exacerbated my wife and i came to realize the resentment jeanpaulbut not i hasten to add his father and motherharbored for our being far better off than the lorimers jeanpaul followed his father into the foreign service his initial assignment was to liberia when jack went into the foreign service his first assignment was paris i later learned that he believed i had something to do with that i did not if i have to say so jeanpaul resigned from the foreign service and joined the united nations and was assigned to paris where he found jack and betsy in the apartment on the quai anatole france wow castillo said that said mr castillo masterson went on i cannot believe that jeanpaul could possibly have anything to do with jacks murder nor can i imagine jeanpaul being involved in anything illegal he is one of those people who go through life trying to bend the rules to their advantage but who simply dont have the courage if thats the word to break them maybe drugs are involved fernando said thats a murderous business i find that impossible to accept even as a remote possibility mr lopez masterson said might it have something to do with our involvement in iraq i dont think thats likely sir castillo said giving my imagination free rein masterson asked could it be that jeanpaul has somehow annoyed the israelis their intelligence agency mossad something like that mossad castillo confirmed formally the institute for intelligence and special tasks mossad has a certain reputation for ruthlessness masterson finished maybe castillo blurted he collected his thoughts all the shootersof mr masterson sergeant markham and special agent schneiderwere firing israelimanufactured ninemillimeter ammunition he heard himself jesus motormouth why did you say that i shouldnt have said that he said quickly my brain isnt functioning all that proves is that israel manufactures a lot of ammunition its unlikely that mossad special task shooters would use traceable ammunition on a job like this probably not masterson agreed but now that i think about it i dont think that israeli involvement in this should be dismissed out of hand on the other hand castillo went on thoughtfully since so much israeli ammo is around so readily available maybe mossad would use it why not which appears to point right back to jeanpaul lorimer and his connections with the french masterson said as the key to this yes sir it looks that way with a little bit of luck i should be in paris before our embassy closes tomorrow not that the embassy being closed matters the cia station chief will just have to give up his cinq a sept masterson chuckled you have been in paris havent you yes sir what the hell is a sank whatever you said fernando asked you could call it recreation on the way home from the office castillo said and masterson chuckled again it means five to seven something like a noonie in the united states fernando shook his head masterson chuckled again how well did you know my son mr castillo not well castillo said but i liked what i saw and that explains your enthusiasm to find these people thats part of it sir the other part is personal i also really want to find the people who shot special agent schneider and sergeant markham do you think the rest of the government is going to share your enthusiasm or will this just fade into memory i cant speak to enthusiasm sir but i expect cooperation i thought perhaps other higher priorities might be involved masterson said or perhaps that when you turn over the rock there will be worms some might wish had remained concealed perhaps in the national interest when i was on air force one with the president just now mr masterson he ordered ambassador montvale the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state to give me anything i asked for and i intend to ask the cia for everything they have on lorimer and im going to ask the fbi and the dia and the dea the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the post office and the department of agriculture and anybody else i think might possibly have a line on him would a reward for information as substantial as necessary and offered either publicly or privately be of any use do you think i dont think that will be necessary sir please keep it in mind mr castillo that if something i appreciate that sir and i will is there anything else youd be willing to tell me i cant think of anything else sir then perhaps we should go out to the plantation before our being missing really attracts attention sir about the plantation castillo said id really like to get out of here first thing in the morning and we have to think about getting fernando back to san antonio fernandos not going back to san antonio fernando interrupted fernandos always wanted to go to paris in the middle of the summer somebody once told fernando you cant find a frenchman in paris in july just think all that beauty and no frenchmen masterson chuckled you sound like my son mr lopez he turned to castillo i really wish you would spend the night at the plantation if for no other reason than i think betsy will be pleased to see that i share her confidence in you jesus h christ i can only hope sir that her and your confidence in me is justified which almost certainly wont be two pope air force base north carolina july pope approach control lear fivezerosevenfive colonel jake torine called into his throat mike lear fivezerosevenfive pope pope sevenfive do you have us on radar affirmative sevenfive estimate pope in seven minutes approach and landing clearance please lear fivezerosevenfive be advised pope is closed to civilian traffic colonel torine turned to major c g castillo who was in the left seat what now o captain my captain he asked i thought wed be cleared castillo said always check torine said write that down charley you guys arent very good at things like this are you fernando lopez who was kneeling between the seats asked innocently earning him the finger from major castillo colonel torine switched to transmit pope sevenfive has been cleared to land at pope verify by contacting lieutenant general mcnab at special operations command sevenfive we have no record of clearance and while youre doing that give us approach and landing clearance please this is colonel jacob torine usaf acknowledge it proved impossible for the airfield officer of the day major peter dennis usaf to immediately find anyone at the air force base who could confirm or deny that lear fivezerosevenfive had permission to land neither could he immediately establish contact with general mcnab with great reluctance but seeing no other alternative major dennis telephoned major general oscar j winters usaf popes commanding general at his quarters where the general was having his breakfast and explained what had happened major general winters was fully aware that paragraph one of the mission statement of pope air force base stated in effect that pope was there to provide support to fort bragg and the major army units stationed thereon furthermore he knew that lieutenant general bruce j mcnab us army was wearing the hats of both the commanding general xviii airborne corps and the commanding general us army special operations command and thus also had command control of the nd airborne division which was under xviii airborne corps and the us army special warfare school which was under the special operations command he was also aware of general scotty mcnabs wellearned reputation for unorthodoxy and of his legendary temper and there was general winters knew an air force officer a colonel named jacob torine why torine would be flying a civilian bombardierlearjet xr winters had no idea except that torine had spent much of his career as an air commando and air commandos were about as well known for unorthodoxy as were members of the armys special forces wise major generals air force or army make every effort not to unreasonably antagonize lieutenant generals of their own or any other service general winters instructed major dennis to grant lear fivezerosevenfive permission to land but with the caveat that it be ordered to hold on the taxiway where two security forces humvees armed with caliber machine guns should meet it prepared to take it under fire in case the sleek and glistening white civilian jet should turn out to be some sort of flying trojan horse ill be right there major general winters said on the way to base operations in his air force blue dodge caravan general winters managed to get general mcnab on his cellular phone general mcnab he said we have just learned that a civilian learjet is about to land at pope piloted by someone who says he is colonel jacob torine usaf and that you can verify he has permission to land i am on my way to the field general mcnabs reply was succinct well i guess i better do the same thank you oscar see you there the bombardierlearjet xr had been sitting on the taxiway near the threshold of the active runway for about ten minutes when both lieutenant general mcnab and major general winters personally appeared there general mcnab led the way standing up in the front seat of an army humvee he was a small muscular ruddyfaced man sporting a flowing red mustache he was wearing a desert camouflage uniform aviator sunglasses and a green beret general winters followed in his caravan he was wearing a class a uniform when the humvee stopped thirty feet from the lear general mcnab jumped nimbly to the ground and walked up to the lear where he hands on hips looked up at the cockpit with all the arrogant confidence of general george s patton a very large and muscular captain similarly uniformed got out of the humvee and took up a position immediately behind general mcnab major general winters and major dennis got out of the caravan and walked up beside lieutenant general mcnab and the green beret captain the lears door unfolded and colonel torine and major castillo each wearing a suit and tie deplaned both saluted crisply which reassured major dennis who reasoned if they werent military they would not have done so good morning sir torine and castillo said almost in concert general winters returned the salute crisply general mcnab returned it with a casual gesture in the direction of his head i must confess oscar general mcnab said that these two are well known to me and that the really ugly one is indeed colonel jake torine mcnab looked at torine and said i knew they wouldnt let an old man like you fly big airplanes much longer he looked at castillo and major castillo daring to show his face at my door again general mcnab turned to general winters whenever i think that captain walsh is the worst aidedecamp i have ever had oscar i think of major castillo in that role and realize i am wrong castillo earned that appellation in perpetuity captain walsh smiled and shook his head as to why there is no record of their aircraft being granted permission to land here i have no idea i was notified by centcom that they were coming i am forced to conclude that either centcom or the air force fucked things up again as both are lamentably famous for doing ill look into it general winters said if i may offer advice without giving offense oscar let sleeping dogs lie no offense taken general would it be possible for you to drag that airplane somewhere where it will be more convenient for them to get back in it after weve had some breakfast certainly sir colonel do you need fuel no sir were all right torine said castillo once again demonstrating his remarkable ability to arrive at the wrong time did so by arriving here just as walsh and i finished our wakeup fivemile trot around smoke bomb hill general mcnab said i require sustenance immediately after my morning fivemiler otherwise my wife accuses i become illmannered i understand general winters said fernando appeared at the lears door can i get off now without being blown away he asked aha mcnab said unless i err the owner of the airplane you may not believe this oscar but he was once a fairly competent captain of armor how are you general fernando asked very well fernando for an old man with all these terrible responsibilities heavily weighing upon my overburdened shoulders could you use some sustenance yes sir i could ill have it towed to base ops general winters said thank you sir torine said thank you oscar general mcnab said and gestured to castillo torine and lopez that they should get into the humvee there was still a small line waiting to be fed at what the army now called the dining facilityformerly mess hallof the st battalion th parachute infantry regiment when mcnabs humvee pulled up outside everyone in the humvee piled out and went to the end of the line one of the principles of leadership castillo had learned while he had been second lieutenant castillo aidedecamp to brigadier general mcnab was that the quality of food served was one of the most important factors in troop morale and that a very good way to ensure that highquality food was served at all times was for senior officers to drop in unannounced at a randomly selected mess hall and eat what was being served to the privates general mcnab took out his wallet and paid for breakfast for everybody but his driver an unmarried sergeant living in barracks who was not drawing a rations and quarters allowance and they went through the line watched by a visibly nervous mess sergeant who was aware both of mcnabs legendary temper and that it was often triggered when food did not measure up to his expectations the foodand there was a wide array of choices was good mcnab waited until they were through poured himself another cup of coffee and then handed castillo a sheet of teletype paper if you have trouble with the big words charley i will be happy to explain them to you he said castillo took the message and read it top secretpresidential operational immediate july from commander in chief centcom macdill af base tampa fla to commanding general xviii airborne corpsspecial operations command fort bragg nc eyes only lt gen b j mcnab copies to secdefense washington dc eyes only sec beiderman secstate washington dc eyes only sec cohen sechomelandsec washington dc eyes only sec hall dir of national intel washington dc eyes only dir

b any inability to provide such personnel or equipment will be immediately reported to cinc centcom eyes only gen naylor by the most expeditious means preferably secure telephone naylor general us army cinc centcom top secretpresidential castillo handed the message to torine who read it and then handed it back to mcnab who folded it and put it in his pocket so tell me chief mcnab said what are you requesting besides the three radios and operators therefor that general naylor mentioned last night thats about it sir castillo replied i have two more questions chief mcnab said if i may dare to ask them ask away sir thank you chief one when do i get vic dallessando and my twentyfour shooters back from mississippi general naylor said that decision is up to you sir just as soon as other security arrangements can be made to protect the mastersons im working on that now will it count as another question chief if i ask you where youre going to get those security arrangements as soon as i get to washington sir im going to call china post and see whos available what the hell is that fernando asked some allege fernando mcnab explained that china post number one in exile of the american legionyour cousin and i are membersfunctions as an employment bureau for former andor retired special operators seeking more or less honest civilian employment he turned to castillo if youd like charley excuse me chiefill give china post a headsup call and tell them youll be calling thatd be great sir thank you very much it would probably help if i could assure them the compensation would be in line with their skills money is not a problem sir mcnab nodded question two he went on what the hell is going on yesterday sir immediately upon landing mrs masterson told me the villains who abducted her and murdered mr masterson so youre going to try to find this lorimer fellow mcnab asked when castillo had finished yes sir with a little bit of luck well be in paris late this afternoon mcnab was silent for a moment visibly thinking you want to take two radios and operators with you right yes sir al mcnab said to captain walsh sir theyll be at base ops by the time we get back over there captain walsh replied the best we could do about the radio for buenos aires is to get the operator on the american airlines flight out of miami tonight thatll put him there at their time tomorrow morning the radio itself posed a problem i didnt want to send it through their customs and not only because i wasnt sure we could get it through their customs so i called secretary cohen when she was still on air force one on her way back to washington she promised to have someone in miami slap the appropriate diplomatic stickers on it to whisk it through customs unopenedits addressed to the ambassadorbut that may not go as smoothly as we like i dont have a lot of faith in the state department again when i get to washington ill call down there and give the ambassador a headsup that its coming hes all right he knows what youre up to and wont leak it hes first class and alex darbyremember him the cia station chief in zaranj castillo nodded hes down there i didnt remember him but he remembered me hes a good man hell know how to get the radio through customs and what to do with it is there anybody else you can use down there if you need shooters mcnab asked and then when he saw the surprised look on castillos face went on we can get people in there charley black but if you need them in a hurry well have to infiltrate them by air that means either with our c suitably decked out as an air paraguay or something and thats a long haul for that airplaneor with a globemaster iii which has the range but would be harder to hide i havent even thought of shooters down there castillo confessed i dont see where im going to need them but if something came up yeah theres people i could use theres a secret service guy and a dea agent in a pinch i could probably use some of the marine guards to play it safe what if i send another crate down there under diplomatic cover weapons nightvision goggles some flashbangs et cetera enough for say six shooters yes sir that would be a very good idea im really embarrassed i didnt think about that even though you studied at the feet of the master charley the master didnt really expect you to be perfect mcnab said colonel castillo asked turning to torine how would the weight of what the generals talking about affect our crossthedrink flight torine considered the question carefully thats a crate weighing about ballpark what three hundred pounds the stuff is in the crate in two duffels captain walsh furnished total weight three hundred twenty pounds not much ammunition we figured you could get some there knock off twenty pounds for the crate were right at three hundred another three hundred pounds gross isnt going to change much charley torine said what about somebody getting curious about whats on the lear customs very seldom checks what a plane is carrying until you try to get it off the plane torine replied you want to take the goodies with you now mcnab asked no sir i was thinking about it but i dont think it would be a good idea i dont think the risk of getting caught with half a dozen car s is worth it okay so that goes diplomatic mcnab said anything else no sir not that i can think of okay mcnab said thats the way well do it he turned to captain walsh go fetch the mess sergeant the mess sergeant appeared almost immediately mcnab stood up everybody followed suit yes sir the sergeant said trying not to appear nervous was everything all right sir you look like youve been around the army awhile mcnab began yes sir im working on sixteen years i want a straight answer do you like it better with all these civilians doing what gi cooks and kps used to do or do you miss the old days general i really think the food is better now but i sometimes wish i could eat some of these civilians a new asshole like i could with cooks and kps in the old army sergeant we all yearn for the old army mcnab said but that was a firstclass breakfast you just served us and you can take pride in it yes sir thank you sir okay mcnab said offered the sergeant his hand and then turned to the others okay you clowns get your asses out of low gear and get in the goddamn truck he turned back to the mess sergeant oh i really miss the old army the mess sergeantnow known as the dining facility supervisorsmiled broadly and followed them out of the dining facility three near richmond virginia july washington center

land after the delta on final xiv one office of the secretary department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc july major h richard miller jr was sitting behind major c g castillos desk when castillo torine and lopez walked in miller was wearing civilian clothing a singlebreasted nearly black suit his left leg was encased in a thick white cast from his toes to well past his knee his toes peeked out the bottom of the cast which was resting on the desk forgive me for not rising miller said i honestly try to be humble but it is very difficult for someone of my accomplishments castillo shook his head hows the leg let me ask you a question first miller said dare i hope to have the honor of serving in some humble capacity within the office of organizational analysis why not castillo replied in that case chief miller said how does it look as if i am about to run the fourhundredmeter hurdles what we should do colonel castillo said to torine is hold him down and paint those ugly toenails flaming red and then listen to him trying to explain that he really likes girls speaking of the gentle sex miller said jack britton called from macdill about ten minutes ago he said the gulfstream was about to take off for philadelphia about five minutes ago quote betty is resting comfortably and the pilot estimates philadelphia at eleventhirty end quote miller saw castillos face and when he spoke again his tone of voice was that of a concerned friend im really sorry about that charley castillo nodded i told tom mcguire miller went on and hes arranging for the aircraft to be met by a suitable secret service delegation castillo nodded again then asked howd you hear about the office of organizational analysis secretary hall showed it to me and mrs forbison when we came in this morning miller said then looked at torine and added he said youd been drafted colonel given temporary duty actually torine said but he didnt say anything about you fernando how much about charleys new exalted status do you know consider him in all the way castillo ordered can you do that miller asked theres a story that when general donovan started the ossbefore he was general donovan when he was a civilian they called him colonel because hed been one in the first world warhe was paid a dollar a year so hand fernando a dollar and consider him on the payroll i think i can do that according to hall you can do just about anything you want to miller said so that makeshe counted on his fingersthree of us you the texan and me anybody else castillo turned to torine and said we were talking about shooters in argentina with general mcnab jack britton would make a good one torine nodded his agreement wheres joel with hall at the white house tom mcguire on his way here from langley with your modified german passport he also has your new american passport when he gets here ill ask him if he stopped as mrs agnes forbison walked into the room the somewhat plump executive assistant to the secretary of homeland security walked up to castillo and put her arms around him im so sorry about betty schneider she said did dick tell you shes on the way to philadelphia just now what were you going to ask the boss she asked as she turned to smile at torine and fernando im going to ask tom if i can have jack britton id like to send him back to buenos aires as soon as possible you mean for the office of organizational analysis castillo nodded if you ask tom he will ask joel joel will probably say yes but if he doesnt youll go to the boss who i know will give him to you so consider it done okay thats four miller said i can think of two more people you could really use mrs forbison said who tom for one i dont think that tom would like taking orders from me castillo replied or that hall would go along with that mrs forbison seemed to be collecting her thoughts and it was a moment before she responded charley she said you need to learn to make better use of soft intel sources and executive assistants such as myself are as good as it gets tom confided in me that he would really like to be in on this among your arguments for getting himand there are manyis that you really need someone who knows his way around the dark alleys of federal law enforcement he told me that too charley raised an eyebrow both impressed at her ability to have her finger on the pulse of the department and disappointed in himself at having forgotten that she had her finger on said pulse okay ill ask id love to have tom and all hall can say is no or probably hell no let me handle the boss mrs forbison said good luck who else me castillo looked at her in genuine surprise why would you want to do that well you know how busy i am here keeping the furniture polished against the remote possibility that the secretary will bring somebody here to dazzle him with his elegant official office we both knowmore important the boss knowsthat maryellen really runs things for him and that he doesnt need both of us doing the same thing castillo smiled at her mrs maryellen kensington a gs like mrs agnes forbison who also carried the title of executive assistant to the secretary of homeland security maintained halls small and unpretentious suite of offices in the old executive office building near the white house hall spent most of his time there he and the president were close personal friends and the president liked to have him at hand when he wanted him mrs kellenhamp mrs forbison went on can supervise the furniture polishing as well as i can and bringing her out here would also get her out of maryellens hair mrs louise kellenhamp a gs who carried the titleof deputy executive assistant worked in the oeob performing mostly secretarialtype duties youve given this some thought havent you castillo asked from the moment i realized the boss whether he wanted to or not was going to have to have his own intelligence people and now that we have thanks to the president this clandestine and covert office of organizational analysis hiding in the department of homeland security it seems to me that youre really going to need someone who knows her way around official washington and how to push paper around what do we do with him castillo asked nodding toward major h richard miller jr send him back to walter reed eventually hell get out of that cast mrs forbison said and if he behaves himself he can try to make himself useful around here until he does god spare us all from conniving bureaucrats miller said piously you know im right charley mrs forbison said you think you can talk the boss into this castillo said consider it done she said the next time the subject comes up act pleasantly surprised when the boss says ive had an idea charley id like to run past you mrs forbison youre marvelous castillo said i know she replied now that thats settled chief whats on our agenda this morning i brought a satellite radio and an operator from fort bragg like we did when we were hunting the stolen the dish has to go on the roof and the operators going to need a place to live castillo said dick mrs forbison said if youll take care of the operator ill deal with the building engineer his delicate feelings were bruised the last time the chief put that thing on the roof yes maam miller replied smiling and i need the passports castillo said theyre on the way mrs forbison said toms handling that and i have to call ambassador silvio or alex darbypreferably bothon a secure line he looked at miller mcnab is sending equipment for six shooters down there i want to make sure it doesnt get lost youll have to use the one on my desk for that mrs forbison said i ordered one for you this morning but it wont be in until later today you ordered one for me castillo asked surprised youre now on the white house circuit didnt you know no maam i didnt well you are anything else well need someplace to stay in paris the crillon if we can get in fancy mrs forbison said and right next door to the embassy have them bill it to gossinger four rooms lets talk about that mrs forbison said you i can put on orders the colonel presumably is already on orders yes maam colonel torine said but what about the other operator and fernando ill pick up the bill for the operator castillo said then he can pocket the per diem check he gets from fort bragg and ill pick up fernandos bill too if we hire him as a temporary contract employee maybe as an aircraft pilot i can cut orders on him too mrs forbison at the risk of repeating myself youre wonderful castillo said at the risk of repeating myself chief i know but youre going to have to start calling me agnes he looked at her but didnt immediately reply please dont tell mei already knowthat im nearly old enough to be your mother but you have just become a bureaucratic heavy chief and bureaucratic heavies call their executive assistants by their first names whatever you say agnes castillo said and then asked what do i do about secretary hall he said that hed like you if possible to come by the oeob before you leave ill do it thirty minutes later after having spoken with both ambassador silvio and alex darby after being informed that the hotel crillon would be expecting all of them after having received his new american passport and his german passport now bearing a departure stamp from the republic of argentina and after having talked to tom mcguire long enough to be convinced that mcguire really wanted to become a member of the office of organizational analysis and was going to have no problems working under a man ten years his junior castillo shook hands with dick miller and then went to mrs forbisons office to say goodbye to her she gave him a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek and told him to be careful he and torine and fernando were waiting for the elevator when mrs forbison put her head in the corridor call for you chief if you keep calling me chief were back to mrs forbison who is it somebody who wants to talk about jeanpaul jeanpaul lorimer all he said was jeanpaul charley castillo went into mrs forbisons office and picked up the telephone castillo youll have to remember to turn your cellular on howard kennedy said jesus its in my briefcase then it wouldnt matter would it if its on or off whats up howard you have really opened a can of truly poisonous worms with that pal of yours the one you asked me to find what kind of poisonous worms the kind i have been absolutely forbidden to talk about on the telephone kennedy said that bad worse than that bad where can we meet where are you answer the question as soon as i can go by the hotel and pack some clothes and after a stop at halls coffee shop on pennsylvania avenue im going to get on an airplane for paris what flight air san antonio flight seventeen oh really anybody i know coming with you the same crew we had in cozumel you know both of them interesting and where will you be staying in paris the crillon lovely hotel unfortunately too close for me to some former associates of mine who work close by christ i forgot to tell or remind tom mcguire to find out what special agent yung of the fbi is really doing in montevideo castillo thought then said what do you suggest when did you say youre leaving as soon as we can you cant make it nonstop in that airplane can you no were going to have to refuel at gander newfoundland and shannon ireland i figure its going to take us factoring in two onehour fuel stops about ten hours well its nearly half past four in paris kennedy said if you get off the ground in an hour that would make it half past five five plus ten is three oclock in the morning figure another hour at least to get through customs and immigration to get to the crillon from le bourget is that where youre headed le bourget yeah castillo said it will be five oclock when you get to the hotel from le bourget factor in another hour for delays call it six see you in the morning charley we really do need to talk there was a change in the background noise and castillo realized that kennedy had hung up two old executive office building seventeenth street and pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc july the president told me youd had a little chat the honorable matthew hall secretary of the department of homeland security said you have any questions about that one big one castillo replied the soldier in me is uncomfortable not understanding my chain of command the simple answer to that is that you answer to the president directly hall said but i think i know what youre asking and proving that im learning to be a washington bureaucrat let me answer obliquely when he came up with that finding i wondered why i had been taken out of the loop then i realized i had not been it all goes to deniability i can now honestly answer if someone asks and someone inevitably will either as a shotinthedark fishing expedition or because this comes out whats my relationship to you that we have none you dont work for me similarly if someone asks the presidents chief of staff what he knows about c g castillo or the office of organizational analysis he can honestly say he doesnt know anything about it if we get caughtwhich is a real possibilitywe can hide behind the presidents finding the further you distance the office of organizational analysis from the president the better thats why hes hiding it in homeland security as far as you working for him directly theres a lot of captains through colonelsthe aides the guys who carry the football for examplewho work for him directly and if some enterprising reporter sniffs you out you can answer the same way they are instructed to sorry my duties in the white house are classified youll have to ask the white house still with me sir what i was really asking was how much of what im doing do i tell him or you as far as or me is concerned whatever you tell me i will tell the president when i think i should and only then the president is not interested in the means just the end thats what puts me back in the loop i will tell him only those things which may require some action on his partim thinking of hell no we cant do that tell him to stop he paused then asked you understand yes sir okay now is there anything you need just one thing i can think of sir i asked tom mcguire to do it for me but im not suredont misunderstand this i have a profound admiration for his abilitiesthat hell be able to do it you have a profound admiration for his abilities hall asked yes sir how would you like to have tom working for you is that possible sir joel suggested he would be very useful to you i agree should i ask tom id really like to have him sir castillo said and thought i have just proved that i too am learning to be a washington bureaucrat those answers were without being outandout lies certainly designed to mislead i already know tom wants to work for me and that its possible okay i will now what dont you think tom will be able to do find out what fbi agent yung is really doing in montevideo if hes doing something covertly theyre not going to tell tom what makes you think hes not doing what he says he is i dont think you want to know sir ah youre learning hall said has this guy got a first name david william sir junior hall pushed the speakerphone button on his telephone maryellen will you get me director schmidt on a secure line please right away mr secretary maryellen kensington said he pushed the button again and looked at castillo i know the dci knows about the finding he called me first thing this morning to feel me out about it i dont think schmidt has seen it yet this is oneupmanship charley a dirty game we all have to learn to play the speaker came alive with mrs kensingtons voice director schmidt is on one mr secretary the line is secure hall pushed the speakerphone button again good morning mark hall said cordially how are you what can i do for you matt youve seen the presidential finding visavis the masterson assassination right hall asked ignoring schmidts abruptness as a matter of fact no well hell that makes this a little difficult mark obviously i cant talk about it if you havent seen it so forget i mentioned it just take this as a routine request for information if you dont mind a suggestion you might ask the attorney general whats new what sort of information do you need matt schmidt said his voice betraying his annoyance would it be easier for you if i called the attorney general i dont want to put you on a spot what information do you need matt you have an agent in the embassy in montevideo david william yung junior hes supposed to be working on money laundering what i need to know is what hes really doing down there what makes you so sure hes not doing what he says hes doing were back to that area i cant talk about hall said are you sure you dont want me to go to the attorney general with this i know hes in the loop and im surprised that youre not ill look into it matt schmidt said and get back to you i need this information yesterday mark hall said so i have to ask how long do you think it will take for you to get back to me ill get back to you just as soon as i can probably this morning i appreciate that mark thank you anytime matt hall pushed the button breaking the connection see how its done he asked ill bet you two dollars to a doughnut that schmidt is already trying to get the attorney general on the horn the attorney general will tell him about the finding and that he has to go along with it which will also make the point that i knew about it before he did suggesting hes not as important as he likes to think he is its childish isnt it absolutely but thats the way things work hall said now that ive annoyed him is there anybody else youd like me to annoy sir when he calls back could you ask him to contact the fbi people in parisand in vienna come to think of itand ask them to give me whatever i need i will tell him that the chief of the office of organizational analysis wants to make sure they know that when they are contacted they will make any information they have on any subject available to him and that they will probably be contacted by a man named castillo he paused and then went on and i will contact ambassador montvale and tell him to do essentially the same thing visavis his cia station chiefs in paris and vienna and montevideo too if youd like thank you it would probably be a good idea when you speak with director schmidt to ask him to tell the fbi in montevideo to give me what i ask for hall nodded his agreement anything else charley i cant think of anything else sir let me run this past you hall said youre going to need someone to handle your paperwork someone who knows her way around washington what would you think about me asking agnes forbison if shed like to work with you i could really use her ill have a word with her as soon as i can hall said three over wilmington delaware july they had been in the air only a few minutes when castillo sensed the lear had changed altitude from climbingtocruisealtitude to descent there was only one reason he could think of for that they were about to land oh shit thats all i need red lights blinking on the panel the goddamn bird is broke he got out of his seat walked to the cockpit and dropped to his knees between the pilots and copilots seats whats going on fernando who was in the left seat looked over his shoulder please return to your seat sir and dont interfere with the flight crew in the performance of their duties whats wrong with the goddamn airplane colonel torine took pity on him you really didnt want to go to paris without saying goodbye to your girlfriend did you charley castillo didnt reply does it make any real difference if we get to paris at four in the morning or five torine went on ill top off the tanks get us something to eat en route get the weather and file the flight plan to gander while the secret service runs you back and forth to the hospital when castillo didnt reply to that either at least partially because he didnt trust himself to speak with the enormous lump in his throat torine went on tom mcguire called and set it up castillo laid a hand on torines shoulder and then got off his knees and went back to his seat four department of oral and maxillofacial surgery fifth floor silverstein pavilion hospital of the university of pennsylvania spruce street philadelphia pennsylvania july as the secret service yukon pulled up outside the hospital the agent sitting beside the driver spoke into the microphone under his lapel don juan arriving fernando chuckled castillo gave him the finger he wondered now that he had been given a hell of a lot of power if it would be enough to have the secret service change the code name joel isaacson had given him when hed gone to work for secretary hall the secret service agent led them to the elevator bank waved them inside and then said fifth floor mr castillo well be right here a tall stocky womanvisibly some kind of latin was standing in the lobby of the fifth floor when the elevator door opened her hair was drawn tight against her skull and castillo could see the fleshcolored speaker in her ear he could also see a bulge on her left hip that was almost certainly a handgun this way please mr castillo special agent schneider has been put in fivetwentyseven muchas gracias castillo said muy amable de su parte it wasnt hard to find room there were two law enforcement officers sitting in folding chairs on either side of the door one was wearing the motorcyclists boots and other special uniform items of the philadelphia police departments elite highway patrol the other was a large and burly man in civilian clothing with the telltale ear speaker of the secret service in his ear as castillo got close to the room both of them stood castillo glanced to his left and saw a glasswalled waiting room there were more than a half dozen people in it castillo recognized three of them as philadelphia police officers chief inspector fritz kramer the commander of the counterterrorism bureau captain frank obrien who headed the intelligence and organized crime unit and for whom betty schneider had worked as a sergeant and lieutenant frank schneider of the highway patrol who was bettys big and it could be reasonably argued somewhat overprotective brother there were also a couple who castillo decided were bettys parents a clergyman and several other people well what the hell did you expect that it would be just the two of you he had what he realized was the vain hope that no one in the waiting room would see him the secret service agent at the door said special agent schneider is in xray mr castillo she should be back any moment theres a waiting room he pointed any reason we cant wait in there no sir castillo and fernando entered the room the bed was mussed but castillo could see no other sign that betty had been in the room and i didnt see jack britton in that waiting room where the hell is he he walked to the window and looked out into an interior courtyard and turned only when he sensed the door to the room was opening betty was wheeled in on a gurney she didnt see castillo until the technicians had moved her from the gurney onto the bed and moved out of the way then she raised her hand and almost moaned oh charley through her wiredshut jaws castillo went to the bed and took her raised hand and kissed it and then bent over and kissed her very gently on the forehead then they just looked at each other thirty seconds or so later he took a chance that his voice would work wiener schnitzel baby he said betty smiled at him if you dont mind costello our mother wants to see her lieutenant frank schneider said behind him castillo turned standing behind bettys brother was the couple charley presumed were the parents behind them were the clergyman and another man whats the matter with you francis bettys mother snapped cant you see the way shes looking at him im sorry castillo said reluctantly betty let go of his hand bettys mother touched castillos cheek and stepped around him to the bed bettys father eyed him icily castillo walked out of the room followed by fernando and a moment later by lieutenant schneider did he leave because he wanted his mother and father and the minister to be alone with betty or did his mother tell him to get out costello lieutenant schneider said castillo turned schneider walked very close to him and asked you remember one time i promised to break both your legs both the highway patrolman and the secret service agent guarding bettys door were now on their feet the name is castillo charley said evenly and yes i seem to remember something like that i knew you were bad news the minute i laid eyes on you schneider said shes in there because of you castillo nodded slightly guilty if you ever show your face around her again i swear ill break both your legs and then tear off your arms and shove them up your ass castillo didnt reply fernando took a couple of steps closer let me tell you something shorty he said aware that shorty was relative lieutenant schneider at sixfeetone was at least two inches shorterand maybe forty pounds lighterthan fernando lopez butt out lardass lieutenant schneider said thats enough lieutenant chief inspector kramer barked back off now what i was about to tell the lieutenant fernando said matteroffactly is that the way it is in our family anyone wanting to get at charley has to get past me first dont pour gas on a fire chief inspector kramer said ask any fireman both of you shut up castillo chuckled you open your mouth once more schneider and ill order you out of here capische schneider nodded say yes sir lieutenant yes sir schneider said reluctantly charley i need to talk to you kramer said and obrien wants to know whats going on too if i order our gorilla to wait at that end of the corridorhe pointedcan you get your gorilla to wait down there he pointed in the other direction castillo looked at frank schneider i think you have a right to hear what im going to tell the chief he said can you behave lieutenant schneider nodded curtly say yes or no goddammit schneider kramer snapped okay okay lieutenant schneider said we can use the waiting room kramer said and pushed the door open well frank what do you think chief inspector kramer inquired of captain obrien when castillo had finished a lot of cocaine comes here from argentina obrien said i didnt know that fernando said they fly it from colombia to bolivia or paraguay sometimes direct to paraguayand then get it into argentina obrien explained and then they mule it to miami from buenos aires the argentine drug cops they call them sideare smart instead of arresting the critters they let them get on a plane and then call our dea guys down there the dea in miami meets the airplane that way the cocaine gets stopped and we have to pay to try the critters and the cost of keeping them in the slam for fifteen to twenty side does more than drugs captain castillo said its the argentine fbi cia and dea under one roof i didnt know that obrien said what im thinking is that the drug guyshere there everywheredo this kind of casual whacking anybody they think might be in the way of anything anybody they think may have seen or heard something gets whacked including members of their family im not saying youre wrong castillo said but that didnt come up down there either from a dea guy i know who would have told me or from the head of side what did they think was going on they had no idea castillo said all we knowand i didnt know this in argentinais that somebody wants to get their hands on jeanpaul lorimer and is perfectly willing to kill anybody to do that we had a job here in philadelphia a couple of years ago kramer said drugs shipped from where frank senegal obrien furnished from senegal to their un mission in new york with diplomatic immunity what happened was out of school castillo nodded our dogsnot k but the drug sniffers those little spaniels or whateversniffed the cocaine in freight handling we couldnt get a warrant to open the boxes of course but i happened to be down there looking for explosives and one of the boxes happened to get knocked over not much damage but put enough of a crack in the box for me to be able to stick one of those meatbasting hypodermic needles you know what i mean they have great big needles castillo nodded again into the box and come out with a white powder that tested to be really highgrade coke so we called in the dea who called in the fbi and customs and the state department it got to be a real chinese fire drill the state department didnt believe the white power had just dribbled out of the box they as much as accused us of violating diplomatic immunity they were afraid the senegalese ambassador would be pissed and give an antiamerican speech to the general assembly what finally happened was that the shipment was passed through customs then the fbi brought in the new york city cops told them what we knew and the new york cops put some heavy surveillance on the senegalese mission and they finally caught one of their diplomats he was number two right frank number three deputy chief of mission obrien corrected him in the midst of a fivekilo sale to a guy in the plaza hotel all they could do was charge the buyer with conspiracy to traffic they couldnt even hold the senegalese he had diplomatic immunity the state department wouldnt even ask for the un to send him home they said they couldnt because they had knowledge of the legally highly questionable manner in which the alleged facts triggering the investigation had been conducted this really pissed off the new york cops so wherever wherever the senegalese diplomat went for the next couple of months he had at least two cops sitting on him and then one day he had enough went out to kennedy and got on an airplane and went home jesus christ fernando exploded so when you find this guy youre looking for charley maybe you better keep the drug angle in mind kramer said i will castillo said how do you rate the threat against sergeant sorry special agent schneider kramer asked i dont think these bastards were after her they were either after me or anybodylike a secret service agent to make their point to mrs masterson so i dont think theres much of a threat here having said you sonofabitch lieutenant schneider interrupted you really dont out chief kramer exploded out of here schneider right goddamn now let him stay until i finish castillo said evenly kramer raised an eyebrow stared at schneider then sighed and nodded having said that castillo went on im going to keep secret service protection on her until i get the bastards that shot her the agents are pretty good at protecting people so are we chief kramer said and as far as youre concerned schneider when you come to visit your sister and you see detectives from dignitary protection sitting on her beside the secret service instead of highway you think long and hard about why i decided to do that now get out of here wait by the elevator im not through with you how about keeping him in here while i go say goodbye to her castillo asked i really have to get out of here right now kramer nodded sit there lieutenant schneider he ordered pointing to a vinylupholstered couch and if you get off that couch before i tell you you can ill have you up on charges kramer waited until lieutenant schneider angrily threw himself onto the couch and then put out his hand to castillo let me know what i can do to help thanks fritz castillo said and walked out of the waiting room special agent jack britton was standing by bettys door i only heard you were coming here fortyfive minutes ago charley i called miller and im glad youre here jack castillo said im headed for paris and what id like you miller told me britton interrupted everything thanks for keeping me on this i need you jack im on an american airlines flight from miami to buenos aires at eleven something tonight go to the four seasons and then get in touch with tony santini ill do it castillo pushed open the door to bettys room her mother and father were standing on either side of the bed her father gave him another icy look and when he did her mother looked over her shoulder and saw castillo charleys here honey her mother said dad and i will be right outside thank you mrs schneider castillo said softly he offered his hand we havent been formally introduced and im very sorry it had to be under such conditions bettys mother took his hand in both of hers made a soft smile then turned for the door her father shook his head walked wordlessly to the door and held it open for his wife then followed her through it castillo went to the bed and took bettys hand with great difficulty betty asked the mastersons okay theyve got twentyfour delta shooters and half of the mississippi state police sitting on them delta special forces guys she was surprised to hear that and asked with her eyes for an explanation long story baby not important but the mastersons are safe the key to this is her brother right after we landed in mississippi she told me the bad guys really want her brother she doesnt know where he is so im on my way to paris to find him he should know who these bastards are can you do that find him you mean im going to try hard just go to paris jesus christ i have to go through the classified business even with her baby this is top secretpresidential which means you cant tell anybody even your family especially your goddamn brother she nodded but her eyes asked for an explanation the president in what they call a finding set up a covert unit to find the people who did this he gave it to me together with all the authority i need to do whatever has to be done her eyebrows showed that she was impressed ill make sure they keep you up to speed on whats happening but you have to keep it to yourself will they tell me special agent schneider you are now assigned to the office of organizational analysis which is the cover for this castillo said im the chief youll be told i wish i could go with you jesus shes not thinking of us holding hands as we take the elevator to the top of the eiffel tower or sitting in the deux magots on the left bank she wants to go as a cop me too be careful charley wiener schnitzel baby i have to go he bent over kissed her very gently on the lips and looked into her eyes for a long moment then she shrugged squeezed his hand and motioned with her head toward the door as he and fernando got on the elevator he heard the latin secret service agent talk to her lapel microphone don juan coming down five hotel de crillon place de la concorde paris france july paris was just starting to wake up when they landed there had been little traffic on the way in from le bourget and the place de la concorde had been nearly empty of vehicles and pedestrians i think the best thing to do is grab some sack time castillo announced as they registered what about leaving a call for half past ten good idea torine said castillo knew the problem was going to be jet lag their body clocks thought it was midnight not half past five in the morning they werent really tired or even particularly sleepy despite the time they had been up and the distances they had traveled since getting up almost twentyfour hours before at the masterson plantation in mississippi for one thing that had been only eighteen hours ago in real time paris time was six hours ahead of mississippi for another theyd shared the piloting between them from philadelphia to gander newfoundland and then to shannon ireland and finally le bourget the offduty pilota role each had playedhad nothing to do but doze and the lears seats in the main cabin which folded back to near horizontal had made dozing easy it was as if theyd gotten up early and taken several naps before midnight the temptation was to take a quick shower grab a quick breakfast and then rouse the paris cia station chief from his bed and get to work finding jeanpaul lorimer the smart thing to do was to take a quick shower and go to bed sleeping as long as possible when sleep proved impossible with a little bit of luck the body clock might be fooled and it would be something like getting up fresh and ready to do a full days work castillo tipped the bellman and then looked around his suite the heavy curtain across the windows of his bedroom was permitting a crack of light he went to it and impulsively pushed it aside far enough to look out he had a view of the place de la concorde and the bridge across the river seine then he pulled the curtain closed took fresh linen from his bag and started to undress he was down to his jockey shorts when the telephone rang hello five minutes in front of the hotel howard kennedy said im in a black mercedes i expected no less of you castillo replied even though halfway through the sentence he realized kennedy had hung up ten minutes laterhaving decided that his need for a shave and a shower was more important than jumping to obey kennedys curt orderscastillo walked across the empty lobby and out onto the place de la concorde there was no mercedes in sight not to worry kennedy might be pissed but he wants to see me and badly hes not about to drive off never to return castillo turned right and walked toward the us embassy he had just reached the fence where he was able to see the american flag flying in the courtyard when he heard the squeal of tires he turned and saw a black mercedes s sedan in front of the crillon the headlights flashed castillo walkedpurposely slowlyback to it the front passenger window was down but the door remained closed castillo leaned down put his hands on the opening and looked inside hello handsome he said to kennedy who was sitting behind the wheel looking for a little action goddamn you charley get in the fucking car castillo opened the door and got in kennedy with another squeal of tires took off and then turned right onto the champselysees where are we going howard unless you know someplace we can talk without being overheard were just going to drive around you think my room in the crillon is bugged i dont know for sure that its not why all the concern how much do you know about lorimer a little more than i knew when i first talked to you castillo replied there are people looking for him they killed masterson to make the point that they are willing to kill to find him and do you know who these people are no thats why im hunting lorimer would it surprise you that some russians are doing the same nothing would surprise me or some germans same answer or some french or some former members of saddam husseins regime or for that matter some people from houston texas get to the point please howard im not good at riddles your friend lorimer was a bagmanmaybe the head bagmanfor that noble program called oil for food which means that he knows who got paid off thats enough for any of the aforementioned people to take the appropriate steps to make him dead give me a minute to think that over a traffic cop stepped into the street and with a shrill burst from his whistle and an arrogant wave of his stiff arm stopped traffic kennedy with a heavy foot brought the mercedes to a stop at the crosswalk as castillo watched the trickle of earlymorning commuters making their way to cafes and then to work he considered how kennedy mightor might notbe trying to play him in addition to his knowing too much charley there are those who think he skimmed the payoff money to the tune of somedepending on who you talk to twelve to sixteen million dollars jesus yeah jesus and one more little item this gets uncomfortably close to alex how alex how do you think you move that kind of money around by wire transfer by ups you tell me one hundred thousand us dollars fresh from the mint comes in a neatly wrapped plastic package about so big kennedy said taking his hands off the wheel to demonstrate the size he could have been mimicking a stubby shoe box the traffic cop blew another burst of his whistle and waved traffic forward and alex moves freight right castillo said no questions asked you dont really expect me to answer that do you so why are you telling me what you did alex thinks youre a lot smarter than i do kennedy said he thinks its possible youll find this sonofabitch before anybody else does and that youll share that information with him tell alex sorry no i want this sonofabitch alive not with a beauty mark in the center of his forehead why so he can tell you whos after him exactly you really are a virgin arent you these people are untouchable believe me the answer is no howard tell alex that i told him thats what you would probably decide kennedy said they were now almost to the arc de triomphe de letoile kennedy made an abrupt left turn onto rue pierre charron and stopped get out charley conversation over without another word castillo got out of the car kennedy drove quickly off castillo walked back to the champselysees and then down it toward the crillon xv one suite hotel de crillon place de la concorde paris france july there was a knock at the door and castillo still chewing on a piece of toast stood up from the breakfast table and went to open the door a nondescript man in his late fiftiesmaybe a little olderwas standing there in a somewhat rumpled suit mr castillo right youre mr delchamps the man nodded come on in would you like some breakfast no thanks maybe some coffee delchamps shook his head and looked at fernando and torine i wasnt told about anybody else delchamps said this is colonel torine and mr lopez castillo said and this is mr edgar delchamps the cia station chief not only wasnt i told about anyone else but mr castillo as you may or may not know the identity of the cia station chief whoever that might be is classified not a problem mr delchamps both the colonel and mr lopez have the necessary clearances how do i know that someone from the office of the director of national intelligence was supposed to have given you a headsup about what were doing here someone did but only your name was mentioned it looks to me that there is some sort of a communications problem castillo said before we go any further with this why dont we go next door to the embassy get on a secure line to the director of national intelligence and clear this up its half past one in the morning in washington delchamps said i know but i dont have time to waste playing the classified game with you mr delchamps maybe later delchamps said i was told you were interested in a man named jeanpaul lorimer what do you want to know about him everything you know about him the phrase used was tell him anything you think you should delchamps said then there is a communications problem between ambassador montvale and whoever you spoke with castillo said what he was supposed to tell you was to tell me whatever i wanted to know and what i want to know is everything it was montvale who called me delchamps said and the phraseology he used was you were to tell me what you think you should thats what he said in that case mr delchamps when we go next door and get on the secure phone were going to talk to the president and you are going to tell him what ambassador montvale told you delchamps didnt reply for what its worth mr delchamps colonel torine said i was with mr castilloon air force onewhen the president told ambassador montvale that mr castillo was to have anything he asked for why should i believe that delchamps asked no reason torine said except its the truth delchamps considered that for a moment then said fuck it excuse me castillo said i said fuck it dont tell me you never heard that phrase before montvale said youre really an army officer a major guilty who was given more authority than he clearly will be able to handle and wont have it long that sonofabitch torine exploded yeah delchamps said youre going to have to go to the president charley torine said before you do that let me tell you where im coming from delchamps said and well see how this plays out go ahead castillo said ive been in this business a long time delchamps said long enough to be able to retire tomorrow if i want to i have been around long enough to see a lot of hard work blownand for that matter people killed because some hotshot with political power and a personal agenda stuck his nose in what was being developed and blew it ive been working on this scum lorimer for a long time years and it hasnt been easy how so castillo asked have you got any clue what hes been up to yeah castillo said hes a bagman maybe the most important bagman in the iraqi oilforfood scheme castillo saw the surprise on torines and fernandos faces he had not told them what kennedy had told him only that they had met and kennedy didnt know where lorimer was the skinny is as you know castillo said that the french wanted to ease the sanctions on hussein but the united statesand the britssaid hell no so in its infinite wisdom the un security council in stepped in with oil for food saying it would keep the iraqi people alive it in fact provided saddam a way to reward his friendly frogs and russians and other crooks oil allocations totaled some sixtyfive billion dollars by the time the united states bagged baghdadand with it the programin theres plenty to skim off sixtyfive thousand million dollars and lorimer was there holding the bag and taking names you want to tell me where you got that about lorimer being the bagman delchamps asked it was close to a challenge no ill ask you again later delchamps said maybe youll change your mind anything is possible castillo said okay for the sake of argument hes been the most important bagman he knows maybe fifty percent of the peoplemaybe morewhove been paid off how much theyve been paid off how and when and what for some of these people are in the un high up in the un therefore the un is not interested in having this come out some of those paid off are french the french have an interesting law that says the president of france cannot be investigated while hes holding that office and the deuxieme bureauyou know what that is castillo nodded they regard the agency as a greater threat to la belle france than the schutzstaffel ever was and cooperate accordingly thats made looking into this difficult i can see where it would castillo said same thing for the germans delchamps went on ive still got some friends on the other side of the rhinei did some time in berlin and vienna in the good old days of the cold warand theyve fed me some stuff together with the friendly advice to watch my back as some very important germans were involved and dont want it to come out there were a lot of russians involved too a lot of the cash we found in saddam husseins closets got there on airplanes owned by a legendary russian businessman by the name of aleksandr pevsner you ever hear that name ive heard it castillo said he runs sort of a covert fedex courier service for people who want to ship things around the world without anybody knowing about it going off on a tangent with pevsner about a month ago i was toldall the station chiefs were toldnot to look into anything that sonofabitch was doing without the specific approval of langley in each case pevsner was involved with the oilforfood business castillo asked not directly as far as ive been able to figure out what he did was move the money aroundlike so much freightand i suspect that a lot of stuff saddam hussein wasnt supposed to get got to baghdad on his airplanes torines eyes met castillos for a moment which brings us to the americans delchamps went on we had several enterprising businessmen in houston who were in the oilforfood racket up to their eyeballs forgive me if i sound cynical but it has been my experience that when rich oil guys make large contributions to politicians the politicians lend sympathetic ears to them when for example they want the agency and the fbi etcetera to lay off another businessman like for example this guy pevsner delchamps paused can i change my mind about the coffee absolutely castillo said and picked up the coffee pitcher delchamps took the cup added sugar and stirred it for a moment so there i was a couple of days ago when this lorimer business came up i dont think i follow you castillo said the secret service guy here is a pal of mine you know two old dinosaurs in a forest of young politically correct state department flits some pal of his called him up and asked him to find lorimer and he came to me because he knew i was working on him he took a sip of coffee and then went on i knew it was going to go bad even before the ambassador called me in and asked about lorimer hed had a call from whatsername cohen the secretary of state herself natalie cohen castillo furnished feisty little broad delchamps said i like her anyway there i was about to really bag the little bastard when somebody blows the whistle on the whole thing you want to explain that my somewhat cynical makeup made me suspect that somebody in langley had a big mouth and told somebody in foggy bottom that i was about to finish my report on lorimer there are people in foggy bottom who deeply regret the current feelings of ill will between the frogs and the united statesand between some senators investigating the oilforfood scam and the unand think it would be just dreadful if we exacerbated those unfortunate situations by suggesting we had information that the frogsall the way up to chirac and maybe him toowere involved and that the bagman was a un diplomat you thought they were going to kill your report castillo asked bury it delchamps said the way lorimer was buried if he was lucky excuse me castillo said its possible of course that hes in moscow or maybe berlin telling all he knows about who got paid off besides the russians or germans knowing where the other guys bodies are buried is a very useful diplomatic tool it keeps them from talking about where yours are youre suggesting that lorimer has been killed castillo asked he was lucky if he was killed quickin other words just to shut him up if somebody wanted to know what he knew they did a real job on his pal a lebanese named henri douchon in vienna to encourage him to answer questions they pulled two of his fingernails and half a dozen of his teeth then they cut his throat when was this castillo asked a couple of weeks ago when was the last time anybody saw lorimer castillo asked going by his american express charges he flew to vienna on the twelfth of this month the same day he boughtor somebody bought using his amex carda train ticket from vienna here i dont know if he ever used it it might be something to throw off anybody looking for him but he might have come back here just dont know a scenario that occurs to me is that he was grabbed when he went to see his pal douchon then they took him somewhere to ask him questions or didnt following either possibility they cut him up in little pieces and dropped him into the beautiful blue danube or he came back here where they grabbed him and after he answered their questions what was left of him was dropped into the seine have you considered he might be in hiding castillo asked sure dont think so my guess is that hes dead these are very nasty people who wouldnt think twice before they took him out i heard he might have been skimming from the payoff money castillo said could be i doubt it he was paid well of course but i cant find any trace of big money and you think you would have been able to delchamps nodded confidently i even got into his apartment he said he had some really nice stuff antiques paintings etcetera more than he could afford on what the un paid him but a lot less i think than he would have had had he been stupid enough to try to steal from these guys okay castillo said thanks but one more question if for the sake of argument he were hiding where would you guess that would be in a closet somewhere delchamps said or under a bed jeanpaul lorimer was a wimp he didnt have the balls to be a criminal you knew him i saw him around im the cultural attache at the embassy i can put the opera et cetera on the expense accountand i get invited to all the parties the corps diplomatique loves to have americans around so they can tell us how were fucking up the world he paused okay thats what i know anything you think i missed id like to see all your files on lorimer castillo said so they can disappear into the black hole photocopies would do that way youd still have the originals youre not asking for the originals castillo shook his head photocopies would be fine how long would it take you to make copies which you would then turn over to montvaleor somebody in the agency maybeso they could message me to immediately transfer by courier the originals of the documents listed below and certify destruction of any copies thereof i dont have to give montvale anything castillo said and right now i cant think of anything i want to give him and as far as the agency is concerned i am on langleys fuck the bastard if possible list i want the copies for me delchamps inclined his head obviously in thought then he took another sip of his coffee finally he leaned back in his chair and lit a small cigar odd that you should ask about photocopies of my files on lorimer mr castillo by a strange coincidence i spent most of the afternoon and early evening yesterday starting right after ambassador montvale called me making photocopies of them at the time i was thinking of retiring and writing a book what the cia didnt want to get out about oil for food what about the my lips are sealed forever plus three weeks statement you signed you could get your tail in a crack doing something like that you ever run into a guy named billy waugh castillo nodded i thought you might have delchamps said billy wrote a book called i had osama bin laden in my sights and the wimps at langley wouldnt let me terminate himor something like thatand nothing ever happened to billy they were probably afraid that billy would write another one cia assholes i have known castillo said delchamps chuckled i thought about that he said and i figured theyd probably come to the same conclusion about me he pushed himself out of the chair and held his hand out with his thumb and index finger held wide apart it makes a stack about this big he said ill go next door and get them thanks castillo said one more question why did you change your mind about telling me anything straight answer please like i said im a dinosaur ive been doing this a long time when i was a kid starting out in berlin we had guys there who had been in the second war jedburghs people like that i even knew bill colby one of them told me if you couldnt look into a mans eyes and size him up youd better find something else to do he was right youthe three of youhave all got the right look delchamps nodded at fernando and torine and walked out of the room when the door had closed fernando said so lorimers dead so now what gringo we dont know that hes dead castillo said from what delchamps said if lorimer was grabbed it was around the twelfth of this month they didnt even abduct mrs masterson until the twentieth or blow masterson away until the morning of the twentythird thats several days i think they would have heard in that time if somebody had blown lorimer away okay fernando said same question what now go get sergeant kranz out of bed castillo said tell him to get packed sergeant first class seymour kranz a deltagray fox communicator had been one of the two communicators theyd picked uptogether with their satellite communications equipmentat fort bragg colonel torine had told kranz he had been chosen to go with them to europe rather than the other communicator who had set up at the nebraska avenue complex because torine devoutly believed that when flying across an ocean every pound counted kranz was barely over the armys height and weight minimums the real reason was that kranz had been with torine and castillo when they were searching for the stolen and proved that you dont have to be six feet tall and weigh two hundred pounds to be a firstrate special operator where are we going torine asked were going to see my uncle otto castillo said and walked to the couch and sat down and picked up the telephone on the coffee table in front of it two executive offices die fulda tages zeitung fulda hesse germany july frau gertrud schroeder was a stockybut by no means fat or even chubbysixtyyearold hessian who wore her gray hair done up in a bun she had been employed by the tages zeitung since she was twenty and had always worked for the same man otto goerner otto goerner had joined the firm shortly after he graduated from philipps university in marburg an der lahn in part because he was wilhelm von und zu gossingers best friend wilhelm was the son and heir apparent to herman wilhelm von und zu gossinger the managing director and just about sole stockholder in gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh when gertrud joined the gossinger firm it had been a mediumsized corporation not nearly as large as it had been before world war ii or was now the firms prewar holdings in hungary and what had become east germanytimber farms newspapers breweries and other businesseshad been confiscated by the communist east german and hungarian governments by otto goerner had risen in the corporate hierarchy to become herman wilhelm von und zu gossingersthe old mansassistant the title did not reflect his true importance he was the de facto number two man but clearly stating this would have been awkward wilhelm von und zu gossinger was supposed to be number two in the family firm it had been gertruds very privately held opinion at the time that the issue would be resolved when otto married frau erika von und zu gossinger frau erika had never married she was called frau out of respect for the familys sensitivities as a very young girl erika had made a mistake with an american aviator of all people the result of which was a boy christened karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger at the time no one knew where the father was gertrud knew the old man could have found him if he wanted to and concluded the old man had decided that no father at all was better for the time being than an american who might get his hands on gossinger money the time being in gertruds judgment meant until the old man could arrange a marriage between his daughter and his assistant heeveryoneknew that otto goerner was extraordinarily fond of frau erika and little karlchen and that the old man thought goerner would be both a good husband to erika and a good father to his only grandson whom he adored and once they were married of course it would be entirely appropriate for otto goerner now a member of the family to hold any position within the family firm the issue was resolved that yearbut not in the way gertrud hopedwhen a tire blew on wilhelm von und zu gossingers mercedes as he and his father were on their way home from kassel the police estimated the car was traveling in excess of kilometers per hour when it crashed through the guardrails of a bridge on the a autobahn and fell ninety meters into the ravine below that meant that frau erika became just about the sole stockholder of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh what shares she did not now own were in a trust fund the old man had set up for karlchen who was then twelve as expected otto goerner became the managing director of the firm frau gertrud believed it was now simply a matter of waiting for an appropriate period of time of mourningsay six monthsto pass before frau erika married otto that didnt happen either frau erika was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer she turned to the us army to find little karlchens father he was located in the national cemetery in san antonio texas under a tombstone on which was carved a representation of the medal of honor his family was located too and to frau gertrud it seemed that the gossinger empire was about to pass into the hands of a texas family of mexican extraction and that poor little karlchen was about to be moved from the family mansionhaus im waldin bad hersfeld to an adobe shack on the texas desert where his newly found grandfather would doze in the sun with his sombrero over his eyes as flies buzzed around him that didnt happen either less than twentyfour hours after she learned that her son had left a love child behind him in germany dona alicia castillo was at the door of the house in woods where she told frau erika she had come to take care of her and the boy she was shortly followed by don fernando castillo her husband little karlchens grandfather and president and chief executive officer of castillo enterprises inc when gertrud turned to standard amp poors to see exactly what that was she learned that castillo enterprises inc was a privately held corporation with estimated assets worth approximately times those of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh two weeks before frau erika died don fernando castillo took little karlchen now renamed carlos guillermo castillo to texas and left for the time being until i can get a handle on whats what otto goerner as managing director of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh for the time being lasted until c g castillo came into his inheritance at twentyoneshortly before he graduated from the us military academy at west point one of his first official acts in his role as sole stockholder of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh was to negotiate a lifelong contract with otto goerner to serve as managing director it provided for an annual salary and a percentage of the profits guten morgen gertrud otto goerner said as he walked into his office he was a tall heavyset ruddyfaced man who many people thought was a bavarian karlchen just called frau schroeder said why didnt you tell him to call me in the car hes coming here him and fernando and two others he say why he said he wants to show youat the haus im walda new satellite phone he says youll probably want to buy for all our foreign correspondents gott we got a charge for him and three others for last night at the crillon frau schroeder announced it was frau schroeders custom as her first or second order of business to daily check the charges karl w gossinger had made against his tages zeitung american express card it let the both of them know where he was the one in paris she nodded and he still has roomsmaybe just onein the four seasons in buenos aires i wonder what our karlchen is up to you could ask him weve been over this before gertrud if i ask him something im likely to get an answer that i really dont want to hear gertrud didnt reply a new satellite phone what the hell is that all about goerner asked since youre not going to ask him well probably never know she said did he say when heswhen they are coming today he say what flight theyll be on and can i make it to rhinemain in time to meet it he said they have fernandos airplane and are going to leipzighalle they flew across the atlantic in that little jet is that one of those questions you really dont want the answer to another one is why leipzig the last i heard frankfurt is much closer to paris we never know what our karlchen is up to do we really up to goerner said as opposed to what he says he is so when do they get to leipzig he said it would probably take them an hour and a half to get out of paris and that its a little more than an hours flight to leipzighalle that was ten minutes ago so they should arrive between tenthirty and eleven if i leave right now and drive very dangerously i might be able to meet them can you get them all in your car she asked probably not he said if they have much luggage no well just have to rent a car at the airport or i could drive over there in my car why would you want to do that the last time he was in here i had maybe two whole minutes alone with him dont let me forget to call my wife and tell her theyre coming goerner said three flughafen leipzighalle july my god castillo greeted goerner and schroeder whos minding the store he kissed frau schroeder wetly on the forehead ach karlchen she said wheres your friends goerner asked going through immigration we germans cant be too careful about what americans we let into the country you know i dont think thats very funny karl goerner said neither do i castillo said but the facts are that as a good german i got waved through and my friends are being very carefully examined by the authorities just who are your friends one is an air force colonel and the other is a special forces sergeant i wont ask you what theyre doing here because i dont think you would tell me the truth and even if you did i dont think i would want to know ill tell you we are looking into the oilforfood scandal we already have people on that story and i want to talk to them especially the guy who covered the murder of msieu douchon in vienna and i want to hear more about what the alte marburgers were saying about sanctuary i dont think we should have this conversation here karl do you goerner interrupted probably not we can have it in the car on the way to bad hersfeld castillo said he turned to frau schroeder i dont think you want to be involved in this tante gertrud she put both hands on his cheeks and looked into his eyes i wish to god you werent involved in this karlchen she said but since you are dont you dare try to exclude me fernando lopez walked up he wrapped an arm around frau schroeders shoulders kissed her on the cheek and said still taking care of ol whatsisname are you frau gertrud somebody has to she said your grandmother is well i hope very well thank you if she knew i was going to make this grand tour of europe im sure she would have sent her love how are you fernando otto asked i dont know otto fernando said i have the uncomfortable feeling that i have just become a file in some vast teutonically thorough database of suspicious people neither otto nor gertrud responded colonel torine and sergeant kranzwho was towing an enormous hardsided suitcase behind himwalked up to them a moment later everything okay seymour castillo asked yes sir the authorities who tried hard failed to find any explosives or controlled substances in my luggage seymour this is mr goerner who has been trying to straighten me out since i was in diapers and this is frau schroeder who keeps him on the straight and narrow how do you do kranz said herr gossinger tells me youre in the army herr kranz frau schroeder asked dubiously kranz looked at castillo who nodded before replying not exactly maam kranz said in german im special forces you mean she asked with the beret the green beret yes maam kranz said with the beret how very interesting she said and you speak german yes maam most of us speak a couple of languages and this is colonel jake torine of the air force castillo said if youre responsible for keeping karlcharleyon the straight and narrow colonel you have my profound sympathy goerner said i think of him as the cross i have to bear as a righteous man torine said me too goerner said four haus im wald near bad hersfeld kreis hersfeldrotenburg hesse germany july frau helena goerner a svelte blonde who was a bavarian but who didnt look as if she would be comfortable in an embroidered dirndl and with her hair braided into pigtails had lunch waiting for them when they arrived at haus im wald welcome home karl she said in english offering him her cheek to kiss as if he were a very distant relative entitled to the privilege then she did the same to fernando dona alicia maria and your adorable children are doing well i trust fernando very well thank you helena fernando replied and your rug rats how and where are they castillo and otto chuckled our children are here but i wasnt sure if it would be appropriate for them to have luncheon with us helena you have to remember that your rug rats are my godchildren castillo said bring em on absolutely fernando chimed in the more rug rats the better frau goerner forcing a smile turned to a maid wearing a crisp white cap and apron ilse will you bring the children to the dining room please she said adding to everyone else ill join you there she walked out of the foyer do you two have to do your best to destroy my happy marriage otto asked he didnt seem to be really annoyed with them the both of you should be ashamed of yourselves frau gertrud said but she didnt seem very annoyed either i somehow got the feeling our hostess does not like my godchildren referred to as her rug rats castillo said to torine and kranz i will introduce you sensed that did you goerner asked sarcastically you two to her when she gets her bavarian temperunder control he pointed to a door thats the elevator the athletically inclined can use the stairs when he was about nine or ten otto said karl used to go to the stables collect the catsfive six moreand load them on the elevator his grandfather who wouldnt let karlchen use the elevator and who hated cats would summon the elevator and when the door opened theyd all rush out into his bedroom you could hear the old man in fulda he was a wicked little boy frau gertrud said smiling fondly who looked like an angel is that a what the hell is this look on your face jake castillo asked torine and then went on without waiting for an answer i was born in this house i lived here until i was twelve castillo saw the look on kranzs face and went on long story seymour ill brief you later lets go up to the dining room and have a beer in a manner of speaking i make it myself if helena offers champagne karl goerner said firmly you will drink it jawohl castillo said smiling he clicked his heels and waved everybody onto the elevator it was a tight fit but they all managed to get on the dining room was an enormous room on the third floor one wall was covered with a huge heavy curtain castillo walked to it found a switch and tripped it the curtains opened revealing floortoceiling plateglass windows offering a vista of gently rolling farmlands nice view torine said come here castillo said and professor castillo will offer a lecture on fairly recent military history another maid in crisp white cap and apron appeared with a tray holding champagne stems castillo torine and kranz were taking glasses from the tray when helena appeared ah our hostess castillo said youll have to forgive my bad manners helena this is colonel jacob torine of the us air force and mr kranz of afc electronics of las vegas nevada who is going to demonstrate the satellite telephone im going to recommend to otto that he buy for the tages zeitungs correspondents gentlemen our hostess frau helena goerner helena had her temper under control and was charming you have a lovely home frau goerner torine said the view is spectacular yes it is isnt it i was about to deliver a little lecture about the land helena may i go on of course she said with a hint of a smile and a visible lack of enthusiasm if you will look halfway across that glorious field of corn castillo said pointing you will see a strip perhaps seventyfive meters wide where the growth isnt nearly as luxurious as the rest yeah torine said curiously having spotted what castillo had pointed out at one time as difficult as it might be to believe in this time of peace and love for our fellow man that strip was sewn with mines about half of them bouncing betties they were placed there by the east german authorities that was the east germanwest german border torine interrupted yes it was may i continue of course excuse me the mines were placed there by the east germans to keep the west germans from rushing over there to take advantage of the manifold benefits of communism castillo went on karlchen be careful frau gertrud ordered and just this side of the stillpolluted soil there used to be a road on which members of the us army used to patrol this is really marvelous champagne helena might i have another yes of course helena said and snapped her fingers impatiently at the maid who hurried up with her tray castillo took an appreciative swallow and went on as i was saying there was a road on which valiant americans of the eleventh and fourteenth armored cavalry regiments patrolled to keep the west germans from escaping into east germany one of those heroic young americans was someone you both know second lieutenant allan naylor came here just about straight from west point after pausing only long enough to take a bride and the basic officers course at fort knox naylor was here torine asked fascinating as a second john and later as a major castillo confirmed and he learned of course the legend of the haus im wald karl goerner warned castillo ignored him would you like to hear the legend castillo asked innocently torine was silent i would kranz said well the legend was that in this house which was known to the stalwart troopers of the eleventh and fourteenth as the castle there lived a blond fair maiden princess who was ferociously guarded by her father the king also known as the old man he didnt keep the fair maiden in chains or anything like that but he did do his best to keep her away from the americans who as any frenchman and many germans will happily tell you are bent on destroying culture around the world dont you think thats enough goerner asked im almost finished otto castillo said i dont think youre being funny anymore karl otto said then dont laugh castillo said well one day inevitably i suppose the inevitable happened an american knight in shining armor rode up actually he was flying in the left seat of a dog model huey he set it down right there on the cobblestones next to the stable he pointed he had several things going for him he was an army aviator for one thing and everybody knows they possess a certain pizzazz most important he was a texicanas fernando will tell you handsome young texicans send out vibes that women simply cannot resist and such was the case here he looked up at the mansion and saw the beautiful princess she saw him their eyes locked there was the sound of violins the earth shook fireworks filled the sky a choir of angels sang ich liebe dich and other such tunes and about nine months later they had a beautiful boy child who stands here before you oh karlchen frau gertrud said emotionally your father was an army aviator kranz asked where is he now he didnt make it back from vietnam castillo said evenly im sorry yeah me too castillo said lecture over i hope you took notes as there will be a written exam why dont we sit down helena said is that a true story onkel karl a very young voice inquired it showed on helena goerners face that she had not been aware her children had been standing in the door and really didnt like it that they had ah my favorite godchildren castillo said yeah willi thats a true story castillo walked to the door and embraced one at a time two boys one ten and the other twelve the twelveyearold asked whats vietnam a terrible place a long way from here castillo said changing the subject seymour what time is it in washington about half past six kranz replied and how long is it going to take you to set up that depends on where you want it how about next to the stable where the knight in shining armor once touched down ten minutes you planning to leave it there not for long castillo said so why dont we have lunch then while i have a little talk with otto you have it up and running by oheighthundred washington time can do five a marvelous lunch helena thank you castillo said im glad you liked it karl she said castillo motioned to one of the maids for more coffee when she had poured it he said danke schon and turned to goerner so tell us otto what you heard at the fundraiser in marburg about the boys moving money to argentina castillo said goerner didnt reply you said two things otto that caught my attention you said what caught your attention was they said something about ha ha der fuhrer was the first to come up with that idea helena flashed him a cold look i dont think the children should hear this she said your call of course helena castillo said but when i was even younger than the boys my grandfather at this very table told me all about the evils the national socialist german workers partymore popularly known as the nazishad brought to our fair land he thought it was important that i knew about it as early as possible her face tightened and grew white you remember otto dont you castillo went on the old man sitting where you are now sitting you and onkel willi and my mother sitting over there and me sitting where willi is i remember karl goerner said helena stood up and threw her napkin on the table come on boys she said you dont have to stay liebchen otto said but the boys will she locked eyes with him and then walked out of the room goerner looked at castillo your mother used to say you know that the one thing you really inherited from the old man was his complete lack of tact he said castillo nodded and then said you said you thought the money they were moving was from oil for food goerner nodded let me tell you where im coming from karl he said when you were being a smartass before with the legend of the castle it started me thinking you were right your grandfather didnt like americans and if the old man were alive today he probably would like them even less but then i realized that if he were still here and knew whats going on and an american intelligence officernot you not his grandson any american intelligenceofficer he thought he could trustcame to him and asked about this he would have told him everything he knew and youre right karl i am sitting in the old mans chair and in this chair i have always tried to do what the old man would do you understand me thats why were talking about what we never said out loud before what you really are thats why im going to tell you what i know and thats why i wanted the boys to hear this the old man was right about that too youre never too young to learn what a lousy world were living in i understand otto castillo said some of this i know myself goerner began but most of it comes from eric kocian who hes the editor of the budapester neue zeitung goerner said he looked at torine thats one of ours which is to say one of charleys charley did tell you didnt he that hes the owner of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh thats the holding company for everything no he didnt torine said he looked at castillo and added it probably just slipped his mind okay eric is an old man well into his seventies hes half hungarian and half viennese he was an eighteenyearold gefreitecorporalin the old mans regiment in stalingrad they were really seriously wounded which turned out to be a good thing for them they were evacuated on the same plane they didnt wind up in siberia for a decade or so after the surrender at stalingrad after the war eric came herevienna was nothing but rubble what was left of his family had been killed the day the americans tried to bomb the hauptbahnhof and missed and destroyed saint stephens cathedraland he really didnt have anyplace else to go the old man put him to work on the farm and then on the tages zeitung when he could start that up again and then when the old man got the wiener tages zeitung up and running eric went to vienna he was managing editor about to retire when we got the budapester zeitung presses back from the communists eric came to me when he heard i was thinking of selling the plant and asked that he be allowed to try to get the zeitung up and running again i didnt think that would work but i knew the old man wouldnt have told him no so i agreed we renamed it the budapester neue zeitung and he started it up it worked its the largest germanlanguage newspaper in hungary and is actually a competitor of the wiener tages zeitung in slovakia the czech republic and eastern austria hes the guy who did the story on the lebanese whats his name douchon who was murdered in vienna castillo asked the first story was written by one of our men on the wiener tages zeitung when eric saw it on our wire he had serious doubts about it so he went to vienna himself where of course he knew everybody especially the senior police and they told him that it wasnt a goerner stopped and looked uncomfortably at his sons for a moment and then went on a case of one more middle eastern homosexual being murdered by his blond viennese boyfriend as our man had hinted but most likely by people who wanted to shut douchons mouth so that he wouldnt be talking about oil for food eric had already been looking into the oilforfood story and it fit what hed dug up himself so he came to mecame here he didnt trust the telephoneand told me about it and said he really wanted to go into it i told him he was liable to get himself killed and he responded at my age what a good way to go out on a big story so i told him no id assign people to the story and then he said okay then i retire im going to do this story did he retire of course not goerner said i want to talk to him tomorrow ill have to go with you goerner said like most people around here kocian thinks youre squandering the old mans money while pretending to be our washington correspondent he actually pointed out to me the striking similarities between a story we published under your byline and a piece that appeared in the american conservative magazine i forget what it was but you certainly didnt spend a lot of time paraphrasing that story ill try to be more careful in the future castillo said goerner nodded your original question karl was about money being hidden or washed in south america especially argentina yes it was ive always been fascinated with that and so was your grandfather the nazis didnt think it up they werent that clever it actually started after the first world war and the versailles convention the french and the english you will recall got german east africa as reparations as well as just about everything that could be taken out of germany proper goerner paused then asked this is going to be a rather long lecture you sure you want me to go on i dont know about charley torine said but yes please go on otto please castillo said as bad as the geneva convention wasand im one of those people who think it made hitlers coming to power and thus world war two inevitableit did not confiscate outright the holdings of individual germans or hungarians or anyone else in what had been german east africa it simply changed the colonial government from german to french and english people still owned their farms and businesses and whatever then the french and english levied taxes on the farms businesses etcetera which they had every legal right to do the problem was that the taxes had to be paid now in french francs and english pounds the german mark was worthless there was no way a german landholder could come up with enough francs or pounds to pay his taxes the properties were then confiscated for nonpayment of taxes and sold at auction in francs or pounds to the highest bidders most of whom happened to be frenchmen and englishmen dirty pool torine said of questionable morality perhaps but perfectly legal goerner went on the only people who did not lose their property were a lucky fewincluding some of your hungarian kin karlwho for one reason or another had gold on deposit in south africa the south africans hated the english and the french and closed their eyes when the gold that germans held in their banks was transferred to either some friendly south african or swiss bank then when the tax auctions were held lo and behold some of the bidders were swiss and south african who were able to buy francs and pounds at very favorable rates with their gold and be in a position to outbid the french and the english who had come to the auctions looking for a real bargain thats how your nagyneni olga karl excuse me torine interrupted my hungarian aunt olga castillo furnished she lived with us here until i was what otto about seven or eight you were eight when olga died goerner said anyway because they had gold in south africa olga and her husband who was then still alive managed to not only hang on to their former german east african property but to buy at auction the gossinger holdings which otherwise would have gone to some undeserving frenchman or englishman after world war two the communists in hungary of course confiscated everything she owned there but when the old man finally got her out of hungary she still held title to the african properties she left it to the old man when she died he held it until he decided that kenya was not really going to become the african paradise the new black leaders said it was going to be after independence i never heard any of this before castillo confessed all you had to do was ask karl goerner said the importance about all of this is that people learned the lesson they understood that it was prudent to have hard currency out of whatever country they lived in this proved a boon to the swiss banking industry who instituted the numbered account and really strict banking secrecy laws the trick was to get the money out of your country without letting your government know this generally required that you have a friend in the country where you wanted to hide your nest egg for many germans a place where you could find german friendsin some cases relativeswas in argentina in the thirties people are prone to forget argentina had the largest gold reserves in the world were we involved in this castillo asked yes we were goerner said what your greatgrandfather and then your grandfather did was begin to buy our newsprint from argentina i dont follow that castillo confessed newspapers consume vast quantities of newsprint goerner said therefore no one was surprised when gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh began to buy newsprint from argentina where it was cheaper than newsprint from denmark or norway and even cheaper than newsprint from the united states and canada and the government didnt understand at first just how cheap it was i dont understand that either castillo said lets say newsprint from denmark was so much a ton say fifty dollars use that for the purposes of illustration i have no idea what it was back then and forty dollars a ton from the united states or canada and thirty from argentina without raising any interest at all the dresdenerbank would transfer say three thousand dollars to the bank of argentina in payment for one hundred tons of newsprint bill rendered and paid end of transaction but actually the newsprint cost twentyfive hundred which meant for every onehundredton transaction there was five hundred dollars left over that could be quietly squirreled away in a bank account we did this castillo asked incredulously we did it mercedesbenz did it man diesel did it seimens did it and i cant think of a brewery of any size including ours that didnt do it he paused where did you think the money came from for the economic miracle that saw germany rise phoenixlike from the rubble we were in i thought it was the marshall plan torine said and hard work on the part of germany all of the above colonel goerner said the marshall plan kept us fed and out of the hands of the soviet union and repatriated nest eggs permitted us to have the raw material we germans needed to go to work are we still doing this castillo asked your grandfather thought juan d peron was as dangerousas hitler we moved our nest egg from argentina before you were born so why are these good old boys from marburg sending oilforfood money there im about to get to that but thats a twopart story and one that will take some time and i heard you tell mr kranz that you wanted to demonstrate your miraculous telephone yeah i have to get on the horn we can get into this later goerner said six i lied otto castillo said they were standing in the shade of the eaves of the stable leaning on the wall watching as kranz set up the radio a small circular dish pointed at the heavens there was a control panel that resembled a small laptop computer to which had been added several rows of colored leds helena had disappeared with the boys castillo wondered if she was protecting them from their godfather or whether otto had subtly signaled her to take them away from something they probably would be better off not seeing why am i not surprised otto asked you cant really buy one of these afc makes some great stuff for the civilian market but these arent available whats so fancy about this one otto asked all green sir kranz said encrypted voice right castillo asked kranz handed him a telephone handset a small black one that looked like it belonged hanging on a reduced to fax machine at radio shack encrypted voice all green sir im not going to need cans castillo asked with the signal ive got i can put it on the speakerphone do it castillo ordered and handed him the handset encrypted speakerphone green sir kranz announced a moment later dick castillo asked conversationally castillos voice was then converted to digital electronic pulses encrypted reduced to a message lasting just a few milliseconds transmitted to satellite miles above the earth relayed to another satellite and then relayed to the dish sitting on the roof at the nebraska avenue complex there the burst was expanded decrypted and fed to the handset major h richard miller jr was holding to his ear a justperceptible delayed moment later millers voicehaving gone through the same series of events came over the loudspeaker next to the stable near bad hersfeld hey charley where the hell have you been weve been calling you for hours you went up twelve seconds ago miller said anybody there with you secretary hall agnes and tom have you got signal strength for speakerphone a moment later another male voice said encrypted speakerphone green and a moment after that came the voice of secretary of homeland security hall hows that charley loud and clear sir tell me what youve got charley and then ill give you the good news hall said lorimer was a bagman in the oilforfood thing castillo said a whole lot of people want him dead both for what he knows and for skimming a lot of moneymaybe sixteen million usfrom the players

you would share it with methan for me to go to the president when is he going to share it with me castillo asked his eyes met torines torine disgustedly threw up his hands in a what now gesture when he called to tell me you were not at the crillon he asked me to put him in touch with you whenever you checked in i told him i would you want to talk to him what choice do i have not much charley but

and there is more major when i asked the director of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research he told me that he was unable to discuss agent yungs activities with me without the

conversation aboard air force one she assures me however that as soon as she gets to singapore she will take the appropriate steps to get to the root of the matter shes on her way to singapore sir

you sending flowers to karl one of my agents was shot in buenos aires castillo said thats bullshit otto fernando said one of his agents was shot but its anything but the professionally platonic relationship hes trying to foist off on you you sonofabitch castillo said ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free fernando responded her name is betty schneider otto and the two of them are like lovesick teenagers wunderbar otto said xvi one danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary july when they walked up to the registration desk of the hotel the manager on duty said that herr goerner had a call and led him around the corner of the marble desk to a bank of house telephones castillo watched him impatiently goerner returned after a minute wearing a wide smile that was eric kocian he announced and what were going to do now is go to our rooms put on our robes and visit the baths i dont have time for a swim or a steam bath castillo said i came here to see this man kocian to accomplish the latter karl im afraid you must do the former what the hell are you talking about in a way im looking forward to this goerner said smiling what is that line what happens when the irresistible force meets the unmovable object i think we are about to see are you going to explain that or keep talking in riddles with a smug smile on your face eric has the habit at this time of day of visiting the baths goerner said he suggested that we could talk there the alternative is to meet him for lunch at the karpatia at half past one thats on ferenciek tere in the i know where it is castillo cut him off jesus christ wrapped in thick white terry cloth robes their feet in slippers and their genitals contained in smalland castillo was convinced transparentwhenwetcotton swimming pouches castillo goerner fernando torine and kranz entered the thermal baths of the hotel fancy sergeant kranz said looks like something from ancient rome it was intended to look like ancient rome goerner said they say there has been a thermal bath here for centuries wheres kocian castillo asked about halfway down the pool goerner said see the man with the float there were perhaps fifteen people in the water their individual conversations unintelligible as the hard acoustics of water and tile created a sort of deeptoned white noise halfway down the steaming pool in water reaching almost to his neck a head covered with luxuriant silver hair was almost hidden behind a floating table on the table were a metal pitcher an ashtray several newspapers and magazines two books and a cellular telephone the man was looking at them without expression his jaws clamped around a large black cigar what do we do just jump in and swim up to him castillo asked it would be more polite if you slowly lowered yourself into the water and waded to him otto said this is a bath karl not a swimming pool goerner tossed his robe on a marble bench slid out of his slippers and went slowly into the pool by a flight of underwater stairs i never thought i would be a prude castillo thought but the only word to describe otto with his privates in that tiny jockstrap is obscene when otto reached the bottom of the stairs he was in water just over his waist well at least his crotch and farfromathletic buttocks are now concealed from public view castillo shook his head quickly tossed his robe on a marble bench and very quickly went down the stairs into the water and then waded across the pool after goerner fernando torine and kranz took off their robes looked at each other shook their heads and then as if someone had barked ready run dive took running dives into the water the bushy white eyebrows on eric kocians ruddy jowly face rose in amazement at this display of bad manners good morning eric goerner said when hed waded close gruss gott otto kocian replied in a thick viennese accent this is karl gossinger eric goerner said do you remember him the distinguished washington correspondent of the tages zeitung that karl gossinger guten morgen herr kocian charley said i was fond of your mother and your grandfather kocian said i never thought much of your uncle willi you look a lot like willi thank you for sharing that with me castillo said in german and then switched to viennese gutter dialect can we cut the bullshit herr kocian i dont have time to play games with you im crushed kocian said i know you have time to play games with otto and our readers excuse me a hand came out of the water and a pointing finger dripped water on one of the magazines it was the american conservative theres a reason for that castillo said its easier to steal someone elses story than to write your own theres a reason for that castillo repeated id love to know what it is kocian said because being the washington correspondent for the tages zeitung is a cover for what i really do charley said which is im an army officer kocian considered that long enough to puff twice on his cigar an army intelligence officer you mean he asked castillo nodded kocian looked at otto goerner who nodded youll have to forgive me herr gossinger im an old man my brain is slowing down and for the life of me i cant understand why an american army intelligence officer would confess that to anyone much less a real journalist because otto has led me to believe were on the same side the same side of what mr intelligence officer im after the people who are willing to kill to keep it from getting out that theyve profited from the oilforfood arrangement isnt that what youre doing you told him that did you otto kocian asked goerner nodded and what are you going to do if you learn who these people are castillo didnt immediately reply he looked around and saw that they had an interested audience in torine fernando and kranz kranz may just may understand the viennese patois but torine and fernando dont all they see is that the old guy and i are sparring and not very politely im unable to believe the us government doesnt already know who they are kocian went on and that there are political considerations involved that have kept it from coming out we dont know who murdered our chief of mission in buenos aires a very nice young marine sergeant and seriously wounded one of my agents okay lets talk about that if you find out who these people are then what ill deal with them vengeance is mine saith the lord herr gossinger my orders are to deal with them your orders from who someone who remembers that the bible also says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth someone with the authority to give an order like that castillo nodded and what will happen when say your secretary of state or for that matter your president learnsas they inevitably willthat someone has given you these orders thats not going to be a problem herr kocian youre not afraid that you and whoever gave you this order will not bewhats that wonderful american phrasehung out to twist in the wind no im not you will excuse me herr gossinger if i think you are being naive kocian said junior intelligence officersand youre not old enough to be anything but a junior intelligence officerare expendable so what castillo said i was very fond of your grandfather and your mother i dont want it on my conscience that i was in any way responsible for little karlchen being left hanging out twisting in the wind or more likely being strapped into a chair with his throat cut after his teeth were extracted with pliers why dont you let me worry about that castillo said i just told you i was very fond of your mother and your grandfather eric im as concerned as you are that karl may be hurt even murdered otto goerner said in the viennese patois but i have reason to believe that he wont be left hanging in the breeze what reason otto castillo said stop right there what reason otto kocian pursued i know who gave him his orders otto goddammit castillo said he told you who did or you know let me put it this way eric goerner said i know hes not as junior an intelligence officer as you might think he is quite the opposite are you going to tell me how you know that not unless karl tells me i can goerner said and are you herr gossinger going to give herr goerner permission to tell me no castillo said then he chuckled whats funny herr gossinger kocian asked politely if i told you that herr kocian i would have to kill you kranz laughed im only kidding herr kocian castillo said thats a special operations joke kocian met castillos eyes for a long moment then he shrugged and said almost sadly id be more comfortable karl if i was sure you were not kidding castillo didnt reply all right may god forgive me but all right eric kocian said i will tell you what i know come with me he started to wade toward the side of the pool pushing the floating table before him when he reached the side he carefully put his cigar in the ashtray then moved the ashtray to the lowtiled coping surrounding the pool he did the same thing with his cellular telephone the metal pitcher the newspapers and the copy of the american conservative then he pushed the floating table away into the center of the pool and with surprising agility hoisted himself out of the pool and sat with his feet dangling into the water out of the water kocian looked his age the flesh on his arms and chest and legs sagged his jockstrap was almost hidden by a roll of flesh that sagged down from his abdomen there were angry scars on his upper shoulder his abdomen and his left leg you speak german kocian said to kranz i could tell yes sir i do these two dont he said gesturing at fernando and torine you want all these people to hear what i have to say karl bitte castillo said then i will speak english kocian said in english very softly because speaking english in here will attract attention he switched back to german and pointed at kranz in each of those cubicles he went on pointing there is a bucket and a water glass or two go get two buckets and sixno eightglasses and bring them here kranz hoisted himself out of the pool he then switched to english and quietly ordered the rest of you get out and lay close to methere are towels in the cubiclesand if you have something to say say it very softly in a minute after two trips to the dressing cubicles lining one wall of the pool kranz had arranged on the tile coping two white buckets capable of holding perhaps a gallon each and eight water glasses about six inches high and everybody was sitting or lying on thick white towels on the tiled floor beside the pool this kocian said softly splashing his feet in the pool is the nearly limitless pool of oil under iraq it was controlledownedby saddam hussein when hussein was quote president of iraq end quote he was more of an absolute ruler than the king of arabia he had many vices including greed which did him in he wasnt satisfied with what he had he wanted the oil which lay under the sands of kuwait down there he pointed if hussein had not invaded kuwait we almost certainly would not be sitting here today but he did this bothered the americans and even some members of the united nations some say the americans rushed to defend poor little kuwait because they believed that saddam hussein was naughty and needed to have his wrist slapped others suggest that they were afraid saddam also had his eyes on the oil under arabia over there which was and is essential to the american economy whatever the reasons there was a war iraq lost some of you may remember that we were all there herr kocian castillo said can we get to the end of the history lesson im surprised that no one has taught you karl that those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it kocian said would you like me to go on sorry castillo said it was not a total victory kocian resumed president bush the first decided he did not need to occupy baghdad to win the war ten years later president bush the second decided that it would take american flags flying over saddam husseins castles to win that war at the end of the first iraqi war to make saddam hussein live up to what he promised to do at the armistice and of course did not do the americans got the un to place an embargo on the sale of iraqi oil that meant iraq would have no money from the sale of their oil france and russia primarily with some other nations were suddenly deeply concerned with the helpless women and children of iraq without some income to buy food the french and the russians cried iraqi babies would starve without medicine and medical supplies for iraqi hospitals iraqi women and the elderly would die in agony oil for food was born iraq would be permitted to sell enough of its oil to buy food and medicine the united nations would monitor the sale of the oil and ensure that nothing entered iraq that wasnt food or medicine united nations inspectors were stationedprimarily at basra on the persian gulf down there and in other placesto count the barrels of oilthe allocationsthat would be shipped out for sale and to make sure that nothing was shipped into iraq that wasnt supposed to be kocian examined the two buckets kranz had fetched for him he dipped the larger bucket in the pool and hauled it out this is how much oil it would take to buy food and medicine you will notice that when i took it out it did not noticeably lower the level of the water in the pool he leaned forward took his cigar from the ashtray relit it puffed on it examined the coal took another puff and went on saddam found himself sitting onswimming ina sea of black stuff that was worthless to him but considered black gold by the rest of the world all he had to do was figure some way to get it out of iraq past the wall the un had set up he tapped the tiled coping first he tried diplomacy he would get the un to relax or remove the embargo to do this he would have to have important friends in the un how does one acquire friends give them something he arranged to have the oil allocations assigned to people he thought might become his friends many of these were french and russians but there were others too to keep this simple what he did was arrangeby bribing a un officialfor his oil allocations to come into the hands of these people at prices lower than the going price for crude oil say fifty cents a barrel lower fifty cents a barrel becomes a lot of money when one is dealing in terms of say two million barrels of oilone tanker full of oil all these people had to do to turn a quick profit of a million dollars was sign over their allocation of two million barrels of oilforfood oil to someone else saddam also let it be known that if he were permitted to export more oil there would be more millionsmany more millionsof dollars coming into the hands of those who caused the un to relax the embargo he also made friends by not complaining when the medicine shipped into iraq for the poor iraqi children and women had a high price aspirin at five dollars a pill for example flour at twenty dollars a kilo und so weiter now to do this of course he had to have friends among the un officials who were checking to see that he didnt get anything he wasnt supposed to have how to make these friends give them something what did he have to give this black stuff that was worthless to him anyway how was he going to get it to them bribe the un official checking the outgoing oil if he happened to be looking the other way when say a hundred thousand barrels of oil was mistakenly pumped into a tanker hauling off the legitimate oilforfood allocation he could expect to have party or parties unknown drop off a package of crisp brandnew us onehundreddollar bills at his grandmothers apartment he picked up the water bucket and poured from it into four of the water glasses then he picked up one of the waterfilled glasses and moved it down the tile coping this one goes to the un official who happened to be looking the other way when the tanker was overloaded he said he picked up a second of the waterfilled glasses moved it down the tile coping and explained and this one goes to the un official who sees nothing suspicious about fivedollarapill aspirin or twentydollarakilo flour and authorizes the bill therefore to be paid he picked up the two remaining waterfilled glasses and moved them to a narrow shelf on the pool side of the tile coping and these two now converted to packages of crisp onehundreddollar bills go back across the border to saddam where they are thus available to build palaces for his sons and to bribe other people you will notice again that filling the glasses did not appreciably lower the level of water in the bucket he paused looked at everybody for a moment and then filled the remaining water glasses there are many refineries in iraq kocian went on capable of producing far more gasoline for example than iraq needs what to do with this he picked up two of the glasses and leaned forward to where torine was lying on the tiles and set them down by one of torines elbows you are now jordan kocian said jordanians dont hate americans as much as most other arab countriespossibly because the widow of the late king was the daughter of an american general and america tends to look less critically at jordan than it does at other arab countries in any event jordan has a need for gasoline there is no pipeline or port but iraq has many twentythousandgallon tanker trucks how to get it across the border bribe somebody he slid the water glasses from torines elbow to his waist and picked up one of them he moved it inside the tile coping this one now miraculously converted to dollars goes back to iraq jesus castillo said now there were certain logistical problems to be solved as well kocian went on saddam wanted certain thingshis sons for example liked mercedes sports cars and hustler magazinewhich he could not legally import into iraq you may notice i am not even talking about war materiel aircraft parts etcetera which is another story in itself so how to do this bribe a un inspector into finding nothing suspicious say that an xray machine intended for an iraqi hospital came from the mercedesbenz plant in stuttgart or that a crate labeled medical publications actually was full of pornographic videotapes saddam hussein international airport in baghdad saw a lot of cargo airplanesmany of them owned by a russian by the name of aleksandr pevsnerflying in things like hospital xray machines from the mercedesbenz plant tell me about pevsner please herr kocian castillo said tell you what about him how deep was he in the oilforfood business he made a lot of money he was one of those bribed were playing semantic games here kocian said did somebody hand him some money and say please defy the un sanctions and airlift this mercedes in an xray crate to baghdad no did he carry an xray machine to baghdad without looking to see what the crate really held yes did he charge twice or three timesfive timesthe standard rate for flying xray machines to baghdad yes did he look to see if a case of ten million aspirin pills really contained aspirin instead of for example ten million dollars in us currency no was he bribed that would be an opinion was he paid in cash yes was the cash he got from saddam hussein cash that had come into saddams hands for oil that he exported that he wasnt supposed to export almost certainly where else would saddam have gotten it can i prove any of this no interesting torine said whats your interest in aleksandr pevsner karl kocian asked the name has come up in conversation castillo said how were all these bribes paid herr kocian do you know in oil or cash i told you no i mean for example you mentioned that a party or parties unknown would hand somebodys grandmother a stack of cash who was that party unknown who actually made the payoffs there was an elaborate system set up to do that kocian said whats your american name karl charles carlos castillo said thats spanish for karl and charles yes of course well youre going to love this carlos love what when this business began to grow and it became inconvenient to pass money through banks laundering it etcetera saddam began looking around for a paymaster he needed someone preferably an official of some sort ideally a diplomat who traveled around the area and whose baggage would not be subject to search the only people who did that routinely were members of the un so they started looking around the un people they already had on the payroll and they werent very impressed finally they found their man in paris working for the un he was a un bureaucrat not a bona fide diplomat he worked for the european directorate of interagency coordination something like that castillo interrupted he was the chief of the european directorate of interagency coordination kocian said looking at him strangely which entitled him to a un diplomatic passport the passportwhich in addition to getting you through customs and immigration without getting your bags searched exempts you from both local taxes and taxes in your homelandis a prize passed out to deserving middlelevel un bureaucrats what does the european directorate of interagency coordination do herr kocian castillo asked ive always wondered i dont really know kocian said from what i have seen of the un probably nothing useful but this fellow had for ten fifteen years been running all over europe and the near east and the united states doing his interagency coordination whatever that might be he had other things going for him he wasnt married so there would be no wife boasting about what her husband was doing and he wasnt homosexual so there would be no boyfriend doing the same and he wasnt very well paid even tax exempt and taking into consideration his travel and representation allowances his salary wasnt very much but most important he was not only american which would keep the americans off his scent but he was an antiamerican american possibly because he was black maybe not but his being black was something else that would keep the americans from looking too closely at him and his name is jeanpaul lorimer castillo said and i want to know where he is just to satisfy an old mans curiosity karl how long have you americans known about lorimer not long where is he herr kocian possibly out there kocian said gesturing toward the stainedglass windows lining two walls of the baths you mean in budapest i meant in the danube kocian said or possibly in the seine what makes you so sure hes dead or possibly in a cell somewhere where they are asking him for names so there will be fewer witnesses around but if i had to bet id bet on one of the two rivers what was his connection with henri douchon ah now i know why you came to see me otto told you about him thats part of it what about douchon he was one of lorimers assistant paymasters kocian said he handled lebanon egypt cyprus and turkey maybe some other places but thats all ive been able to confirm who killed him if i had to bet id say either the french or the egyptians possibly the germans or maybe even the turks i just dont know but id bet on the french or the egyptians and you think the same people killed lorimer the list of people who wanted to silence lorimer includes all of the above plus russians syrians iranians its a long list herr gossinger you dont think lorimer would be in hiding somewhere castillo asked i think he might have tried to hide after he saw what they had done to msieu douchon and youre sure he knew about that an old friend of mine in vienna showed me photos of lorimer entering and leaving douchons apartment in vienna they were taken after someone had pulled his teeth and carved him up after that mr lorimer disappeared it could be of course that he was taken bodily into heaven but i think it far more likely that someone besides the austrian geheimpolizei were keeping an eye on that cobenzlgasse apartment to see if lorimer might show up and they grabbed him we know that somebody bought a train ticket to paris on his un american express card castillo said lets say it was lorimer himself they didnt grab him in vienna in other words lets say they didnt grab him in paris either if he saw what happened to douchon he was watching his back lets say he got on the train and didnt go to paris because he thought they might be looking for him there so say he got off the train in munich or didnt even get on the train to paris he could have bought a ticket to paris on his credit card then bought another for cash to anywhere maybe even to budapest thats possible of course kocian said but i dont think youre going to be able to find him if he was going to hideand why wouldnt he have thought of having someplace to hide if something went wrongwhere do you think he might have gone anywhere kocian said the south of france lebanon maybe even the united states anywhere who knows you didnt mention south america castillo said argentina or castillo stopped in midsentence surprised when kocian flashed otto goerner an angry look this caused kocian to look at him why not south america castillo pursued yeah why not did these bastards abduct mrs mastersonin buenos aires and murder her husband in south america because when they couldnt find lorimer here they figured he might be in south america and if his sister was there she would probably know where he was or that he was there because she was otto have you been talking to our little karlchen about south america kocian inquired sarcastically some goerner admitted not in this context in what context i told him of your suspicionsmy suspicions too that some of this oilforfood money in germany might find its way over there might find its way over there kocian snapped the sun might come up tomorrow you want to tell me about that herr kocian castillo asked no but you will right no kranz get out the pliers castillo said were going to do a little dentistry karl thats not funny otto goerner said whats funny otto kocian said seriously is that im not really sure hes kidding i said something before about him looking like willi his eyes right now make him look very much like the old man when the old man looked at you with that look in his eyes you knew he was determined to get what he wanted what i really want is to find jeanpaul lorimer castillo said and what i really want is to burn the greedy bastards in germany who were involved in slimy profits from oil for food kocian said im close to having proof they wont be able to deny and i dont want anyoneyou rushing over there and letting them know im getting close and giving them a chance im not interested in greedy german bastards unless i find out theyre responsible for the death of masterson and sergeant markham castillo said are we back to vengeance im back to following my orders castillo said you heard that a lot at the nuremberg nazi trials kocian said all i was doing was following my orders they said that to justify the murder of innocent people castillo replied these bastards are neither innocent nor helpless kocian nodded thats true he looked into castillos eyes you never told me exactly what your orders are im to find the people responsible for the murders and render them harmless castillo said render them harmless is that the same as terminate with extreme prejudice kocian asked isnt that the euphemism for assassination you americans used in vietnam my orders are to find them and render them harmless castillo repeated the idea is to make it clear that there are certain things you cant get away with and that sounds like vengeance to me so what does that make you the agent of the lord no not of the lord it doesnt say gott mit uns on my uniform buckle kocian nodded at him touche he said and then looked at goerner theres a lot of the old man in him isnt there yes goerner said simply there is your grandfather was a man of his word kocian said when he told you something you could trust him are you that way karl i like to think of myself as an officer and a gentleman if thats what you mean thats what i mean kocian said what im going to do karl if you give me your word you wont turn it over to the cia or anyone in your government is give you the names of germans i believe have both profited from oil for food and are now trying to hide that money in argentina brazil paraguay all over the southern tip of south america if you can use this information to find lorimer fine but you give me your word you wont use it for anything else you have my word and that you wont tell anyone where you got it agreed and that these gentlemen will be similarly bound by our agreement agreed when do i get the names once i get to the office it will take me an hour or more to go through what i have i want to make sure in my own mind that if you have to render any of these people harmlessthats a much nicer phrase than terminate with extreme prejudice isnt itthat they really deserve such treatment fair enough and i dont want youespecially ottocoming to the office and making people curious so why dont you meet me at the karpatia at noon you know where it is otto goerner nodded and so do i castillo said not far from the american embassy kocian nodded we can have a nice lunch he said and not without effort got to his feet then grunting he bent over and picked up his ashtray his cellular telephone and the books and magazines then he waddled down the tiled floor of the bath and disappeared through a door you got more out of him karl otto goerner said thoughtfully than i thought you would i can only hope thats a good thing what he didnt say was that these people would torture and kill him without thinking twice about it if they knew he knows as much as he does and unless youre very careful with those names they will learn he does castillo nodded but didnt reply then he stood up lets get out of here he said wrapping a towel around his waist i want to get on the horn two the embassy of the united states of america szabadsag ter budapest hungary july otto goerner touched castillos arm as they started to get out of the taxi in front of the american embassy a sevenstory centuryold mansion youre not going to need me in there are you goerner asked no and it might even be a bit awkward no ill handle it castillo said why dont i keep the cab go to the karpatia get us a table get myself a cup of coffee okay otto this wont take long well see you there castillo said and he and the others got out of the taxi as castillo watched it drive away sergeant seymour kranz touched his arm major what the hell is that he asked pointing castillo looked in the park facing the embassy was a statue of a man in uniform with his hands folded behind his back its a statue seymour budapest is full of them they even have a section of the berlin wall around here somewhere thats an oldtimey american uniform kranz said ill be damned i think hes right colonel torine said castillo looked again and asked what time is it in washington seymour kranz consulted his watch and reported ohfourohfive sir since it wont make much difference to whoever we get out of bed whether it is ohfourohfive or ohfourten let us go and broaden our cultural horizons by examining the statue castillo said why the hell would there be a statue of an american officer in a park in budapest they walked to the statue it was indeed of an american wearing a world war iera uniform of riding boots and breeches he looked as if he were examining the embassy and found it wanting there was a bronze plaque with a legend in english beneath it kranz read it aloud harry hill bandholtz brigadier general us army i simply carried out the instructions of my government as i understood them as an officer and a gentleman of the united states army i wonder what the hell thats all about fernando said i wonder what the instructions he carried out were to get him a statue kranz asked gentlemen castillo said fellow history buffs perhaps there is a public information officer in the embassy who can enlighten us all shall we see there might have been a public information officer at the embassy but they never got to meet him they encountered first a marine guard a buck sergeant who politely but firmly told them there was no way they could see the ambassador without an appointment colonel torine produced his air force identification sergeant you get the defense attache on the phone or down here and do it now the marine guard examined the photo id carefully and then picked up his telephone there is a usaf colonel here who wants to talk to a defense attache he announced and then handed the telephone to torine this is colonel jacob torine usaf are you the defense attache captain brief pause then get him on the goddamned horn or down here and right goddamn now an army lieutenant colonel appeared colonel torine he asked right im lieutenant colonel martin sir im the army attache may i see your identification please sir torine produced his identification again how may

need to do is get into the white house switchboard on a secure line and you are sir my name is castillo im with the secret service he showed lieutenant colonel martin his credentials this is very unusual lieutenant colonel martin said im prepared to explain it to the ambassador or the chief of mission castillo said one moment please lieutenant colonel martin said and motioned for the marine guard to slide him the telephone he punched in a number this is colonel martin we have an air force colonel here ive checked his id who wants to be connected to the white house switchboard can we do that there was a reply lieutenant colonel martin turned to colonel torine he said that you have to be authorized to connect to the white house switchboard do you have that authorization i do torine said excuse me sir but how do i know that torine threw up his hands in disgust that was your commo room castillo asked lieutenant colonel martin nodded is it tied into the white house switchboard to the state department switchboard tell him to get the state department switchboard operator tell her or him as the case may be that c g castillo wants to talk to the secretary of state and that if she

youre doing than i did before except i now have no question about your right to use my secure voice link thank you very much for the use of it sir it should go without saying that i really hope you can find whoever murdered jack masterson is there anything i can do anything at all i cant think of anything sir castillo said except one thing who was the american officer whose statue is across the street the ambassador chuckled you saw that did you he asked rhetorically brigadier general harry hill bandholtz was sent here in to be the american on the interallied control commission which was supervising the disengagement of romanian troops from hungary the romanians thought disengagement meant they could help themselves to the transylvanian treasures in the national museum general bandholtz didnt think that was right so on october he showed up at the museum alone and armed only with his riding crop ran the romanians off like christ chasing the moneylenders out of the temple he must have been one hell of a man obviously and when they asked him why he said something to the effect that he was only obeying his orders as he understood them as an officer and a gentleman you dont hear that phrase much anymore do you an officer and a gentleman mr ambassador torine said oddly enough i heard it earlier today said seriously or mockingly very seriously sir torine said spoken by an officer and a gentleman the hungarians loved bandholtz and had the statue cast the ambassador went on they set it up in the hungarian fascists and the nazis didnt bother it but when the russians were here right after the war before they let us reopen the embassythey took it down and away for repair we heard about it of course from the swiss who were supposed to be guarding the embassy property we were actually in the process of having another made when we learned that the hungarians had stolen it from the scrap yard and were concealing it so it could be put back up when the russians left the russians left and general bandholtz is back on his pedestal mr ambassador thats a great story and im really glad i asked but now sir with our profound thanks we wont take any more of your time castillo said where are you going now to the airport first to the karpatia sir then to the gellert to check out and then to the airport ill get you one of our cars the ambassador said and reached for a telephone then i can tell myself i at least did something to help three karpatia ferenciek tere budapest hungary july otto goerner and eric kocian were already mostly through what looked like litersized glasses of beer when castillo and the others came into the restaurant and the moment they sat down a plump waiter with a luxuriant mustache showed up with a tray full of the enormous beer glasses none for those two thank you just the same castillo said in hungarian pointing to torine and fernando theyre driving goerner and kocian chuckled are you going to tell us what you just said about us fernando challenged no booze youre flying castillo said and what about you ill be doing the flight planning i can do that with a little beer in my system ill do the flight planning thank you just the same major torine said and slid castillos beer away from him picked it up took a healthy swallow sighed appreciatively and added as an officer and a gentleman im sure youre aware that rank hath its privileges well in that case i guess theres nothing for me to do but eat castillo said what do you recommend herr kocian kocian reached into his pocket and handed castillo a businesssized envelope it was stuffed with paper i would only give this to a friend he said you may therefore call me eric thank you very much eric castillo said putting the envelope in his inside jacket pocket seymour you can put the pliers back in the tool kit dentistry is apparently not going to be necessary ach gott karl goerner said youre aware im sure karl that the hungarians taught the machiavellians all they knew about poisoning people kocian asked and with that in mind eric what do you recommend gulyas lightly laced with arsenic wiener schnitzel kocian said the karpatia serves the best wiener schnitzel in the world better than in vienna actually you can get better hungarische gulyas in vienna than you can here kocian said things are not always what they seem karl do you know what the people in hamburg call what you call a frankfurter castillo shook his head then asked a frankfurter right and what do the people in frankfurt call what you and the hamburgers call a frankfurter dont tell mea hamburger a sausage kocian said and what do the hamburgers call chopped and fried beef i know they dont call it a frankfurter they call it fried chopped beef unless they dont fry it and instead serve it raw in which case it becomes steak tartar actually eric i have a real fondness for wiener schnitzel do you suppose you could have the kitchen make up a dozen of them and wrap them in foil so that we can take them with us on the plane wont they go bad theres a little kitchen on the plane with a freezer the only thing in it right now is a bottle of beer and colonel torines viagra oh jesus christ torine said my friend karl eric kocian said inasmuch as this is all going on ottos american express card you can have anything your greedy little heart desires in that case a dozen wiener schnitzels castillo said plus one for my lunch of course i really love wiener schnitzel xvii one approaching aeropuerto internacional jorge newbery buenos aires argentina july castillo was flying the night was clear and he could see the glow of the lights of buenos aires as he began his descent as he dropped lower the lights became more distinct what had looked like a single orange line pointing at the city became a double line and he could see headlightsmoving along what he now recognized as route and the acceso norte leading from pilar to the city it had been quite a trip the lear was fastits longrange cruise speed was threequarters the speed of soundbut it was not intended or designed for flying across oceans it had been necessary to make refueling stops within the limitations of the aircrafts range about nautical miles the first legabout nautical mileshad been a threeandahalfhour flight from budapest to casablanca morocco after refueling they had flown nautical miles in a bit under three hours to dakar senegal on the extreme west coast of the african continent from dakar it had been a fourhour nauticalmile flight the longest leg southwest across the atlantic ocean to recife brazil this had been the iffy leg there are no alternative airfields in the atlantic ocean on which to land when fuel is running low they had approached the point of no return with their fingers crossed but there had been no extraordinary headwinds or other problems to slow them and torine who was then flying in the left seat had made the decision to go on what could have been a real problem just hadnt materialized recife apparently was not accustomed to either refueling small private jets or providing food at half past two in the morning and it had taken them an hour and a half to get both but with that exception they had been able to land refuel check the weather and file flight plans in remarkably little time everywhere else from recife they had flown south to sao paulo nautical miles in just under two and a half hours and then begun the last leg to buenos aires which would be a justovertwohour flight covering nautical miles alex pevsners down there castillo thought and i have a gut feeling im going to need him and by now howard kennedy has told him that im not going to point him in jeanpaul lorimers direction so he can give him a beauty mark in the center of his forehead that will be a problem one that ill have to think about later right now im too tired to make difficult decisions castillo pushed the transmit lever jorge newbery lear fivezerosevenfive i am forty kilometers north at five thousand feet request approach and landing lear fivezerosevenfive jorge newbery ground control ordered at the end of the active turn right and proceed to parking area in front of the jetaire hangar customs and immigration will meet your aircraft sevenfive understands right at the threshold taxi to jetaire parking area castillo replied wait for customs and immigration as he approached the jetaire hangar a ground handler in white coveralls came out and with illuminated wands directed him to park beside an aero commander when castillo had finished the shutdown procedures he took a closer look at the aero commander if the light highwing twin wasnt derelict it was close the fabriccovered portions of the rear stabilizer assembly were missing or visibly decayed the tire on the left landing gear was flat the left engine nacelle was missing i know just how that commander feels castillo said to colonel torine who was in the right seat old battered and worn out torine looked at the aero commander and chuckled it has been a rather long ride hasnt it torine replied in something of an understatement as he unfastened his harness and here comes what looks like the local officialdom fernando said from the aisle behind them castillo saw two ford f pickup trucks with grimes lights flashing from their roofs approaching them two uniformed men got out of the first and a man in civilian clothing out of the second the civilian is side castillo said i dont know his name but i saw him somewhere he unfastened his harness and stood when castillo went down the stairs to the tarmac he saw both that the side agents eyebrows had risen when he saw him and that he immediately had taken out a cellular telephone well this time im arriving as c g castillo carrying a brandnew passport with no stamps on it at all when the side agent came to the lear he gave no sign that he had recognized castillo even after he had examined his passport the customs and immigration procedures were polite but thorough the aircraft and their luggage were submitted to testing for drugs and explosives which might or might not have been standard procedure for civil aircraft arriving from outside the country castillo was glad that he hadnt brought any weapons from fort bragg no questions were raised about kranzs satellite telephone antenna which might or might not have been because castillo had asked them if it would be safe to leave it on the aircraft while they were in buenos aires neither did the laptopwhich actually controlled the radio and held the encryption systemcause any unusual interest it had been designed to look like a typical laptop computer the customs officer did however unfold the aluminum foil in which the wiener schnitzel in the freezer was wrapped it might have been idle curiosity or he might have been looking for a package of cocaine what is this he asked wiener schnitzel castillo told him sort of a veal milanesa and if you hadnt gone in there and found it i probably would have forgotten it and with the juice turned off when i finally remembered it it would have been rotten wiener schnitzel i think id better take that with me castillo said as the customs officer started to put it back in the freezer he put it into his laptop briefcase enjoy your stay in argentina gentlemen the customs officer said well certainly try castillo said two el presidente de la rua suite the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina july a sleepyeyed special agent jack britton answered the door in his underwear that was a quick european tour he said offering his hand the last two hotels we were in we didnt even get to muss the beds castillo said except kranz of course hes smarter than we are whenever hes not eating hes sleeping im kranz kranz said hes our communicator castillo said jack britton britton said as he shook kranzs hand im impressed with your buddy kensington hes got that fantastic radio set up in his room all he has to do is open the drapes and the window and were talking to dick miller thats great castillo said even if it may require yet another shuffling of living arrangements im in your bed britton said yeah you are and i dont like to think of anyone else sleeping in the bed where betty and i were not for long castillo said when i told the desk i needed more rooms they told me this suite is expandable so i took a threeroom expansion but i forgot about sergeant kensington i can bunk with kensington major kranz said not a problem dibs on that bed fernando said pointing through the door at the huge bed in the master bedroom from which britton had just risen like hell thats mine im now the chief and youre just a lousy airplane pilot in any interpretation of that term you may wish to apply fernando shaking his head and smiling gave him the finger castillo walked to the telephone and picked up the handset and punched the front desk key on the base im going to need one more room he said and send up several large pots of coffee he hung up and turned to britton did tony santini get you a cellular phone britton nodded me and kensington with his number and darbys on them britton nodded again may i have it please castillo asked britton went into the master bedroom youre going to get santini out of bed at this unholy hour torine asked santini and ricardo solez and alex darby and then as soon as one of them tells me how to get him on the phone special agent yung in montevideo i am awed by this very early morning display of energy torine said jake castillo said very seriously if jeanpaul lorimer is here and i have a gut feeling he is i want to find him before anyone else does point taken torine replied i wasnt thinking sorry charley britton now wearing trousers but no shirt and still barefoot came back into the room and handed castillo a cellular telephone santinis on two he announced and darby on three and ricardo solez after you left he went back to drugs britton said i dont have a number for him ive got his home number fernando said yeah thats right don fernando you would have it castillo said not very pleasantly well get on the phone call him tell him to call in to the embassy that hell be late and to come over here and because youll be on an unsecure cell figure out some way without using my name to tell him not to tell anyone im back is that a secret fernando asked for the time being castillo said and punched autodial button two on brittons cellular then he said shit and pushed the end button he went to the minibar in one of the cabinets took the ice trays from it and in their place put the foilwrapped wiener schnitzel then he pushed the cellulars autodial button two again tony santini arrived first looks like old home week he said when he saw everybody welcome back to gaucholand i guess you got something in europe ill have to remember to tell tom mcguire to button his lip castillo said tom and i go back a long way charley but while were on the subject of what tom told me where do i go to enlist excuse me i hadnt planned to make this pitch with anybody listening but what the hell ill eventually go home but theyll never assign me to the presidential protection detail again falling off a limo bumper is just about as bad as goosing the first lady people arent supposed to snicker when the motorcade rolls by from what tom told me about what youre going to be doing thatll be at least as interesting how about it do i have the authority to just say yes sure i do until someoneand that means the president tells me i dont welcome aboard tony castillo said thats presuming someone important doesnt say not only no but hell no you cant have santini well worry about that when it happens from what tom told me i dont think it will so whats up you have a look at the package from fort bragg santini nodded very impressive weaponry he said and black jumpsuits and those face masks this may be an indelicate question but who are we going to whack the answer to that is top secretpresidential tony castillo said seriously okay santini said his voice now serious understood my orders are to locate and render harmless the people who murdered masterson and markham its about time we started playing by their rules santini said after a moment the president apparently has made that decision castillo said now all we have to do is find them huh how do we do that you remember mrs mastersons brother the un guy we couldnt find to tell him about masterson santini nodded it seems he was the head bagman for the oilforfood payoffs castillo said he went missingprobably from viennaimmediately after he found one of his assistants dead of a slit throat in vienna nasty before they killed him they pulled several of his teeth with a pair of pliers the cia guy in paris and my source in vienna think lorimer is probably in the seine or the danube i dont why not wait until you hear this when we landed in mississippi mrs masterson told me the reason she was abducted was because they thought she would know where her brother was they killed masterson to show her how serious they were about wanting to know the masterson kids would be next and i think they whacked sergeant markham and almost whacked schneider to show her they could get to whoever they wanted to i had a gut feeling at the time they were after you santini said it was your car that thought has run through my mind castillo said she didnt know where he was or she figured her kids were more important which she didnt know castillo said a knock at the door announced the arrival of alex darby why do i feel im late for the party darby asked and then looked at fernando and kranz fernando lopez seymour kranz alex darby castillo said and these gentlemen are darby asked mr lopez is an airplane pilot under contract to the office of organizational analysis castillo said to the what the office of organizational analysis you dont know what that is never heard of it darby confessed im surprised its in the department of homeland security i told you charley i never heard of it darby said using my miraculous powers to judge a mans thoughts by looking into his eyes i deduce that darby really doesnt know theres been a presidential finding alex castillo said a clandestine and covert organization charged with finding and rendering harmless those responsible for mastersons and markhams murders has been set up within the department of homeland security and who was put in charge of this its about goddamntime for payback organization and why didnt i hear about it torine pointed at castillo and said say hello to the chief alex the answer asks more questions than it answers darby said starting with why didnt i hear about it i just told you about it castillo said and whos kranz hes our communicator theres a rumor floating around that theres already a special communicator down here darby said now theres two they call that redundancy im getting the feeling you know who these bastards are darby said and i would really like to help you render them harmless we dont know who they are castillo said but theres a guy i think is here who can probably tell us who jeanpaul lorimer i thought they couldnt find him in paris whats he got to do with this hes here i think so somewhere here in the southern cone what he has to do with it is that he was the bagman for oil for food not only did he skim a large sumsixteen million according to one sourcefrom the bribe money but he knows who got how much when and what for thats what the whole thing was about the people who want his mouth permanently closedand their money backreally want to find him that sounds pretty farfetched charley lorimeri told you i met himis a typical un bureaucrat i cant imagine him being involved in something like that whered you get it i got the fact that people are looking for him from mrs masterson they kidnapped her because they thought she would know where he is i think they believed her when she said she didnt but they think hell contact her they told her that theyll kill her children if she does find out where he is and doesnt tell them masterson was blown away to make the point that they will kill to get what they want you got that from betsy masterson castillo nodded why didnt she tell me she didnt tell me until we landed in the states her primary concern was protecting the children and god knows she had reason not to feel secure in argentina i guess when she saw the globemaster surrounded by delta force shooters she felt secure enough to tell me does she know why these people are looking for lorimer if you mean did she know he was the oilforfood bagman i dont think so if she knew she would have told her husband and i dont think theres any question that masterson would have blown the whistle on him and he would have darby said so how are you going to find lorimer i dont know but the first thing i have to do is talk to yung the fbi guy in montevideo whats he got to do with this i dont know but i do know hes not looking for money laundering as he says he is how do you know that darby challenged and that hes working for the state department not the fbi i dont understand that neither do i but i got that from natalie cohen who has told ambassador silvio and ambassador whatsisname in montevideo mcgrory darby furnished to tell him to quote put himself and whatever intelligence he has developed end quote at my disposal she didnt tell you what hes doing shes in singaporeor wasand believe it or not the secure voice links in both her airplane and the embassy were fucked up you want to try to talk to her from the embassy what i want to do is talk to yung here or in montevideo montevideo is where his files are going to be castillo said i want a look at them hows the best way to get to montevideo starting about now theres austral flights from jorge newbery every hour or so you want me to go with you what id like for you to do is show lorimers picture to everybody in the embassyyour people the dea the military peopleand see if it rings a bell dont tell them why were looking you have a picture the cia guy in paris gave me two i have them in my briefcase castillo said if i give you one can you get me twenty copies of it no problem darby said do you have a safe house a safe apartment not far from here and a safe house in mayerling thats a country club out in pilar mayerling castillo asked yeah mayerling upscale gated community where the guards at the gate have uzis mayerling castillo repeated is there something i dont know charley darby asked my mind is flying off at a tangent castillo said lets suppose youre an austrian and you have some money youre not supposed to have from oil for food and you manage to get the money laundered here in argentina and youre looking for an investment what the hell are you talking about ive got an envelope in my briefcase stuffed with names of germans and austrians who havewhats the phraseillgotten gains from oil for food that theyve moved here really yeah really are you going to give it to me no sorry i gave my word as an officer and a gentleman that i wouldnt give it to anybody in the cia or other agency of the us government now let me finish what i was saying so youre an austrian and looking for a sound investment for your now thoroughly washed illgotten gains where to put it eureka i know real estate i will build an upscale country club and sell expensive houses to rich people wanting to escape crowded buenos aires all i need is a romantic name with overtones of aristocratic class so what will i call it mayerling thats what ill call it mayerling aint nothing no more classic than mayerling ill have everybody in argentina who traces his ancestry back to the glorious days of franz josef and the austrohungarian empire standing in line to throw money at me so they can say i live in mayerling what the hell are you talking about what the hell is mayerling alex for someone in your line of work your ignorance of history is shocking castillo said solemnly you dont know about mayerling no goddammit i dont once upon a timein one version has it crown prince rudolph who would on the death of his father franz josef become king and emperor of the austrohungarian empire was called in by daddy and told to divest himself of his mistress crown prince rudolph was thirtyone his mistress was a sixteenyearold tootsie the baroness maria vetsera the relationship was embarrassing to the throne and had to be ended daddy said rudolph took maria to his hunting lodge which was called mayerling to break the bad news to her after talking it over they decided that since a rudolph could not disobey his father the emperor and b that life was not worth living without each other there was only one solution and they took it rudolph popped maria with his steyr automatic and then popped himself in the temple he was given a state funeral and the entire austrohungarian empire went into an official state of mourning marias body was sent back to her village the other version according to otto goerner who got it from my aunt olgashe was actually my grandauntwho was hungarian and moved in high social circles was that franz josef really didnt give a damn who rudolph was diddlingol franz josefs own mistress lived with him in schonbrunn palacebut was really annoyed when he found out that rudy was in serious conversations with some hungarians visavis what we now call regime change rudy wanted to be king and emperor now not when the old guy finally kicked off according to that version franz josef had rudolph popped while he was fooling around with maria in his hunting lodge which if i didnt happen to mention this before was called mayerling the result of rudys sudden demise at mayerling was that his cousin franz josefs nephew archduke franz ferdinand became heir to the throne on june in sarajevo a serbian anarchist tossed a bomb into his car mortally wounding poor franz ferdinand franz josef simply couldnt put up with having his heir whacked so he declared war on serbia and world war one was off and running and it all started in mayerling im really surprised you didnt know this alex jesus charley youre amazing darby said youre not really suggesting theres a connection with this country club and oilforfood money far be it from me to suggest anything to an old spook like you alex but if i were in your shoes id have a good close look at it truth is stranger than fiction theres a reason they call your country club mayerling and you are looking for foreignlaundered money right the trouble with you you sonofabitch is when you come off the wall like this half the time youre right darby said actually its closer to seventyfive percent of the time castillo said now tell me do you think you can smuggle the stuff i had sent from bragg past the uziarmed guards at mayerling no problem darby said how about moving it out there while i talk to yung you said something about airplanes to montevideo every hour on the hour yeah but if you dont want me to go with you i thought id take jack hes an excop you and britton had better take tony with you okay why because he has a diplomatic passport and is accredited both here and in uruguay theyre not going to search him for weapons darby opened his briefcase and took out two beretta mm semiautomatics opened their actions and handed them to charley thanks alex castillo said buenos aires cellulars work in montevideoand some other places over there darby said and went back into his briefcase ive got two cellulars tony santini said and also a couple of berettas spread them as far as theyll go castillo ordered and then alex can you take care of those who need either a pistol or a phone or both darby nodded youre going to need wheels too he said but to get them for you ambassador silvio will have to know youre here i sent word that we were coming castillo said but im not going to tell him any more than i have to about what were going to do hes a good guy and i want him to be able to honestly say he knew nothing about it it covers a lot of territory charley darby said thats because right now i dont know whats going to happen castillo said how do we get to jorge newbery ive got a car santini said with cd tags darby asked santini shook his head then take mine that way you can park right in front three aeropuerto internacional general c l berisso carrasco montevideo republica oriental del uruguay july there had been a parking area for perhaps thirty cars reserved for the corps diplomatique against one wall of the jorge newbery passenger terminal and fifteen minutes after santini parked darbys embassy bmw they were aboard austral flight boeing nonstop service to montevideo immigration formalities for leaving the republic of argentina and entering the republic of uruguay had been simple castillo saw that argentine and uruguayan nationals simply had to show their national identity cards he made a mental note to see if the friendly folks at langley could make him one as foreigners castillo and britton had to go through formal procedures these consisted of submitting their passports to an argentine immigration officer who exposed them to a computer reader he then applied the exit stamp in the appropriate spot and then handed the passport to the uruguayan official sitting next to him the passport was again exposed to a computer reader stamped with an enter stamp and then handed back to the traveler there would be no immigration formalities when they actually got off the airplane in uruguay airport security had come next it consisted primarily of walking past two police officers who didnt show much interest in any of them the carryon baggage xray machine wasnt even turned on even granting that austral flight really is a flying commuter bus and that the possibility of muslim terrorists taking over the aircraft and diving it into the say daimlerchrysler building in downtown buenos aires is admittedly slim castillo thought as a stewardess handed him a copy of la nacion the airport security check of boarding passengers was still a little lax the flight itself from wheelsup to a somewhat hard landing took about twentysix minutes once in the terminal building there were signs in spanish and english offering travelers their choice of nothing to declare and pay customs charges lanes castillo did not see officials of any kind in either lane special agent david william yung jr of the fbi was waiting for them in the airport lobby im going to have to remember i dont like this sonofabitch hello again yung castillo greeted him it was good of you to meet us mr darby suggested it would be best yung said ignoring castillos outstretched hand well fuck you yung you remember mr santini im sure castillo said im not sure about mr britton i saw him when i was in buenos aires yung said pleased to meet you too britton said cheerfully with a broad smile its always a pleasure to work with the fbi castillo and santini smiled yung didnt where would you like to go mr castillo yung asked where are your files i have some in my office in the embassy and some in my apartment yung said i dont know what youre after im looking for an american he works for the un his name is jeanpaul lorimer yung shook his head indicating hed never heard of him or doesnt want to give me what he has which is closer your apartment or the embassy my apartment then why dont we go there after we stop someplace for breakfast you didnt eat before you came over yeah sure i did but it was so long a flight im hungry again my cars out here yung said and walked out of the terminal he walked so quickly he was soon out of earshot charley britton asked why do i think that guy doesnt like you youre perceptive they found an open restaurant not far from the beach why is the atlantic ocean so dirty britton asked thats not the atlantic ocean thats the rio de la plata castillo told him thats a river the mouth of the river of silver is a hundredplus miles wide the blue danube isnt blue and the river of silver is muddy the atlantic starts about sixty miles north of here theres a resort there called punta del este point of the east pretty classy the water there is blue very handy to launder money santini said yeah castillo said thoughtfully how do they do that launder money britton asked one way is through the casinos santini said theres a bunch of them there hell theres one right here in carrasco a marriott and a couple more downtown the biggest one in punta del este is the conrad named after and i think owned by hilton the way it works is that you slip the casino a bunch of cash then they let you win say ninety percent of it you declare your gambling winnings pay taxes on it and your money is now laundered youre telling me that marriott and hilton are laundering money britton asked incredulously marriott and hilton no santini said theres generally at least one legal attachewhich is what they call fbi agents in the diplomatic worldon their premises marriott and hilton are thus reminded of their patriotic duty not to launder money the locally owned casinos are where its done isnt that so yung if you say so special agent yung said he turned to castillo when do you want to see ambassador mcgrory i dont need to see him castillo said he wants to see you i dont need to see him at least not today he wants to see you so you said you are aware arent you mr castillo that the ambassador is the man in charge of all us government activities in the country to which he is accredited so ive heard castillo said well talk about this when we have some privacy yung didnt reply yung had a spacious topfloor apartment in a threestory building on the rambla the waterfront highway between carrasco and montevideo to the south yung waved them not very graciously into chairs in the living room all right mr castillo what can i do for you im sure youll understand that i am obliged to report to ambassador mcgrory what may be discussed special agent yung castillo said icily i am now going to show you my credentials identifying me as a supervisory agent of the united states secret service he got out of his chair and held his credentials in front of yung who examined them and then nodded are you satisfied that i am supervisory special agent carlos g castillo of the united states secret service special agent yung im satisfied yung said these gentlemen special agents anthony j santini and john m britton of the secret service will now show you their credentials when you are satisfied they are who i am telling you they are please say so santini and then britton got out of their chairs walked to yung showed him their credentials waited until he nodded and then went back to their chairs are you satisfied special agent yung that we are all who i am telling you we are im satisfied are you going to tell me what gentlemen castillo interrupted him i want you to make note that at zeroeightonezero hours local time july in his residence in carrasco uruguay we identified ourselves to special agent yung as members of the us secret service by showing him our credentials and he acknowledged their validity santini and britton nodded special agent yung what i am about to tell you is classified as top secretpresidential the unauthorized disclosure of any of this information to any person not authorized by the president or myself to have access to this material and that specifically includes ambassador mcgrory is a felony under the united states code do you understand all that i have said youre telling me i cant report this to ambassador mcgrory frankly castillo i dont believe you have that authority in the vernacular special agent yung i dont give a flying fuck what you believe or dont believe the question was whether or not you understood what i said to you i understood it good i now inform you that i am the chief of the office of organizational analysis the what which is a covert and clandestine organization set up in a presidential finding within the department of homeland security and is charged with locating the assassins of j winslow masterson and sergeant roger markham usmc and rendering them harmless do you understand that that sounds as if you plan to kill them the question was do you understand what i have just said theres nothing wrong with my hearing to carry out this mission it is necessary for us to find one jeanpaul lorimer an american citizen employed by the un who i have reason to believe is somewhere in this area i told you before i never heard of him aware of my mission the secretary of state for whom you work has relayed through either or both ambassadors mcgrory and silvio her orders to you to place yourself and whatever information you may have at my disposal you have received those orders have you not ambassador mcgrory told me that you were going to come to me and that i was to cooperate with you as much as possible yung said and that if you came to me directly instead of through the embassy i was to tell you he wanted to see you immediately with the implication that you didnt have to cooperate with me unless he knew what this is about and until he gave his permission for christs sake castillo hes the ambassador tony see if you can get ambassador silvio on your cellular castillo ordered i work for ambassador mcgrory not silvio yung said no you dont you work for the state departments bureau of intelligence and research doing something so secret that the secretary of state didnt know about it until the day before yesterday castillo said castillo could see a flicker of surprise on yungs face did you tell mcgrory what youre really doing down here yung didnt reply okay that explains a lot you didnt tell mcgrory what youre really doing so he thinks youre just one more legal attache working for him right ive got the ambassador charley santini said that was quick castillo said as he reached for the telephone the miracle of modern communications santini said good morning mr ambassador im on a cellular so were going to have to be careful what were saying im in montevideoactually carrascowith special agent yung what i hope youll be willing to do is relay the message from our friend natalie to yung when the other fellow did that it got a little garbled and hes annoyed that im walking on his grass without his permission ambassador silvio replied briefly thank you sir i hope to see you shortly castillo said and handed yung the telephone special agent yung mr ambassador yung said he had the cellular to his ear for thirty seconds and then he said yes sir thats perfectly clear thats not exactly the way i received the message here ambassador silvio said something else yes sir yung said i understand sir thank you very much sir do you want to speak with mr castillo again sir the ambassador apparently did not wish to again speak with castillo yung ended the call and handed the cellular to santini yung smiled wryly at castillo after the ambassador relayed secretary cohens message he added he said for purposes of clarification mr castillo has permission from the highest possible authority not only to walk on anybodys grass he wants but to sow it with salt if thats what he chooses to do castillo chuckled and smiled and said okay you satisfied yung nodded so what are you actually doing here i know its not looking for money launderers you dont know no i dont but youre going to tell me right yung nodded actually it has something to do with money laundering but not to develop a case against money launderers i dont think i follow you how much do you know about the un oilforfood business a hell of a lot more now than i did a week ago castillo said what about it an astonishing number of people all over europe and the middle eastfor that matter all over the world made a lot of money from that operation primarily frenchmensome very highly placed frenchmenand germans and russians its an incredible amount of money and like the nazis in world war two they decided that south america primarily the southern cone is the place to hide it the director of the bureau of intelligence and research started to build dossiers on these people even before the second desert war using his own people i mean and it got out theres a lot of oneworlders un lovers in the state department they think that leaking things is their patriotic duty so he quote called off end quote the investigation and then he went to the director of the fbithey were both fbi agents as young menand explained the situation and asked for help and here i am i heard you were a hotshot castillo said who told you that the same guy who told me whatever you were doing here it wasnt looking for money launderers howard kennedy yung said who i know youre pals yung said i never heard that name in my entire life until just now castillo said cross my heart and hope to die yeah sure well if you should ever happen to meet somebody with that name give him my regards yung said when we were young innocent and naive we really thought we could protect society from the barbarians had a lot of fun for a while doing it and then howard decided hed rather be a barbarian it paid better and it wasnt nearly as frustrating sometimes i think i should have changed sides when he did so tell me about these dossiers youre building castillo said well theres fourteen fbi agents including me here looking at money laundering as one of them i have access to whats developed theyre looking for drug money primarilyand theres a hell of a lot of thatwhich means theyre looking for colombians and mexicans mostly and americans of course when they come across some european moving a lot of money around here they check with the dea the treasury department whoever to see if theres a drug connection or an american connection of some kind if there isnt they let it drop he paused then added and i pick it up and do what with it what my boss wants is proofphotocopiesof bank records who deposited how much and when records of who bought an estancia or a car dealership or a milliondollar villa in punta del este i dont really know what he thinks anybody will do with it he still has stars in his eyes expose the bad guys and the world will be a better place i cant see that happening yes you can castillo said youve still got stars in your eyes too otherwise youd have changed sides when your friendwhat was his namedid and what about you castillo no stars in your eyes how did you get involved in something like this i know what render them harmless really means i am simply carrying out the instructions of my government as i understand them as an officer and a gentleman of the united states army oh shit yung chuckled yeah thats right you are an army officer arent you a major back to my question how did an army officer get involved in something like this i just told you castillo said where are your files here i cant leave them in the embassy another price i pay for being a secret hotshot to use kennedys words is that my fellow fbi agents think im either stupid or lazy or both i dont turn in half the work they do if youre working on something like this im surprised you can turn in any work at all castillo said can i see the files reluctantly yung said i dont want it getting out what ive been doing here who else is going to know whats in my files even that i have them would you believe me if i say no one why should i ill make a deal with you castillo said ill show you mine if you show me yours and that will be our little secret whats in your files the names of peoplegermans french and russianswho are reliably reported to have made money on oil for food and probably are sending it over here i promised my source i would not turn them over to the cia or the fbi or anybody and i wont but maybe it would help if you took a look at them maybe make a match with somebody youve got a dossier on that might help us find this bastard lorimer whats your interest in lorimer he was the head bagman for oil for food he knows who got how much and when and what for and if i find him i think i can convince him to point me in the direction of whoever whacked masterson and markham lorimer is who im really after never heard of him yung said sorry and i have to find him before the bad guys do they want to make sure he doesnt talk they already whacked one of his guys in vienna deal why not yung said wheres your list in my briefcase castillo said and picked it up from the floor and placed it on a coffee table yung pushed himself out of his chair and walked to the table as castillo opened the briefcase well i can save you time about him yung said excuse me bertrand yung said the guy in the picture this picture castillo asked and held it up you know this guy his name is bertrand yung said hes a lebanese antiquities dealer a lebanese antiques dealer antiques are old furniture things like that yung clarified antiquities are things boosted from king tuts tomb things like that really old stuff and bertrands very good at it makes a lot of money i learned a lot from him about antiquities about how to have money in a bank and not worry about getting it back out you do know dont you why people dont use argentina much to launder andor hide money no but i wondered why there were so many fbi agents in montevideo and zero in argentina because this is where the money is laundered and hidden yung said argentina used to be the place but a couple years ago just before argentina defaulted on its government bonds the government decided to help themselves to the dollars in everybodys bank accounts the peso on one sunday was worth one us dollar on monday morning the government announced the pesification of the dollar all dollar deposits in argentine banks were converted to pesos at a rate of onepointthree pesos per dollar in other words if you had a hundred dollars on sunday on monday you had a hundred thirty pesos now if you wanted dollars you had to buy them and the rate was five to the dollar in other words your hundreddollar deposit was now worth twentysix a lot of peopleincluding a lot of honest onestook a hell of a bath the argentines blamed it on the imf who had loaned them the money they couldnt didnt want to repay fascinating their argument was pure argentine it was like some guy on a thousandamonth salary buying a cadillac with no money down then when it comes time to make the monthly payment he says not only am i not gonna make the payment but im gonna keep the caddy too because you should have known i couldnt afford to pay for it youre serious arent you castillo asked absolutely the banking system took a hell of a beating the scotia bankone of canadas biggest theyd been doing business in argentina for more than a centuryjust took their losses and pulled out for a while it looked like citibank and bank of boston were going to take their losses and leave too but they finally decided to stay how did this affect the antiquities dealer bertrand well first of all he was smart enough to have his money herea lot of money the last time i looked it was a little over sixteen million usand not across the river and then hes got an interesting deal with the banks what kind of a deal this is pretty complicated make it simple for me castillo said okay he doesnt deposit his money in his banks he loans it to them just like he was another bank banks are always borrowing money from each other so nobody notices one more loan they dont pay bertrand what they have to pay other banks so theyre happy and hes happy because he has their note callable on demand or he can endorse the banks promissory note over to somebodyanybodyelse an individual or another bank you see how it works like a super cashiers check im not sure castillo admitted how is he sure the banks will come up with the money when he says pay me because hes taken out insurance that they will yung said just a little smugly he gets it either from the bank or the insurance company it costs him a little money sure but his money is safe what if somebody steals the promissory notes unless he signs them theyre just pieces of paper you know a lot about this guy dont you yung ive been keeping my eye on him ever since i came down here you know something about his personal habits where he lives hes got an estanciahe calls it shangrilain tacuarembo province and a fancy condominium in punta del este he doesnt use the condo much because getting to his personal habits he likes the young girls very young girlshe has at shangrila theres one thing you dont know about this guy yung castillo said and whats that his real name is jeanpaul lorimer yung looked at castillo incredulously and then smiled youre kidding castillo shook his head uhuh can you show me where shangrila is on a map xviii one nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina july alex darbynotified by the guards at the gate that his guests were arrivingwas waiting at the door of the large stucco house when castillo britton and santini drove up come on in he said have any trouble finding it just followed the signs castillo said our little house isnt that a little cutesypoo for a safe house alex he looked around the foyer and the wellfurnished living room and fancy whats this place costing the agency there are safe houses and safe houses charley this is a safe house but not the agencys i own it i stole it you own it darby didnt reply come on in and well have some coffee unless you want something stronger i would love something very strong but not now castillo said as they followed darby into the living room and sat down around a coffee table get this charley darby said and pointed under the coffee table castillo saw him push a floormounted button with his shoe there was a faint tinkle of a bell and a moment later a middleaged woman in a maids uniform appeared yes sir juanita will you bring us some coffee please darby asked and some pastries yes sir very classy castillo said you said you own this place correction you said you stole it both darby said what do you think a place like this is worth half a million anyway probably more a lot more with the panache of mayerling attached you heard what happened here a couple of years ago the pesification special agent yung delivered a lecture on that just now in carrasco id been here a couple of months when that happened nobody had any dollars anymore the government had just converted them to pesos at a thirda fourthof what they had been worth before people were desperate for dollars the bottom fell out of the real estate market i paid a hundred and seventyfive grand for this you did steal it castillo said and you live here i rent it to cisco systems they pay me twelve thousand a month so the guy who runs things for them in the southern cone has a nice place to live reflecting the prestige of cisco systems to the natives he lets me use it when i need it he saw the look on castillos and santinis faces you know what cisco systems does right data transfer something to do with the internet largest operators in both can you imagine how much goes over their nets that would be of interest to me this guy is undercover with the agency no but hes a retired signal corps colonel he used to work for intelsat from time to time he tells me things hes found interesting and from time to time like nowi ask him if i can borrow the place to get out of the city for a couple of days cisco maintains an apartment in the alvear plaza for visiting executives so he and his wife stay at the alvear for a couple of days do the restaurants go to the colon etcetera nice deal its now all paid for so the rent goes in my pocket he paused smiled and chuckled which came to the attention of the counterintelligence people in langley i guess the riggs bank felt it their patriotic duty to tell them i was depositing a lot more money than i should be on what the agency pays me so they investigated they came down here and spent three weeks investigating and id already told my boss what i was doing his reaction was jealousy not disapproval so when they triumphantly laid on his desk their report that the guy in buenos aires was in the real estate business he said i know castillo chuckled and its like were queer charley to answer that question before you ask it the cisco guy doesnt ask and i dont tell youre a lot smarter than you look alex castillo said so what did you find out from the fbi guy in montevideo castillo didnt answer the question but asked one what time is ambassador silvio coming i didnt know how quickly you could get here so i told him three everybody will be here at three is that okay thats fine castillo said ive got an errand to run im sure i can be back by then while im gone tony and jack can tell you what happened with that sonofabitch in montevideo i thought maybe youd be pals after he was told to make nice darby said not quite and im going to need some maps topographic maps of tacuarembo province uruguay the more detailed the better and of the terrain on a reasonably straightline route from here to there why do i think youre planning a helicopter flight castillo didnt answer that question either and to go on my errand im going to need a car without cd tags our host has a mercedes suv he lets me use it comes with a driver i dont want the driver castillo said just the car the maid came in pushing a cart with a silver coffee service by the time you finish the coffee ill have the keys to the mercedes i dont have time for coffee alex castillo said and stood up two buena vista country club pilar buenos aires province argentina july castillo braked to a stop at the heavy yellowstriped barrier pole and with some difficulty finally found the window control switch and lowered the window the guard eyed him suspiciously but didnt speak im here to see mr pevsner im sorry sir but theres no one here by that name get on the phone and tell mr pevsner his friend from vienna is here the guard opened his mouth get on the phone and tell mr pevsner his friend from vienna is here castillo repeated that is not a friendly suggestion the guard stared at him for a moment and then said park over there please senor he pointed to a threecar nosein parking area castillo saw that another heavy steel barrier pole would keep people out of the country club until it was raised and that a menacinglooking tire shredder would keep them from changing their minds about wanting to enter buena vista and backing out the guard waited until castillo had parked the mercedes before he returned to the guard shack and the moment the guard entered the shack another came out leaned against it folded his arms on his chest and stared at the car castillo got out and waved and smiled at the guard which seemed to confuse him castillo took out a small cigar and lit it five minutes later a mercedesbenz ml identical to castillos came through the gate made a uturn and pulled in beside castillo castillo had examined it carefully but the windows were so heavily darkened that it wasnt until the door opened that charley could see the driver and then recognize him this doesnt give me a lot of time to figure outeven guesswhat hes doing here alfredo what a pleasant surprise castillo said fancy meeting you here mr pevsner had no idea that you were going to call karl colonel alfredo munz said you really should have called first i will offer my apologies for my bad manners i know hes going to be pleased to see you would you follow me please how do you know that hell be pleased to see me because when i saw you puffing on your cigar i called and told him who his friend from vienna was and he said wonderful i really want to talk to him munz replied snapped an order to the guards to raise the barrier and got back in his mercedes by the time castillo got behind the wheel the barrier pole was already high in the air aleksandr pevsner wearing riding breeches and boots and a heavy red turtleneck woolen sweater was standing on the verandah of his house waiting for them charley how good to see you he exclaimed and embraced him in the argentine manner how are you alex if you had given the guards your name i would have had them pass you in he said all i heard was a friend from vienna and i have many of those i understand castillo said you thought it might be henri douchon miraculously raised from the dead who i have no idea what youre talking about my friend okay castillo said smiling come on in the house well have a glass of wine have you had luncheon can i offer you something i had a small hamandcheese sandwich at the airport in montevideo and yes you may offer me something thank you very much anna and the kids are at school i have been at school horse school equestrian alex castillo corrected him i keep telling you things and you keep forgetting them so you do i was at equestrian schooli wonder whats the etymology of that word whats it got to do with horses it means horses alex from the latin equus castillo said i keep forgetting how smart you are charley at least most of the time you mean you keep forgetting most of the time or that im smart only part of the time how about both anyway i am just back from learning how to properly ride a horse and i was about to have a lomo sandwich may i offer you the same or would you prefer something a lomo sandwich would be delightful alex with wine or beer beer please and coffee lets go in the breakfast room pevsner said gesturing and would you mind if alfredo joined us not at all i thought he would like to hear what you have come to tell me what makes you think ive come to tell you anything castillo asked pevsner didnt answer he gestured for them to sit at a round glasstopped table and then left presumably to order their lunch so how do you like working for alex alfredo it pays much better than side did munz replied how is your female agent thank you for asking shes a lot better than she could be i saw her a few days ago in philadelphia and the mastersons are they well safe they are being protected by twentyfour delta force shooters and half of the mississippi gendarmeria i saw your president on television munz said when he said this outrage will not go unpunished i saw that too would it be reasonable to assume that youre somehow involved with doing that for him where would you get an idea like that where would alfredo get an idea like what pevsner asked as he came back into the breakfast room the us president promised he would punish those responsible for what he called this outrage the murders of masterson and the sergeant the sergeants name was markham castillo interrupted sergeant roger markham and i asked karl if he was involved and what did my friend carlos say he asked me where i got an idea like that aha pevsner said so if youre not involved in punishment and you didnt come here to tell me something to what do i owe the honor i came here to borrow your helicopter for a couple of days castillo said i just knew youd be happy to loan it to me pevsners head snapped around to look at him after a moment he said so he is alive and here whos alive and here castillo asked the man you asked howard kennedy to find for you did howard find him you know he didnt carlos the word on the street in paris and elsewhere in the old country is that hes in either the seine or the danube didnt howard tell you that what was his name again jeanpaul lorimer as you damned well know pevsner said you told me youd never heard of him when i asked you castillo said sometimes its better not to know peoples names pevsner replied i know who a lot of people are who do things sometimes i cant put a name to them i just know what they do thats interesting castillo said can i take that as a yes ill be happy to loan you my helicopter let me offer a hypothetical situation pevsner said lets suppose someone came to you in texas and said i want to borrow a horse i have an errand to run and you said but its raining and if i loan you my horse you will get soaking wet and maybe even get your death of cold and die why dont you let me run your errand for you wouldnt that make more sense not if your idea of an errand is to send someone to the beauty parlor to put an indian beauty mark on his forehead i told howard in paris to tell you i want this sonofabitch alive to do what i want to hear him sing you know like a canary i want him to tell me not only who he thinks whacked masterson and markham but everything else he knows about who got what and when and what for in the you know what alex a series of business transactions involving food medical supplies and oil pevsner stared at him coldly for a long moment and just to satisfy my curiosity how would you go about making the canary sing pevsner asked you mean in case pulling his teeth with pliers didnt work or the chinese water torture well first i would appeal to his sense of honesty and fair play if that didnt work then i would tell him i understood completely and since i knew people were worried about him not being in paris i was going to send him back there and there would be nothing to worry about the trip either because i was going to give him enough gamma hydroxybutane so that when he woke up he was going to be in the place de la concorde chained naked in a sexually suggestive pose to one of the statues around the obelisk of luxor wearing lipstick and earrings and with a rose stuck up his ass oh charley pevsner laughed what a wonderful picture unfortunately i cant permit it im not asking you for permission alex all i want to do is borrow your helicopter for a day or two youre not listening to me charley i said i cant permit it i have too much to lose if the canary sings and youre not listening to me alex you tend to forget what i tell you i really dont want this to become unpleasant charley i really like you and you know that i would be very unhappy let me tell you how things really are alex okay my friend tell me how things really are right now the pressure is off you because i went to the president and got it taken off as far as i knowi was about to say correct me if im wrong but i dont think you wouldyour only connection with oil for food was to move things around in your airplanes you didnt buy ten dollars worth of aspirin and sell it to the iraqis for ten thousand and then kick back half to saddam or anything like that right so far pevsner nodded just perceptibly im a businessman charley if people want me to airlift something somewhere ill do it i understand the point is right now we have an understanding you dont break any american laws and we dont come looking for you the problem is that youre about to break an american law what law would that be interfering with an official investigation obstructing justice pevsner smiled youre not suggesting that i would actually be charged with something like that come on charley oh you wouldnt be charged with anything but the arrangement would be broken and the president would be free to really start helping interpol in their sofar not very successful attempts to put the cuffs on you as much as it pains me to even think of something like this have you thought of what might happen to you before you could tell anybody anything you mean maybe getting my throat cut or getting a beauty mark those things seem to happen charley to people who threaten me or more important the happiness of my family you dont think i just walked in here cold do you if im not back where im expected within an hourand its a tenminute driveor i dont make a telephone call and say the right things ambassador silvio will request an immediate meeting with the foreign minister he will tell him he has just learned that aleksandr pevsner who interpol is searching so hard for is living in the buena vista country club what makes you so sure he doesnt already know pevsner snapped i wouldnt be at all surprised to learn that he does but thats not the same thing as being told he does by the american ambassador is it and the argentines seem at those levels of the government to solve embarrassing problems by throwing people to the wolves wouldnt you agree alfredo pevsner glared at him think it over alex castillo said very carefully goddamn you charley pevsner said more sadly than angrily and fuck you alex i say that in the friendliest possible way what do you want to do with the helicopter you really dont want to know do you hypothetically hypothetically if i knew a where somebody i wanted to teach to sing was locatedin a foreign country and b i knew that other people were trying to make sure that he didnt sing what i think i would do would be to get him back home to the good ol usa as quickly and quietly as possible a helicopter would be useful if someone was hypothetically of course thinking of doing something like that you just told me you realize that lorimer is not living in buenos aires or any other city you want the helicopter to move him from someplace in the country to an airport an airport large enough to take a plane that could fly him out of the country you didnt by any chance come all the way down here in that lear you had in cozumel id love to keep playing twentyquestions with you alex but i have to be running along are you going to loan me your helicopter or not goddamn you charley you already said that nice to see you alex castillo stood up ill have to pass on the lomo sandwich and the beer thanks anyway sit down charley pevsner said you can have the helicopter thank you what do i tell the pilot have you thought this through tell your pilot to fly it to jorge newbery by five oclock this afternoon tell him to park it at jetaire have him top off the tanks leave the key under the pad in the pilots seat and take three days off whos going to fly it i will and when im through with it ill take it back to jorge newbery give you a call and your pilot can pick it up pevsner nodded he looked at munz and after a momentadded take alfredo with you im sure hell be useful absolutely not but thank you just the same alfredo is not in the beauty spot business if thats what youre thinking but he could come back and tell you where wed been couldnt he if youd already taken lorimer out of the country what difference would that make what im thinking is that when it comes outand it willthat you got to lorimer before the other people looking for him did it would be embarrassing for me if people knew youd used my helicopter to kidnap him kidnap him what a terrible thing to even think what im thinking of hypothetically of course is returning this poor lost soul to the bosom of his loved ones of course what im suggesting is that if something happened while you were carrying out this humanitarian mission of yoursofficialdom asking questions youd rather not answer for examplealfredo could deal with that better than you could goddammit hes right the question is will munz deal with the officialdom or just wait for the opportunity to whack lorimer castillo looked at munz are you wondering karl if i have become an assassin for hire munz asked that occurred to me munz met his eyes for a long moment if i were in your place i would wonder too the answeris no i have not i ask you to consider this these people have changed my life too i bearand my wife and my family sharesthe shame of my being relieved and retired for incompetence i would really like to find out who they are so you can pop them alfredo i said the thought had occurred to me it did and i dismissed it castillo said do i mean that or am i already wondering who i can trust to pop him the moment he looks like hes thinking of whacking lorimer i guess i meant it but that doesnt mean i shouldnt seriously consider the selection of someone to pop him in case im wrong or prepare to do it myself thank you munz said why dont you tell your pilot to fly alfredo to jorge newbery castillo said that will make him less curious about whats going on pevsner considered that and nodded the maid appeared with a tray laden with hardcrusted lomo sandwiches and a wine cooler filled with ice and beer bottles ah our lunch pevsner said then he turned to castillo didnt you say something about having to call someone charley to let them know youre with friends i was lying about that alex pevsner looked at him shook his head and said you sonofabitch i say that in the spirit of friendship and mutual trust of course three nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina july ambassador juan manuel silvio phd ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states of america to the republic of argentina was sitting in the living room attired in blue jeans battered health shoes and a somewhat rattylooking sweatshirt on which was the faded logo of harvard university he had a beer bottle in his hand good afternoon sir castillo said good to see you again charley the ambassador said rising from his chair to offer his hand do i detect curiosity on your face perhaps because of my attire if i may say so sir youre not your usual natty self im glad you asked silvio said as he sat down when alex said you wanted to see me and here rather than at the embassy the problem then arose how was i going to get out here without having my side escort wonder what i was doing at our little house so you ditched the side escort castillo said smiling in a manner worthy of james bond silvio said i left the embassy went to the residence changed clothes and went jogging i led three side stalwarts on a merry chase through the park until they were puffing with the exertion then i speeded up the pace until they were far behind and then i just happened to see a car driven by one of alexs men who stopped and offered me a ride just happened to see it huh what they call a fortuitous happenstance silvio nodded ive always wanted to be the subject of an allpoints bulletin silvio said i can just see my good friend the foreign minister somewhat incredulously asking youre telling me you lost the american ambassador castillo chuckled then said thank you for coming sir thank you for asking me silvio said or arent you going to tell me what youve been doing or plan on doing alex castillo said is there someplace here where the ambassador and i can have a couple of minutes alone darby pointed through the plateglass windows toward a small tileroofed building in the garden how about the quincho he asked theres even beer in a refrigerator out there that will do very nicely castillo said castillo helped himself to a bottle of quilmes beer and then offered one to ambassador silvio who smiled and nodded and said please when castillo handed him the bottle the ambassador settled himself in an upholstered armchair and looked at him expectantly i dont think you want to know all of it sir castillo said tell me what you think you can silvio said well sir the president was waiting for the globemaster at biloxi with a finding he had just made and thats about it sir castillo concluded twenty minutes later silvio obviously considering what he had heard didnt reply for a moment my latin blood took over for a moment he said the first thing i thought was sympathy for betsy masterson and ambassador lorimer to learn that your brother and your son was not only involved in that slimy oilforfood business butindirectly perhaps but certainlyresponsible for the murder of your husband and son and the murder of a very nice young marine and the wounding of he stopped and looked at castillo ill understand if youd rather not answer this is dr lorimer on your list you intend to render harmless what i intend to do with him sir is take him to the states alive silvio nodded im sure he could be a cornucopia of interesting information he said but that wont keep ambassador lorimer and betsy from having to learn what a despicable sonofabitch he is will it sir im ashamed to say i never even thought about that before what i want lorimer to do is point me in the direction of those who murdered mr masterson theyre the ones i have been ordered to render harmless both santini and darby tell me the most likely scenario once i get him to the states is for him to be taken into the witness protection program which is run by the us marshals service in exchange for his cooperation silvio grunted and if he doesnt choose to cooperate i think he will sir he knows that people are looking for him and hell understand i think that if we can find him the people trying to find him to kill him torture and kill himcan also find him and ive had the fey notion that one thing i could tell him to get him to cooperate would be to threaten to take him back to paris and turn him loose on the place de la concorde after making sure le monde le figaro and lhumanite are informed that the missing un diplomat can be found there i dont think thats a fey notion at all that makes a good deal of sense i didnt think about telling the newspapers castillo admitted is there anything i can do to help charley would you be willing to call ambassador mcgrory and tell him the reason i didnt go to see him he wanted to see you he doesnt know what yung is really doing in montevideo and therefore feels he has the right to know what yung is doing especially with you what the telephone call from secretary cohen was really about yes sir he told yung if i went to yung without going through the embassy first to tell me he wanted to see me immediately i dont think he has to know about the finding id like to leave him in a position where he can truthfully say he knew nothing about this either what im going to do or what yung has been doing i understand ill call him as soon as i get back to the embassy thank you hes going to be curiousfrom his standpoint he has a right to knowwhat yungs role in what youre going to do is going to be or past tense was can i tell him that after youre gone yungs not going to have a role in what im going to do okay silvio responded that answers that doesnt it whats that look on silvios face mean that he doesnt believe yung wont be involved that hes surprised that he wont be that he doesnt like me keeping mcgrory a fellow ambassador in the dark to pick up the pieces after i screw up sir there was a look on your face did something i said make you uncomfortable i guess i dont have the poker face good diplomats are supposed to have silvio replied and i certainly have no expertise in your area but i was surprised that youre not going to use yung and then take him out of the country when you leave why well for one thing wont his position with ambassadormcgrory be compromised mcgrory will soon learn that yung wasnt what he believed him to be and since youre not going to tell him that youre operating with the authority of a presidential finding im sure hell go to the state department with that i would in his shoes absent a presidential finding an ambassador is responsible for anything any government agency is doing in his country and has veto power over any action proposed hes not even going to know about this until its over hes going to be more than a little annoyed yes sir i know what im trying to do is leave the ambassador in a position where he truthfully can deny any knowledge of what i plan to do or did i understand what i did was presume that you would take yung with you taking advantage of his expertise and then take him out of the country when you left and that once your mission was accomplished the secretary would tell ambassador mcgrory there were reasons for what had happened and that she had decided it was best that he not be cognizant of those reasons he wouldnt like it but he would understand and if i dont take yung with me and yung obeys my orders to tell mcgrory nothingi threatened him with the felony provisions of violating top secret presidential material so i think he would keep his mouth shutmcgrory would blow his top and a number of senior officials in the state department who have no legitimate reason to know would know that something had gone on in uruguay and be curious and ask questions that shouldnt be asked castillo finished for him which questions would come tobe leaked tothe washington post and the new york times and other presidenthaters silvio nodded with all the ramifications of that castillo added im sure youve thought of the risks involved charley im not trying to tell you your business the truth is i didnt think about it all castillo confessed mr ambassador you just kept me from making a stupid mistake a serious mistake thank you then he blurted you know what ambassador montvale said about me silvio shook his head montvale said that i am someone who was given more authority than he clearly will be able to handle it looks like hes right on the money doesnt it from what ive seen charley you handle the authority youve been given very well im so drunk with my authority that it never even entered my mind to ask you what you thought about what im going to do which means i just about blew the investigation into the oilforfood scandal out of the water and embarrassed the president personally that doesnt strike me as handling my authority well silvio studied castillo for a long moment then asked how much sleep have you had in the past few days it shows huh it shows if you really want my advice get yourself some rest castillo considered that took a sip of his beer then asked can you recommend a quiet hotel near the airport in montevideo as a matter of fact i can the airports in carrasco theres a really nice hotel in carrasco the belmont house a little stiff on the pocketbook but i was thinking you might get some rest today so was i sir you think i could get a couple of rooms there for tonight for two days how would i get the number to call i really dont want a record of me booking it through american express ambassador silvio reached into the pocket of his frayed blue jeans took out his telephone and punched the appropriate buttons juan manuel silvio here he said a moment later please tell me that youll be able to accommodate two friends of mineseparate roomsfor tonight and tomorrow night thirty seconds later he returned the cellular to his blue jeans done thank you very much my pleasure anything else i can do let me see if i can at least do this by myself castillo said and took out his cellular and punched the appropriate buttons im glad i caught you yung he began id offer to drive you to the airport ambassador silvio said but i dont think that would be a very good idea inasmuch as i suspect theres a good many people in uniforms looking for a man in a harvard sweatshirt and blue jeans castillo smiled at him and chuckled i meant what i said before about you keeping me from making a royal ass of myself and more important making the president look like one muchas gracias amigo silvio made a deprecating gesture with his hand what times your plane he asked or are you taking the lear or shouldnt i ask you can ask me anything you want to castillo said and ill tell you everything i think i can okay i will how are things going so far just generally if details may be inappropriate the first thing that can go wrong with this operation is that when i get to jorge newbery at five oclock a helicopter i borrowed wont be there or it will be there and the man in it will shoot me or if its there and he doesnt shoot me it will be equipped with a pressuresensitive detonator and a couple of pounds of semtex which will go bang when i pass through one thousand feet or if that doesnt happen the engine will quit when i am equidistant over the rio plate between jorge newbery and corrasco aside from that everythings going swimmingly silvio shook his head thats today the list of what can go wrong tomorrow is a little longer castillo said you will be in my prayers charley silvio said softly castillo nodded at him id love another beer but im driving charley said but theres no reason you cant four belmont house avenue rivera carrasco carrasco montevideo republica oriental del uruguay july nice place castillo said as they stood at the reception desk of the small luxurious hotel looks more like a club than a hotel fidel castro thinks so el coronel alfredro munz retired said with a smile this is where he always stays when hes in uruguay if you would like a drink gentlemen the desk clerk said as he returned castillos passport and american express card and munzs national identity card and handed them keys to their rooms ill have the bellman take your bags to your rooms he gestured toward the interior of the building castillo saw a small woodpaneled bar with leatherupholstered chairs at small tables i think thats a splendid idea castillo said im expecting a visitor at seventhirty a mr yung would you point him toward us please certainly sir castillo walked into the bar and sat at one of the tables munz followed him but did not sit down will i be in the way karl munz asked does in for a penny in for a pound mean the same thing in spanish that it does in english only to someone who speaks english munz said and we both do castillo said sit down alfredo a young waiter in a white jacket appeared do you have famous grouse castillo asked yes sir a double please water and ice on the side that sounds good munz said arent you taking a chance karl munz asked when the waiter had gone to fill their order that ill really get famous grouse you mean castillo asked innocently instead of some locally distilled copy thereof you know what i mean munz said ive learned that every once in a while you have to take a chance castillo said im taking one on you not to interfere with this operation by either telling alex about it until its over or choking the canary before he can sing when i went to work for alex you mean fulltime after you were retired in other words munzs face tightened when i was with side i never gave alex any information that in any way betrayed my duties or my country okay i told alex before i went to work for him that there were certain things i would not do munz said choking canaries as you put it was among the things he understood i would not do im sure howard kennedy made a deal very similar to yours castillo said but what i was wondering about before i decided on in for a penny in for a pound was whether or not the things you would not do included giving him information that might see my canary choked by somebody else if you feel that way why did you agree to my coming with you munz asked icily i agreed to your coming along after i decided that youre not the sort of man who could look at himself in the mirror after deciding that it would be morally justifiable to arrange for a canary to be choked providing someone else did the choking munz looked at him coldly but didnt reply and because alex was right castillo went on i think youre going to be useful were back to having to take a chance every once in a while like flying a singleengine helicopter across the river plate that was taking a chance wasnt it what if the engine had failed we would have drowned castillo said unless youre a much better swimmer than i am munz shook his head the seatslike those on airlinersare flotation devices castillo said we might have had to float around in the river for a while but i filed a flight plan and if we hadnt showed up on time they would have started looking for us i dont like to take foolish chances alfredo and dont the waiter appeared with a tray holding a bottle of famous grouse glasses a silver ice bucket a silver water pitcher and a pair of tongs he was pouring whiskey into the glasses when special agent david william yung jr came into the bar he was visibly surprised to see alfredo munz right on time castillo said halfstanding to offer yung his hand you two know each other right how are you colonel mr yung munz said im sure youre both wondering what happens next castillo said their eyes reflected their interest im going to have at least one more of these castillo said raising his glass and taking a healthy swallow have some dinner and go to bed he paused and added a very wise friend pointed out to me that people who havent had much sleep tend to make bad decisions i havent had much sleep and i cant afford to make any more sloppy much less bad decisions so just a question or two yung what do you hear about visiting friends from montevideo theyll be on the first busquebus from ba it gets here at about tenthirty and you found accommodations for them yes sir you have those maps i asked you for yes sir are you going to have any trouble waking up in time to pick up munz and me here at the hotel at say seven oclock in the morning ill be here sir where are we going munz said can i ask generally speaking we are going to reconnoiter the target ill be more specific in the morning he paused i wonder where the restaurant is right next to us munz said but it doesnt open until eight in half an hour well thatll give me time to finish this drink and have another castillo said he saw how they were both looking at him what im doing now is running on my reserves when im doing that i cant get to sleep unless i dilute the adrenaline or whatever the hell it is with substantial quantities of alcohol i understand munz said mr castillo can i speak to you privately for a moment yung asked it wont wait until the morning i wasnt kidding im in no shape to make decisions it wont take a moment sir alfredo order me another one please i will be back directly castillo said and stood up he followed yung out of the bar and through the lobby to the street okay what castillo asked i know we got off on the wrong foot mr castillo my fault water over the dam castillo said and i just wanted to say im grateful youre not cutting me out of this i thought when you went back to buenos aires this morning thats what was going to happen so thank you ill do my damnedest castillo thought unkindly jesus h christ hes acting like a high school kid blubberinghis gratitude to the coach for letting him back on the team after he got caught smoking in the boys room he thinks whats going to happen is some kind of a game so how do i handle this castillo smiled at special agent yung then punched him on the shoulder im glad youre going to be on the team yung he said hoping he sounded far more sincere than was the case xix one estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay july jeanpaul bertrand patron of estancia shangrila naked under his silk sulka dressing gown his bare feet in soft brown unborn calfskin loafers carefully pushed open the french door from his bedroom to the interior courtyard of his home he was carrying a cup of tea in his left hand and when it was rainingas it was nowthe damned door stuck and the tea would spill it didnt matter if he slopped tea on the tile floors of course but getting tea on the light blue dressing gown was really distressful he had managednot without a good deal of effortto teach the laundress how he liked his shirts lightly starchedand his linen and how she should carefully wash his silk socks in cold water but dry cleaning was an entirely different matter there was no drycleaning establishment worthy of the name in tacuarembo which meant that all his dry cleaning had to be taken to punta del este the place there charged an arm and a leg to dryclean something but at least it was returned clean in one piece and usually of the same color there were several problems with that too however for one thing he did not think it wise to go to his condominium in punta del este people might be looking for him to show up there and even if he could goin say six monthsthe stains he got on anything here would by then be permanent therefore he opened the door very carefully and was pleased with his foresight and care the damn door did stick but he didnt spill any tea on his dressing gown he sighed it was drizzling and from the appearance of the sky it was going to drizzle all day that happened often in winter what it meant was that he would be a prisoner in the house at least for today and tomorrow and probably longer than that the paths in the interior courtyard garden were paved with tile and if he wanted to he could pace back and forthlike a prisoner being allowed to exercisefor as long as he wanted but leaving the house was out of the question walking on the grass was like walking on a wet sponge jeanpaul had ruined more than one pair of shoes like that and where the grass ended there was mud the only way to move through the mud was to wear calfhigh rubber boots the rubber hurt his feet ruined his silk socks and made his feet smell and too frequently the boots became stuck in the mud which meant that when he tried to take a step his foot came out of the boot and wound up in the mud past the ankleif he didnt fall down on his face in the mud or worse on his back jeanpaul heard the helicopter a long time before he finally saw it while helicopters were certainly not common he seemed to see more and more of them even way out here in the country he had learned that some of them were owned by people who used them to commute between montevideoor even buenos airesand their estancias that was especially true in the winter when the goddamn persistent drizzle turned the roads into impassable quagmires and some were used to take hunters from montevideo or buenos aires to the duckshooting areas there was a lot of that too welltodo american and european hunters had discovered the wild fowl of uruguay he had even heard that the vice president of the united states had shot perdiz over dogswhatever that meanton an estancia owned by a uruguayan lawyer not far from shangrila in the summer there were frequent overflights of shangrila by helicopters taking people from argentina and brazil to punta del este jeanpaul had toyed with the idea of getting one for himself having one would solve the problem of getting back and forth to punta del este it was a dreadfully long drive on narrow highways and he now could easily afford one but a helicopter would draw attention to him and it was a little too soon to be attracting attention the helicopter like a good many other things would just have to wait until everyone forgot jeanpaul lorimer the sound of the helicopter grew louder and then startling himit suddenly appeared out of the drizzle no more than several hundred feet in the air and flashed overhead it was quickly gone and then the sound of its engines and thrashing rotor blades grew dimmer and finally disappeared jeanpaul bertrand decided the pilot had somehow become lost and had flown close to the ground to find a road and reorient himself he tossed what was left of his tea onto a flower bed and went back into the house for a fresh cup two suite victoria plaza hotel plaza independencia montevideo uruguay july suite was classified by the radisson victoria plaza as a hospitality suite intended for the use of businessmen who wished to entertain potential clients in privacy there was a bedroom with two kingsized beds plus a large sitting room with a wet bar a refrigerator and a large table seating eight that was suitable for use as either a dining table or a conference table an enormous sony flatscreen television was mounted on one wall of the sitting room so that those sitting at the table could view sales presentations hbo or for that matter the xxxrated video dramas that were available for a nominal fee when castillo walked into the hospitality suite with munz and yung there were ten people in the room colonel jacob torine special agents jack britton and tony santini of the secret service special agent ricardo solez of the drug enforcement administration mr alex darby the commercial attache of the us embassy in buenos aires mr fernando lopez sergeants first class robert kensington and seymour kranz of delta force corporal lester bradley of the united states marine corps and someonea mildlooking man in his early thirtiescastillo had never seen before castillo walked directly to darby took him by the arm led him into the bathroom closed the door and somewhat indelicately demanded what the fuck is bradley doing here and who the fuck is the other guy darby made a timeout gesture with his hands then went and opened the door bob will you come in here a moment please the mildlooking man came into the bathroom and closed the door after him bob this is mr castillo darby said charley bobroberthowell how do you do bob howell extended his hand castillo did not reply instead he looked questioningly at darby bob is the cultural attache of the us embassy here in montevideo darby said the head spook you mean castillo asked darby nodded tell mr castillo what you told me when you called yesterday bob howell nodded i received a telephone call on a secure line from ambassador montvale what castillo thought jesus christ is that sonofabitch montvale trying to micromanage me he first informed me that what he was to tell me was classified top secretpresidential howell said and that no one in the embassy here was authorized access including the ambassador then he told me he had reason to believe you were in buenos aires i was to make contact with you immediatelyhe suggested mr darby would probably know how to do thatand place myself and my assets at your absolute disposal he paused so i called alex what else did montvale have to say thats it sir he didnt tell you to check back with him let him know how things were going howell shook his head nothing like that and how much did you tell mr howell alex castillo asked only that i would be here this morning and we would need a secure discreet place to meet with maybe a dozen people so i arranged for this mr castillo howell said ive used it before i came earlier and swept it and i asked him to stay to see what you wanted to do darby said this is his country charley he knows it castillo nodded and what about corporal bradley did montvale call him too can howell hear this castillo thought that over for a moment then offered howell his hand welcome to castillos traveling circus mr howell castillo said this operation is authorized by a presidential finding the classification is top secret presidential what were going to do is take a man an american citizen named jeanpaul lorimer who is here in uruguaymore or less legallyas jeanpaul bertrand on a lebanese passport from his estancia in tacuarembo province to the states whether or not hes enthusiastic about being repatriated and without going through the usual immigration departure procedures getting the picture howell nodded can i ask what this guys done he has been a very naughty boy castillo said there are people who would like to see him dead so we have to do this before they get to him okay howell said castillo turned to darby okay alex what about bradley whats he doing here well you wanted two hundred gallons of fuel for the helicopter darby said the questionthis is before i got the call from bob you understandwas where to get it without having questions asked that meant id have to get it in argentina getting the fuel was no problem getting it over here was i knew you didnt want questions raised around the embassy either the embassy routinely trucks stuff over here but i thought there might be questions asked if i tried to get on the busquebus with four fiftyfivegallon barrels of jet fuel plus the other stuffin the back of a pickup truck so that meant it would have to be driven over here thats a long drive all the way up to gualeguaychu across the bridge over the rio uruguay into uruguay and then all the way down here but i didnt think there would be many questions asked at the border if there were cd plates on the truck better yet on a yukon being driven by a marine guard they often make freight runs over here by road so i knew they had a yukon so i called the gunny and told him you needed a quiet favor i needed to take four drums of fuel and some other stuff to you in uruguay would it fit in his yukon and would he loan itand a driverto you for some reasonmaybe your charming personalitythe gunny likes you so he said sure and for a driver guess whos standing right here in my office just back from the states corporal lester bradley my stalwart marine bodyguard castillo said shaking his head who had already heard more than he should darby said i figured it was better to use him than go through the hassle yeah and what the hell i just might need a bodyguard castillo said okay lets go look at the home movies sergeant seymour kranz was sitting at one side of the table a laptop computer was in front of him there was a rats nest of cables attaching the computer to a small video camera to a small color inkjet printer and to the control panel of the sony television on the wall please dont tell me that the minicam batteries were dead or that yung forgot to take the cover off the lens castillo said no sir sergeant seymour kranz replied it worked better than i would have thought and were set up right so i can push the right buttonwhich you will show meand can make stills as we watch it yes sir kranz said handing castillo the control as castillo sat down beside him and its already loaded into the computer so you can send it to washington or bragg if you want to lets hold off on that castillo said and then okay guys heres the tape we shot of the target this morning i could only make one lowlevel pass over the house itself so im sure i missed something important make a note of what else you would like to see when i drop kranz off up there this afternoon ill have another shot at it he paused are we going to have to turn the lights off to see this well lets find out the huge television screen began to show the uruguayan countryside and then approached a city thats the town of tacuarembo not much of a town the road to the estancia is at the top right of the picture a quarter of a mile or so out of town the paving stops the roads according to the maps are improved which means anything from paved with stone to mud we better count on mud this is the rainy season now theres estancia shangrila itself shot through the soup from about twentyfive hundred feet i think i hopethe stuff yung shot when i made the lowlevel pass will give us a hell of a lot more detail but you can see the house notice the interior courtyard and the outbuildings now this is the road leading away from shangrila in other words farther away from tacuarembo what i was looking for was a place where we could set up kranzs radio today and tomorrow where we could form up and where i can leave the chopper while were making the snatch i went five miles or so in this direction and didnt find one it all looked like swampmaybe because of the rainor it was full of rocks or trees or both so i went over here much closer to where were going you cant tell it from the air but the maps show that its a hundred or so feet higher than the buildings at the estanciaim sure i can get in there without being seen and i dont think anyone will be able to tell the difference between a chopper flying overhead and me landing and where the hell is it there it is a field without rocks or trees and it looks as if it drains pretty well and here a half mile give or take from the field is another improved road you have to go all the way back to tacuarembo to get on it but thats what bradley youre going to have to take to get to it youll take ricardo solez with you i dont know what the hell to do about the damned cd plates on the yukon he stopped the video and looked at darby the yukon now has argentine plates on it charley alex darby said and argentine documents in the glove compartment how less suspicious will the argentine plates make it castillo heard a whirring noise and realized the printer was already printing the stills not as unsuspicious as uruguayan plates darby admitted but i just couldnt put my hands on uruguayan plates on such short notice and anyway uruguayan plates have the province on them you cant tell where an argentine vehicle is from from the plates okay castillo said bradley keep your mouth shut if you get stopped or anything ricardos texican speaks pretty good porteno spanish can probably pass for a uruguayan and probably can get away with explaining you as his anemic cousin yes sir the way were going to do this is that youre going to drive the yukon to tacuarembo as soon as this meeting breaks up its about two hundred twenty miles so figure five hours six if the roads are bad but its a real highway as far as tacuaremboi flew up it this morningso we may get lucky if you leave here by twelvethirty that should put you in the city by sixthirty at the latest there will still be some light until about half past five the priority obviously is to get the fuel and weapons up there safely even if that takes you until midnight having said that the sooner you get there the better understand yes sir corporal bradley said highest road speed consistent with safety and share the driving castillo ordered and thought at least ricardo will be driving half the time change over every hour yes sir bradley almost barked youre being unfair he may look like an escapee from the high school cheerleading squad but he did get the yukon here didnt he and the fuel and weapons past the border guards in the best of all possible worlds castillo continued you would get to tacuarembo at say quarter to five even a little earlier that would give you time to find the right road out of town and then to find the field youll have a map getting from the road to the field is the problem reconnoiter it on foot make sure operative word sure that you wont get the truck stuck in the mud if we get really lucky and you can drive to the field dump the fuel barrels and the pump not the weapons just the fuel and the pump and then go find the hotel carlos gardel in tacuarembo it shouldnt be hard its the only one decide for yourself if you want to take the chance of leaving the weapons in the yukon or taking them and the other stuff into the hotel you dont want us to just stay in the field overnight solez asked if some gaucho rides up on the fuel he might figure someone left it there to fuel a tractor or something he would get curious to find two guys in a yukon okay if you cant get the yukon in there well just have to land the chopper on the road in the morning and refuel it there why do you have to refuel it at all britton asked i mean you went up there and back because im going directly to jorge newbery from shangrila castillo explained to do that im going to need a full load of fuel torine and fernando are going to stay herethe lear isuntil they get word that we have lorimer in the bag we should know whether that worked by say twentyone hundred tomorrow night whenifthey get the word they immediately go wheelsup to jorge newbery the next morningim going to have to wait until its light to take offim going to fly nap of the earth under i devoutly hope any radar i dont want to try that in the dark with the equipment on the ranger he looked at munz tell alex that whoever sold him the avionics on that chopper screwed him and that in the spirit of friendship ill send him a list of what he should have somebody cheated alex munz said that wasnt smart was it whos alex darby asked you dont want to know castillo said and if things dont go well charley torine asked well have to play that by ear castillo said maybe stay one day and try it again or abort this operation and think of something else torine nodded if it works and you go to buenos aires check out of the four seasons check everybody out torine asked britton me and you and fernando castillo said kranz and kensington will have to stay here long enough to get the weapons the gear and the radios back to buenos aires and then get with darby and santini and get it to the states through the embassy so theyll need rooms for a day or two then theyll go back to bragg commercial is getting them tickets going to be a problem alex darby shook his head good okay fernando and torine will go to jorge newbery check the weather file a flight plan etcetera and be ready to go the minute i get there in the ranger with lorimer and yung and munz thats where you come in mi coronelalex said youd be helpful who the hell is alex darby asked again castillo ignored the question if im able to reason with lorimer he went on that is convince him the only way hes going to stay alive is by going with me fine he may even have his american and un passports in his safe if he gives me trouble if i have to put him to sleepyung a man of many unexpected talents tells me hell have no trouble getting into his safei think we can count on his lebanese passport for sure but if he is knocked out how do we get him through immigration and into the lear i can arrange that munz said no problem and i just come back to montevideo right yung asked no youre going to the states with us castillo said what about my investigation my files id really like to stay here this is not open for debate yung castillo said youre going with us your cover as just one more fbi agent will be blown with the ambassador the moment he hears what happened so this afternoon pack a bag with enough clothes for a couple of days and give it to fernando a small bag what the hell happens to my files you are tenacious arent you castillo said sharply but that is in fact a good question mr howell this afternoonwhen you go with him to his apartmentmr yung is going to give you some files which as of this moment are classified top secretpresidential you will find someplace to keep them until i decide how to get them to the states maybe in the hands of a diplomatic courier and what happens to my files in the states whatever the president decides to do with them which means they disappear down the black hole of diplomacy i just changed my mind castillo said colonel torine will you go with howell and yung to yungs apartment and take possession of yungs files that way we can take them home with us torine gave him a thumbsup signal castillo nodded the subject is closed yung you understand yung exhaled in resigned disgust okay castillo said now to the assault team those twohe pointed to kranz and kensington have some very rudimentary skills in that area so theyll be on it but that means they wont be on the radios you can set them up cant you so all someone has to do is turn them on and talk no problem sir sergeant kensington said one goes with us that leaves the question of where to set up the other one here can you just aim the antenna out the window the way you did in the four seasons i think so sir ill have to try it okay but if miller or anyone else in the states tries to talk to you it fails right i dont want anybody trying to micromanage this operation got it sir kensington said how big is the antenna howell asked a little larger than a satellite tv antenna kensington answered eighteen twenty inches in diameter theres a backyard at my house howell said fenced in would that work wheres your house castillo asked in carrasco not far from yungs apartment okay you are now our base station radio operator kensington will go with you set it up and show you how it works both men nodded jack britton who knows how to operate a car and i know is pretty good at running around in the dark gets suited up tony you want to go absolutely i would like to volunteer sir corporal lester bradley said i have never fired the car but i shot expert at parris island with the m and with the beretta and in iraq i was the designated marksman of my fireteam i used a boltaction mm snipers rifle for that sir essentially a remington model modified for marine corps use sir you were a sniper in iraq sergeant kranz asked incredulously we dont have snipers in the corps sergeant but the better shots are issued a snipers rifle and are assigned as designated marksmen we have a remington right castillo asked i do sir kranz said well lester castillo said youre just the man ive been looking for what youre going to do is take sergeant kranzs rifle make yourself a suitably camouflaged firingobservation position we have binoculars too right kranz kranz nodded and the nightvision goggles the new ones the really good ones make sure that corporal bradley knows how to use them castillo ordered hes going to guard the ranger while were at the house sir since its sergeant kranzs rifle bradley said maybe hed prefer to guard the helicopter and i could go on the assault team in special operations bradley castillo said very seriously we operate on the principle of the round peg in the round hole not personal desire sergeant kranz is not the best man to guard the chopper you are aye aye sir bradley responded with not much enthusiasm ricardo you want to go with us castillo asked i realize you havent had much training in things like this please say no if anything goes wrong youll be the first one to take a hit and i really dont want to have to tell abuela about that that would be even worse than having to tell your father nothing like this i suppose the young dea agent said but i have had training the dea school is there such a thing yeah and thats tough but what i meant was that when i was at a and m in the corps i went through the ranger course at benning and hurlburt field one summer don fernando can tell you thats rough yeah i really want to go dont worry about me okay youre on he glanced at fernando and saw that fernandos eyes were on him castillo shrugged slightly fernando tipped his head slightly hes thinking exactly what im thinking its one of those things it has to be that makes seven on your assault team right darby asked plus bradley at the helicopter thats eight you have enough black suits weapons night goggles etcetera where do you get eight darby ticked them off on his fingers kranz kensington yung britton santini solez munz and you he held his hands up with five fingers on his left hand and three on his right extended thats eight when i took those bags from fort bragg out to the house i counted equipment for sixshooters thats the trouble with you agency people castillo said with a smile you assemble a few facts and immediately draw the wrong conclusion or usually conclusions plural darby rearranged his extended hands and gave him the finger twice what colonel munz and you and i are going to do alex is drive sedately up to the door of shangrila in a car youre just going to drive up in a car where question one is the car coming from howell will rent it for us this afternoon from hertz at the airport he will use his credit card thus keeping your name off the books i have a car that you can use mr castillo howell said a fiveyearold powder blue peugeot better yet castillo said things are going so well im waiting for that famous other shoe to drop would your car be the sort of car used by uruguayan bureaucrats on official business mr howell howell nodded thats why i bought what i did actually alex you will drive mr howells fiveyearold powder blue peugeot to tacuarembo early tomorrow afternoon theres no sense you being there any sooner than say half past five or six and when i get there then what go to the hotel carlos gardel if it doesnt have a bar it has to have a place you can have a cup of coffee munz and i will meet you there say at eight or eightthirty we will be wearing suits and trying to look as much as possible like uruguayan bureaucrats dont recognize us finish your coffee and leave go to the car well find it its powder blue right that should make it easy to find and then we drive out to shangrila quickly flash our badges to whoever answers the door eventually we will get to mr bertrand who will be informed that there seems to be some irregularity with his passport and might we have a look at it if this goes as i hope it will lorimer will open his safesaving yung the difficulty of blowing it opento get either his lebanese passport or money to bribe us with probably both once the safe is open munz will put handcuffs on him and i will begin to explain to him what happens next and the wisdom of his cooperating once we get that far you who will have been waiting patiently outside will drive the powder blue car back to montevideo anybody around seeing the car leaving will presume were in it castillo went on as soon as they see you leave while britton yung and solez are cutting the telephone line andor any cables leading to any transmitter antennas kranz and kensington will come into the house put plastic cuffs on anybody in the house and make sure theres nobody lurking around who can cause trouble they will then go outside to make sure there are no visitors or that were warned if there are ricardo britton and yung who should be in the house by then will herd everyone weve cuffed into a bedroom where they will be attached to the furniture with more plastic cuffs when thats been done leaving ricardo to watch those cuffed britton and yung will start to search the house for anything interesting that lorimer didnt choose to put in the safe thats in munzs area of expertise too so hell help with that ill sit on lorimer just before dawn we take lorimer out of the house and head for the helicopter by the time we get there there will be enough light to take off the way i figure it well have anywhere from a half hour to an hour before those cuffed manage to get loose or someone comes in to make breakfast or whatever and discover jeanpaul has been kidnapped bythis is important spanishspeaking people two of whom look like copsbusinessmenbureaucrats and the rest like those people one sees in thriller movies those balaclava masks really scare people darby thought the scenario over carefully you dont need permission to speak you know alex castillo said after a very long thirty seconds jesus charley darby said smiling this might just work and nobody gets hurt castillo said i want everybody to keep that in mind this is not an assault the only man at lorimers estancia who deserves to die is lorimer and unfortunately i need the sonofabitch alive the primary purpose of the black suits and the balaclava masks and all the weapons is to scare everybody into behaving while were there and the masks will make everybody hard to describe to the local gendarmes when they finally show up and start asking questions at what time do you want me to chauffeur you and munz out there darby asked probably about nine oclock at that time there probably wont be more than two or three servants in the house plus maybe his tootsie anyway kranz and kensington will have kept an eye on the place for at least an hour before we get there and if it doesnt look right one or the other of them will wave us off at the driveway if that happens we may wait until later midnight for example and forget the bureaucratic business just drive up in the yukon bust in grab lorimer bust open the safe and get the hell out of there we can hide in the field where the chopper is or maybe just get in the chopper and go i think the first scenario will work darby said jesus i hope so castillo said okay well get to the rest of the tape make notes of what were missing and ill try to get what i missed this afternoon he pushed a button on the control and the videotape began to play this is where we followed the road bradleys going to use into tacuarembo i didnt see anything extraordinary about it but take a real good look bradley okay here we are over the field again i didnt see one but there has to be a road a path into it look for it bradley dont just drive over the field we cant afford to have the yukon stuck in the middle of the field when the sun comes up im glad i thought of that if bradley gets the yukon stuck he will be shot and his carcass left in the yukon which will be then torched by ricardo ricardo make sure that kranz gives you a couple of thermite grenades and shows you how to use them before you drive up there one for the engine compartment the other on one of the barrels of fuel ive seen a thermite grenade before solez said okay here we are im about to make the lowlevel pass over the main house at shangrila jesus theres somebody in the interior courtyard he stopped the tape gentlemen there is mr jeanpaul bertrand aka lorimer apparently having a wakemeup cup of coffee in his garden three estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay july jeanpaul bertrand was not only dining alone but he had prepared the meal himself there were several reasons for one he was bored for another his cooks idea of a gourmet meal was to throw somethingusually beef sometimes pork and less often chickenon the woodfired parrilla grill char it and then serve it with either mashed potatoes or what they called here papas fritas and a sliced tomato salad wrapping a potato in aluminum foil and baking it apparently overtaxed her culinary skills there were some marvelous chefs in uruguay but not in tacuarembo and of course he had to stay in tacuarembo for the time being jeanpaul had come to believe that the northern italian kitchenwhich is what the good restaurants in montevideo and punta del este servedwas in fact as hard as this was to accept actually a bit superior to that of the french tonight with annamaria the cook watchingand he dared hope perhaps learninghe had prepared chateaubriand first after putting on a chefs apron he had gotten a knife really sharp and then trimmed all the fat and sinew from a lomo a lomo was the entire tenderloin of beef a tenderloin that would cost fortyor moreeuros in paris was available here as a lomo for the equivalent of nine or ten and it was magnificent beef then he first cut a teninch section from it and set it aside the remainder of the tenderloin he carefully cut into bitesized pieces tomorrow or the day after he would make boeuf bourguignonne with the remaining meat he rubbed the teninch length of tenderloin with a garlic clove salt and pepper and set it aside while he prepared the vegetables the green beans were marvelous as is but the carrots were the size of his wrist and he had to slice them into fingersized pieces before he could use them he put the steamer on so that he could steam the beans the potatoes a half dozen stalks of celery and a dozen large white mushrooms he told annamaria to open a bottle of the cabernet sauvignon just open it not decant it and leave it here in the kitchen for the time being then he sliced another dozen and a half white mushrooms very thin vertically and then sauteed them in a pan until they were about half cooked then he added a tablespoon of flour and stirred it into the mushrooms until it was no longer visible next came a cup of the very good local merlot with the gas as low as it would go he stirred patiently until the sauce formed only then did he add a touch of garlic and basil and salt and pepper he went to the parrilla outside the kitchen and carefully arranged the coals under the grill testing to see if he had the proper heat with his hand when he was satisfied he laid the tenderloin on the hot steel grid when he went back in the kitchen the cabernet sauvignon was on the table with a glass he poured and took an appreciative sip maria came into the kitchen from the outside jeanpaul could tell from the young face of his current companion in the bed that she was afraid he was angry with her he had told her he wanted to read while dining and she should find something to eat by herself the truth was not only did her manners leave a good deal to be desired but setting a fine meal before her made him think of the phrase casting pearls before swine if it wasnt charred black on the outside and raw inside maria eyed it with great suspicion and only ate whatever it was to please him maria and annamaria watched as he examined the mushroom mixture and then added a half cup more of the merlot and loaded the vegetables into the steamer he had then gone back to the parrilla and turned the tenderloin then he went back into the kitchen had another sip of the cabernet and told annamaria to set the table for one with the candles in the candelabra lit then he told maria to go to his bedroom and to bring his reading glasses and the book with the red jacket that was on the bedside table and put both on the dining room table then he went back to the parrilla again turned the tenderloin againit was browning nicelyand went back into the kitchen the sauce was now almost of the right consistencythe merlot had been reduced just enoughso he turned off the gas under it then he tested the vegetables in the steamer with a fork and with the same result another five minutes and everything would be done at just about the same time he looked at his watch then sipped the cabernet until the five minutes had passed then he took a meat thermometer from a drawer and went to the parrilla he turned the tenderloin again then inserted the meat thermometer into it the dial showed degrees fahrenheit he then removed the tenderloin from the grill to a plate and took it back in the kitchen there he rolled it onto a large oblong platter and then placed the first plate over it he tested the mushroom sauce one last time added a touch of salt and then closed the lid again then he went to the steamer and carefully removed half of the vegetables arranging them neatly to one side of the platter he ran the knife against the steel again until it felt right then took the tenderloin and put it on a cutting board he sliced the entire piece into pinkiefingerthick slices and then skillfully lifted them all at once and laid them in the center of the platter he used the knife blade to carefully push the vegetables already on the platter against the tenderloin then he arranged the vegetables remaining in the steamer against the other side of the tenderloin when that was done he placed the knife blade on the tenderloin and pushed so that the slices were displaced and lying on one another then he went to the mushroom sauce pan picked it up and dribbled an inchwide path of sauce on top of the slices annamaria he announced this is called a chateaubriand si senor put this sauce in a sauce bowl he said and then serve the chateaubriand i will take the wine and glass with me si senor do you want me to come sit with you maria asked no dear thank you just the same why dont you have a bath ill be in shortly he picked up the bottle of cabernet sauvignon and his glass and went into the dining room and sat down at the table annamaria came in with the platter i will need some bread please the hardcrusted rolls and butter and of course salt and pepper and dont forget the sauce when annamaria had delivered everything he checked to see that everything he needed was present thank you annamaria he said you may go i do not wish to be disturbed si senor annamaria said and left the dining room three minutes later she was back jeanpaul was annoyed he had told her he did not wish to be disturbed and he had had just barely time enough to move a couple of slices of the beefand it looked and smelled marvelousto his plate and here she was back i told you annamaria that i didnt wish to be disturbed excuse me senor but there are two men here officials officials what kind of officials officials senor from the government they have badges what the hell and they wish to see you senor jeanpaul rose angrily from the table threw his napkin on it and marched to the front door two men were standing there may i help you gentlemen are you senor jeanpaul bertrand yes i am and who are you i am assistant chief inspector muller of the immigration service the larger of the two said and this is inspector ofallon he held out his credentials we are very sorry to trouble you senor chief inspector muller said and at this hour of the night and we do apologize sir what is it do you have your passport senor bertrand yes of course i do youre sure senor yes of course im sure why do you ask senor bertrand as you may know our immigration records are now computerized so ive heard this afternoon senor bertrand according to the computer you attempted to enter uruguay on a varig flight from rio de janeiro thats absurd the computer also says that you entered uruguay some time ago and have never left thats true what we suspect senor bertrand is that the other senor bertrand who is being held in custody is not really who he says he is that his passport is either a forgery or that he has somehow come into possession of your passport assistant chief inspector muller gave jeanpaul bertrand time to think this over and then went on one or the other is true senor bertrand and the question can be simply answered if you have your passport then the other is a forgery and the other senor bertrand will be dealt with accordingly on the other hand if your passport has somehow been misplaced it happens senor if it has been misplaced into the hands of the other senor bertrand then he will be dealt with accordingly i cannot believe that a gentleman of your reputation and standing would loan his passport i certainly would not jeanpaul proclaimed righteously my passport isor should bein my safe ill get it for you thank you very much senor may i offer you a cup of coffee something to drink while i get it no thank you senor inspector ofallon said were on duty ill be right with you jeanpaul bertrand said my safe is in my office in the rear of the house thank you senor assistant chief inspector muller said the sitting room is in here jean paul said if youll wait there are you sure i cannot offer you anything thank you just the same senor muller said the safe was bolted both to an interior wall and to the floor jeanpaul had learned that when he was looking for something in it it was much easier just to sit on the floor than to bend over and try to look inside he had done so now he had a hell of a time finding the damned passport but finally did a forged passport i understand but one with my name on it whats that all about oh of course in case someone checks there is a valid passport in the name of jeanpaul bertrand oh god is this incident going to be in the newspapers he heard a sound and looked over his shoulder the younger one inspector ofallon was standing behind him what the hell is he doing in here inspector ofallon isnt it jeanpaul asked no not really castillo said in english i beg your pardon you know how it is lorimer sometimes people use other names will you hand me the passport and stand up please whats going on here castillo snatched the passport from lorimers hand as he stepped over him and pushed the safe door open more widely jeanpaul scurried backward on the floor and ran into a set of legs then he felt himself being hauled to his feet put your hands behind you please the man who had said he was assistant chief inspector muller ordered jeanpaul did as he was told he looked around his office muller was doing something with his wrists jeanpaul took a closer look at the face of the man who had said he was inspector ofallon but had just now called him lorimer in american english but then something else caught his eye there was a face at the window and it looked as if whoever stood there was trying to break the window with something the last thing jeanpaul lorimer phd saw in this world before two mm bullets struck him in the mouth and forehead was the breaking glass of the window and an orange flash castillo reacted to the sound of the breaking glass and the burst of submachine fire instinctively he dropped to the ground scurried behind the desk and reached for the beretta he was carrying in the small of his back what the fuck this desk is going to be about as much protection against a mm as a kleenex there was the sound of more firing outside he recognized the characteristic chatter of a car more than one car and then the sharper crack of a didnt i hear a just before the goddamn submachine gun went off he saw a cord running across the floor to the desk if they cant see you they cant shoot you unless they spray the room with a submachine gun what the hell he jerked on the cord and a lamp on lorimers desk crashed to the floor but didnt go out sonofabitch there was the sound of another mm round going off and of voices shouting something unintelligible and then several more bursts from car s castillo reeled in the lamp finally found the switch and turned it off the room was now dark castillo got to his knees then took a running dive from behind the desk toward the corner no one shot at him he found the wall with his hands and pushed himself into the corner he waited for a moment to give his eyes a chance to adjust to the darkness to turn the lamp off he had had to find the switch which was a push device in the bulb socket which meant that hed had the light from a clearglass sixtywatt bulb right in his eyes finally he could make out the outline of the windows and raised the beretta in both hands to aim at it alfredo he called im hit munz called back i dont know how bad i have lorimers brains all over me there was another burst of car fire this one farther away and then sergeant kensingtons voice anybody alive in there only the good guys castillo called back there was the sound of a door being kicked open and then a hand holding a flashlight appeared in the door and the light swept the room then kensington came into the room with corporal lester bradley on his heels sniper rifle at the ready get that goddamn light out of my eyes castillo ordered theres a lamp on the floor behind the desk kensington found the light and turned it on and then walked to where castillo was getting to his feet he waited until castillo was fully up then said these cocksuckers whoever the fuck they were got past kranz can you believe that is he all right they garroted him major kensington said oh shit castillo walked to the desk again looked at the exploded head of jeanpaul lorimer and then at the blood oozing from the chest of el coronel alfredo munz and said oh shit again four estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica oriental del uruguay july youre going to be all right colonel sergeant robert kensington said to munz who rested just about where he had fallen behind lorimers desk theres some muscle damage thats going to take some time to heal and youre going to hurt like hell for a long time every time you movefor that matter breathe i can take the bullet out now if youd like i think ill wait until i get to a hospital munz said your call alfredo castillo said but how are you going to explain the wound and if kensington says he can get it out he can no offense but that looks to me like a job for a surgeon kensington has removed more bullets and other projectiles than most surgeons castillo said before he decided hed rather shoot people than treat them for social disease he was an ateam medic which meant whats that line kensington that i was qualified to perform any medical procedure other than opening the cranial cavity kensington quoted i can numb that give you a happy pill and clean it up and get the bullet out it would be better for you than waitingthe sooner you clean up a wound like that the betterand thatd keep you from answering questions at a hospital but what are you going to tell your wife lie alfredo castillo said tell her you were shot by a jealous husband what shes going to think is that i was cleaning my pistol and it went off and im embarrassed munz said but id rather deal with that than answer official questions how long will i be out you wont be out long but youll be in lala land for a couple of hours okay do it munz said well lets get you to your feet and onto something flat where theres some light kensington said he looked at castillo and between them they got munz to his feet theres a big table in the dining room that ought to work kensington said it looks like everybody got here just in time for dinner theres a plate of goodlooking roast beef on it and a bottle of wine okay on the beef castillo said nix on the wine we have to figure out what to do next and get out of here major who the fuck are these bad guys kensington asked i really dont know yung is searching the bodies to see what he can find out i dont even know what happened well theyre pros whoever they are maybe russians krantz was no amateur and they got him with a fucking garrote that means they had to a spot him and b sneak up on him a lot of people have tried that on seymour and never got away with it spetsnaz castillo said if this were anywhere in europe id say maybe even probably but here i just dont know well take the garrote and whatever else yung comes up with and see if we can learn something when they got to the dining room kensington held munz up while castillo moved the chateaubriand the sauce pitcher the bread tray and the wine to a sideboard then he sat him down on the table tell me physician munz said what would the effect of wine be on this happy pill youre about to give me kensington went to the sideboard and picked it up cabernet sauvignon he said there is a strong body of medical opinion which suggests this is indicated in a procedure of this nature you want a glass yes please munz said kensington poured wine in the glass and handed it to munz take these with it he said putting two white gel capsules on the table and when you start to feel a little woozyit usually takes about a minutejust lie down im a little surprised youre not in pain what makes you think im not munz asked as he tossed the capsules into his mouth and then picked up the wineglass you wont be out for long kensington said what happened out there physician munz asked the first thing i knew that anything was wrong was when i heard the remington go off and god forgive me what i thought then was that the goddamn kid was playing with the rifle and it went off so i ran around the side of the building to chew him a new asshole and thats when i saw the two guys one of them was on the ground and the other was pointing a madsen at me a madsen castillo asked yeah that mean something it might castillo said and i had just decided oh shit hes got me when another round went off down he went two shots from the kid both in the head the little sonofabitch can shoot he saved my ass and yours too the first one he popped was the guy who stuck his madsen into the office window bradley told me he waited until he was sure what he was up to before he popped him he was supposed to be guarding the goddamn chopper castillo said and arent you glad major that he didnt understand that order kensington said and then things got a little exciting there were six of them in all five at the house and the one who garroted kranz kranz managed to get his boot knife into him when we found kranz that one died trying to escape that wasnt smart kensington yeah i know but seymour and i went way back and i didnt think i am starting to feel a little strange munz said let me help you lie down kensington said kensington gently lifted munzs eyelid and shined a small flashlight into it okay hes out hell probably be out for thirty minutes but hes a big sonofabitch and i have no idea what his threshold of pain is so he may start to wake up when im working on him i want you to be prepared to hold him downlie on top of him whatevers necessaryif he starts to move okay got it castillo said and now before i lay out my surgical instruments you may help me scrub how do i do that kensington handed him an aerosol can spray this crap all over my hands its advertised as better than a good scrub with surgical soap it fucks up your hands but what the hell castillo sprayed a foaming pale orange substance over kensingtons hands from the aerosol can and then watched as kensington pulled on rubber gloves then kensington came up with a thin black plastic envelope he tore it open inside was a small set of surgeons tools no offense major kensington said but if you feel yourself getting a little woozy when i start to cut for christs sake sit down on the floor and put your head between your knees the last thing we need is you cracking your head open on the table you have to get us the fuck out of here no identification whatever special agent david william yung of the fbi reported to castillo forty minutes later no labels in the clothing and im almost sure theyre manufactured locally or at least available here so theres nothing there i fingerprinted the bodies and took enough blood to do a good dna but a dna is good only when you have something to compare it to sorry they came in cars from enterprise rentacar the airport office we can run those credit cards but if these people are as professional as it looks thatll be a dead end too sorry thats what kensington said theyre pros so what did we expect four caucasian two black i took pictures of course but okay thanks thats the bad news the good news is an address book from the safe and these he wagged a dozen sheets of what looked like stock certificates what are those these are the certificates of loan fifteen point seven million us dollars worth of course since lorimer didnt sign them they cant be cashed but it proves he has all the money in the banks maybe some bank officers can be talked into telling us what they know about lorimers activities on the other hand once they learn hes dead theyll deny their existence and theyre fifteen point seven million ahead yeah yung agreed corporal lester bradley usmc came into the kitchen sergeant kensington said hes ready to mount up anytime you give the word sir the colonel is on his feet bradley i owe you you saved my tail and colonel munzs just doing my job sir tell sergeant kensington to get the show on the road bradley yes sir five the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc august the president of the united states was behind his desk across the room ambassador charles w montvale was sitting next to secretary of state natalie cohen on one of two facing couches secretary of homeland security matthew hall was on the other couch major c g castillo who was in civilian clothing was nonetheless standing before the presidents desk at a position close to at ease or secretary hall thought like a kid standing in front of the headmasters desk waiting for the ax to fall for the past ten minutes castillo had been delivering his report of what had happened since he had last seen the president in biloxi when the president had issued his presidential finding aboard air force one and so we landed at macdill mr president castillo concluded where we turned over sergeant kranzs remains to central command and then we came here arriving at ohninethirty i took everyone involved to my apartment and told them nothing was to be said to anyone about anything until i had made my report and that they were to remain there until i got back to them colonel torine too the president of the united states asked and your cousin too how did they respond to your placing them in what amounts to house arrest colonel torine knows how things are done sir i didnt order him and fernando my cousin understands the situation sir and thats about it castillo the president asked yes sir except to say mr president how deeply i regret the loss of sergeant kranz and how deeply i regret having failed in the mission you assigned the president did not immediately respond he looked into castillos eyes a moment as he considered that statement then said how do you figure that you have failed castillo well sir the bottom line is that i am no closer to finding the people who murdered mr masterson and sergeant markham than i was before i went looking for mr lorimer mr lorimer is now dead and well never know what he might have told us if i hadnt botched his repatriation the president offered yes sir and sergeant kranz is dead i failed you sir charles the president said what about the longterm damage resulting from major castillos failure just off the top of your head mr president i dont see it as a failure secretary hall spoke up the director of national intelligence has the floor mr secretary pray let him continue the president said coldly actually mr president neither do i montvale said actually when i have a moment to think about it quite the opposite you heard him the president pursued this man lorimer is dead we have no proof that natalie can take to the un that he was involved in the oilforfood scandal or anything else and castillo himself admits that hes no closer to finding out who killed masterson and the sergeant than he ever was isnt that failure mr president if i may montvale said cautiously let me point out what i think the majorand that small valiant band of men he had with himhas accomplished what would that be if we accept the premise that mr lorimer was involved in something sordid and the proof of that i submit is that he sequestered some sixteen million dollars montvale looked to castillo for help fifteen point seven sir castillo offered close enough for washington some sixteen million us dollars in uruguay and that parties unknown tracked him down to uruguay and murdered him to keep him from talking after they abducted mrs masterson and later murdered her husband so what charles the president demanded i dont seem to be expressing myself very well mr president montvale said let me put it this way these people whoever they are now know were onto them they have no idea what the major may have learned before he went to south america they have no idea how much lorimer may have told him before they were able to murder him if they hoped to obtain the contents of lorimers safe they failed and they dont know what it did or did not contain so they will presume the worst and that it is now in our possession or possibly worse in the possession of parties unknown they sent their assassins in to murder lorimer and what we what the major and his band gave them was six dead assassins and an empty safe and now that we know were onto them god only knows how soon it will be before someone comes to us and rats on the rats you mean the president asked yes sir thats precisely what i mean and im not talking only about identifying the masterson murderers i think it very likely that the major has already rendered them harmlessbut the people who ordered the murders the masterminds of the oilforfood scandal those who have profited from it sir in my judgment the major has not failed he has rendered the country a great service and is to be commended you ever hear charles that great minds run on similar paths i had just about come to the same conclusion but one question charles what should we do with the sixteen million dollars tell the un its there and let them worry about getting it back actually sir i had an offthetopofmyhead thought about that money according to the major all it takes is lorimers signature on those documents whatevertheyre called that the major brought back from the hideaway to have that money transferred anywhere but lorimers dead the president said they have some very talented people over in langley if the president takes my meaning you mean forge a dead mans signature and steal the money for what purpose mr president i admit that when i first learned what you were asking the major to do i was something less than enthusiastic but i was wrong and i admit it a small unit like the majors can obviously be very valuable in this new world war and if sixteen million dollars were available to it sixteen million untraceable dollars i take your point charles the president said but im going to ask you to stop thinking off the top of your head sir the next thing youre likely to suggest is that charleyand thats his name charles not the major move the office of organizational analysis into the office of the director of national intelligence and thats not going to happen charley works for me period not open for comment secretary hall had a sudden coughing spasm his face grew red ambassador montvale did not seem to suspect that secretary hall might be concealing a hearty laugh natalie do you have anything to say before i send charley out of here to take with my profound thanks a couple of weeks off after he lets everybody in his apartment go of course i was thinking about ambassador lorimer sir hes ill and it will devastate him to learn what his son has been up to jesus i hadnt thought about that the president said charley what about it sir mr lorimer is missing in paris charley said the man who died in shangrila was jeanpaul bertrand a lebanese i dont think anyone will be anxious to reveal who bertrand really was and i dont think we have to or should what about his sister natalie cohen asked should she be told i think so yes charley said i havent thought this through but i have been thinking that the one thing i could tell mrs masterson that would put her mind at rest about the threats to her children would be that i knew her brother was dead and with his death these bastards excuse me had no more interest in her or her children and if she asks how you know under what circumstances the president asked thats what i havent thought through sir you dont want to tell her what a despicable sonofabitch he was is that it i suspect she knows sir but its classified top secretpresidential would anyone have objections to my authorizing charley to deal with the masterson family in any way he deems best including the divulgence of classified material splendid idea mr president ambassador montvale said do it soon charley please natalie cohen said yes maam the president stood up and came around the desk and offered castillo his hand thank you charley good job go home and get some rest and then think where you can discreetly hide sixteen million dollars until you need it six room fifth floor silverstein pavilion hospital of the university of pennsylvania spruce street philadelphia pennsylvania august hey baby im home oh charley how are you doing look at me my face looks like somebody attacked me with a baseball bat you look beautiful can i kiss you youre sure you want to im sure i want to five minutes later they stopped she smiled at him what i was afraid you were going to do was come back from europe and walk in here and start that stupid wiener schnitzel nonsense again i like it better when you just say you love me oh shit i forgot forgot what he went into his briefcase and came out with an aluminum foilwrapped package whats that wiener schnitzel the real thing except that this comes from budapest not vienna you get the best hungarian gulyas in vienna but the best wiener schnitzel comes from budapest understand she didnt reply she simply took his hand and held it against her cheek he saw that she was crying but he knew it wasnt because she was
